text:FAQ: Why/ when/ how do you cuff jeans?	labels:Why: I think it can add a useful visual break in a pant leg, and sometimes it helps the leg drape better. Or if you just want a different silhouette, like cuffing high with boots.  How: I usually do one big turn up of like 2-2.5 inches, seems to let the leg drape more cleanly with no bunching. I'm more of a stacking guy tho.	episode_done:True

My husband hates the thing but it's like my security blanket * and finally, my Demobaza pieces because some of them are sold out and there's no way to replace them.	episode_done:True

text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:A comfortable pair of completely waterproof boots. I bought my first pair of Timberland waterproof boots about 10 years ago when I started university and they were one of the best purchases I've ever made. I've always walked to class / for commute and waterproof footwear is a game changer. Honestly I think soggy feet should be banned, no one should have to suffer that!   Nowadays I have a pair of office appropriate waterproof boots and a pair of semi-hiking boots and my toes never have to feel the horror that is wet socks.

text:Permanent Style - Tucked in T-Shirt	labels:It CAN work...but only when you're going for something very specific. I have an outfit I wear a lot with a black leather jacket, navy tee tucked in, black belt, black derbies, black leather strap on watch, and windowpane plaid grey slacks. It makes it look mostly casual on top, mostly dressy on the bottom, but leather jackets can be dressed up a bit and the black leather ties everything together in materials, and the tucked tee allows the fit to work when you should generally never wear a tee with slacks. Also, I make sure to not tuck it in too tight and emphasize my gut (which I don't even have but it can make it look bad). I pull it out enough to let some fabric hang over the belt a bit. Speaking of which, I'd never wear it tucked without a belt, it just looks wrong, period. With a button up you could almost do it without a belt (especially if it's a French tuck. But a tee? No way. That's dad territory.	episode_done:True

text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I haven't done any lab work since March as I'm writing up the thesis but when I was there we had to use a change barrier for a radiation controlled area. The PPE was a howie style lab coat and white anti static safety shoes. Often wore a respirator and wear glasses as well as safety over-specs so make-up was pointless.  I had a variety of different print trousers/leggings that would pop out from under my lab coat, things like fair isle prints, "Aztec" print, polka dots and stripes. All cheap, fast fashion, expendable but comfy items. Or if it was a jeans day, fun socks!	episode_done:True

It doesn't seem that long ago that Millenials were the ones that were the young upstarts.
text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:Zara, Perry Ellis, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors, H&M, Urban Outfitters, Steve Madden... obnoxious crap. You'll spent 2/3rds the price of quality clothing and will be 1/100th as satisfied with it. It won't fit right, feel right, look right, or last long.  Give me a Pendleton canvas jacket, LL Bean sweater, W&B Selvedge, and Red Wings. Will be 3X as expensive upfront, but I will be wearing it 6 years later - and the boots, jeans, and jacket will look even better with wear. It's a difference of 500 wears versus 10, especially when you take into account that shit clothes do not look very good so you will eventually resell or give it away.

Since then, I was looking to get more, but they disappeared off the face of the earth. These jeans were stretchable, allowing more leg movement to the point where if I was physically capable of doing it, I could do the splits in them without tearing it. What kind of jeans are these called?

My black Veronica Combat boots in particular are an absolute cold-weather staple for me- I've put them through the ringer and they still look good, walked for miles over cobblestones in them and not had issues.   I also love Frank and Eileen button-up shirts. When I was first introduced to them I thought the price point was absolutely bonkers but as I got to know more about quality clothes and what actually goes into them I decided to give them a try and yeah. They fit me PERFECTLY. Hang on me just right, buttons are in exactly the right place, last for years- I can barely tell the difference between the first ones I bought five-ish years ago (and have had in heavy rotation ever since) and the one that arrived yesterday that I'm wearing now.

Not really seeing the functional different between the two. As a side note, do slash pockets on chinos somehow lead to wider-looking hips than the 5-pocket design?

I never see it anymore, not in winter, not in spring, not in autumn and definitely not in summer. Except when I look in the mirror or that one time I saw someone else with the exact same combo I was wearing in the grocery store.  But you will pry this look from my cold, dead hands.

text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:1) Be early when you're dressed up. People will assume you're late because you were getting dressed even if that's not true.  2) It might actually help to wear the clothes around the house. Even just for an hour or two on your day off then hang them up again in the closet 3) Do you love to look at dresses or wear them? I really like to look at high heels, but I just don't buy them because they make me uncomfortable. If the dresses are making you uncomfortable, then maybe they're not really "you." Maybe you just enjoy collecting them?
text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:my hair goes with practically anything at this point, it's half dark blue and half black. i usually wear black, red, yellow, green, or any combination of the two. my clothes are \*mostly\* black though, so its relatively easy.  i mean look at billie eilish for instance. bright green goes with nearly freaking nothing but she still manages to make it work.	episode_done:True
text:Now i'm saying this while obvs not knowing your size and body, but you're way better of thrifting than trying to find something at 20$. And instead of trying to fit into something awfully tailored as a 20$ blazer inevitably will be, you'd be suprised how many high quality blazers can be found at thrift stores. Additionaly the fit of a vintage blazer doesn't have to be spot on if just used casually, as long as the shoulders are the right width, you will most likely be good to go.	labels:Fair enough. Do you really think a cheap blazer (I just learned from Google that apparently what I'm looking for is more of a sport coat; I am really putting on full display how little I know about these things) would be so poor that I'd be better off thrifting? Because if so I need to go thrifting more often.

Then go onto ebay and find decanters of the fragrance i.e. 50 ml instead of 200 ml and for 1/4 of the price. That way you save money and can enjoy the cologne that you like.   I personally would not recommend you to listen to people here and their fragrance choices because everyone has different scent choices.

For the past two months, I've been trying to find chinos or suit pants to fit me; I finally started putting on muscle after a half-decade of working out and now my quads are bigger than my waist. Today, I ditched the chain-tailor shops for the most part and went for the independent ones in my city. I had two shops say "yes, your jean waist size is 33.5 but your chino/suit-pant waist size is 38." This a) confuses me and b) is really messing with my mind and taking me back to my morbidly obese days. Why are there two seperate measurements?

I'd like to be able to buy from a physical store, so something at a common US chain like Macy's or Men's Warehouse would be fantastic. I live near Dayton, OH, so access to boutique shops isn't stellar.  At this price range, I'm not buying something I wouldn't wear every day for the rest of my life, so being able to try it on is extremely important to me. I would love to go bespoke, but I can't justify that, especially given how much more that would cost.

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:I work at a TJ Maxx/HomeGoods combo store. We absolutely do not know what we are going to receive until we actually open the packages that come off of the trucks. At my store, we got like 10+ pairs of blue crocs, but literally only two pairs of white crocs.  And unlike most retail stores, we have buyers choosing which items to purchase every two weeks instead of monthly/quarterly. With that in mind, the best thing you can do is check in as much as possible. I'd say for every gem, we have about 200 decent items. Go during a weekday as soon as we open for the best chances as weekends are generally busy.   Also I agree about the Runway stores, I saw a Gucci purse like two years ago at a TJ Maxx with a Runway section in Scottsdale, AZ. (Also to my fellow Arizonans, the locations on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd and Miller Rd have the best selection, in my opinion).

Between those brands at least one of them should be selling an ivory turtleneck.  I got mine through bosie.co, but they discontinued their custom service a couple years ago. They opened it up for October but I don't think they're taking more orders. Might be worth emailing if you can't find what you want from the other brands.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:I buy mainly mid-range designer/independent designers secondhand- so I have a bunch of Isabel Marant that would retail 300+ but I get for less than 100 euros typically. My most expensive item that I paid retail for was my Isabel Marant Dicker boots as a gift to myself for passing a high level language competency exam for French. So 345 euros.  However, the most valuable items if they were new is my Chanel pencil skirt and my Ferragamo Vara Pumps that I got really good prices for secondhand, particularly the Chanel.   Like anything, shopping for high quality clothes takes practice. Once you know what to look for quality wise, it's very easy to scan in person to see what is worth the money on the racks.	episode_done:True

I have a standing desk as well but that doesn't seem to help. I haven't gained or lost a significant amount of weight.  Anything that can be done, or wardrobe choices to make to be more comfortable at the office that might help? Thanks!
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 05, 2021	labels:I'm trying to find my style and I'm looking for ideas on what I should add to my closet. The only clothes I have right now is a bunch of black t-shirts and sweatpants, dark wash straight jeans, and a black zip-up hoodie. I did also already order a black Patagonia down jacket and core black Ultra Boosts. I live in a warm area so layering would be difficult. Thanks!

Either no one checked the tag, or they did and wanted to throw it out there and give someone a thrill.     I redonated it last year as I have busted out a bunch of kids in quick succession and will never be an AU 8 ever again. So sad! But hopefully it will give someone else a thrill too.	episode_done:True

My goal this year was shooting for only buying things on deep discount (60-80%) turns out I shattered that and across my entire wardrobe I spent an average of 13.9% of MSRP, super proud of that. I did, however, still manage to spend more than I should have in total.
text:Ahhhh that is amazing and sounds like my dream wardrobe. My closet skews heavily toward birds and feathers, but I've been getting bored with that - and I think I've found some direction thanks to you! Unfortunately, the Yumi Chintzy Flower and Bird Shirt Dress is begging me to buy it right now LOL	labels:I think you mean "fortunately", haha! I'm obsessed with prints of animals, and I'm not sure why. But it definitely adds a lot of fun! I feel like for a long time only men got to wear fun things like that, which is devastating.   Come to think of it, Sugarhill Brighton has some beautiful animal prints too - and dinosaurs, if you're into that!	episode_done:True
text:What are some stores/brands that have surprised you?	labels:I recently got a second hand Jones New York top. I generally think of them as an alright but not amazing brand, but this is one of the nicest pieces of clothing I own. Really high quality silk, bias cut, and the construction is all French seams and fully enclosed hems with high quality stitching. If you told me that this was from a luxury brand I totally believe it.

text:The suit looks dark grey to my eye, though monitor may be misleading.  If it is indeed dark grey/charcoal, I would not recommend navy pants, I'd suggest a lighter grey with no pattern that is very noticeably lighter than the jacket. Agree with the above poster that the goal here isn't to match, but to contrast in a... Controlled... way, especially since you're planning for a funeral.  White shirt, simple/plain tie in any dark color (black or grey would be traditional for a funeral, but dark blue, burgundy, or dark green would be fine as well).	labels:My monitor leads me to mid greyish.... if it's on a darker spectrum, probably black slacks could do either, although depends on the colour of a pair of shoes.

text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:It really depends for me. I think lots of body-type advice is about balancing your figure which can be very different from flattering your figure IMO.  I like to look at clothing in two ways: balance or enhance. "Flattering" is so often a byproduct of your personal comfort.  I have a short torso and long legs so most suggestions are for me to wear low waisted pants and longer tops. This just makes me look boxy and low-waisted pants are uncomfortable. Plus, why would I want to make my legs look shorter? I like my legs so wearing cropped shirts and high rise pants is my go to!  Same goes for busty girls: so much advice is about minimizing your bust, what about enhancing it with a turtleneck or higher neckline?   It really depends on your personal insecurities and whether you want to look more balanced proportion-wise or if you want to enhance certain features!

text:Does anyone take their “power color” really seriously? Basing a whole wardrobe around one color - not just choosing an accent color for a neutral capsule?	labels:My mum's wardrobe is probably 85% shades of blue, even down to her shoes. She has navy brogues. The other 15% are all things that that go with the navy stuff. It seems more accidental and  because 'blue really suits me'	episode_done:True
text:Pantone trying to make Economy happen over here	labels:Are they though? It's like they're baiting us with that sunshine yellow and then completely killing its shine and undercutting it with that grey. Like hey, it's the light at the end of the tun- NAH, JUST KIDDING MISERY FOREVER. A yellow like that needs a complementary color to bring out the richness of the color. This just makes the yellow look as depressing and cold as grey does. Bummer.	episode_done:True

text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:I'll be in year two of my wardrobe overhaul in summer of 2021, so I wanna knock out the hard stuff.  Big goals are to figure out online shopping (I don't,) my shoe situation, and buy the multiple basics that I just couldn't get myself to focus on because they're *so boring*.  (Unsurprisingly, a big focus was this year was actually removing colours, since my brain loves all of them, but I really like myself in black.) I'd love to be in no/low buy position by 2022. Little goal is to be better about documenting, since I have about 94 outfits that have yet to see IG, which is problematic only because they're all multiples and I'd like my phone space back.  I'd also like to be a bit better about sticking to my list next year.  I picked up a ton of stuff this year due to unnoticed weight gain, so I'm not gonna beat myself up about it, but I definitely would like to be a bit more conscious about it in the future.	episode_done:True

text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I've lost 85 pounds. My boobs are by no means as perky as they "should be" for my age. They sat low on my chest even before weight loss. They never gave me any cleavage, even when I was a 38F. That's just how I've always been built.   Now I refuse to wear bras. I'm willing to wear bralettes to formal occasions (like if I'm a bridesmaid) and job interviews, but I'm never wearing a bra again.   Now I only buy clothes that look good on my body exactly how it naturally is, instead of buying underwear to force my body to look good in the clothes. My body looks fine, it's the clothes that are designed wrong (for my body).   Lots of low cut things, despite having no cleavage and not attempts at cleavage. It just balances out my hips and the lower cut makes things seem perkier, haha. I don't care if I "don't have the tits" for it.	episode_done:True
text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:Full length bootcut jeans! As much as I like my basic skinny ankle jeans, my ankles get cold! Something I just want to be able to wear higher socks with my tennis shoes (white Adidas 99% of the time)!  I don't think they're a noticeable enough item that I'd look out of place though- I bought them last year, so they're still a modern wash/fit.  I guess I could look out of place in a sea of high waisted mom jeans, but man, in my opinion, those take too much effort to wear! I have to think about if my shirt is cropped enough to wear with them, if my underwear are high enough to be comfortable underneath, if I'm going to be eating a big meal that day... no thanks! I'll wear them sometimes, but I couldn't do it every day.	episode_done:True

text:I might be an outlier, but I've just been dressing as I usually would. The way I dress normally is pretty comfortable, so I haven't noticed any difference there. Basic bastard kinda stuff, button up + chinos/denim. I often toss on a chore coat cause I'm a sucker for them.	labels:I dress more-or-less as normally, too, both because I leave the house enough to walk the dog that I want to look put together, and because of Zoom.  Plus, most jeans and the like have stretch in them these days anyway. They're pretty comfy as is.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 13, 2020	labels:Anyone else really dislike the way a denim jacket looks with a collared shirt underneath? I've been finding that even with a flannel shirt it looks off, maybe something to do with the double collar.

text:How do men's outerwear differ from women's? I found a really good deal on a 100% wool coat, but in men's...	labels:It'll be fine wearing it open, but it'll be tight around the bust and hips if it's closed.    Plus there might be more shoulder padding to give you an exaggerated V shape. Fine if you're intentionally going for an androgynous look, just don't expect it to look/fit like a women's coat.

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom taught me that tank tops were for whores and if I wore them it was only to make boys look at my chest (not because it was hot out?), that shorts showed off the "cellulite" on my 16-year-old thighs (oh hello lifetime of body image issues!), and that any form-fitting shirt was an open invitation to "those boys that were only after one thing" (referring to my male friends, many of whom I am still friends with, and married to one of them, 25 years later and are all the most anti-misogynistic people I know). She also questioned the size of any piece of clothing I tried on (really, JBT-Lover, a size MEDIUM??? Are you sure you don't need a large? I'm 5'7" and 125 lbs btw, but it's always nice to hear that you definitely look a whole size larger than you are during every shopping outing.)   She did not teach me that clothing was an expression of who YOU are, not of the people who might be looking at you. Moms... *eyeroll*

Everyone is busy looking at, thinking about, critiquing themselves.  So wear what makes you happy! Try new things!   Edited for concision.
text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:I spent like two months investing in a bunch of nice wool sweaters that I could wear through the winter, put them in a separate laundry bin after wearing so I could launder them myself, but my ex washed and dried them on high heat and they all shrunk so badly that I couldn't even fit them on my dog. About $1500 gone.

text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:Mod note!  The topic of how to find clothes that fit or how to work with what you find on the racks is a valuable discussion for this subreddit and we would love users to share their tips and any methods they've learned over the years.  However, we are ver sensitive to the ways this topic can overlap with general body dissatisfaction. We request that the comments in this thread center on the discussion of making items fit your body rather than becoming a platform for people to criticize their body or express body dissatisfaction. While every body is unique, we're not actually *that* unique and many of the things you might criticize about your own body are also aspects of others' bodies.   We would appreciate an effort to express your individual struggles with fit without making subjective judgements about the quality of your body. Comments that are only about body dissatisfaction and not about fit will be removed.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 05, 2021	labels:Are facial aesthetics important in pulling off certain looks? (Note: I don't mean required to wear those looks, you're welcome to wear anything you like)  I've noticed that anyone can look great in smart casual, business casual, indie wear but for other styles like denim + jeans, rock/biker, punk, eboy styles a lot of men don't fit into that look and instead look like nerds trying to dress rough (myself included). What are your opinions on this? Do you notice certain faces or body types fitting better in certain fashion styles?  Just wanted to ask this so I won't waste too much time dwelling in the styles that might not suit me.  Also, is there a way to post this qn as a thread on the main page of the sub? I posted and it got taken down by the bot.

text:Do you feel the black Friday sales better or worse than usually this year? Is it worth to buy clothing you won't wear until next year?	labels:Maybe this is just the stores I'm looking at, but it seems like the new stuff that I'm actually interested in isn't on sale this Black Friday, but everything else that's not as good is 40% off. It's annoying, because splashing a big number like that ("30-50% off the whole site! \*exclusions apply") draws me to their site, but the items I actually want aren't a part of the sale.  The only exception being Levi's because I've been waiting for this 40% off sale to get a pair of Wedgie jeans.   Not going to lie, I did buy quite a few bits from the sales this year but with the intention of returning 90% of it because I don't feel comfortable going into stores to try stuff on. Best to buy everything I want to try on at sale prices then return what I don't want to keep!

I've also been really loving some of my natural fiber cardigans. I have a cashmere Banana Republic one that's camel colored, and a long grey cashmere sweater that I think I originally bought from Zara (probably the last thing I bought from them, two years ago and have been shocked at how often I've reached for it over quarantine, very comfy and cozy). Wool socks too. I decided I was going to just go for it and spend some money on smart wool and darn tough socks and they have been a god send for comfort. So warm and thick and come in great colors.  Also wearing turtlenecks with everythinggggggg. I have several uniqlo ones. On a sidenote, I'd love to find some alternatives to Uniqlo turtlenecks that are from a company with better ethics so if anyone has suggestions, please share!	episode_done:True

text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:Project Runway! I know this might sound silly but I never really realized just how much goes into designing and creating beautiful clothing until I got into that show. I grew up poor and thought fashion was something that only rich people cared about. Watching the designers on Project Runway create unbelievable outfits from only some relatively cheap fabric and a sewing machine made me realize just how much goes into being a fashion designer and I gained a huge respect for the industry. Now I am obsessed!

text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:You should wear whatever you like, regardless of what anybody else thinks of it. If it makes you happy and helps you feel good about yourself, that's the only thing that really matters.  I'm sorry your mom was not fully supportive of your choices. Yes, it's harder to keep light colored pieces looking clean, but that's why they make non chlorine bleach. It's not like you're a toddler jumping into mud puddles, LOL, so that's no reason to not buy light colors of you like them.  I would encourage you to re-buy the pieces you returned, if you really liked them. Experimenting with color is a good thing, that's how we discover our personal style. Go have fun experimenting!	episode_done:True
text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:I think we've taught each other equal amounts. She was always one to just follow the trends (and her photos from the 70s-80s are proof of that!) and she still does to some extent. Then I came along (oldest daughter) and wanted to look like a Pippi Longstocking editorial every day but she rolled with it. I mixed a floral top with a plaid jumper for my third grade class photo and my family still talks about how mad my mom was about it.  She kept a lot of her vintage from the 70s and I regret being such a brat and refusing to wear any of it.   As we've gotten older, I've taught her how to change up her makeup to look fresher. I finally convinced her to stop dyeing her hair last year. She has AMAZING silvery grey hair and really good skin, she looks so great now. And she's helped coach me through some big body changes with yoyo-ing in my 20s and now being pregnant.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:When I was in my early 20's, my first priority was to look "cute" or "hot". 5 inch heels were just what I did. I had no money obviously, so it ended up being most anything I could find on clearance.   I'm in my mid-30's now and I simply don't wear it if it isn't comfortable. Not to say I live in sweatpants (well, pre-pandemic anyway), but I prioritize my comfort, looking relatively pulled together, and not tragically out of style but still not necessarily trendy. I don't wear heels.   I don't shop clearance anymore. If it's a well made item that I want and I've taken the time to think about it, I buy it. Otherwise, I do a lot of thrifting and wear what I like of that and sell the rest.	episode_done:True

It's giving me traumatic flashbacks of middle school. I do have to say I kind of like the blonde hair on the outside black on the inside style.

text:General Discussion - December 26, 2020	labels:I just realized I am having a shoe identity crisis. Not all outfits work with boots, but my trousers selection has shifted a lot and no longer works with sneakers (or maybe I just don't like sneakers anymore). At least most of the time I end up changing my pants because I don't know what shoes to wear. And it's holding me back. I've never been a huge fan of derbies, especially black derbies because I associate them with school uniform shoes, and I'm forbidden to wear sandals. So now I don't know what to do. More types of boots? Buy nice derbies and see if I like them? Accept that all outfits go with boots? shrug

text:Haha this is spot on! I'm half German and I do have to say that I find it very liberating that no one gives a shit compared to Sweden (my other home) where you'll find people in their 40s desperately trying to keep up with fashion.   I've been working in a lot in high end restaurants and you can (almost) always spot the german tourists within a second. I'm sorry, but a white dress shirt won't make your  jack Wolfskin rain jackets and trekking shoes blend in any better (although they're very praktisch).	labels:Haha so true. Another classic are these hiking nylon pants you can unzip to turn them into shorts. And 3/4 shorts in summer are also great.  I lived in South Africa & Australia for some time and it was incredibly easy to spot the Germans. Oddly, I find that there is a weird "sense of fashion" if you can call that. It just includes the wrong items and fits...

text:I had this problem at my last job when I took public transit to work. I finally just got into the habit of taking off my puffy coat once I got into the subway station and holding it on the train. I'm sure it made me take up like 10% more room, and it was harder to keep my hands free, but it was worth it to not be a puddle of sweat by the time I got to work.	labels:I swear this is why more people pass out on the T in the winter (or so it seems to me).

text:Is it disgusting to not wear socks with shoes?	labels:I don't think its "gross" or unhygienic, if you are wearing shoes without socks all day and moving around a lot then maybe they will get a bit smelly but sounds like she blew it way out of proportion. That being said get yourself some "no-show" or "invisible" socks purely from a comfort standpoint. Having worn vans with no socks for a lot of my teenage years because I liked the look and men's no show socks didn't exist, I can tell you, not wearing socks sucks and no show socks are the way to go. You achieve the desired look with no discomfort or risk of sweaty smelly feet / shoes.	episode_done:True

text:I'm with you on this. It's interesting to me that all the responses are basically "but lazy is the aesthetic!"  And I guess that's fine. If you want and enjoy lazy, I'm not going to stop you.

I did, also, feel like his humor was largely focused on making snide metaphors about the quality - without considering his selection.   To that point, I feel like the 'lazy' really comes through in his selection of t-shirts. There's a lot of other great options out there, but he went with all cheap mall brands, as far as I can tell. I really want us all to consider the supply chain, the ethics of buying less and higher quality, and I just don't feel like this video (I haven't seen any of his others) aligns with that worldview.	labels:	episode_done:True

I've never used RTR, but when I saw the ad for Revive on my thredup app I was curious. I was honestly shocked when I saw a sweater (which I'm sure was a nice enough when it was new) with a MASSIVE stain on the front of it for more than $60! It absolutely was not a part of the design on this otherwise solid colored sweater. Goodwill wouldn't even sell something with a big, dark, nasty stain like that. Really made me worry about what the other Revive items could be hiding in less obvious places... Ick.

text:I reserve the neutral color matching for days where I don't want to think too much about dressing up. It's hard to go wrong with neutrals in whatever way you style it.

text:Pantone Color(s) of the year for 2021: Illuminating and Ultimate Gray	labels:I predicted yellow for 2020 but in reality it was too early in the trend to dominate the scene at that point, so it makes perfect sense for this year.  Gray is surprising since it's been losing ground to beige and warmer tones the last few years.  I'm much deeper in the interior design scene than fashion and everything thing over there is gray-out beige-in.  But I love gray tones, so I'm surprised but happy.	episode_done:True

text:Runways have been sending out 2000s vibes. Anyone onboard?	labels:I'm just going to lay it out there: I hate it. I hate the return of the Mean Girls/bitchy rich white girl/fucking velour Juicy tracksuit look. Probably because I started high school in 2001 and it was like the hey day of bland tackiness and Paris Hilton and I'm too close to it, lived it a little too much, to find any novelty in it. SO vapid. I was slightly vapid and a little mean for a while around that time before I came into myself and I don't like the reminders.  What I do like about the looks above though, is that I see the 60s and 90s Spice Girls influences and I can get into that.  Edit: also, on occasion, I wear low rise pants, but I like looking at trends for inspiration and new ideas, not dictating what I can or can't wear. If you like low rise jeans and hipster minis, rock em. If not, fuck em forever, who cares.

text:The term itself "male presenting" is used by or describing more masculine genderfluid people for example. If you havent heard it before, especially a in a different context, I understand how it is a little confusing.

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:Okay I am totally in the same spot as you. So tired of wearing grey, I want to rid my closet of the colour. The best solution and not to rid your whole closet is to buy colourful accessories or go to a consignment store and buy statement pieces to wear with your basic wardrobe that would be at discounted prices compared to online retail like Free People and Anthropologie  (I recommend not going to thrift stores because that's more basics typically). I also have a rule that if a t-shirt or any article of clothing hasn't been worn in the last 6 months its time to donate it, that's at least 2 seasons of wearing it not being utilized. As for up-cycling your own old clothes you can buy fun iron on patches that can be added on plain hoodies or t-shirts for a pop of colour much like the brands Comme de Garcons and Scotch and Soda.  You can also embroider shirt collars, or the pockets of jeans.	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:My new year's resolution is to only buy (at most) one new piece of clothing per month. I have a pretty well-stocked closet, but I also don't love most of my clothes. I did too much stress shopping because of Covid, and spent more money than I needed to on mostly cheaper clothes, and I made this resolution to help change my mindset about shopping.  With my resolution, I'm not even looking at outlets of other cheaper stores. Yes, it is still hard to stomach spending more money on clothes, but after I've had an item in my cart for a couple days and feel certain that it's the one new thing I want to get for the month, it has been easier for me. It  has also forced me to be much more thoughtful about what I need. We'll see how the rest of the year goes!  I think that thrifting can (obviously) be great, but it can be a lot easier to buy things that you don't love because they are great pieces that just don't work for you.	episode_done:True

text:Ahh ok yes I see. Wouldn't it be possible to simply do that yourself/ have a tailor do that? Or does the collar itself need to be cut in a certain way for that effect? My grandmother is a tailor so I have easy access to those services if it were theoretically possible to do without having it look like shit	labels:This is actually a subject that trad nerds absolutely obsess over. It has to do with how the the collar is constructed, how it's cut, whether or not there's interlining etc. You perhaps could, but I'd say it's likely more complicated than it appears at first blush.	episode_done:True

text:Believe it or not it's actually less fast as it was a decade ago. Trends hang around FOREVER especially with Instagram, bloggers, etc. -- ripped jeans have literally been in style for over 12 years. 12!!! Same with moto jackets. It used to not be this way, where every year you were updating stuff to keep current. Now, it's like you can wear ripped jeans and a moto jacket and everyone thinks it's chic and cool. Because retailers want to sell, they don't experiment as much because the mainstream fashion consumer like most on IG, etc. are not as willing to move to trends as quickly as people were in the past. No complaints, but I find trends take forever to move now than compared to before.	labels:I was wondering this with jumpsuits and rompers, I feel like when I was just graduating college in 2006, rompers were just coming in but it wouldn't have been OK to wear them anytime in the last 10 to 15 years. Short rompers and long leg jumpsuits have kind of come in and out a few times since 2006, right now it's much more jumpsuits in my area, but they've kind of been in since 2006, moreso than less so?

I also found that going on an anti-inflammatory diet helps quite a bit, and using unscented everything and being very careful with my laundry soaps. I use wool drier balls, and am in love with those, too, in place of any softener.

text:Are jean shorts on men really that bad?	labels:Listen, there are very few things, if any, in menswear that are always wrong.  But as far as single items go, jorts are very, very, very rarely right.  Denim is a generally a heavy, workwearish fabric designed to protect your legs. Shorts are generally worn for comfort -- they should be lighter, or softer, or both. And there are a few more reasons that jorts are... unnatural, but... They are, don't wear them unless you *really* know your shit. Like, "studies runway shows like an academic" level of knowing your shit.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 26	labels:My go-to undershirt used to be Polo Ralph Lauren Classic Fit White V-Neck Undershirts. They were perfect for me: lightweight cotton with just the right neck drop - not too deep, not too shallow.  But something changed in that product a few years ago. The cotton is heavier and the neck drop is now too short. Since then, I've been unable to find another undershirt that is just right. Most v-neck undershirts either have a short neck drop (5") or a really deep one (8-9"). I want something right in the middle (around 7"). And of course, most companies don't publish the neck drop measurement, so you're forced to squint at the picture and try to guess. Or just buy a package and hope for the best.  Can someone point me to an white v-neck undershirt that is:  * White * 100% cotton * Very lightweight * Around a 7" neck drop  Much appreciated if you can help me out!	episode_done:True

text:Model poses while online shopping	labels:They do that when the fit if the garment is inferior. It is intentional.  Beware items that have this kind of photography, because most of the time it means the garment has bad construction, weird seam placement, or unfortunate details.  Well constructed items are not shot in this manner. Brands want to show off their excellent construction. It is known.  Hope that helps!

text:Actually this is 10000% accurate. Spent 5 years working in corporate fashion retail as a buyer and it was mind numbingly repetitive. Every year is just a bunch of old stuff recycled to look "new." Same colors, slightly updated. Same styles, slightly switched. And just way too much of it altogether.

Im allergic to almost all wool and it gives me a terrible rash and I always think this chunky sweater will be different and it NEVER IS lol.  Wool blend coats are ok tho as long as they have a full lining and a flat collar.

text:Good to know. I just picked up a few of their sweatpants from the softAF line--and yes, like many others here, am pleasantly shocked at how comfortable and nice they are. Didn't know about the dryer pilling however.	labels:Yeah their newer softAF fabric which they introduced about 2 years ago feels really nice off the rack but I've seen some hoodies/sweats literally pilling in the store, probably from friction during transportation or something.   I have a pair of sweats with an older fabric from about 5 years ago that still holds up well, but it's not as soft as the new stuff. I imagine they're able to sell more with the softAF fabric based on first impressions.	episode_done:True
text:Wish we could just ban people for this shit  Any conversation around "you have to be attractive/tall/skinny to pull this off", when taken to its logical conclusion, is just people saying that people that don't fit Western beauty standards look objectively bad *at all times* regardless of what they're wearing or doing  Like I've seen people say that if you're short or if you're overweight you can't wear "x", but the "x" is basically everything, and they never seem to reach the point where they admit that they just think that the best certain people can hope for is inoffensive or unnoticeable, which disgusts me	labels:I've talked about this before but a lot of these "rules" that people talk about like "don't wear $thing if you're $characteristic" have to main parts to it:  1. They're always about *not* doing something 2. They're always about a stereo-typically "negative" characteristic  > *Don't* wear $thing, if you're *$negative-characteristic*  You never hear the opposite, for any characteristic "positive" or "negative". It's always restrictive.  > Wear $thing if you're *$characteristic*

text:What’s your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:I was a kid in the 90s and for me it's equal parts cool and exciting and equal parts "no thanks I wore that to death in 4th grade."  I love: wide-leg/bootcut/flare pants, corduroy, plaid, shorter shirts (I know not necessarily 90s but I was so glad to get away from the super long shirts of the 2000s).  Not a fan of: neon, velvet, tie dye, chokers (not in fashion any more but still from the 90s), and platforms (but I'm a boring person when it comes to shoes).

text:Dream Unconventional/ Unrealistic Fashion Accessories- Discussion	labels:I look amazing in hats, but everything about my style comfort zone is low-effort/minimalist. While there are hats that work with my style, hats in themselves are so uncommon where I live that they invariably wind up looking try-hard no matter how I style them, and I wind up feeling overdone & self-conscious :( I cherish a weekend at the beach or outdoors so I can throw on a big sun hat and still look casual!

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 16, 2021	labels:Do you guys find oversized clothing actually comfortable? Of course loose is more comfortable than tight, but I feel at a certain point the extra fabric and longer sleeves become more and more annoying. Also don't people worry at all about their sleeves when eating?   I've been going for looser stuff lately but I just can't seem to make it work practically and appearance wise. I feel like the only person who's oversized fits I like is Scott Disick wearing hoodies, and I've been trying to go for the same fit. I know a lot of his stuff is from John Elliott, but even the models don't look as good IMO.
text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:I usually keep my hair some shade of dark blue-green or some shade of dark purple. I don't typically bother trying to match with my hair. But my wardrobe also tends to have a lot of cyans and teals and purples and stuff, so it kinda works out, anyway.	episode_done:True
text:What are your most loved ride-or-die winter clothing items?	labels:A parka I got from Target last year. It wasn't even $50, and it's the *warmest* jacket I've ever had in my life. I live in the northeast, where the snow and wind can be brutal, and I was used to spending upwards of $150 on coats that didn't even do anything.  I'm in the process of losing weight, so I figured spending $50 on a winter coat I would wear for maybe two seasons wasn't bad at all. Cue my surprise when I spent a weekend in the Adirondacks last November, where everybody else around me was freezing, and I'm snug as a bug in my cheap Target winter jacket!  I'm hoping come next winter, it'll still fit well enough to be warm, because it's honestly my favorite winter clothing purchase I've ever made.

text:I don't have any familiarity with those products in particular, though I bet they're quite good. That's not a huge amount for professional wool outerwear, and if you can afford it I bet you'll be happy with it. That said, there is tons of high-quality outerwear on eBay for a fraction of that from good makers like Brooks Brothers and PRL, so if you're willing to consider used you can get a similar coat for more like 1-200.  That said, if you want the exact SS coat and can afford it then don't listen to your friend. $500 isn't even that much for such an item.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:Tops: tight polos, tight graphic tees, tight see-through button down shirts over camisoles  Bottoms: all pants had to be low or mid rise (high rise jeans were for old ladies), thong hanging out gave bonus points, the legs all had to be wide or at least flared/boot cut. A skinny or even straight cut ankle was unthinkable. Shorts were all butt-cheek length. Skirts were denim and extra-mini.  Accessories: puka shell necklaces, hoop earrings, silver instead of gold, Tiffany necklaces and bracelets, lockets, leather bracelets, stacking bangles  Brands: Abercrombie and Fitch, Hollister, American Eagle  There were strict formulas to follow, and straying from them was basically fashion suicide.	episode_done:True

text:Sewing your own clothes	labels:Having basic sewing skills to repair or slightly modify existing clothes is a fundamental skill most people should have and is absolutely worth the time. Novice tailoring is a great skill to have too and can save you some money. Beyond that, sewing clothes from scratch is more of a hobby than a necessity for most people, due to the widely available nature of inexpensive and functional clothing. So like most hobbies, whether or not it is "worth the time" (and cost! Sewing is expensive and it's frequently cheaper to just buy an item unless you're looking for a custom fit or something super unique) is more dependent on your enjoyment of the activity than it is on more "functional" motivators like cost-savings.

text:Sculptural Fashion Inspiration Album	labels:The girls outfit in #10 is easily wearable and wouldn't even look out of place.  It's just a dope looking slightly futuristic dress outfit.
text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:I feel about faux leather like I do about vegan "meat". I'd much rather have a bowl of beans or stir-fried tofu, than tofu pretending to be meat. And I'd rather have something made of another material entirely, rather than plastic pretending to be leather.  I have only had cheap faux leather (a Target purse when I was a teenager). It cracked and peeled. And it felt nothing like leather. Pricey ones may be better, but I'd still rather have a different material. I also find I feel more relaxed in general when I surround myself with things made of natural materials, rather than plastic. I also notice I value them more and have higher motivation to take great care of them.	episode_done:True
text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:I think there might be some correlation. First of all the older we get the less likely we are to try new things and I am sure that affects clothing too. But that does not mean that 40 year olds can't wear trends just because some of their age group don't.   I remember my mother sometimes saying that certain things have a grandma vibe for her or look dated. But for me it was something completely different, because I was not around when those styles were popular the first time (or I was a litle kid) so they don't remind me of that. And it's also obvious that I could not have bought it at that time and just never threw it out, because I am too young. So I guess some pices might look dated on a 40 year old, but not on a 20 year old.  On the other hand, I have no problem with older clothes if they are paired with other pieces that are more trendy. There is no reason to throw away your favorite sweater just because it's older than 5 years. Some pieces are classics.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: what does your shopping process look like?	labels:Stick something on a favorites list (ebay/Amazon/Etsy/etc)  Keep waiting for the "right time" to buy it  It gets bought out from under me  I buy the same thing for $20 more than the original item within an hour -_-
text:Are jean shorts on men really that bad?	labels:Listen, there are very few things, if any, in menswear that are always wrong.  But as far as single items go, jorts are very, very, very rarely right.  Denim is a generally a heavy, workwearish fabric designed to protect your legs. Shorts are generally worn for comfort -- they should be lighter, or softer, or both. And there are a few more reasons that jorts are... unnatural, but... They are, don't wear them unless you *really* know your shit. Like, "studies runway shows like an academic" level of knowing your shit.
text:Does anyone else hate literally everything they put on?	labels:I actually talked about this in a general discussions. I generally feel okay about my body naked (dare I say happy) and I like clothes on the hanger and other people but i put them on myself and I hate it or I like pieces on myself separate but than hate them with every item in my wardrobe. I like to call it reverse body dysmorphia (im happy with how I look naked but not in clothes)

Pretty disappointed tbh, I'm gonna have to stick with my Stan Rays for the foreseeable future.

(chest size 34, 5'10)  I am a smaller dude, 5'10, but with a chest thats 34 inches, and a 30-32 waist  it seems every shirt on amazon on "s" size is 39 or so inches on the chest, looks abnsolutly enormous  my waist would be around 30-32, I think, my size 32 pants do fit me with some space, but they have been worn out  ive recently lost a lot of weight, and im trying to re-make my wardrboe, I usually preffer long sleeve shirts because they help me hide my skinny arms (weirdly enough, arm sizes are also a problem, the sleeves are always really friggin small and I end up looking like I out-grew the sleeves)  the "beefy-t henleys" by hanes seems to fit me well, but it does feel kinda loose, and the sleeves are starting to become a problem, the amazon slim fit extra small fits fine on the chest, but its the friggin sleeves!

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 29, 2020	labels:Does Adidas offer a sneaker similar to the Iniki anymore?

I basically just want the comfort of the boost but the look of a classic trainer which is getting harder to find now that they have decided to cancel the iniki... recommendations from other brands would be fine too as long as they have something similar to boost.

text:Oh, I actually have a pair of black cherry Beckmans from way back when Iron Rangers were all the rage on here. They are a bit painful to break in. Currently I don't have them in rotation as I don't really know how to style them since donating all my workwear.  I casually checked the Uniqlo website in my lunch break today (I was also interested in the tapered trousers and maybe the work jacket) but basically everything was sold out except some XS shirts. All y'all better have some amazing +J fits to show off next week.  Ended up ordering the oversized casual blazer in bordeaux red because I like the fabric and I've considered a bordeaux jacket (as a general principle) for a while. Would prefer emerald green, but that wasn't even on the roster. (I want a dark emerald green velvet overshirt, in case anyone has any leads.)	labels:Good to know I used to own them but lost them to a hungry dog this last year. I forgot how bad the break in was lol hopefully they loosen up across the fore front of my feet everything else is snug but good  Oooo I love adding wine/dark reds to a fit they are definitely underrated as a color good luck finding that emerald color is so rare in menswear maybe in couple years they'll start popping up as we move into (get pushed towards) more vibrant colors lol

text:I feel that, that's what all the redneck boys in high school wore	labels:I wore one in high school that had huge "WR"s written all over it in sharpie. My dad was in work release in the county jail and they scribbled that on all of the carhartts to dissuade people from stealing them. It was a good ass jacket, warm enough for Michigan winter, and I just made up some dumb shit whenever someone asked about the sharpie.

text:Shitpost Saturday: Advice on Learning How to Hate Fashion	labels:Basically, I really started to hate fashion when I realized that I would spend hours each morning creating a unified and satisfying look, and then I'd go out onto the street, see a girl in a torn concert tee, mom jeans, and worn combat boots, and immediately wish I had dressed like her. This would happen day after day after day. Invariably I'd spend far too much time trying to satisfy my inner compulsion look perfect, and then immediately envy the first girl who looked like she had rolled out of bed and slipped into whatever happened to be sitting in a pile on the floor of her room. It was at that point that I could no longer hide from the fact that none of this made any sense, or maybe it made a sort of sense that I personally would never understand. And yet there was no escape.
text:And #8 stole his mom's jeans. And seems to be wearing a faux camelhair coat with.....chucks?

text:Stay In-Vested	labels:Genuine question: what are use-cases for opting for a down vest instead of a down jacket? I like vests, but at any temperature where they'd be appropriate I'm always like "might as well wear a jacket and cover my sleeves too". Is it for mobility? I've heard that if your core is warm then your arms don't matter as much, but I've never tested it out myself.
text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:So, two pieces of information:  1) My stepmom works at Marshalls and she says it's totally random what they get in and when, but she does work front end, not receiving, so it's possible that there are patterns that she just doesn't pick up on.  2) I read an article once that said that Marshalls, TJ Maxx, etc. purposefully seed a few insanely good deals (designer stuff for a few $, etc.) throughout the store because it's a good way to make customers look at every single thing on the racks to make sure that they don't miss out on another deal like that. And that makes them buy more overall. Obviously I can't prove whether this is true or not, but it does sound plausible...

text:Can You Wear a T-Shirt Under a Blazer and Not Look Like an 1980s Leftover?	labels:I still maintain that a t shirt with a tailored jacket is not a good look. It's a clash of formality. Same reason sneakers look odd with a suit. That doesn't mean you can't wear a t shirt or sneakers, just that they don't look good with those particular pairings.
text:Tips for easily looking more modern/in style?	labels:I would recommend updating your "fashion basics" like plain t-shirts and jeans first because then more unique pieces will just look unique, not outdated. For instance, consider a black t-shirt with jeans. Ten ish years ago you might have a vneck tshirt and boot cut mid wash jeans, five years ago probably skinny jeans in a darker wash and a slim crew neck, and now maybe a square neck bodysuit with light wash straight jeans. But on the other hand if you have some kind of, I don't know, cool bomber jacket, it doesn't really look out of date especially because thrifting is in right now.	episode_done:True

(\*you are here). Lurkers gonna be *mad*.  Upon reflection it really highlighted to me how downright insane the discourse of 10-years-ago-MFA was. Taking the square toes as examples, we had all this "teaching material" about how they were wrong, unflattering and just an all around horrible idea. With the implication that the people who make and wear square toe shoes simply don't know what they are doing.  Yeah, right. The people running one of *the* most profitable and most competitive markets simply didn't know that square toes "don't flatter your foot". They needed randos on the internet to find that out. *Insane*.
text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

text:Whats with all the "stretchy mens pants" startups I am seeing all of a sudden?	labels:Serious question for anyone who has these: are they different from something like golf pants?
text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:I used to live near a TJ Maxx so I saw when the trucks would come in, usually every Wednesday morning. Sometimes on Thursdays, too, before the major sales holidays. On Tuesdays there would be bigger discounts and by Wednesday night the new stuff would be stocked. I went in pretty much every Tuesday and Wednesday to browse and get a feel for what they were getting in, but I would usually only actually purchase stuff maybe once a month since I'm a spendthrift.

So as each pair gets worn out or I decided to get rid of them (for instance, I don't LOVE my ballet flats, I should upgrade) I will buy the next pair of shoes in a red hue.

I do like some of the muted tones, but honestly I just want bright colors- not neon, just bold, fun bright colors.	labels:Me too, I'm exceptionally pale (and purposefully stay that way because I like the way it looks on me) and need the high saturation of jewel tones to wear color at all.   If I can't find jewel tones I feel like I've no choice but to just keep wearing all black all the time lol.

text:General Discussion - October 30	labels:probably my least favorite lurker take is "there's not a lot of style variety represented here :/"   First off, that's not even remotely true. Just in today's waywt we have: vintage menswear/prep, americana/workwear, full designer, milsurp, SLP-esque, W I D E,  etc. etc.   Secondly, if someone feels like their style isn't being represented, or they're not seeing what they wanna see, then POST A FIT. FUCKING PARTICIPATE. BE THE CHANGE YOU WANT TO SEE IN THE WORLD LIKE DAMN
text:It's got texture and the mix between white and other colour threads is fantastic and can help tamp down some bolder colours e.g. yellow, the collar roll on a good Oxford is beautiful, the fact it is a button down collar means it doesn't collapse without a tie so it's easy to wear under a jacket casually, it can easily sit underneath a fuzzy Shetland or a soft thin cashmere jumper and not look out of place in terms of visual weight.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Seriously!! Also what is that pants style called!?	labels:I've seen them called anything from pleated, carrot-leg, tapered or balloon-leg trousers and they are a bitch and a half to find because every company calls them something different. I've been hunting for the holy trifecta of: at least once pleated, in a plaid print, with a tapered leg and NO elastic in the waistband for like a year and even finding two of the four is difficult.

I would like some more "adult casual" looks.	episode_done:True

She's given us a few ideas but I'd love to get her a nice surprise, you know? I'd love any special or fun ideas! I'm estranged from my mother so my MIL is very special to me.

I know machine drying is frowned upon but I'm pretty lazy and tend to just do this for most of my clothes.  Do/will these hoodies shrink considerably with machine drying? And is there any noticeable impact on the feel/comfort of the hoodie?  I have a slim build (5 10, around 60-65kg) and am looking to get a small, and so I am okay with very slight shrinking.

text:Which higher end brands do you find to be "worth it" and for what?	labels:I love comfortable shoes. Aquazzura has comfortable, stylish heels. Eileen Fisher has less stylish, more comfortable shoes. I have not been impressed with Cole Haan lately. (I have loafers that are 5 years old that are comfortable, and shoes that are 2 years old that I regret buying.) I also like Lanvin shoes, but only have two pairs so not sure if my experience can be applied to all their shoes.  I hate Chanel espadrilles. They're insanely uncomfortable.  I don't like Commes des Garcons clothes are worth it. They feel like fast fashion quality with their brand slapped on.   Loro Piana cashmere is a fucking dream, but $$$$$$.   I have a Burberry leather jacket and the leather is nice. I can't speak to its durability because I've only worn it a handful of times.   Most of my every day clothes come from COS and Allsaints (on sale). Durable and drapes nicely at a reasonable price.

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Cons: People think I'm crazy  Pros: Other crazy people recognize me as their own. Regular people are not as startled when I act weird or talk about weird stuff.  I wear a lot of very unusual clothes that I make myself. A lot of them are inspired by historical fashion and videogame characters, but there are elements that are sort of hippie or vaguely goth/theatrical. A lot of what I wear is exceedingly lazy in essence, but people don't really notice, I think. I also have a very... medieval view on colors - specifically I consider the idea that some colors clash to be just a nasty rumor.  Also, I am autistic. I figured out that it pays to advertise. People are less weird about some of my odd behaviors (that I can't really help) if they get a heads up in the form of a huge lavishly embroidered long red skirt and a baby-pink viking style coat and a bright green shawl. And a pale purple puffy pointy hat that looks like the tower top of an ortodox church.
text:I resisted straight leg jeans for SO LONG because when I was in middle school (1997/1998) I was among one of the last to get into wearing flares and bootcut and I was convinced that the tapered straight legs of then were similar to what the straight legs were like now. But I adore straight legs now as long as they're a slim fit. I can't go back to flares.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I'm a big fan of Costco's trail socks.  That said and as a guy that spends a lot of time outdoors in winter in Michigan...the best insulation is air.   Boots a size or 2 bigger than usual and big airy puffy socks are the best way to keep warm.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I think Barbour is actually more associated with Landed Gentry/Old school upper class types.   Typically worn by people who go grouse shooting in mangy old Land Rover Defenders - but own a chunk of their local county.	labels:Yeah that's definitely true, but then lots of the middle class wear them as they'd like to emulate the landed gentry.

I always knew I wanted to dress better and sharper but wearing athleisure was just the cheaper option for me.    I do not mind chinos. I just want to dress it up a bit more for an elegant yet very minimal look. What is OCBD?

Still waiting for them to ship though.	episode_done:True

text:Stay In-Vested	labels:Genuine question: what are use-cases for opting for a down vest instead of a down jacket? I like vests, but at any temperature where they'd be appropriate I'm always like "might as well wear a jacket and cover my sleeves too". Is it for mobility? I've heard that if your core is warm then your arms don't matter as much, but I've never tested it out myself.
text:Shitpost Saturday: Ghost Outfit	labels:I'm wearing an oversized white tshirt with no bra, way too big men's black and white flannel pajama pants, and Stitch slippers that are blue sherpa and have floppy ears.

text:I say don't worry about your scars. I have scars on my ankle from surgeries due to a broken ankle, and if I hid them I'd be wearing mid calf socks all year long. I know midriff scars are on a more noticeable part of your body, but I think you should work on being less self consious of them so you can wear the styles you want. If the scars bother someone, its on them not on you!	labels:I don't know if I'm self conscious or I just don't want anyone pointing at it and asking and having to tell the whole story! I wrestle with the idea of showing them or not
text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I'm short, and one of the fashion guidelines I tend to read say to create long lines - this means avoiding ankle straps on shoes. I LOVE ankle straps on everything - heels, flats, sandals, etc. I definitely ignore this rule! Another rule I saw was to avoid the midi length since it can sometimes be too long but not long enough to be maxi. I wear my midi length skirts high-waisted so they fall at the right point and I love them. IDC if they make me look short, they're gorgeous!
text:I have to second this, I always size up in tights by at least one size, maybe more. It has to be rated for someone 100 lbs heavier than me or I just cannot take it.	labels:I was gifted a pair of uniqlo heattech tights recently and they are quite comfy! I typically size up for comfort as well but these fit well in my "true" size. Also worth checking out.

text:what are your fashion flaws?	labels:I seem to only be able to "support" 2 or 3 pairs of pants at one time. I buy a new pair, fall in love with it, and suddenly one of the old pairs just seems like completely the wrong fit/style/too worn. Partly I think this is due to sticking mainly to versatile pants, classic blue jeans or black jeans, that go with everything. If I added a little more color I'd be forced to branch out more.	episode_done:True
text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:For french tucks specifically - some tops just don't work for it. I have one sweater that I french tuck a lot. It's a loose sweater and I have no idea how to describe this properly but it's like...flexible? It's super easy to tuck the front in no worries.   Then I have another sweater that I tried to french tuck the other day. It's also a loose sweater, but it's stiffer and was less easy to tuck. I then went downstairs and my boyfriend said it looked like I went to the toilet and didn't realise my top was stuck in my pants.   So I think part of it could be that some tops just don't french tuck well?  But otherwise, my best advice is to just watch a tonne of Queer Eye. The women Tan dresses aren't skinny and perfect looking and he doesn't dress them in a way that aims for that. He dresses them to show what they've got but the outfits themselves look great.	episode_done:True

text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:Yeah, I think age correlates heavily here. It's not just that with time, you see so many styles come and go, but you have more life experience generally, and I've found that I have more responsibilities and things to care about every year. Trends come and go so quickly that I have less and less energy to care if my wardrobe is keeping up.  I'm "only" 31, so maybe I'm just a curmudgeon lol.	episode_done:True

text:While nothing is truly timeless in fashion, lastingness is graded on a scale. If the lurkers were really optimizing on that, the rule of thumb would be to not lean too hard in any particular extreme, whether it's silhouettes, e.g. cuts that are too skinny or too wide, or any one fashion "tribe" to the point where it looks like cosplay.   While the most salient elements of the zeitgeist can seem to flip on a dime to the casual observer, its center is quite slow moving.   Anyway I think we can have both - interesting stuff for the regulars and more conventional stuff for the lurkers. And as long as we don't take the bait from the trolls, some of these "discussions" in the threads can be pretty entertaining.	labels:I think lastingness is a good term  personally, i think timeless and classic are used casue people don't have the vocabulary to articulate what it is about the pieces they find interesting. so timeless and classic are good ways to describe military or menswear or ivy pieces because that's how they *feel.*  I think content that teaches, rather just drops an idea should be helpful.

For the first few months of WFH I stuck to my routine and got dress every morning.

I am not super brand loyal outside of Franco Sarto when it comes to flats, but I have a lot of variety in brands. Nine West makes some good low heels and flats too. I think miss L fire makes a great flat and good booties too. Never bought anything by them but I like their style a lot.

I realized that they cut off the visual line of my legs unlike a pair of long, black boots which I don't have. Maybe they will look alright with jeans, but I don't even like wearing jeans any more and I tend to stick with more feminine styles. Another issue is that I hate having to tie up and then undo the laces every time I wear them, it's just not practical. Idk if anyone has some style advice please let me know lol
text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:I love ModCloth and have for years. When they were sold to Walmart, I was disappointed--but I kept shopping there. The plus-size options are fantastic. The customer service is always great, too. I once bought a dress to wear to a wedding, realized it was going to arrive too late, and called them; they immediately upgraded my shipping for free. I don't buy the most twee things they have, but as somebody else noted, they have lots of other clothes, too. Also, sometimes I just want a cute or funny graphic T to wear around the apartment. It's true that their prices can be way too high, but they have frequent 30 percent off sales; I usually wait for one of those before buying.  The quality can be a bit mixed, but their returns are super easy, and it's usually clear quickly when a certain garment isn't going to wash well.  Will ModCloth survive this? I hope so. I know it isn't for everyone. But it's one of the only online stores I know will always have something I like, in my size.

The window for wearing the basic clothing you've suggested is huge, you're not going to be perceived as cute when you're in your 40s but none of the basic clothing you've suggested is going to make you look like a desperate old man, and your tastes will probably have changed by the time you get there anyway.	episode_done:True

text:How Carhartt A Billion-Dollar Brand	labels:Their shirts are pretty cheap while stylish, something I think a lot of brands are missing the mark on. Charging $17 for ball caps and tees while other brands are usually $25-$40 makes them ideal as a core for the wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:Mmm I bet you get the "what are you all dressed up for?" passive aggressive comment all the time. I live in an *aggressively* casual area (Pacific Northwest) so basically if I'm not wearing jeans and a flannel I'm trying too hard.	labels:Ah, the PNW. Going to the Seattle Opera is always a fun experience in people watching, because people there are dressed in anything from Patagonia to floor length gowns and suits.
text:Everyone’s opinions on Youtube fashion channels?	labels:I've been looking at @bestdressed since covid started... she's honestly awesome but her budget is 100% unrealistic.

Also suits are in decline in a lot of places, mostly being limited to interviews, funerals and weddings. But even then, at least in interviews, a sports jacket or blazer, with a tie and slacks or chinos is now acceptable too.  in my experience I haven't seen strict demand for suits at funerals and weddings as well.	episode_done:True
text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I was 24, my then fiance (now husband) bought me a Chanel bag to congratulate me on achieving a major life milestone. It's a beige calfskin, classic double flap with the interlocking C's and gold hardware. I use it on every suitable special occasion. It's been more than a decade and is still in damn good condition, I'll probably hand it down to one of my daughters.  Then when I got married, my parents very generously surprised me with a Chanel bag as well. It's the same handbag style, just a size larger and black with silver hardware. Still in great shape, and will probably also be handed down to my girls.   Honestly I don't feel the urge to acquire more / other high end bags, though I certaintly wouldn't object if they were gifted to me!	episode_done:True

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:She taught me function over style. I was horribly dressed for a long time simply because I didn't care about fashion. I was against makeup and pink, very anti feminine. I had a makeup and fashion faze after college but I think I've settled nicely into my androgynous athletica with short hair, yellow nails, and a chest binder. I love it!	episode_done:True
text:For the parents of girls	labels:I remember when I was younger my mom and dad would buy all my clothes. I use to pick out my clothes from my closet and my mom would make me change because they didn't match so on so forth. So when I was about 8 my mom finally noticed it bothered me a lot when she would make me change, so we made a deal that she would let me wear whatever I wanted as long as it was appropriate and clean that kinda stuff.  I know have to cousins 8(has down syndrome) and 9 who live with me that I practically parent. The 9 year old will were anything on trend that's cute(loves to try and steal my clothes) and the 8 year old is extremely picky she only likes to wear dresses and insist on wear clothes to small for her if she thinks there "cute" lol. She I kinda have to convince her that something is sooo cute. Anyway hope hope this ramble helped.	episode_done:True
text:When will I be "too old" to look cute, cool, hip, whatever?	labels:word of warning, i'm 25 and a friend recently dyed his hair blonde, and started dressing like a tik tok e-boy and posting edgy, posed photos. We're all super worried about him cause it looks like hes going through some stuff and is desperate for attention.  So word of warning is: maybe don' copy wholesale these looks that 18 year olds who post on the interent are doing and instead take some inspiration.  /r/malefashion has lots of soft boy, avante garde, e-boy, archive adjacent looks that are less specifically "18 year old," but convey similar ideas.

text:How has lockdown affected new purchases?	labels:Still working from home and will be until at least end of b2c peak next year, so my "need" for new stuff hasn't really been that great. It has meant I've worn a lot of stuff I haven't really had the chance to recently; even getting some pieces out of long-term storage that I was holding onto to gain value ripe to exploit some archivists.  I've sold a bunch of stuff as well, but most of that money has been spent on things other than clothes; fly fishing/tying, a 3090 or replacing tired stuff in the house.  Ultimately, my annual clothing spend for this year is going to be massively down. Sorry Ssense and Yoox.	episode_done:True
text:Le Château is closing all stores (most likely)	labels:I remember when I used to shop as the warehouse with my mother (at the time they had section for girls).  I got my prom dress (100% silk) for 70$ instead of 200$ because it was the last one (XXS) and it had little repairs to do.   Unfortunately, I feel like they lost what made them unique (affordable but stylish clothes) in the last years.	episode_done:True

That said, whenever it's worn as a mid-layer (especially buttoned up) it looks vaguely reminiscent of a gunslinger vest straight out of Red Dead, so while I can't see myself wearing it, it at least appeals to that part of my brain.

text:Does anyone else wear one brand only?	labels:I like Adidas sneakers but I have found some of their clothing to be really poor quality.  I thrifted an Adidas sweater, a genuine one recently that obviously hadn't been worn that much.  A basic straight stitch had been used to secure the hem, despite the fact that the fabric was a 4 way stretch jersey knit, it was some kind of sweat wicking thermal fabric.  Needless to say the stitches all popped very easily when I pulled them.   It was a loose sweater and I could have probably just not popped the stitches, but a garment shouldn't come apart like that either way.  I tend not to stick with brands per se, but there are certain brands whose clothes I generally avoid because they have a style I just don't like.	episode_done:True
text:Budget and climate are the two biggest ones, but another would be comfort. Even with my softest merino sweaters, I do feel a slight but discernable friction between it and my arm hairs.

text:Runways have been sending out 2000s vibes. Anyone onboard?	labels:Not about it. Like another commentor said, I entered and left puberty in the 00s and these fashion trends gave me horrible body image issues. Everything was skin-tight and low-cut to show off bellies and boobs and legs, which made a pudgy shorty like me feel awful about myself for a long time. I've always leaned more toward modest looks anyway just out of personal preference, so I've been living for the high-waisted, lower hemlined looks that have become popular now.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:Is anyone else kind of tired of posts and comments that variously try to "justify" the price of obvious luxury goods, designerwear, etc.?  Good thread on the SLP teddy, but just about nothing in there is surprising. Is it well-constructed? Duh, it's SLP. Does it have little refinements all over, compared to everyday varsity jackets? Yeah, that's kind of the point. Is it "worth" $2,000? No, obviously not.   Like...at some point we need to acknowledge that these efforts are misguided, even if well-intentioned. You're buying SLP because it's SLP (or Ackermann, or Dick Ovens, or whatever your thing is). *That* is the justification. And that's a fine justification in and of itself! An analysis of the materials and construction is unlikely to throw up surprises that'll make people go "damn, that really makes it worth the obnoxious price tag!"   (This observation does not apply to bespoke clothing, where the justification genuinely is that you get something more or less customized for you, and you alone.)  What do people think?

A friend has a statement necklace of huge randomly sized faux pearls, a bit longer than a choker. She has had it for years and it always looks amazing.

text:Jamieson and Harley are nearly always chunky and thick knit.  Pendelton is a broader line. Some are as thick (though usually it'd be a special run or collab etc) but they're just more prolific.  You can find some amazing Pendelton second hand if you're not opposed but otherwise the safer bet for heavyweight durability will be with the other two.

text:Yes, but I hate this trend where every blog nowadays only throws a bunch of very expensive options in your face with no regard to whether said make is known for that specific item. With many blogs nowadays you really can't tell the difference between a genuine recommendation and a sponsored recommendation.  If you want me to pay 250 bucks for a sweater made by a shirt-maker, you're gonna have to explain yourself. At least this article was transparent in saying that said shirt-maker, Proper Cloth, is in the list because it's a sponsors.	labels:Proper cloth does way more than just shirts and at 250 your still at a relatively low price for a knit (relative to other brands) especially since proper cloth is mtm. I don't see any brand recommendation that are poor quality for their budget in the article. That being said I agree with your general statement. when the blog recommends shit from like Cole haan for blazers I run.

text:What niche do you feel is missing from the fashion blogging/YouTube world?	labels:Wedding dresses for short people 5'0" and actual short people as models for reference not tall 6'5" models. I really like mermaid and fit and flare style dresses but have no idea what it'll actually look like bc my torso is non-existent. I once saw someone sell their wedding dress of a beautiful mermaid dress witha design of the clear lace at the legs. The bottom was shortened, but the the torso length remained long.  I don't know if the alteration was poor or if it was the reference photo being inaccurate but it looked like the person was missing a torso and had the upper body of a woman and the legs were of a little girl's and this was mashed together. Like when little girls try on adult clothes. It looked odd and I worried that this is what it would look like. Sometimes it's harder to try all the dresses you want in stores and it would be nice if they photos for each size bracket.

text:There is no unmarked woman	labels:I honestly have been normalized to being marked. Maybe I would actually feel unsettled if I was given "unlimited" freedom? Rompers, dresses, and skirts tend to be the clothes that I get the most feedback on. On one hand, I really do love compliments and conversations with others. In general, I love people.  But I've had awful experiences where being "marked" has had traumatic effects on my life. Maybe it would be different if I had more bad then good.

text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:When I did a shopping detox a few years ago, I found that using shopping to fill time was as big an issue for me as wanting new things. Yes, the fun of the purchase and desire to wear something new contributed to shopping. But the bigger issue for me was that I used shopping to fill downtime. It was an issue at in-person stores, e.g. in between a fitness class and work, and at home when I had plenty of time for online shopping. I had to find other ways to fill my time. I took walks between errands and tasks. I did some errands and maintenance work that I'd been putting off. I read and exercised more. It helped me see how much time I was dedicating to shopping and how much time I had available for other things if I shifted priorities a bit.	episode_done:True

text:Agree! The most ethical piece of clothing is the one you already have and wear the most. And that means every addition to your wardrobe should be something you'll wear many times. I read on a garment tag that the expected life of a garment is 70 washes.How many items do we all wear 70+ times? For seasonal items you only wear 6 months a year, that means wearing it once a week in season for 3 years.  I certainly can't say I've worn much of my closet that much. It helps if we can answer yes to the question "will I wear this once a week for 3+ years?" But if we already all have more than enough clothes, we don't actually have enough days in the week to wear items that much.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I definitely think some items are harder than others to wear and incorporate into your style. Also depends on your mindset.   With outerwear particularly (old coats or beat up denim jackets), I can't shake the feeling that I'm cosplaying as someone from the 50s or 60s, even if I'm wearing more modern pieces in the rest of my fit. And I don't think I'm ever going to feel comfortable wearing an old varsity with words or patches I've never heard of.	labels:	episode_done:True

I have no jeans, and Im really skinny right now and feel self conscious in just a t-shirt. I'm having a really tough time, and I want to feel better about how I look.  I have so many questions. What color jeans look best on a guy? What shirts look attractive to wear? What kind of clothes should I get?
text:The functionality aspect I get it  I just don't know style wise if those frames as classic and elegant as they look would be ruined by the slight tint or enhance it  My store told me to go 1 size bigger if I get transitions as it makes the glasses feel smaller usually	labels:I don't really care much for it to be honest, it's mostly the frame that matters. That said having tinted glasses on a cloudy winter morning is a bit annoying but these things are sensitive. Anyway I don't wear my glasses constantly as I've got 9/10 eyes. If I had to, I'd probably opt for something different, like these sun lenses you can clip on your regular glasses.
text:What’s a piece you bought before the pandemic, but haven’t worn a single time since because the occasion has been cancelled/we have literally nowhere to go?	labels:I've actually bought several dresses on clearance and a nice pair of dress shoes that were super on sale during the pandemic. If things go well I have *three* weddings I'm supposed to attend in that fall, so I'll (hopefully) wear them eventually.	episode_done:True

text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:I feel like dressing in the winter is so difficult (although the clothes are so much cuter/look better on me lol) because it'll be like 20F outside and 110F inside, and then a balmy 80F on the metro (crammed with smelly people pre-covid). so I usually wear a pretty thick coat (I got a really nice one on LL Bean last winter) and light layers underneath - J Crew tissue turtlenecks are my staples, Docs, and a scarf.  I try not to leave my apt during the summer haha...still trying to figure out cute clothes that won't make me feel/look miserable

text:Runways have been sending out 2000s vibes. Anyone onboard?	labels:I'm down with some of it, at least. I was in my late teens/early 20s for through the mid-2000s, and I definitely liked some of the trends. Like in the link you posted, I definitely dig the sunglasses. I was just saying to my husband the other day that I miss the kinds of sunnies that were popular during the early 2000s :) I liked the brighter colours and more interesting styles... like patchwork jeans, flared pants, plaid, studded things, corset tops, newsboy hats... and chokers! Choker-length necklaces are my favourite, so I'd love to have more access to them! I'd even go for a seatbelt-belt, and I'm in my mid-30s now (still a quirky dresser, lol).     I definitely DO NOT want low-rise to come back though; that was the worst! It's always so hard to find pants that fit comfortably and a low-rise comeback will just kill my dreams of comfy pants being easy to find. Tracksuits can stay in the 2000s, too :P	episode_done:True

Less clutter!\], but in practice they don't work great for me \[I get bored easily, I like a variety of styles, I love to play with clothes\].  I'm working on figuring out what 'styles' I enjoy, and a few pieces that would fit each style, so that I can have maximum options with a minimal(dish) amount.       I've been working on creating a capsule just for work though - even though my job skews casual, there are some safety rules that I should abide by when I'm in the lab space like long pants and closed toe shoes.  Plus, I seem to be more productive when I'm dressed more business-y.  I haven't figured out how to separate them in my closet though since we don't have a ton a space in our loft.	episode_done:True

But thank you for the reply, I will just buy 1 then.	episode_done:True

text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:I bought from ModCloth only pre-Walmart when I was in my late teens, and they used to be so fun - it was the place I could find funky mint green t-strap heels or a super unique formal dress that no one else would have at a dance or event. Once Walmart took over, I jumped ship, but found myself missing their retro vibes. If ModCloth is "revived" I would likely go back, as long as I was happy with their ethical/sustainability practices (doesn't have to be perfect, but at least trying and not just greenwashing).	episode_done:True

I have screenshots of Ssense outfits that I am trying to copy piece by piece lmao. I wear designers that copy other designers. Having points of reference is the first step to forming your own taste, and it is an effortless way to ensure you end up with some good pieces. But don't base it off what the person looks like, base it on the clothes. I'm blonde but I take inspo from Don Draper. You should find the inspo that speaks to you and go from there.

text:i'm still a teenager so i might not offer the best advice but if you want a more professional alternative look for work, accessories are your best friend!! add some necklaces, some more bold shoes, etc. to your work look. i would probably go for pants with a wide leg and long inseam with a nice type blouse with some details. you could also add an oversized blazer (but not too oversized).  if you have a strict dress code for work, i would focus a lot more on your face. obviously, full trad goth makeup wouldn't be suitable for work unless you work in some kind of alternative store but add some eyeliner (not a full wing but i would make it short and a bit smokey) and any other makeup you would usually wear. i would also dye my hair black (more suitable to work but still works with a lot of alternative styles) and then style it however you want.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Sculptural Fashion Inspiration Album	labels:I love the unexpectedness and drama of making a normally shapeless medium like fabric stiff and structured enough to hold any shape you give it. It also adds a dramatic volume that you don't usually get from clothes.  This is mainly inspiration. Not much of what's in this album is what most people would consider "wearable". These are almost all runway pieces and the majority of them weren't produced for sale. That said, if they were and I could afford them, I'd wear about 60% of what's in the album.  I included a bit of womenswear. There's more to draw from in womenswear, and the pieces here are wonderful.
text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:I love wearing midi/maxi knit skirts in fall and winter. They're comfy and warm. Just pair them with some boots and a sweater and you're good to go! You can also wearing leggings under if you want extra warmth. I've purchased many long skirts from Uniqlo if you're interested in a brand.	episode_done:True

Alas. The styles changed just a bit, and now I can't find the plain white tanks and tees I want because the sleeves and the neckline and the length are all just a tiny bit off.

I remember YSL was like this for a long time about ten years ago but they seem to have revived their brand somewhat.

text:What do you get tailored?	labels:I love the idea of tailoring in theory, but in practice my body changes shape a lot. In the past I've struggles with an eating disorder, and had periods of fairly rapid weight loss and gain. These days I've been doing better with that, but I've also finally come out as non-binary. Some days I wear a chest binder and some days I don't. If I tailored things, I'd need a whole lot more clothing lol.   I expect there are people out there whose bodies change a lot even without these factors being involved. If anyone has tips for improving fit without actually stitching anything, or just wants to comiserate about the difficulties of an evolving body (whatever the source of those body changes), I'm here for it.

text:Are there any actual fashion trends in 2020?	labels:I'm a place with still moderate covid restrictions: everything closed march to about june, outdoor dining opened in june, we are still at 25% indoor dining and limited capacity everywhere, you can only be at your own table, everything closes at 10pm. So, for me, even if I am out people are at their own tables or in their own dining igloos, and I really can't see everyone's full outfits.  I was also injured right before covid so I haven't gone to work in person in a full year.    That being said these are trends I have actually seen - tie dye, more doc martens than ever before, more wide pants than ever before, shackets, matching sweat sets, flared leggings and lots of ribbed pants and ribbed tops in general.  leather and faux leather pants.  thigh slit mini skirts.   I have not seen anyone wearing bucket hats or sweater vests, they still only live on tik tok in my world.
text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:The world isn't the US, some of them have responsible leadership and will (probably) have holiday parties and other outings. Heck, not even the US can be painted with a broad brush. My city took the lock down seriously, now we're slowly opening. People here are going out again, just with masks and outside. I think the idea that everyone is now in sweatpants 24/7 is exaggerated.   By virtue of being high end it's going to be out of step with the lives of the average people.

I wore a knee-length black pencil dress with a long black blazer. This one lady wore a fascinator with an orange feather sticking up and she stood out in a bad way. I think the focus of the funeral is typically supposed to be on the deceased so it seemed self-indulgent to be wearing something so conspicious. Same thing for the guy who wore a half-unbuttoned linen shirt. Just no situational awareness.	episode_done:True

Does that item, style, colour, cut, feature, etc catch my eye? Did we make shy eye contact? Auto-pilot: issue compliment, smile, nod, exit stage left. I miss public transit for those times.  People are suspicious of compliments, especially women, as an opener for deception.   Idk if I am more empathetic or something, but the expression on someone's face is just so ... nice. So maybe the selfishness in it is the happiness I feel from their reactions. Sometimes people need to be reminded that the entire world is neither out to get them nor completely ignore them. Makes me feel less disconnected.	episode_done:True
text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Asket | February 6, 2021	labels:Oddly enough, I am wearing one of their hoody's as we speak, so it's a great time for my comments.  I actually interviewed one of their co-founders on my podcast, and decided to treat myself to one of their garments after being really impressed with their brand and company values. I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of product, but as soon as I unboxed the package, I instantly felt the quality in the weight of the hoody.   The organic cotton is soft to the touch, but there is substantial weight in the body of the hoody, which to me is exactly what I want in a garment that gives me comfort, especially in the winter.  I've only had the hoody for a month, but after 20 or so wears and the first wash, it looks like new, which is a great indicator of longevity.  Aside from the quality, I personally love everything Asket is about from an ethos perspective and have nothing but great things to say about my experience with them so far.  Five Stars, IMO.	episode_done:True

You would have no idea they're Hot Ones shoes until you see the bottom with the chicken wings. But how cool is it to have chicken wings on the bottom of your shoes?! It's hilarious.    Worst: I bought a plaid shirt/flannel thing from ASOS that I shouldn't have kept. I bought two more flannels later from another store that are much more soft and cozy. I was very deliberate in my puchases this year, so if this is my only regret, that's pretty good.
text:What’s your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:I don't remember these styles from the 90s but I was so young at the time. I feel like I vaguely recall grunge style with a lot of flannels, vintage, etc, Girbaud pants and shorts, velvet.

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:When the pandemic hit us people on this sub were predicting a dip in quality from retailers. It was already happening well before the pandemic, but they figured retailers will probably cut corners *even more* and we would see that transition to even poorer quality once the 'regular' stuff already cycled through.  I remember in high school, Old Navy had thick cotton for women's tanks. Some of those tanks are still in my closet! Meanwhile, the more recent tanks are thinner and tend to be blended with synthetics. You can't get through a season before little holes start to show up where your jeans poke the fabric.

text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:I've only ever had one person give really nice jewelry. (Not that I've gotten a lot of jewelry in general, but like, as a teenager, I was given a necklace from like Sears or something. Meaningful at the time, but not something I'd save anyway probably...) The relationship ended terribly but I liked the piece. I just had it remade. Any good jeweler can do this pretty easily (not always cheaply, though). I turned one necklace into two. The jeweler worked with me, as I came in eith general, vague ideas and they actually drew up plans and designs, which I picked from...It was cathartic in a way. I wore one of the necklaces to renew a restraining order against the guy and it felt like an ultimate "screw you, I have the power here" move lol	episode_done:True

I was the only one in the class that noticed. Granted most the class were guys but still. I am in the same boat as you, now while wfh I wear the same thing for days and I don't think anyone notices.

They're both super comfortable and soft. Great amount of colors.  I also really like the organic cotton long sleeve from Organic Basics ($45). SUPER soft. Like crazy soft. (If you do order one of their long sleeve tops, size up...My first order I got my usual size and wow that was a mistake! Lol) they don't have a great amount of colors unfortunately...  NAADAM is also a great place to get cashmere. They're ethical/sustainable and pretty reasonably priced for cashmere items. I have about 5 of their $75 cashmere sweaters and one that is $125. Totally cute, warm, and comfortable! Lots of colors to choose from as well!  I also have quite a few long sleeve tops from Target...I am trying not to buy A New Day long sleeve fitted tops ($10)..but they're pretty decent for the price. Fun colors also.	episode_done:True

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Think the problem lies within yourself. Fashion has always been about trends and you feel forced by your understanding of society and your circle to keep in trend. People who can afford it, get stylists. They have their clothes picked for them.   If you're having this much stress. Maybe think about the underlying reason. Choose what you want to wear. What speaks to you. What makes you happy. Living a life for other people is one wasted. At the end of the day they're not going to remember you were this year's Fashion. If they do, they're shallow and you need people in your life that don't care what other people wear.  Just be you.	episode_done:True
text:I remember when topshop opened in manhattan like 15 yrs ago. I was walking up broadway in Soho and there was a long line on opening day.   I checked it out a few months later. I'm 5"9 175 with moderately broad shoulders. Nothing there fitted my shoulders.   I saw a great plain coat. Had a chinese, cultural revolution, minimalist vibe. The XL fit my shoulders. The sleeves and torso length were absurdly long.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I snagged some Italian made pair a few years ago for a significant amount off the actual retail (lol per this thread I guess because they're "dress sneakers"), I don't recall the brand name off hand and since I haven't gone into the office ever again I don't really wear them anymore, but the leather feels so super comfortable and nice. They're tan with the per this thread, hated white sole. But it's a normal sneaker sole not that chunky one people keep posting.  \*shrug* I like them and they pair well with some outfits. Not as versatile as a regular sneaker, but nice to have a different flavor when you want something different.	labels:Totally agree. I work in a hospital and get tons of steps in some days. Yet there is an expectation that I dress at least business casual. My Cole Haans fit the bill beautifully: light, cushiony, and breathable enough to wear even on during an entire 26 hour shift.	episode_done:True

text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:I think it is a must as much as the trench or the white button down - it does not necessarily work for all of us, either our lifestyles or bodies.  Trench coats were invented when people wore hats, hence no hood, and they are IMO impractical for rain compared to hooded raincoats and can drown a lot of women's bodies particularly if they are not tall. Or if they bike, or whatever.   Little black dresses were probably a fantastic idea in the 60s, where women would dress formally for the office, or go to cocktail parties afterward. Right now I think the LBD probably is good for one thing, the specific cocktail or aperos or dunno a party given by your inlaws or something. I think it is something work having - but buy it cheap and/or in sale because likely you will not wear it lots... And focus on fitting (not too tight, not too short), if you find an affordable one which fits great and you have the budget/space, worth having. But do not go all check-list getting.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:I'm a full fledged Maxxnista but I haven't had much luck with clothing there.  It's been very hit or miss lately (and 2020 styles are NOT flattering on me AT ALL).    Their beauty section is another story...  That's a major weakness of mine and I just recently stocked up on some shampoo and conditioner in anticipation of another lockdown.

About $1500 gone.

text:Tons of formal stuff for sure, with the amount of weddings and engagements and all the associated parties and celebrations there will be. It'll probably permeate everyday wear too, and putting more effort in and having a more "done" look will swing back into being desirable.   I know girls who are actively planning their "look" for weddings in 2021 and 2022 - people wanna have shit to look forward to and get excited about, and wearing all the cool stuff you longer for in lockdown is exciting.	labels:I gave birth at the end of 2019 and was soooo excited to be invited to 3 very swanky weddings in DC and NYC in 2020.  Was spending a lot of time looking up dresses and inspiration since I knew I would have my pre-pregnancy body back by then.  Needless to say, I will be going all out in 2021 if those weddings are allowed to resume.
text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:The most expensive bag I bought was a $500 Tory Burch bag, and I have already sold it. I regretted the purchase. I always wanted a Chanel bag, but after the pandemic, my perspective has changed a lot and I am happy with my Madewell leather bags I have collected over the years.

text:It depends on how dirty they are.  Jeans that I wear for work.  They get tossed in the wash on cold, (sometimes treated with oxyclean spray), then they go in the dryer on ultra low heat.  My good jeans are only washed when dirty.  I turn them inside out and wash on cold / gentle.  Then I hang them to dry.   I don't really have nice distressed jeans.

The purchase happened on my birthday month so it did become the birthday gift to myself. It was a year and a half into scrimping and saving for my own apartment, and I would put a little bit of money aside each pay that I received for something silly. That silly something was to get a designer bag. A rite of passage for the fashion lover, or so I thought. I got the Saint Laurent SDJ Nano on sale at 30% off. I'd love to buy another designer bag but I don't hold bags to the same sentiment as jewellery.	episode_done:True

text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:I love love the concept of "Capsule wardrobes". Maybe other people find it restricting but I find it liberating. I get easily overwhelmed with too many choices (I also tend to feel guilty when I see a piece I haven't worn for a long time like I wasted my money and that it is harmful for the environment). I have put an effort in buying less but buying a quality piece (for the environment ya know) so all I need is 20 pieces of clothing.  I usually include a couple of trendy pieces. a leather jacket. a fur jacket. a nice tan color wool jacket. another beige wool jacket. 2-3 high-waisted trouser/tailored-pants. 1 denim jean. 1 white blouse. Sometimes I include dresses and skirts depend on the season. I usually don't include skirts and dresses though because they are not as versatile but I tend to keep a beige silk wrap skirt.  Since I own less, I am able to care for each item more. Each piece is very loved.	episode_done:True

text:Lamb is fantastic! It was very common where I grew up, less so in the US (compared to poultry, beef, and pork anyway).

Good lamb will be super tender and juicy, though still toothsome and with a distinctive flavor (which people either love or dislike, I guess). What're you making with it?	labels:I grew up on a sheep farm and I can't stand lamb. It tastes like the inside of the barns smelt at the end of winter.

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:oooooh,so apparently my friends all consider me the laundry queen. I also have the strictest dress code out of all my friends. I will say that much of my wardrobe is machine washable,but even with those pieces I try to limit damage from washing. I have a couple of ways:  1. wearing more often and hanging up between wears to air out and limit wrinkling.  2. Depending upon the item,using an undergarment to protect from sweat etc.  3. Using a steamer to help remove wrinkles and refresh clothes.  4. If having to wash in a machine,gentle cycle on cold and air dry. I use a mesh wash bag for the most delicate articles. I find for a lot of "dry clean only" this method is usually ok.  5. For wools and silks etc. I use Eucalan.   edited to add: I don't really havs brand recs - much of my wardrobe is thrifted and even when I've gotten recognizable brands I don't think I'd be able to say with confidence if they were indicative of the brand's current quality.	episode_done:True

text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:The key is actually just learning how to create FABULOUS casual outfits rather than tryin to dull down a dressy outfit. Instead of starting from a place of Dressiness, start with Casual then work on making it the NICEST version of casual possible.    I like to wear jeans and loafers and then some gold earrings, a small scarf, a blazer and maybe a necklace. Where I live even that can be too fancy. So if I see its over the top, I just whip off the scarf and blazer, wipe the lipstick off a little and then I'm looking really cute casual in a t-shirt and jeans.     Overly styled hair and makeup is one thing I notice older women do that "ruins" a casual outfit. The hair is often too stiff and done and the makeup too "nice". So I think having a really pretty, casual go-to hair and makeup routine is important.	episode_done:True

My old mesh new balances from California were not too good for this weather, and my feet got soaked usually within seconds, while the shoes themselves degraded/got dirty and moldy very quickly.

text:I get that. I'm in my early 50s, so between menopause and having spent the bulk of my adult life battling several autoimmune illnesses wearing comfortable clothing is a must. But I like different things. I can only wear my skinny jeans some of the time due to chronic pain/inflammation. So my pants wardrobe is all about chinos since they are comfortable.   I'm an hourglass/pear leaning more towards the pear these days but I'm not going to beat myself up over it. I love fit and flare dresses and twirly midi skirts. I like open front cardigans for the non-winter months. These are the styles I like to wear and are comfortable. I feel no compulsion to chase every fad or trend.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:As I wait to hear if I have to evacuate due to CA wildfires, here’s a hypothetical I had to do: you have time to prepare before your evacuation and pack up your car. What clothes do you bring and why?	labels:Socks and underwear, just like my mama taught me.  You don't know when you'll get a chance to do laundry, and you don't want to re-wear a dirty pair of panties.  I'd throw in a few pieces that have sentimental value and/or are simply irreplaceable, but mostly, I'd be grabbing by the Old Reliables.  You should know which ones they are--the pieces that you keep coming back to because they are versatile, comfortable, and easy to wear.  You may feel terrible leaving behind your beloved zany vintage pieces in favor of a plain black knit top, but if you're packing to lose almost everything you own, you have to ensure that the things you *do* save are things that will keep you going while you rebuild your life.  Make sure you have something you can wear to a job interview if, heaven forbid, you end up not being able to go back to your own job.	episode_done:True
text:I think this is key really. You can sit down and try to learn about stuff intellectually, but it won't click into place until you build the habits of aggressively checking fabric content tags and doing lots of googling in real time until it just becomes second nature. You get to the point eventually where certain things you don't even have to check the care tag because you can tell by feel or sight whether it's cheap cotton or polyester. I found that thrift stores actually helped a lot with learning for m because you get a mix of stores, fabric types, and quality so you can have a cheap cotton shirt next to a better made polyester shirt and actually see and feel the difference.	labels:	episode_done:True

But both are out of the woods! They seem to be doing so much better and it's a huge relief!   Got a bunch of Aime Leon dore stuff from various sales and I got to say I'm very impressed. Nothing too flashy, but the Woolrich collection goes so hard. Also have to say, as much as I love some of Howlin' designs,  compared to the ALDxWoolrich stuff,  Howlin' quality is just not there. Surprised at how itchy the wool is. My gf got them as a full price Christmas gift though so can never say that out loud lmao.

You can grab some Golden Fox boots, but i'd rather save up the extra $75 and get Iron Rangers seconds from Sierra Trading Post or elsewhere.  &#x200B;  I'd recommend poking around some sites like Dappered, or Primer. They've got a lot of guides and reviews of moderately priced stuff	episode_done:True

I want cyberpunk LEDs and glow in the dark stuff, not just angular rain jackets. Probably wouldn't be ad cool as I'm imagining, but I think it would be fun.	episode_done:True
text:What trousers do people wear these days?	labels:I've actually been wearing bootcut maternity jeans. Don't kill me they're the comfiest pair I've found and work well with flowy tops and ankle boots. Plus I don't like wearing flats or low cut shoes in some of the houses I'm in for work since they're not all clean	episode_done:True
text:What are your go-to, everyday shoes?	labels:Since covid, it's LL Bean slippers.  Assuming I actually leave the  the house though, I have a few options  1. Winter & shoulder seasons: Timberland Women's Sutherlin Bay Leather Boots 2. Year round: grey converse 3. Summer & shoulder seasons: Birkenstocks 4. Winter if I don't feel like looking nice or tying shoes: a pair of rolled over 12 year old uggs that are warm af and easy to throw on. I wouldn't buy another pair cause I think they look kinda dumb but holy hell are they warm and easy	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel sexy at home in winter?	labels:velvet, cashmere, and even corduroy are warm (especially if you layer a thermal top or leggings underneath) but still look lovely! i also like to layer lacy, silky pieces on top of my winter clothing to add some visual interest. if you're into streetwear, puffer jackets and graphic, structured sweats (not the thin kind you get just anywhere, the thick, structured kind with cool graphics printed on them) are super warm but look great too	episode_done:True

text:Does Anyone Ever Feel Like It’s Hard to Find Basic Clothing Items That Were Plentiful in the Past?	labels:I don't know if I'd consider a velvet dress a basic item.  My basic item is a good quality fitted tee and tank.  Old Navy used to be the place to buy these things but their quality has gone downhill a lot.  I just want a tee or tank that is good for layering, but is not so sheer that I can't wear it alone.  Is something made with fabric heavier than tissue paper too much to ask?  (And by fitted, I don't mean the Everlane oversized/boxy fit.  If I wanted that, I'd shop in the men's section.)
text:>Burgundy tights and a millennial pink shirt  this + seafoam green, aqua blue, or a deep teal make it beachy, too.

Felt very seaside - maybe if the bag were like a dark burnt orange or cinnamon it'd be even better.  &#x200B;  Also I love blush and olive!!!

text:Walmart fashion a “new” thing as seen on IG bloggers?	labels:Are they marked as sponsored posts? A couple of fashion influencers I follow are showing a lot of Wal-Mart clothes these days and the posts are always marked as sponsored. Any time an influencer is getting paid to wear something I assume they're wearing it for that reason and not because they genuinely like the clothes. I'm always way more interested in what they're wearing when they're not getting paid by some megacorp.  I will say I have weird love for some of the older George (edit: from Wal-Mart) stuff (like from years ago) that I can find on ThredUp periodically, some of the dresses from 10 or so years ago are actually pretty great and wear well. Anything else I've ever seen or purchased is very meh.
text:What are your go-to basic fall tops? I’m talking long sleeve tees, sweatshirts, turtlenecks etc!	labels:I love the "beyond soft" sweaters and sweatshirts from Athleta. They feel luxe and look a little more leveled up. They're washer/dryer friendly so worth the cost imo.  I know J.Crew has quality issues these days, but their cardigans are still a good buy if they're on sale. I'm loving their sweater coats these days to toss on over tees, button ups, etc. I just bought a black one and the texture is gorgeous. Super comfy too.  Edit: formatting.

Nothing from my husband, nothing from family. We have away a bunch of gifts, but got nothing in return. I even got something for my husband to open under the tree. But I got nothing. Just sat at home, baked a lemon loaf and watched tv. I thought putting up Christmas ornaments would put me in a better mood, it didn't. I took down the Christmas ornaments today. My mum died two years ago, Christmas was always big with her, and she dowled out gifts like they were going out of style, and we usually travel over Christmas, so Christmas has always felt exciting. This year, I don't feel like celebrating. Just a sad, lonely Christmas. Looking at all your Christmas spoils just makes me feel even worse. I shouldn't have ventured into this thread...

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:You have to be a skeptic. You have to go in there with the mindset that decent brands and decent items are rare. That however cheap anything is, it was, 98% of the time, made to be sold at that price.  If you've heard of the brand, *and* you know it's good, *and* you know they don't have a diffusion line, *and* you know that you like the piece, *and* you know it's not damaged or defective, *and* you've tried it on and it fits, *and* it really is a good price in light of all that go ahead. Their return policy isn't too harsh, so you can double-check some details at home, but... Don't expect anything to be great.  Otherwise... each of those things are risks. On the menswear side... I often search for the brand name here. I've probably missed a decent item or two that way, but I've also avoided a lot of garbage and found one or two pieces of gold.	episode_done:True
text:I'd also like to add that it's not nearly as expensive as I thought it'd be. I think a lot of people (including myself in the past) hear the word "tailor" and think it's only something the upper-upper class do.

Well I went through some family stuff where I no longer need to be spending my free time and money taking care of some family members so I have been updating my wardrobe like crazy. I watched and learned about a ton of fashion for a month first with all the free time from covid. I have never spent this much on myself ever. Don't get me wrong everything was thrift store finds or clearence but I was still wearing almost only things from highschool before and I'm 25..

Perhaps it would have if the stitching had been more neon light blue instead of light blue.   I love the laces, I love the shoes with the blue soles, but not together and I can't put my finger on why. Maybe get quality shoelaces with the exact same shade as the stitching? Perhaps even pigmented leather shoelaces? Maybe instead perfectly match the shoe laces to the more orange hue of brown above the bright blue below the stitching, to contrast and highlight those blue.	episode_done:True

text:How do you feel about vegan/faux leather?	labels:I have a faux-leather party dress that I bought last year for a specific occasion, and I've worn it a couple times since. I love how it looks, but it also traps heat, so I'm not casually wearing it around the house during quarantine.  Ethical considerations aside, I tend to avoid faux leather in bags. It has a much shorter lifespan than actual leather, and I'd rather buy a bag that lasts years but is made from an animal product versus a bag that lasts months and is made out of plastic that will have to be thrown away and won't ever degrade.  But I think faux leather is fine in accent pieces that you don't wear every day (like a party outfit that gets worn every few months, versus a skirt that gets worn every week), and if someone spills a drink on it it'll wipe off and not stain. It can serve a definite purpose, as long as you know what you're getting into.	episode_done:True

Kinda like every kid in the neighborhood suddenly became privy to "your" private swim spot.   Maybe it's the association of all of it. I feel like this big shift has occurred, especially in the last 2-3 years where the kids who rock vineyard vines have found themselves getting their "street style" on or rich girls who wish they were indie chicks compensate by wearing bucket hats and only using film cameras.  Still organizing my thoughts around this.. going through a fashion identity crisis atm.

The way I see it, I have two choices... a) Purchase a pair of barely used shoes that haven't had their cork insoles "broken in" yet, and therefore have a better chance of forming to my feet better, or b) purchase a pair of cheaper shoes (\~$50) with the plan to send them to AE for recrafting which ensures that I get a fresh cork insole, along with a completely recrafted shoe.  Thoughts?  If I go with route (b), my final cost will be around $200. So I guess I need to see if I can find some barely used shoes for less than that. If not, the recrafting option may be just as good?

text:Stacking and pooling are what happens when pants are longer than your "proper" inseam length. What ends up happening depends on the width of the pants, as well as the material. Pooling is what you think of when people talk about '90s jeans; wide, long, and "puddling" all over the shoes. Stacking, in contrast, is what happens when the pants are skinny and long, forming folds or "stacks" at the ankle area. Material plays a factor since cotton tends to rumple/wrinkle which favours stacking, whereas stuff like wool drapes, which favours pooling. Think of it as a continuum between narrow stacking and wide pooling.  Also important to note that either can be purposeful decisions to convey a particular vibe, but pooling ends to happen more with people who don't put as much thought into their clothes (i.e. "they'll grow into it" sizing, etc.)	labels:Ahhhhh.. thank you for that	episode_done:True
text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:I recommend doing two things:   1 - look at your current wardrobe and pick out what outfits you consider your favorite. Ask yourself why you gravitate to those items. Is it a color? A theme? A certain look? Those are some clues to your style.   2 - if you follow fashion bloggers or general fashion posts, ask yourself why you follow them. There is a likelihood that you follow them because you like their look/style.    Now, with more insight into what style you currently have and styles you aspire to have, you may get closer to defining your style. Don't feel too bad if you can't explicitly name it (ie: preppy, vintage, casual, etc). Your personal style is more nuanced and probably a combination of multiple categories.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 07, 2020	labels:I'm looking for some advice! My SO asked me to get him new shirts to add to his wardrobe for Christmas. The issue is, I'm not sure what to get him - he says he trusts my fashion sense, but I'm only good at women's styles. He's in his early 20s, tall and lean build, about 6'4" and ~165lbs. His wardrobe mostly consists of grey, straight-cut pants and a handful of grey/black/white printed t-shirts that aren't fitted. In the past I've managed to find a handful of fitted button-downs and sweaters that look nice on him. He wants more printed t-shirts this time, and has asked that I help add some color to his wardrobe. Where can I find affordable, nice men's shirts that are more than just solid colors? My Christmas budget is tight this year, but I'd love to find him around 4-5 new shirts for under $100.

But I think I'm just not young enough this time. I remember the 2000s as a time when I was young, unbothered, and boundlessly optimistic. That's just not 2020 for me right now.  It's cute, I love to see the younger set channeling me circa 2002 (it really does make me smile), but I'm not that girl anymore. I have really gravitated toward the elevated basics, androgynous clothing, comfort fabrics, and eco-conscious brands. I've leaned into being a 30+ woman, and I'm honestly loving it. I always feel that, when people try to dress too young out of insecurity, it can actually age them after awhile. I'm good being my Levis-and-good-cardigan self.

I've moved to a place with an ungodly cold winter (even though from what people are telling me this winter has been quite mild) from a place with only hot-or-warm-entire-years and the only thing I've been able to think about the past week is: how the hell do people keep their legs warm without looking dumb? Any sort of fashion or even barely nice looking thing I wear seems to let breeze in like a fucking skirt while I'm outside. Are long johns a thing people actually wear and not just a thing in old assed shows that have a winter fishing scene? If you're hooking up with someone and have to take off your long johns, that won't be something that gets you laughed at by society as a whole (or spread a rumour that you're a mormon)? Are there winter coats but, like, skirt winter coats I can wear over my legs? How do people do this...
text:Yep, definitely a rise issue then. As I mentioned, I experience the same problem with Levis' regular stuff. Once the waist fits well, everything else is too tight and low.   If I'm not completely lost in my own world, high waist and regular fits have been dominating the scene since at least 2? years. Why Levi's insists on keeping the low waist on their 501s is a mystery to me. I wouldn't call their current waist a regular waist. They ought to be like Dickies work pants. *That's* a regular waist haha.	labels:I am on the lookout for something like athletic fit pants, just for the way they fit in the waist/rear/thigh/crotch.

text:Yeah be careful with mass produced stuff. Brands change owners or management and China is capable of producing manufactured goods with the same or better quality than countries that don't use slave labor, so it's always a ticking bomb when someone already has their line streamlined so that it can be mass produced that they will move shop and pocket the difference.  Even mass produced brands that stamp american flags on their stuff like Redwing have big operations in China were they just jump around factories finding the cheapest labor and employees are usually working on conditions that would be considered slavery in the US. That doesn't mean there's no good quality jobs in China but for the clothing industry I usually assume guilty until proven innocent. Like if I can't find the factory address on the webpage I try not to buy from them.	labels:I never knew Red Wing did it. Sheesh, I have like 4 pairs.

I went shoe shopping a month earlier and still had the boxes in my room. I throw them out thinking they were empty. When I was packing to fly out for my internship, I couldn't find the sandals.

The fit is also excellent, the body is slim but pretty long, and the sleeves aren't billowy. I have several of these shirts and they're holding up fine after ~2 years of wear. They do run pretty slim so I had to size up (normally wear a small but wear a medium in these). Really the only negative thing I have to say is that their quality control can be off sometimes, one of my five bella canvas shirts just doesn't fit quite right even though it's the same size as the others. All in all though, highly recommend.	labels:Oh, the fabric is also pretty thin. I live in a really warm climate so this isn't a problem for me, just a heads up!	episode_done:True

text:The abundance of sub-brands is really confusing and annoying. There's the shitty Kohl's tier Chaps and Lauren Ralph Lauren brands all the way up to Purple Label and RRL, and what seems like another dozen or two in-between. I don't understand why it was thought to be a good idea to create so many damn lines.  Shit, there's literally three sub-brands with the word polo in the title. Which then creates a situation where a garbage brand like U.S. Polo Assn can leech off your sales by making people assume they're another RL sub-brand and result in you having to spend untold amounts of money suing them over it.	labels:Bit of a hot take here so forgive me, but diversifying is probably actually helping them stay in the game.

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I don't really get cold, so this advice might not be helpful, but when I'm wearing a dress with boots (which is a standard outfit in my wardrobe, usually a mini dress with docs or vintage boots around the same height), I find that it really helps to wear warmer high rise underwear with a boyshort cut. Almost like shapewear I guess? I find that if my midsection and tush are warm, I don't need to cover my legs. That being said I have heavily tattooed legs, so I usually like to have them bare. If i am wearing long socks, depending on the color of my dress and boots, i wear a warm grey cotton knee high or a cotton/wool blend black knee high.

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:I grew up not being able to afford the latest trends so I adopted a grunge style and would tear holes in my jeans, put safety pins on them or cut the necklines off normal  t-shirts to make off-the-shoulder shirts. Also when the skinny pants trend started, I only had boot cut pants, so I sewed the bottoms tighter to make skinny style pants. It definitely made me more creative and gave me the mentality to make the best of what you have.  Now that I can afford a bit more, im all about comfort and quality. It really is a luxury to wear natural fabrics that don't make you hot and sweaty. And that fit properly.  Its definitely much easier to have (subjectively) good taste and style when you have money.	episode_done:True

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:One solution for weird looking midi skirts is to wear a pointed flat or almond-shaped flat. Not the best for foot health, but seems to create that high heel aesthetic in a manageable way. It also seems to help with trousers/wider legged boot cut dress pants. If you're able to handle a little bit of height, pointed toe wedges are WAY more comfortable than heels and kind of help with that silhouette.  Otherwise yeah, pixie pants and skinny jeans and dresses and coats cut above the knee or higher are probably the better option if you wear flats all the time. Or you could just say "fuck it" and lean into the full menswear or casual aesthetic and do Oxfords with billowy trousers, chelsea boots with midi dresses, etc. The rules only exist if you want a flattering look that makes your leg look longer, but if you put that aside and lean into it you can still wear that kind of stuff with purpose.

Prices are good, quality is good, and the return policy is amazing. I've been surprised with the quality of Kirkland brand leggings and tops and I've been able to restock my wardrobe with coats, basics, and work from home outfits (mostly leggings!) for very cheap. Recently got a plush, warm, long robe for only $9! And there are good online deals pretty regularly as well. They also have lower prices on designer clothing/purses/perfumes/make-up.

text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:My good friend told me a great tip for New Years Resolution : to start already for all the month of December, to see if you actually stick with it and make it a habit by New Years!!  That said, my new years Resolution for fashion is -  Buying clothes in colors (preferable pastels, especially pink and light blue!), and adding mini skirts (especially pleated), sweater vests, blouses with interesting collars and bows, cute cardigans, and loose pants (in other fabrics besides denim).  I am tired of only having jeans and a bunch of free college tshirts, while the few cute blouses I have match with none of my bottoms.
text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:I was in this same position a few years ago! I highly recommend creating a budget and setting aside a certain amount of money each month for fashion/clothing/shopping etc. This prevents you from feeling guilty or restricted from shopping.   Also, I would recommend creating a wishlist of pieces you want to buy and planning out when you want to buy them. For example, in the beginning of the year, I knew I wanted a good pair of boots this year. So I wrote down in my wishlist on my phone that I would buy them in September/October. I think this helps to be more mindful when shopping as items will be on your list for a while so you have to think about and research them and how they will fit into your wardrobe before you actually buy them!	episode_done:True

But I didn't see them in my life anymore and they were taking up space. I honestly got rid of things that were leftovers from high-school and parts of undergrad. Also a lot of socks, random t-shirts, and bras that were the wrong size.  I think its a good idea to not get rid of all your "work clothes". Maybe hold on to some things? You may have to do a professional zoom call. I think its less expensive to house a small selection of items instead of rebuying a bunch of things.

I would've bought those children coats myself had I seen a situation like that or been around when it happened but it was in a different area of the U.S. from where I live of course. But I haven't supported a Goodwill since. I would about feel as comfortable supporting a sweat shop as Goodwill bc they're no better in my opinion.	episode_done:True

text:I mean it technically is, but I don't often explicitly say I'm interested in fashion as a hobby.   There's a lot of stereotypes about being vain, vapid, and further outdated ones about sexuality. As a rule of thumb the older the person the more stereotypical assumptions about a person's sexuality in my experience.   It's a balance between impression management (how do I want to appear, what do I want to be known for?) and who I'm talking to really. Professionally? Not usually. With friends or colleagues I'm more casual with? Sometimes.   End of the day though, hobbies don't make a person. See: everyone's hobby being hiking on dating platforms lol.

text:Which color palette do you hate wearing?	labels:I hate mustard on myself, and also think black washes me out. My undertones are pretty neutral, and I like a lot of warm colors but certain ones are just too intense, like bright orange, mustard, neons.

I love the little Fossil watch that my husband bought me four years ago; but something about it is getting wonky, like it'll stop and start randomly and the second hand has fallen off twice.  It might be time to invest in a "forever watch" in the near future.     Edit:  The ultimate spurge would be a Chanel classic flap for my mom.  When I was in law school (and pretty broke), I gave my mom two Chanel lipsticks for Christmas and wrote in the card:  one day, this will be a bag.

When I was able to work remote full time I wore comfortable but cute clothes for me - definitely didn't want to fall into the day pajamas and night pajamas trap. I did a lot less ironing when I was dressing for me. I have an even harder time largely JUST going outside to go to work and run errands and THAT IS IT.

I've been wearing babydoll dresses because they hide my back brace and doc martins because they're comfy and I can get men to kneel before me (to tie them bc I cannot bend). Usually I dress more grunge though, like right now- I've got on thermal pj pants, a bleach stained baggy old sweater, and a tye-dyed sports bra.

I'm tall and in decent shape, but want that Hobbit look.  My wife wants me to dress better, I dress like a lumberjack. Our compromise is somewhere between a Hobbit and and Oxford professor, with maybe some Peaky Blinders influences.  I know I should go for tweed and fall colors, bit I have so little fashion sense that I don't actually know *what* to look for. Like what are they called? Frocks? Waistcoats? Tweed longcoats? Just "linen shirts"? "Collared shirt"? Any specific kinds of suspenders?  Does this mean I gotta pay for drycleaners now? What about a tailor?

Bending over, stairs and things like that aren't very easy either. Also it can get uncomfortable while lying on your bed in your hip area. But pros are worth it. It looks good, with dresses they serve as both top and bottom so no worrying about them matching. And the freedom down there is pretty cool too haha

I guess it was always fun to have "THE GOAL" bag, but after idolizing something for that long, I feel like it was inevitable for it to fall short of my expectations. I definitely need to re-evalute whether it's worth keeping, or just selling it.	labels:Just had that same anticlimactic moment with Chanel today >.< was obsessed with this boy bag for years, hunted it down, finally received it and honestly the leather on my old vintage Coach purse was far far superior and 3200$ less	episode_done:True

text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:I love ModCloth and have for years. When they were sold to Walmart, I was disappointed--but I kept shopping there. The plus-size options are fantastic. The customer service is always great, too. I once bought a dress to wear to a wedding, realized it was going to arrive too late, and called them; they immediately upgraded my shipping for free. I don't buy the most twee things they have, but as somebody else noted, they have lots of other clothes, too. Also, sometimes I just want a cute or funny graphic T to wear around the apartment. It's true that their prices can be way too high, but they have frequent 30 percent off sales; I usually wait for one of those before buying.  The quality can be a bit mixed, but their returns are super easy, and it's usually clear quickly when a certain garment isn't going to wash well.  Will ModCloth survive this? I hope so. I know it isn't for everyone. But it's one of the only online stores I know will always have something I like, in my size.

text:What pieces would you love "backups" of?	labels:Honestly just... clothes that I want to wear. It's always a challenge as a 6'5'' woman to find clothes that do, and the styles are usually so limited.  I have exactly one well-fitting navy turtleneck. It's wonderful, but it's from a Tall range that has been discontinued. Yes, there are other navy turtlenecks, but none that fit me. There are also plenty of Tall black turtlenecks out there, but wearing black just leaves me feeling drained.  Before I came out as trans I just used to wear guy clothes, and I could reliably find the same styles, year in, year out, at the same places for roughly the same price. Female fashion sucks sometimes. (And since I'm autistic too it can be realllly annoying when I can't get the clothes I'm used to anymore!)	episode_done:True

I have friends that wear the shorts but I don't know where they bought them.  : (  From what I've seen they're typically about 5 inches inseam.	episode_done:True
text:Messy eaters? Tell your stories and hacks / fixes.	labels:Why do extra work when you can just git gud at putting food in your mouth hole? Changing your wardrobe, carrying a bib, or changing clothes to eat is a bit silly of a solution to a problem that can be remedied by becoming less messy, no?    I'm sure that's not what anyone wants to hear, but I don't see this as markedly different than a child who has to learn to put away their toys. Messy eating isn't some genetic anomaly, you can simply exercise more control over how you eat. It may even be as simple as slowing down or leaning forward more over a table/desk.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:I'm in a ambivalent state of mind right now. For a like over a year now I have been into streetwear. Baggy, oversized clothes with lots of prints and branding. This was my first period of taking clothing serious and feeling "fashionable". But one can only see so many of the "same" outfits.  I grew really tired of streetwear in the last couple of weeks but I'm scared to leave my comfort zone. I'm 20 years old but feel like dressing like a teenager. I really really like graphic tees if the prints are well done and If I would imagine dressing like lets say Tim Dessaint for example, who is not into graphics/"crazyness" at all, It would feel too "mature" for my age if that makes sense.  But at the very same time, I feel like im dressing too childish when wearing cargo pants + graphic tee.  Am I overthinking this?

text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:I had bright blue Coraline hair for around 4 years (with a few months of pink or lavender intervals in that time) and it did actually change how I dressed.   I mostly wear black, with some grey and camel, but until I had blue hair I hadn't realized how many of my office tops were blue or blue patterns. I didn't like mixing the blue tones, so I ended up passing over all my blue clothes until I had pink or lavender hair again.  In my anecdotal experience, I felt like light pink went with nearly everything, but blue wasn't hard to fit into my (pretty neutral) style.

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:Honestly I think it's ok to shop fast fashion stores, as long as you don't do it with a fast fashion mindset. For me that means:  1. Only buying stuff that I really like, not setteling for stuff that are just kinda ok. 2. Reallize which stores work for you and which don't- for example most of my sweaters are from zara, but I won't order any jeans from them because of weird sizing/ fit. 3. I'd only avoid fast fashion when it comes to shoes/jewlery. After breaking many necklaces, losing earrings that wouldn't close properly, I was just done with it. Same with shoes.	episode_done:True

text:Penny loafers are a classic Ivy shoe; they were worn by a ton of students at colleges in the mid-20th century. they were considered  a youthful shoe then, and by now fewer younger people wear them. They're very cool if you want to explore the look though, or if you wear mainly basic stuff and want to maybe expand your aesthetic. I wouldn't worry about connotations of "maturity", as they're not a formal shoe- if you're interested in them, go for it! They have an interesting history and are a great addition to a more basic wardrobe.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:Clothes are never ever an investment. With the extremely few exceptions like Birkins and limited edition Chanel bags or stuff like that, it's not a thing.   Clothes will not retain their value and it's naive to think that you can buy something and expect to recoup more than half your money after *5 years* of wearing it. Especially since it's probably already a few years old when you buy it.  Pret a porter does not do as well as bags on the resale market. No one gives a shit that your old cardigan is designer because in another 5 years it will not only be worn out, it will be really outdated. If someone is paying hundreds for one single item, they're not buying worn from a collection 10 years ago AND still be willing to pay half the original price.

It took a while to find my confidence wearing it, but now that I've been wearing hats for several years it's really NBD, and it's become part of my standard uniform. If you find something trendy, you might find yourself having to chase trends instead of something you can make your own.  PS: Also sunscreen.	labels:Nice.

I've also spent more on import taxes and fees then on the product itself. how does that happen? Imported items are taxed on their original, non sale price. Nevermind that retail in Canada charges tax based on the price at the register, even if it's on sale.    And the Canadian companies that ship out of the US and charge insane shipping fees to Canada - if they can even ship to Canada at all can bite my arse! (looking at you Bite and Holotaco (though Bite ceased to be Canadian in the mid 2010s))

Women's clothes become outdated every 5 years for no good reason. Men can always wear straight leg jeans and t-shirts and their clothes are better quality and fit them, while finding outfits that fit around curves (actual curves, not just having a small toned instagram-small waist) is like playing 3-D tetris with your body	episode_done:True

But you know what I miss? SHOES. We don't wear shoes inside the house, so I rarely even put them on anymore. And there was a big part of being dressed down to my shoes and like... the stompy feeling of boots, and the clack of heels that made me feel like I was ready to take on the world -- definitely a contributor to good mental health.   I miss shoes. :(

text:In exactly the same position as you, uk weather, skint but want to look good.  So far I've found that choosing a good selection of colours to base your wardobe off works best (I like khaki-greens-blacks and browns) and then going from there. A solid pair of trousers in a style you like is always a good option too, I wear a pair of ripstop cargos almost everywhere, that usually helps you figure out what you like or dislike fit wise.   For example my cargos made me realise I like a more relaxed fit, but also made me appreciate something more fitted when I want to put more effort in, so I buy within those two criterias in the colours I like.  Also that link I_P_L posted is a good shout too.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I'm short, and one of the fashion guidelines I tend to read say to create long lines - this means avoiding ankle straps on shoes. I LOVE ankle straps on everything - heels, flats, sandals, etc. I definitely ignore this rule! Another rule I saw was to avoid the midi length since it can sometimes be too long but not long enough to be maxi. I wear my midi length skirts high-waisted so they fall at the right point and I love them. IDC if they make me look short, they're gorgeous!

text:The problem is "vanity sizing". A lot of brands, especially fast fashion brands, don't really use a standardized measurement like cm or inches. They just take a pair of pants and decide to give it a number that's smaller than its corresponding measurements, so people feel better about themselves. So even if you have a 36 inch waist, pants that say "32" are supposed to make you want to buy their pants, because they think consumers are stupid. It's one of the reasons why it's hard to find cheap pants that are sized consistently; all brands have their own system of vanity sizing.	labels:	episode_done:True

I think the rise of having one style you can't stray from comes from Instagram where influencers and bloggers have a Scandi-Chic wardrobe in grey and beige, or (on the other side of the spectrum), their wardrobe is full on colour, pattern, whimsy, etc. It's like there can be no in between.   I've fallen into this trap before looking at my closet, and feeling the need to give away anything that sort of falls outside my norm. I've regrettably given away pieces I wish I'd kept because of this line of thinking. Style is just as much what you wear as it is *how* you wear it.

I'm not very rich, I would struggle to afford a house in my expensive city, but I have dropped a few thousand on a suit - made with good materials by a local bespoke maker.  I think extreme wealth gaps are unsustainable, for sure, but dropping a few thousand on a suit every couple of years isn't much more than people spend on a computer, out drinking, or on games and gaming systems. For me, it's a hobby I get to wear.	labels:> it's a hobby I get to wear.  I think that viewpoint difference is the key.  Time and time again people discuss "value" and project their own versions of what that word even means.  You probably don't even need the "I get to wear" part.  What you're describing here should be the default justification (and end of the discussion) over buying clothes vs. being clothed.  Sure there's a large difference between those two things, but everyone will have to find their own point along that continuum.  And maybe hobbies themselves are unsustainable, but that's a systematic distinction rather than an individual one.

text:Really? Huh I guess I never noticed cuz any shrinkage I did notice after washing just stretched out again and was really only in the waist	labels:Yeah the good thing about a rigid cotton like denim is that it'll usually just stretch out again. I'm not a garment/materials expert but iirc it's similar to how even your regular Levis can shrink in the wash even though the fabric has obviously been soaked and bleached many times over.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever used eShakti?  I'm similar to the OP here and have had my eye on them, but am a bit wary of inflated hopes!!	labels:Yes, I have! I have multiple dresses from them. I was very happy with he purchase. I also ordered some for my mom and sister and sis in law and they all loved it. The customization options are amazing and you can really make something that is 100% your style. I get compliments on my eshakti dresses all the time. People are like : wow that fits you perfectly.  And it does because it was made for me. :)	episode_done:True
text:Dress Sneakers Are Alarmingly Popular	labels:I think that some shoes can fit well with a suit, and I prefer them (apart of the commodity etc) because you can still be formal looking with a pair of sneakers, they elevate the outfit and they shouldn't rest seriousness when someone is wearing them	episode_done:True
text:Wait these are out? In my area pretty much everyone is wearing athleisure (skinny leggings) or skinny jeans, but with everyone bundled up for winter I can't really tell much about the rise/other detailing.

text:Spring/Summer trends: Dresses	labels:I feel like ruffles or puff sleeves have been in, in some shape or form, for several years now. I prefer this year's iteration of it, but frankly, I don't really like it as a trend. I feel like it wants to give the drama of a big couture gown but just ends up looking a bit deflated and sad on the 1000th floral print mini dress.	episode_done:True
text:My 2020 Clothing Challenge	labels:Hey OP! Just thought I would drop in to share a bit of information about cashmere! You mentioned you have purchased a few scarves and had problems with pilling. It is my understanding that cashmere is very prone to pilling and this can happen even with the highest quality knits.    Since scarves experience a lot of rubbing and twisting, a bit of pilling is to be expected. You can just remove the pills and brush the knit to restore it's original appearance! The amount of pilling reduces over time (because you are basically removing all the loose fibres) so you might only have to do it once or twice.  Otherwise, wool or acrylic might actually be a better fabric choice for the scarf, they are more easy care :)

text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:I divide my wardrobe into two main categories - workwear (including going-out clothes too) and home wear (including clothes I'd wear to run errands but are not nice enough to wear to work.) Those are divided again into spring/summer and fall/winter (obviously there are overlaps, I'm ok with these.)   Dresses, blouses, blazers/jackets, skirts, and dress pants go on the hangers; tees, sweaters, and jeans are folded. Socks, underwears, and scarves go in the drawers. I also have a coat stand where I hang my worn-but-not-dirty clothes. I'm not super strict with the categorization, mostly because I have limited space, but I know where everything is and it works for me.	episode_done:True
text:So uh, what’s the trends for fall this year?	labels:I feel like I saw a lot of lace up leather tall boots when I was boot browsing Last night
text:Feel this. I think rings tend to have a lot more character than bracelets or necklaces, which tend to be just plain chains with replaceable charms. Rings, on the other hand, represent a kind of permanent, personal decision.	labels:Yes. Also something that I didn't mention is my location/surroundings. Men around me don't really use jewelry, so in a way I would be the one odd out. Sometimes I already dress a bit more flashy/different that your jeans and sneakers kind of guy so I fell that rings would putt additional attention on me, which is not always good.  Back in college I wore a basic af silver bracelet and I remember my female colleagues commenting on it, or my friends commenting  when I started wearing chelseas a few years ago. Both situations comments were positive which is good, but it tells that people aren't used to this kind of stuff. I can only imagine that rings would be 10x worse.

text:You're welcome, glad you liked it. I didn't come across Vuori while researching but someone else in the comments mentioned them too. Going off what I can see on the site they have some good sustainability goals and production standards they adhere to. I prefer a drawstring on the inside so I liked the Sunspel/Lulu pants for that reason. They advertise them as soft even though they're polyester so I imagine they're probably a brush back on the interior? Also looks like they don't have a gusset which can be nice for comfort/stretch on tighter pants (but not a requirement).  Do you know where they're made?	labels:Last I checked I think they were Vietnam; they're suuuper soft (in a good way) and I was surprised that I ended up wearing them more often than my Nike Tech Fleece or RC Midweights just because they're that much softer. I see your point about the drawstring being inside though.

Do you have any recommendations or are they local?!	labels:If you live anywhere with a diamond district or significant presence of local jewelers it's much cheaper to have things custom made; you'll pay far closer to the spot price of gold. The r/moissanite sub has a bunch of recommendations for e-jewelers who will be more competitive on price as well.

text:General Discussion - October 24	labels:I read Gear Patrol's site for the first time in a while and it's gone downhill.  e.g. I read an article about how you shouldn't by cloth bath mats because they can grow mold and bacteria...  Which goes on to suggest comparatively expensive wood slat bath mats, which can also grow mold and bacteria.  Another article in the same series derides slippers, and suggests wearing $400 Gucci loafers around the house instead....     The site's OG premise was about recommending "quality goods" and all that jazz, but I guess they bought into their own bullshit and now conflate $$$$$$ w/ "Quality"  (Additionally, an anti-cold brew article in the same series as the others .references James Hoffman, a effete British snob who I would gladly kick down the never-ending stairs from Super Mario 64.)

text:Good quality men's jeans?	labels:> * The crotch tearing (this one's a reoccurring theme) * The dye running onto white shoes (probably the cheapest pair I've had has done this) * The jeans losing their shape/fit and turning loose  1. This happens when your thighs rub together and there's not enough fabric slack there. You may want to try sizing up at the thigh. Also, get a few pairs and rotate so that each pair only sees a third or a quarter of the wears instead of one pair getting it all.  2. This is called crocking, where indigo flakes off/falls off when abraded against something else. That's part of indigo, whether you're talking about jeans, jean jackets, etc. You can help remove excess dye with a wash and try a magic eraser on your shoes.  3. That's normal. The warp/weft weave will stretch out like a sweater after each wear, becoming noticeable in time. Wash them when they get too out of shape.

text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:The people in the comments on this thread are kind of... The OP is asking how looking at a garnment in a website, how you can gauge if it has quality.  The majority of websites don't list anything other than fabric composition and have a page on the company's ethics, which is likely filled with lies (EVERLANE, which many "ethics' conscious people were duped with bought)). Also, expecting the majority of people to research on said ethics, when most don't even read that ethics' page is being out of touch with reality.  This person is making an effort than the majority of people don't do. To which some respond with condescending remarks?	episode_done:True

text:What does "looks like a lesbian" mean? Why is a straight or bisexual man not only expressing what that is, but then assigning a negative value to that look?	labels:I've seen many people express what a lesbian looks like. There is even a lesbian fashion subreddit on reddit (which i follow), plus different lesbian types (fem,  alpha, ect), and you can also find many" lesbian fashion starter packs" on reddit that include things like wearing oversized clothes, rolling your sleeves, the short sleeve button up, the eyebrow with the slit in it, funky earrings, rainbow, carabiners. With associating a negative value i can't comment because I see it the same as him stating he doesn't like "tomboy", "egirl", or "goth", it's just not what he likes in a sex partner

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 12, 2020	labels:Hey guys, I'm looking into oversized tops. It won't be the bulk of what I wear but maybe a few pieces would be cool. I read that oversized is actually a design and items should be marketed as "oversized" or "easy fit", instead of just buying what is meant to be a straight or slim fit in a larger size. Is that true in your experience (for those that are into the whole oversized thing)? What else should I look out for to see if something can be worn oversized or not?

There's a rich knitting and yarn crafting history there, and some of the work can be very delicate and beautiful.   For extra cold days, I'd recommend silk thermal undergarments. The silk should keep you warm, and any wool trousers from getting too static-y.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:Planed obsolescence comes in to play. If the trend is over for the next season why make it last a year?  and adding to that is the cost of investment to change trends is higher for women with more possibilities with sizes and lot's of  inventory for each size. So the "Value"is in the changing for companys because it increases consumption but men don't have that.  For them if it falls apart or feels cheap they don't buy it and a shirt can last every season XD. So if it falls apart after a couple of months they are more likely to change brand for something of higher quality.  >>  >The lack of consumption and brand loyalty can lead to increase in quality with lack of differences and change cutting cost.	episode_done:True

The style was a little dated but I carried it for years because I was broke and working in fashion.   &#x200B;  I just got my first real designer bag - a Chloe - for Christmas last year from my fiance, at age 32. We share a bank account and a business together so all of our money is made and shared by both of us, but I could never spend that much on myself. He knew that I had always dreamed of a Chloe bag, but didn't have a specific one in mind. He read up a ton and picked out black Chloe Faye bag for me, which makes it even more special.	episode_done:True

text:Ever been censored at work because of what you wear?	labels:Im a former teacher and as an older lady I still wanted to wear what I felt was appropriate. So I wore a skirt to school that was high but not unprecedented among the teachers. I get a call from the assistant principal calling me in during my lunch break and she said my skirt was "inappropriate". I was in my 60s when this happened. I explained that among teachers in the school my skirt height was within code but she wasn't having it. So I changed into a lower skirt. Meanwhile students and staff who were actually breaking the dress code didn't get any punishment. In other instances they censored one form of political speech for another form when the rules clearly stated that "all political clothing is prohibited". Its very frustrating.
text:Creating your own clothes: Advice?	labels:Definitely start by getting a used sewing machine and just learning the basics of sewing, first try tailoring your own stuff or making really simple things like pillow covers or masks and then try something more complicated like a shirt (and while I always prefer to make my own patterns, I recommend starting out with ones you can buy or find online). Even if you don't plan to do most of the manufacturing yourself, it'll still be vital for you to understand the process.	episode_done:True

My uniform is solid thin knit sweaters and straight leg pants. On the weekend I replace pants with jeans.  Use the other time to play around or wear your onesies and uggs.  I'm hitting this point myself, not so much as f-it entirely, but I want to wear more things ***I*** like and not worrying about if I look like 2017 Pinterest threw up on me, or a midwestern mom, or whatever other out of fashion term is cool at the moment.  One thing I always look at or check is "Is what I'm wearing appropriate for the occasion or place I'm going?" If it is and I like it then screw it this is what I'm wearing, I'm comfortable and I like it.  Is it going to get me photographed walking down the street?

text:When will I be "too old" to look cute, cool, hip, whatever?	labels:Your tastes will likely change as you experience new things in life. I personally like 18th century fashions (except the wigs, screw that!) Feel free to experiment with what ever draws your fancy. You're going to draw more attention if you piece stuff together more so than if you "chase a fashion." I make some of my own clothes and those draw way more interest than anything I buy in a store.  When you are older, if you clothes are still in decent shape and they fit, keep wearing them. The "young people" will likely be wearing totally different stuff by then anyway, or not. That said, IMO young people clothing hasn't changed much since the early 90s.	episode_done:True

I fixed it by putting baking soda in both shoes and then sticking them in the freezer for a week or so. It killed all the bacteria and they are good as new now.	episode_done:True

text:Sorry you feel that way. When I wrote it, I tried to convey that I didn't put much thought into what I wore. Perhaps I could have said pajama bottoms with RRL cardigans. I don't have a perfect description for it, but I do think that the style Andrew is wearing there is a lot more coherent. I think there are ways to do that style thoughtfully, and not randomly. I didn't write this with the intention of making people feel unhappy with their current wardrobe. Just trying to give suggestions on how they may get enjoyment from clothes, even when confined to home.	labels:Hey man huge fan. DWW has been a game changer for me and the way I dress and I've been following it religiously for a verrrrrrry long time. Absolutely love your recent article "America's Other Button Down" in particular. Hope you have a great night and looking forward to what you put out next!    And if you have any more California Sunshine and Noir or Western shirt inspo please feel free to send it my way ;)
text:What’s your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:Remember DeLiAs catalogs?
text:I don't know, I think you'll find that anywhere. If you're wearing a lot of jewellery you're probably in the minority outside of fashion circles.   My girlfriend wears a lot of jewelry, rings specifically. I guess it rubbed off on me over the pandemic since we mostly see only each other. The first few times I met coworkers I got comments but it didn't bother me - it felt more like they were the odd ones out because at home we're wearing jewelry almost constantly. I'd say now is the perfect time to start if you've got money to spend because you can get comfortable with it on your own terms.	labels:I agree to an extent, but what I meant is that some places are just more forgiving on this aspect, specially big cities or countries. I feel that in places like London or such, nobody would bat an eye.   This is of course me being a little bitch about it. But I'll try to dip a little bit on this
text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:A couple of years ago I was feeling this way - kind of stylistically adrift, generally discontented about my look but unsure of where I wanted to go with it - and I ended up buying The Curated Closet book and found it SO helpful. If you've got some spare cash and the interest, it's definitely worth buying, as it has a fantastic, non-judgmental of helping you discover what you love and what makes you feel great (as opposed to what "looks good" or "flatters"). However, the thing that helped me the most was taking outfit photos of what I wore every day for a few weeks. Looking back over them helped me see what styles, cuts, and colors felt like me and made me happy, but also, knowing I was going to take a picture kept me from wearing jeggings and a milk-stained tee (I had a five month old at the time).	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else have “irony pieces”?	labels:I wear a lot of black, androgynous, clean/modern lines, but I do have one or two fifties/sixties vintage pieces that I love (a gorgeous coat and a dress). They go with nothing else in my closet and feel more like costume pieces at this point, so I'm not sure they're really "irony pieces" so much as manifestations of my suppressed inner femme. I do need to figure out how to wear that coat more though.	episode_done:True

Why would they bring that back? It was terrible the first time around!" and *realized I sounded like my mother*.

text:All-time favorite cold weather pieces?	labels:I love Falke wool tights for winter, and I have pairs that have lasted me ten years. For fun tights and socks, Hansel from Basel are solid quality.  Seconding the love for La Canadienne and Blondo boots, and adding Wanderlust and Martino Canada to the list.   I have Reynaud Phenomenon, so my hands and feet are always cold. Merino or silk glove liners and sock liners make all the difference. If you buy conductive thread, you can make any glove layer touchscreen compatible with just a little darning.

text:I've been looking on the local version of Craigslist for music gear recently and I found this one guy selling a ton of guitars "with the possibility to exchange for instruments that need a loving hand". Looks like restoring peoples' instruments is his hobby. I thought it was quite interesting - I'm almost tempted to buy something just so I can go and ask him about what he does and see what he's working on.  If you like the restoration aspect and don't plan to play it you could consider restoring it and then trading it for something else. Trade your way up to something really special that you want to keep.	labels:IF the guy implies apathy with me trading it, I'll probably trade it for a bass.        IF I'm guilted for thinking about trading, I might commission someone to make me a 30" short scale neck that'll fit on the strat.

text:What’s your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:Born in '96 so I really didn't get to experience 90s fashion, and I've been loving it. I feel late 2010s were heavily inspired by it, but recently 2000s trends have taken over and that just reminds me of elementary and middle school haha.  As for the trends you listed:  Love: Platform shoes, but more for boots and loafers. I'm not against platform sandals I just haven't found any that I've been drawn to. Love corduroy, love plaid pants.  Neutral/Like: Holographic, Neon, Metallic, Tie dye - I like these but I don't really want anything from it  Not a fan: Wide leg. I am such a skinny pant girl. I do enjoy a boyfriend jean now and then though, so I think I'm just really picky.	episode_done:True
text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:The oldest Millennials are pushing age 40, so they have different style needs than teenagers.

But this has always been the difference between older and younger generations.	episode_done:True

text:yeah the camosun might have been a slightly better fit for me. I am pretty happy with my radsten anyway, but wouldn't go any colder with it then the weather in vienna rn. When ordering I was afraid that the camosun would be too warm, which I think it could also very well be. So I chose the one where I thought that it would maybe be a bit too cold instead of too warm and having to sweat. I think that I might pick up a good fleece or thermal underlayer and that should do the trick for the cold days. :)	labels:That's a really good point!  I only start to wear the camosun around 0 degrees and have other lighter coats for above that. Really depends on what your needs are, since winter in Canada can get a bit more extreme than austria.

text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:Any time I see people being told to only wear 1 surplus piece per fit to avoid costume territory I wonder if I ever look like I'm cosplaying. Like I do wear full camo on occasion and I'm about to have a three-piece flecktarn set, but it's always very clearly just fashion and not "you're talking to a future soldier"-core right? Please say yes, I need the affirmation cause the only nice jawns I can afford come from fucking with surplus.      Also because I'm mad young and Finland has mandatory service for all males I do have a year of service in my future. Don't really have a strong opinion on that, but I do wonder if my stance on surplus and militant clothes will change after that (if I'm even wearing surplus at that point).

You might catch yourself setting certain outfits aside, and those are key moments to train yourself to look out for. When you find yourself doing it, make a choice.

It sculpts surprisingly well to my body and is hella comfy, two things I've never seen in womens jeans simultaneously. Also the right underwear makes a HUGE difference.A good bra that fits is hella important and I've heard thongs do wonders for tighter fitting jeans or bottoms.

text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:So I began sewing a year ago and now almost my entire wardrobe is handmade. I previously would have said I have no distinct style/label, but now I know that my style ks more just a group of proportions I like - I love high waisted pants, I love denim, I love really over the top loose, blousy and structural tops, I love relaxed dresses, I love overalls. It means I don't have a tagine or catch phrase I can use to describe my style, but my wardrobe is super coherent and everything feels very *me* and I even have friends pointing out pieces or outfits and say "oh this looks like an effervescent banana outfit!" So yeah, I don't think your *personal style* needs to be a particular genre, sometimes it can be a bit more abstract than that while still being very specific to your tastes	episode_done:True

A mess doesn't even begin to describe the situation all partners involved in the process were in!	labels:Oh word. It NEEDS to change. Fast fashion is hurting everyone, and I don't see how it's benefiting the consumer at all, it's very chasing your tail.  Begging the China office to produce a 40 thousand unit order based on a vague promise from a retailer in 4 weeks is just not workable long term, nor can a designer churn out new and original ideas in such a short space of time without resorting to straight up knockoffs or pushing your body and soul far past what is healthy. Such a mess, and so nice to hear someone from the sales end agreeing that this shit is essed up.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:I'm in a ambivalent state of mind right now. For a like over a year now I have been into streetwear. Baggy, oversized clothes with lots of prints and branding. This was my first period of taking clothing serious and feeling "fashionable". But one can only see so many of the "same" outfits.  I grew really tired of streetwear in the last couple of weeks but I'm scared to leave my comfort zone. I'm 20 years old but feel like dressing like a teenager. I really really like graphic tees if the prints are well done and If I would imagine dressing like lets say Tim Dessaint for example, who is not into graphics/"crazyness" at all, It would feel too "mature" for my age if that makes sense.  But at the very same time, I feel like im dressing too childish when wearing cargo pants + graphic tee.  Am I overthinking this?

text:I agree!  I'm short enough that they fit me like proper pants.    I accidentally bought a pair of mid-rise dress pants, and I feel so uncomfortable in them.    And related to low-rise, I don't think I'll ever be able to tuck my shirts into my pants.  I've seen this trend with turtlenecks, sweaters, t-shirts, but outside of a button down shirt under a suit, I can't do it.  The extra fabric makes me feel bunchy, and then it comes right out when you move anyway.	labels:	episode_done:True

Doesn't look out of place when i throw it on top of my business suit, but also functionally well enough to withstand the occasional snowstorms.	labels:How warm is the Herno?

text:I agree with this mindset wholeheartedly. Fashion is an incredibly expensive hobby for me, personally, and I let it be because I can afford it now, but you can absolutely build a wardrobe off of thrifting and purchasing secondhand clothes.

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:For white shoes, I clean and/or replace the laces fairly often. Some dirt will stay caked into folds on white shoes no matter how well you clean them but a fresh pair of white laces really makes them look cleaner. I like to wash the laces when they get dirty by taking them off the shoe and soaking them in cold water with dish soap and then rubbing them in my hands before drying them in the sunlight. There's probably better ways to do it. I replace them when they're permanently gray, even after washing.   I've heard of people stripping white fabric shoes to get the shoes back to bright white but that seems like a bad idea since you have to soak them in hot water. Has anyone done that?

If you are looking for pleather pants and want the \*nicest\* pair you can get, these might be that.	labels:Thank you for this. These are currently en route to me.

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.

text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:There's something between form fitting and loose fitting and it's skimming the body. This looks more like that.   Skim fit can include looser fit items that aren't intended to be overly baggy but aren't intended to be skin tight. u/amelisha is describing this well, but also think about Audrey Hepburn and Jackie O and how their clothes fit them. They weren't skin tight. They were skim tight. Aka as "fitted."  We don't see that as often today with stretch being built into every fabric, and tailoring (beyond hemming) being rare.	episode_done:True

I can't wait to wear dress up clothing again for public consumption. I am thinking through how I can get more fancy and bike friendly stuff!

We are missing those ocassions to look forward to, so I am imagining two zones for fashion 2021 - luxe basics for being at home and maximalist things for going out.

Granted, I'm 5'11" 180#, so the size of an average dude. I wear a size 12 in women's pants.   "Unisex" in t-shirts really means men's, so you can start there on sizes. With your build, you might have to fix sleeves and pants lengths to be shorter. For pants, I think it depends on how your hips are shaped and the cut of the pants. If you have wide hips and/or a bigger butt compared to your waist, go with that measurement. If you're more straight through the waist and hips, you have some leeway.	episode_done:True

I don't have a super-great grasp on what the formality levels are going to be at work yet, but I'm definitely hoping to get some great all-weather boots, some super warm leggings for non-work or work from home wear. The new job comes with a promotion so I'm going to need a few suits and some wool dress slacks for work (for those days when it's just too cold for anything else!).  I'm thinking a lot about velvet and knit and texture, trying to do longer (and warmer!) skirts than my usual pencil skirt without looking girlish or dowdy... and trying not to splurge on every coat known to man (four wool coats and a cape isn't too-too much, right?)

text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:I am in my 30s and I have always just followed what is on trend/in style at the moment and I have always dressed very casually in an urban street wear/basic feminine sort of style.  However my clothes are better cared for than they were when I was younger and I now have separate lounge wear and outdoor wear.  When I would wear my outdoor clothing every single day until I went to bed from the time I woke up it would fall apart/fade/pill much quicker.  By the time I am fed up with a piece of clothing it's usually still in reasonable condition despite most of my wardrobe coming from H&M and New Yorker which is standard high street quality.   I am a size L/XL and I feel that fashion is more size inclusive nowadays than it was when I was younger.  I have been chubby for most of my life and I feel more included in fashion now than I ever did.   I mean it must be much harder still for plus size women (I'm considered mid size) but even when I was younger I feel like my body wasn't catered for as much when it came to on trend pieces.	episode_done:True

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I have gone through a hellish 2020 - I moved across the country, separated/am in the middle of a divorce, quit drinking alcohol (I'm sober six months!), didn't get the promotion I wanted (stupidly my fault, was too depressed/distracted to apply), never mind COVID and all that comes with that.  I am trying to be kind to myself despite it all, and I am saving for my first luxury designer bag! I have owned mid-tier level bags like Coach, Dooney and Bourke, etc. but I think my first real luxury bag will be the Louis Vuitton Speedy 30 (classic). I'm still deciding if I will give it to myself as a Christmas present :) I'm in my late twenties and I think it is a classic enough style that I will still like it even as I get older. I also like that it can be dressed up or down - I've seen pictures of people wearing it with dresses and heels, as well as with sweats and a tee-shirt, and it looks good either way. Some people even bring it to work!

text:Shitpost Saturday: What do your shoes say about you?	labels:Damn, bitch, you old. My old lady dr scholl's shoes that I wear to work 95% of the time don't understand how I am in fact not 80 years old and do not in fact have a broken hip. They see their brothers and sisters in the closet and scream, "she cares not for you loafers, boots, and fashionable sneakers, for she only cares for this 1.5 in cushiony bottom that keeps pep in her step all day!"	episode_done:True
text:Hi everyone. What are some relatively unknown or startup luxury brands you love?	labels:Somebody (here i think) recommended Ernst Leoty for activewear.  The fabric and design are great but the fit is tricky.  I'm a 36ddd and their bra cups don't fit in an XL (spilling out) but the garment ribcage was loose.  They're made for small busted bodies but I may buy something without a fitted bra top because I really liked the pieces.	episode_done:True

text:Discussion: Clay Jewelry?	labels:I'm really not a fan of modern clay jewelry that I find on etsy/IG, but it's because it seems to be "let's attach every shape to this earring that we can" and I'm just not a huge fan of that style. I don't like when an earring weighs so much that it makes my earlobes sag, and I don't really like mismatched shapes and colors on an earring. I tend to go for clay jewelry studs instead, though they seem to be much rarer.

text:>I give people the benefit of the doubt and assume they're trying to give a compliment but just chose the wrong words. Certainly "You look nice today" or "That's a great outfit" are more appropriate. But I think some people feel asking "why?" is somehow safer.

text:Fair, but if you look at the shoulders and arms of the clothes on the slimmer women, you can tell most of them were probably bought in the straight sizes and made to be oversized. And OP included a lot of plus size women, who are often think or are told that this kind of style makes them look frumpy- they all look fantastic here and I hope some people are inspired	labels:Yeah I wasn't trying to say OP was guilty of this but in general some people who really get into the oversized clothing aesthetic (I edited to specify more so with thrift shopping which affects poor plus sized people more) can sometimes take options away from people and it's something to be mindful of.	episode_done:True

Im a social worker so it's perfect. Kind of business casual but super fun. Also i love dinosaurs so much.

They both still hold up extremly well. I can also really vouch for A kind of Guise, Asket & Ebbets Field Flannels.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 17, 2020	labels:My sister got me a Ralph Lauren Polo cashmere sweater a couple years ago, and I was under the impression it needed to be dry cleaned so I had it set aside from my regular laundry... but it somehow got mixed in with my dress shirts. I ran them on an "eco warm" cycle of water on permanent press, but realized the mistake to my horror before putting them all in the dryer, luckily.  The label says it is machine washable but says to place it in a garment bag and flip it inside out in cold water. Obviously I did none of those things - I just put it through the wash in warm water along with other garments. I didn't flip it inside out and the water was warm (but not hot).   However, it doesn't appear to have shrunk and looks OK to my eyes. I have it laying flat on some towels right now to dry. Is there any way I can tell if the material was damaged at all? I feel bad, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed I didn't mess it up too badly.  Thanks!

text:Can I see your casual natural-fabric outfits?	labels:Consider shopping for trousers at lapolicegear dot com - they have hundreds of styles of very sturdy clothes ,shirts too, many of which are 100 % cotton. If you can tolerate ~2% synthetic that's pretty popular too.   Other brands to consider are duluth trading company, and carhartt. High or full organic content, super long wearing, and able to handle rural living. I had a pair of carhartt jeans from 2003 ish that never wore out, i just gave them away in 2015 because I stopped wearing jeans, but they were still structurally nearly perfect.	episode_done:True

text:I'm Not a Watch Guy I Swear - Street x Sprezza	labels:Maybe some watch or ex watch peeps can give their opinion on this. I'm reaching a big life goal early next year and wanted to get something to remind myself of the last year or so of my life. A Casio F-91w has been my daily driver for a watch and sometimes I feel like it looks a bit out of place in my more casual menswear fits. I was thinking of getting a 1950s Omega, I wear a lot of  vintage clothing and that watch / date just sort of feels right with my getup. It's a big purchase, but a local watch store here sells maintained ones and can service them... On the fence a bit.

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:The clothes on the runway are designed to represent, as closely as possible, the idea and sentiment that the designer is using to inspire the new line.  It's analogous to the Platonic ideal. Because the ideas can be so abstract, so too must the clothes. In fact, you can think of it as a series of progressive dilutions, from the designer's mind, to the runway, and then to the clothes that you wear in your day-to-day.
text:>eta: yes, I also watch entirely too much of them I feel slightly embarrassed  I'm honestly at the point where I start rewatching videos because I've watched them all. >\_> Starting on Cathy Hayes, now, who is also awesome.	labels:Cathy Hay is an absolute treasure, I just finished my entry for her website Foundations Revealed's annual competition. Sewstine is also brilliant but she does more straight up historical sewing than historybounding but her work is incredible, Abby Cox is the same but does really informative videos about fashion history and deep dives into the construction of antique clothes.

text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:I think it's worth noting that even when you get flairs of the past decades, it's going to be *exactly* like the decade itself. We might have elements of the 2000s with wider pant legs, brighter colors, etc. but I don't think the decade will be a mirror image of the 2000s. Besides too many women don't want low rise jeans lol
text:Formula for a put together outfit that works for most aesthetics	labels:That's an interesting idea, though I think it's not 100% accurate. One can look really chic wearing very simple clothes if the clothes are a good fit and good quality, and if the person's hair looks great (doesn't have to be elaborately styled, just a good cut and clean hair is enough). Also, I think wearing loud statement pieces is not as easy as just limiting them to certain number. You'll still need to think if they go well together.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 23, 2020	labels:Do you feel like social media (possibly over-accessibility in general) "ruined" things you otherwise like because it seems to cheapen everything? Ex. every look turning into a meme. Or is that it all never actually mattered in the first place and this idea that you knew about stuff on the low was utterly meaningless to begin with? Kinda like every kid in the neighborhood suddenly became privy to "your" private swim spot.   Maybe it's the association of all of it. I feel like this big shift has occurred, especially in the last 2-3 years where the kids who rock vineyard vines have found themselves getting their "street style" on or rich girls who wish they were indie chicks compensate by wearing bucket hats and only using film cameras.  Still organizing my thoughts around this.. going through a fashion identity crisis atm.

text:General Discussion - December 26, 2020	labels:I just realized I am having a shoe identity crisis. Not all outfits work with boots, but my trousers selection has shifted a lot and no longer works with sneakers (or maybe I just don't like sneakers anymore). At least most of the time I end up changing my pants because I don't know what shoes to wear. And it's holding me back. I've never been a huge fan of derbies, especially black derbies because I associate them with school uniform shoes, and I'm forbidden to wear sandals. So now I don't know what to do. More types of boots? Buy nice derbies and see if I like them? Accept that all outfits go with boots? shrug

text:How Carhartt A Billion-Dollar Brand	labels:I've noticed a definite quality difference in materials from a few years ago to now in the few canvas pieces I've handled. The older Mexican made canvas jackets have a heavier weight, more substantial feeling canvas with richer colors on the dyes and a more sturdy feeling rib for the cuffs and hem vs the more recent made in india ones I've handled at the local store.   Also, I'm super dissapointed in that they've changed how they cut the detroit jacket, making it longer with a dropped back tail vs the older cropped model, but apparently they chaged it due to large scale input from workers wearing their products on job sites, so, I understand why they've done it.	episode_done:True

They're now the only jeans I have that don't have a hole between the thighs, and it's way to cold were air live to be outside in leggings right now, so I wear them almost every time I have to leave the house.  I don't think they look good on me, and they're slightly cropped so I have to wear big thick socks to keep my ankles warm. They're that awkward not-quite cropped, not full length type business. Oh, and they're also a size too big, so I constantly have to pull them up?   Why did I buy these??	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 20, 2020	labels:Thanks for all the help recently guys! I was wondering what is generally meant when people say "black pants", for more casual wear. That's just dark wash jeans, correct?  I have blue jeans that are a little big on me now and gray jeans that are an okay fit - I feel a little weird buying black jeans now, too.
text:Brands that are actually great that you discovered on Instagram?	labels:I kept seeing the Thistle and Spire snake (Medusa) bodysuit on Instagram so I gave in and bought the bralette and panty set and I LOVE IT.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 24, 2020	labels:I know when mixing suits, one is supposed to aim for similar fabrics. What typically pairs well with linen?  I recently became enamored with a pair of linen trousers on iTailor and think they would look good paired with a double-breasted coat (either gray or dark blue/navy), but I'm having trouble finding one in linen for a reasonable price, so I may need to expand my search to other fabrics.
text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:My very first one was a red  Badgley Mischka (apparently eel skin) that I got off eBay for $7.  This was back in the day when actions didn't take off like they do now.  It ended up being an orange toned red and went with NOTHING.  I tried selling it, but not very hard.  &#x200B;  Then I got "into" fashion a bit.  I got a little Donald J Pliner clutch (tags still in the bag) for $12.  And a used black Coach bag for $80.  I adore the Coach bag, it's really heavy and my first SOLID bag.  It taught me a lot about accessories pulling an outfit together, oddly the bag was what got me started into the world of perfumes (then indie perfumes).  &#x200B;  Obviously, I have no issue with buying used/thrifting/ebay/poshmark.  The majority of my "nice" clothes are all secondhand.  I'm fairly sure even when I do get another bag it'll be used again.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 08	labels:I recently got into biker leather jackets, but I read that you gotta drop at least $400 on a decent real leather jacket. I wouldn't be opposed to it, but my two main concerns are that:  1. The biker jacket aesthetic may not stick with me in the long run (even though I think they're super cool since a few months ago) 2. I'm currently at 160lbs and plan on bulking to 170lbs. I'm concerned that the jacket will be too tight in the shoulders, arms, and chest and I can no longer wear it.  I also understand that faux leather jackets are of inferior quality compared to real leather jackets, but it's also at a lower price point. Those things considered, is it worth buying a faux leather jacket over a real leather jacket? If not, what things should I consider while shopping for second-hand leather jackets?

text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:A few years ago, I had recently gotten a promotion and wanted to dress a bit fancier. I went a bit ham on Old Navy's pixie pants. I bought some really fun colours, mustard yellow, light pink, floral patterns, pastel blue, etc.   I used to style them primarily with black, dark, grey, white, chambray tops/blouses.  I grew bored of this phase and went back to blue jeans, but it was a fun experiment for the summer time! Especially when I didn't want to wear a dress, but still wanted to look fun but work appropriate.	episode_done:True

text:Ok. It's a tough question since dressing "better" is highly subjective and you should wear whatever you think is looking nice. Dress "older" doesn't sound like something you should aim for imo. How old are you?   If you want to dress more timeless perhaps, I'd say aim for regular fits. Skinny jeans is a great example of something that is not timeless. Go try a pair of Levi's 501, preferably from a vintage store since their older jeans are incomprehensiby better than their new ones. Regular fit, meaning not skinny, slim nor baggy, is always the most timeless fit you can go for.   Get a bunch of non-branded sweaters, sweatshirts, t-shirts, shirts (flannels, OCBD, denim, chambray, whatever you like). There's nothing wrong with brands and branding but some brands are more timeless than others. You can't go wrong with a Nike or a Champion sweatshirt. White sneakers from Converse is something that will never be out of style.  I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for.	labels:	episode_done:True

Prices are good, quality is good, and the return policy is amazing. I've been surprised with the quality of Kirkland brand leggings and tops and I've been able to restock my wardrobe with coats, basics, and work from home outfits (mostly leggings!) for very cheap. Recently got a plush, warm, long robe for only $9! And there are good online deals pretty regularly as well. They also have lower prices on designer clothing/purses/perfumes/make-up.

Make no mistake, I love a good suit, and I wear them regularly - but it definitely is the outfit worn by the greatest terrorists and mass murderers on earth. Maybe it's time we let politicians express themselves.

text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:A few tips that work for me in thrift stores: - I pick one section and don't feel like i have to check out the entire store.  - I go through racks and touch everything and stop when I touch something that feels like a nice fabric - silk, cashmere, good wool, crisp cotton. This helps me get to the nice stuff when the racks are visually overwhelming. - try on lots of things! Sometimes you fall in love with stuff you didn't expect to.   On websites that are searchable: - have a very specific item in mind or a specific brand you like - narrow the search results by size, brand, color, and fabric - pay attention to the measurements to see if things will fit - don't be afraid to make low offers on sites where you can do that  I find online thrifting very different than in-store thrifting, because online, you can search for all kinds of specific things, where in a store, most of the fun comes from finding something unexpected.

A character from a clockwork orange, because I got to dress like a hoe while still looking like the nerd I am. I wore a white bodysuit, white fishnets, doc martens, a boiler hat, a cane, and I had fake eyelashes on one eye!  3. Sexy Christmas elf, I thought it was so funny to have a Christmas costume on halloween and I glued bells to the end of my skirt to be as annoying as possible

Barnes and Noble always used to have a really diverse set of fashion magazines available, including ones from other countries.

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:For one thing, I'd say having a pretty serious budget and space constraint means I don't feel comfortable experimenting with buying clothes that might not work for me. I mean, beyond something that obviously doesn't fit and you just return it. I've been wanting to explore a slightly different style for a few years, but I don't want to buy new things.  I'd also say a lot of my current style comes from clothes that just happened to come to me. A friend of mine used to work at a laundry company so he'd sometimes bring home clothes that never got picked up. They had pretty wealthy clients so a lot of the clothes were really nice, and these are some of the nicest pieces I own. It might not be what I'd pick if I were shopping in a store, and they don't all fit as intended, but I do love them.	episode_done:True

The clothing swap would be at a bar in the area, you could get drinks (friend of friend is a bar tender) and go through the clothing on the tables. You could choose to drop off clothes and take nothing, you could choose to give away nothing and take stuff and anything else in-between. Most people came with stuff and left with different items. Everything left over at the end of the night was donated.   I LOVED going to these swaps. I got so many awesome things and it was a great way to give away things that I was no longer interested in wearing.

While I do take these lessons to heart, I do "dress like a hobo" most days, (sweatpants and a graphic tee,) because nice clothes are expensive and thrift stores aren't safe, (and I like to try on my clothes, so online isn't really an option.)	episode_done:True

text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:To be honest, most even slighty heavy-weight fabrics (and by that I mean cotton and heavier) would be fine. You just don't want them to get blown up and get wind trapped into them. I personally prefer short skirts with wool, possibly patterned tights underneath as I think long skirts just look a little too heavy and dark with dark tights underneath, although that is definitely a preference. Anyway, as long as your tights are thick enough, the skirt material shouldn't really have any impact on staying warm! For a really winter-y look, you could maybe look into wool skirts, but I don't think those are a necessity.

It's just my hair color now, you know? I do tend to wear a lot of blacks and greys, but I think it works just as well with my red plaids or a whole spectrum of t-shirt colors.	episode_done:True

ThredUp doesn't have a great return policy, and you can't request additional pictures from the seller like you could on a direct sales site like depop or poshmark.

If it's a bright color, or any pattern, or even blue jeans (don't wear them often), I get all kinds of comments ranging from surprise to passive agressive insult to over-exhuberant compliment. Don't even get me started on accessories or hairstyle.  It makes me so self-conscious.   Just once, it would be nice to hear, "I like your outfit," and that be the end of it.

I've been trying to pin fashion and style again, and I find I really miss the website Polyvore.  I never used it, but the ease with which other people made outfits and shared them meant that there was always something new to pin.    I follow a few fashion bloggers who seem to be popular, but I sometimes forget the work that goes into doing a blog post, styling things just right, taking the photos, etc.  Not to mention buying the clothes!  With that old Polyvore website, users were pushing out complete outfits everyday.  I hope something like that comes back around again soon, because I found the flat lay design of the pins easy to identify with.

Because we weren't any of us born knowing how to style.
text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:I learned nothing from my mom - not that she didn't try, but that she had no sense of style.  She was a plus-sized woman raising a plus-size daughter in a time where plus-size fashion was not a thing. Muumuus and ill-fitting pant suits everywhere! She's very much a believer in wearing shapeless, baggy fabrics and that plus-size women should hide everything. I can't go clothes shopping with her, I can't trust her judgement.   She's good at applying makeup, but bad at choosing shades and types that look good on her, so I ran away from the orange lipstick and green eyeshadow and didn't ask her for help.  She's had exactly 2 hairstyles in her life: the giant 60s beehive and then short perm'ed curls. Long hair is a mystery to her so I never learned the art of ponytails, buns, braids, anything like that.  I didn't make a lot of female friends until the end of high school and we didn't bond over clothes and makeup and they just couldn't understand why I didn't know any of these things.	episode_done:True

text:Everyone’s opinions on Youtube fashion channels?	labels:I enjoy the ones who do hauls from common shopping stores such as Walmart and Target. If they share something I've been looking for I'll check out the price to see if it's in my budget. It helps me build a list of affordable items that I could use but don't yet have. My wardrobe is very worn and dated so I need a lot of basic pieces that won't break the bank but can still be great staples.	episode_done:True

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:I have a pair of platform doc martens  (~$140) in a deep maroon that I love, I haven't been brave enough to wear them to work yet (white collar, no dress code, just feels a little weird), but I wear them everywhere else. Shoes and jewelry are my top high cost items. Real leather shoes last forever. My bf got me a simple bezel set diamond necklace for graduating and I wear that with everything too  Tbh quality fabrics (linen, silk, leather etc.) are worth the cost, but 'name brands' aren't. Goodwill, or etsy if you want something new and specific, have given me my favorite pieces. I got a $300 J. Crew wool coat for $30 from the goodwill online store. If you're patient, you can build a lovely wardrobe that didn't cost so much you're afraid to wear it.

I'm considering the Louis Vuitton Discovery compact wallet but the hardware makes me afraid it's going to break any day... Hope to hear some suggestion.

text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:I can definitely relate and ultimately if I don't love the item, or feel good in it I won't wear it. No matter how many people have complimented it in the past.   On the flip side, and honestly I feel like a shitty person for this, I have also gotten rid of items purely because someone whose taste I don't like has complimented it. This has only really happened with things I was already on the fence about or trying to make work, and then certain people complimenting the item will just send it over the edge and I'll get rid of it immediately. Anyone else do this? Or am I just a horrible person?

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 22, 2020	labels:**Trying to get fashion advice on my body type for all seasons in the UK and Ireland environment.**  Relevant physical profile:  I am an Asian dude with a fair complexion, short (165cm) and not bulky but not too thin.  I will be moving to Ireland with occasional trips to the UK.  I just don't want to look like a tourist and aim to dress like the average local for blending in.  My priority is gear and fashion for winter but since I will be living there indefinitely, I would appreciate fashion for all seasons as well.  Right now, the important thing I am looking for is a proper attire for the wet and cold weather of these countries so my focus is on the shoes and an overall gear that wouldn't need an umbrella as much as possible. And then these should be appropriate as business casual for office.  I really like to be able to wear trench coats or any long coats but I think they are really not good for short guys. :(	episode_done:True
text:What are you hate wearing?	labels:Anything that is even slightly restricting on my neck (turtlenecks, mocknecks, even some crew necks). Yet, for some absurd reason, I am absolutely drawn to the aesthetic. Its an ridiculous tug of war between fawning over them from afar but ripping them off my body within seconds of having them on.

I'm a relatively lanky guy (6'1, 190 lbs) and any shirt that I've tried (uniqlo, jcrew, hanes) has been too short on the torso. Sizing up only makes the shirt even looser on me without solving the problem. Any activity with my arms even at 90 degrees reveals my belly button lol.
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I bought a pair of boots from Modern Vice because a Facebook ad had been repeatedly coming up.  They are one of the coolest, most unique pairs of boots I own but they were not worth the cost and frustration. And tbh I almost never wear them.   They took over 6 months to get to me and, while I was expecting a long wait time, it was over the top. I tried contacting their customer support to check in - they asked for my order number and then disappeared.  As soon as I threatened to dispute the charge with my bank, my boots magically showed up on my doorstep 3 days later.	episode_done:True

I personally think that scandinavian minimalism is a marketing name for being lazy with design. But that is just me, of course.	episode_done:True
text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:I'm hoping those "Is it Wine o'clock?" shirts (or anything involving  women drinking wine to deal with life) you find at any mall store/Target directed towards adults.   Perhaps it's because I can no longer pass as a youth and will no doubt get thrown into the demographic these companies sell to, but it's always painful when you start to see a trend in clothes and you hate it, and it lasts YEARS.

I'll try to get a board together to put a picture with what I'm describing, but any Youtube video titled Fall 2020 clothing haul will probably give you an idea of what I'll be wearing as I'm not much of a fashion risktaker lol.  I have been searching all the resale sites for vintage wool shackets, as the Zara one I'm interested in keeps selling out and its like 90% polyester anyway. I plan on buying a few vintage pendleton/ll bean/eddie bauer oversized wool flannels to wear as jackets instead.

Jeans are for non-flare up times. Curvy fit chino pants with the hidden elastic waist will work for flare-ups. Wireless bras are for everyday. Underwire bras are special occasion only.

text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:1. Don't think of compliments as criticism. There are a few bad bananas out there who will actually try to bring you down, but for the most part, people ask "Why are you dressed like that?" simply to make conversation (and it's really a compliment -- you look nice!).   2.

Sometimes though, I dress up in all black and rock a punk look.  Pro: People find me approachable when I wear my softer clothes & I like making friends so that's a win. When I wear all black, I look hot & intimidating, which is a big confidence boost.  Cons: I'm not taken seriously either way lol	episode_done:True

text:or, to be more precise, genderless, showing that ivy is for everyone	labels:Just to be clear, everything is *for* who ever is wearing it. A white dude's dreadlocks are his.  But culture has inertia, and no matter how you slice it, ivy's elite provenance is the very reason for it's cache. Similar to the reasons for a birkin bag or Gucci slippers having cache.  You can call it egalitarian or iconoclastic all you want, but wearing stuff like this as a minority or a person who isn't a member of the elite has nothing to do with being brave or bucking trends. Its just us wanting a piece of that rarified elitism ourselves. Its us aspiring to the very thing we're supposed to be against, the rich.
text:I (M/39) just bought some bright yellow, women's, terry loungepants from August November. What wonderful "non-female" fashion items have you purchased recently? Do you ever dip into the men's section?	labels:Yes, joggers and flannels often, and rarely jeans. I work with fire and synthetic material will burn to your skin but cotton will turn into ash and fall off. Literally nothing in the women's section is 100% cotton. It's a damn shame because men's clothes don't fit me and look a little ridiculous to wear ill fitting clothes	episode_done:True
text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:I know I'll get alot of hate for this, but leggings are NOT pants. Sure, its cute with an oversized sweater that covers your booty and some nice boots or if you wanna workout or lounge around at home. But I always thought it was weird when adults where leggings like they're pants. I know they're comfortable but I don't think they should be considered "fashionable" imo.   Leggings look cute on toddlers tho.

text:How do you deal with wrinkles in linen pants? Do you stick to linen blends? Or are you just very careful not to wrinkle them?	labels:Unfortunately there is no way to avoid wrinkles in linen, but I think that's part of the look and just embrace it. I start the day with unwrinkled pants (steamer works great but honestly just hanging them up gets them pretty smooth) and the creases that develop are at joint lines. I think that those wrinkles from natural wear look neater than the wrinkles from something that has obviously been crumpled in a heap. My linen does tend to be heavier weight so they arent the super gauzy type, and they fit further away from the body which it think wrinkles them a little less.	episode_done:True
text:What clothing items have you reverted back to since WFH/quarantine?	labels:Oh man, somebody gave me a pair of Ugg moccasins they'd never worn (but were so comfy she couldn't resist buying them) like 5 years ago. I also thought they were too ugly to wear out of the house, but dear gods they were the most comfortable, sturdiest slippers I've ever owned. I, too, may need to revert to this.	episode_done:True

text:What are some unexpected surprises you've found with certain clothing brands that are known for other things?	labels:La Paz: I just bought my first piece from La Paz. I went with a basic heather gray crewneck (boring I know) but I love how soft it is and the loose fit makes it comfortable and stylish.  I love that all their garments are made in  Portugal as well!	episode_done:True
text:Generally what you're trying to match is formality.   "Dress pants" can of course be worn casually, and as they are separates then they're instantly less formal than a suit. So on a fun date you could easily wear a denim trucker or leather biker. For something more serious, look for top coats in solid colours (Navy, Camel, Grey, Black).   To clarify, what do you mean when you say dress pants?	labels:I recently ordered some Bonobos Weekday Warrior Dress Pants, then realized I have no idea what to wear with them.
text:Curious why you'd go for designer shoes over handbags? Personally I'm inclined the other way around because I feel like a handbag would last longer with frequent use than a pair of shoes would.	labels:You're 100% correct but unfortunately my love for shoes knows no reasoning! I've just always been shoes>bags. Especially when it comes to Christian Louboutins and the like!	episode_done:True
text:Do you name your favorite outfits?	labels:I don't name outfits, per se, but I name articles of clothing. For example, today I'm wearing my "bitchy boots," a pair of black leather ankle boots with a tall block heel that would be really good for literally kicking ass
text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I wear a pair of small, very dainty gold hoops, my engagement ring, a petite brass signet ring, a gold necklace with a small emerald pendant, and a small gold watch. I have a pair of pearl studs, and some fun bigger fake gold hoops. I would like a slightly wider, short flat herringbone chain in gold, and some dangly earrings, but otherwise feel pretty good with my selection. Another right hand ring would be great though.	episode_done:True

text:Style Lessons from Male-Presenting People: An Inspo Album	labels:I love this! What a great album. Great diversity, too!    Maybe it sounds silly, but MFA taught me so much about wearing properly-fitting things that aren't skintight.    And as always, the MFA wiki is fantastic. Men's fashion can be more formulaic, so in my opinion, it's less overwhelming to start out there when you're first learning, even when you're femme.

text:How Much Clothing Should I Own?	labels:I don't think anyone is going to be able to tell you this as it's subjective and dependent on your job and lifestyle. It's going to come down to keeping stuff you actually wear on a weekly basis and throwing away stuff you don't wear. This will let you know where you stand with your wardrobe right now and you can build from there.     Personally, I just went though this and cleaned out my closet from all the all the old high school, college, and worn clothes I still had hanging around and my mind set was that ***it's better for me to throw away a little too much than too little***. Only do this if your in the financial situation where you know you can replace an article of clothing pretty easily though.

I can't find anything like it any more, but one silver lining of COVID is I hardly ever go out, so they're lasting longer just by virtue of not wearing them lately.

Can I wear the same shirt twice before dry cleaning? Do people do that? How often should I hit up the dry cleaners? Can any of this stuff be normal washed?  I'm sort of lost any help is appreciated.
text:What is your most worn accessories?	labels:I have some nice sterling silver pendants and ear rings, and rings as well. I also like bags, and although I love shoes too, I end up wearing trainers 99% of the time so I try not to buy 'nice' shoes as they won't get much wear.  For jewelry I find that I think I can't deal with cheap materials any longer as my ears start itching when I wear things that aren't sterling silver, so I'm only getting real solid silver earrings as well as rings, pendants etc. As a teen I'd have cheap stuff but now that I have a job I can afford to spend a bit more on better material.	episode_done:True

Total: 71 items (acessories, sleepwear and gym clothes not included) .

text:Same lol. Outdoor brands are so good for durability. There is a lot more scrutiny placed on them too with reviewers comparing pieces in action on hikes or whatever. And since the styles don't really change that much year to year, they basically have an efficient process to make the items at the best price with quality to withstand the elements. It might not be the most stylish but it's going to last.    Also since the style types don't change much, there's a lot of second hand stuff that's basically the same as the new season stuff just different color ways and  you can get them for better deals. They also hold their resale value on the secondhand market. Like the patagonia better sweaters / vests and stuff.	labels:	episode_done:True

No, what's worse is that they excused #MeToo away. They don't view the women assaulted by Weinstein as victims of a predator that held immense power in an industry that's very small and difficult to break into, they view them as participants in a business transaction that they willingly entered into.

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:I have collected so many gray sweaters/long sleeve tops over the years that my family teases me about it, and I get exasperated at myself whenever another catches my eye. I do get mileage out of all of them, so I don't see it as a waste really, but I definitely think of gray as my safety blanket color.   The gray tops are probably a seasonal crutch- I play around with colors/styling a lot more in the spring and summer, but during the winter I rely on neutral tops/outerwear and bottoms, with maybe a nice scarf if I'm making any kind of effort.	episode_done:True
text:I feel one of the issues is that in this subreddit we have:  1.  A group of people who genuinely want to know why people make large purchases (people just getting into fashion, hearing about spending more to get better quality leather/materials). I was in this group for a while.  2. A group of people who are looking for the absolute cheapest way to get into fashion, they often take pride in getting things for cheap and some even get a sense of superiority for getting the same look without spending as much as "suckers" who buy designer fashion.  3. Hobbyists who have the money to spend on exact items they want.   I genuinely think that one of the issues that causes people to butt heads in this subreddit is when the hobbyists feel they need to justify their purchases when confronted with the question "why?"  Getting the exact item they have searched for is a valid enough reason, and trying to invent other reason to "justify" a purchase often causes confusion for people who are trying to get involved in fashion and are genuinely asking "why is this item worth it?" When I first was looking for new footwear, the number of times I was told that $500 boots were worth it because how long they would last was absurd.	labels:>when the hobbyists feel they need to justify their purchases when confronted with the question "why".

text:General Discussion - December 30, 2020	labels:I dunno if this is dumb or not but having a real pair of good winter pants has changed how I approach fashion in the winter a bit.  I got those uniqlo wind-proof lined pants back in oct and they've been amazing, last week I wore them in -25 for about a half hour and my legs stayed cozy. The real benefit though is now when I buy new pants I don't have to worry as much about whether or not I can wear them in the winter. If I'm spending more than like 5 minutes outside I'll take off whatever I'm wearing and put the warm pants on, it's great.

Almost worst: Off yellow Ivy Trad collegiate Vneck sweater. I thought my fall wardrobe had more things to match with it, and then I pulled out my fall wardrobe and found nothing that I would have wanted to wear with it.

I wear suits to work and it looks unique but subtle with them. Got a great deal too.   Worst: the 4 different attempts to buy a Patagonia Better Sweater Vest from grailed/ebay. I want one in navy but keep buying ones that look dark colored in the photos but then they get in and are a medium blue. Thankful for PayPal protection on those.	episode_done:True
text:When your personality and aesthetic don't quite match?	labels:I feel bad for this reaction. Who wants to say "my boyfriend admited that sometimes he's not a huge fan of my clothing choices" and then immediately get whacked with "fuck him find a better boyfriend"  She never said he was being mean, or stopping her from wearing the things. Just that he's not a huge fan of some of the pieces. Whatever. No big deal. Women hate on cargo shorts and there's no resounding "fuck her for throwing out your favorite shorts while you were gone. find a better girl"  I don't think he was trying to be critical here. I don't even think he was realizing what he was saying. What I think he was trying to say is "I think you look best in this" "I think you look fine in that too" not so much a "you look good in this" "you look bad in that". I think he's poorly articulating his preferences on style.

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:From elementary to middle school (with older sisters whose fashion I idolized), my favorite outfits were plaid multi colored shorts, with a tank top layered visibly under a polo shirt. Both the tank top and the polo were different colors that matched the multi colored shorts, and all of it was presumably from Aeropostle or Hollister. And matching Vans, of course.	episode_done:True

Like, this is your sight, wearing the wrong prescription can fuck you up, I don't know that I'd trust $30 glasses.	labels:I have a super weird prescription because I had cataracts as a kid and always get mine through zenni. They have different levels of lenses just like a normal eye doctor does, and it recommends the best ones for your prescription. Mine are usually like $60 total but as long as I get the upgraded lenses theyre just as good as my more expensive ones.	episode_done:True
text:The safest bet is probably your classic two-button charcoal grey suit. If you only own one suit, navy or grey are the most versatile options. If you want a single suit that's appropriate for weddings and funerals, I would go with charcoal grey.	labels:I was thinking that. I've always owned black or pinstriped before, so charcoal would be a good change. What do you think about a vest? And how lame or not are bow ties?

text:Which higher end brands do you find to be "worth it" and for what?	labels:Not sure how high-end you're thinking, but I love my Frye boots. My black Veronica Combat boots in particular are an absolute cold-weather staple for me- I've put them through the ringer and they still look good, walked for miles over cobblestones in them and not had issues.   I also love Frank and Eileen button-up shirts. When I was first introduced to them I thought the price point was absolutely bonkers but as I got to know more about quality clothes and what actually goes into them I decided to give them a try and yeah. They fit me PERFECTLY. Hang on me just right, buttons are in exactly the right place, last for years- I can barely tell the difference between the first ones I bought five-ish years ago (and have had in heavy rotation ever since) and the one that arrived yesterday that I'm wearing now.
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:I was in high school in New Jersey in the mid 2000s. It was an extremely tacky time period for style. Think Jersey Shore but with less self awareness. Basically every cool girl in my high school wore a Bebe Sport or Juicy bedazzled sweatsuit, usually with low rise flair pants, a very tight camisole that exposed a bit of stomach, usually with a belly button ring hanging down, a tight zip up top, between 1-3 pairs of big hoop earrings, bedazzled sneakers, and lots of frosty makeup with pin straightened or crunchy hair with chunky highlights. I seem to remember everything being hot pink, black and zebra print, maybe baby blue. I don't really see people recreating that whole trend, though we are probably not far off from a revival. It was actually kinda fun. I miss the unironic over the topness of it.	episode_done:True

When the teacher saw this she sent ten more pairs to Bernie and said that when she saw him wearing them at the inauguration she was honored because everyone there was wearing world class designer clothes but Bernie was wearing her mittens

text:How to Combat Fashion Apathy?	labels:I think the apathy is mostly coming from the weight gain. Speaking from personal experience, i go through cycles of unfit and fit, and my fashion mood alters accordingly. When you're unfit, all clothes just look urgh but once you're in shape and toned up, the exact same clothes magically look gorgeous and interesting again. So get fit first and you'd want to show it off through fashion!	episode_done:True

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:If the person knows what they're doing and are using high quality materials then handmade things can last for a very long time. I always go over the stitches in machine-made store-bought clothes if they're cheaper because they often rip in the wash.	episode_done:True
text:What are your tips for being stylish when your weight fluctuates like crazy?	labels:I recommend accessories like watches, bandanas, silk scarfs (to tie around a purse handle or your neck), and earrings. Wearing those things can still be possible even with significant weight changes. I recommend purchasing fun socks/tights if that's your thing too.

Are machine washable / easy to care for without spending on dry cleaning or excessive personal attention. 2. Do not involve even vestigal belt loops. 3. Can be worn casually without issue.  I want something that I can throw on, feel comfortable in, not worry about cleaning, and still feel well-dressed in. Right now, those are chinos, but... chinos are stiff, they require a belt, there's nothing cool about them, there's nothing slouchy or loungey or fun about them, they're just... White people pants.

text:2020 Christmas Gifts Thread	labels:Disappointed by Christmas and the season as a whole. We're in lockdown, we can't visit family, can't visit friends. No gifts. Nothing from my husband, nothing from family. We have away a bunch of gifts, but got nothing in return. I even got something for my husband to open under the tree. But I got nothing. Just sat at home, baked a lemon loaf and watched tv. I thought putting up Christmas ornaments would put me in a better mood, it didn't. I took down the Christmas ornaments today. My mum died two years ago, Christmas was always big with her, and she dowled out gifts like they were going out of style, and we usually travel over Christmas, so Christmas has always felt exciting. This year, I don't feel like celebrating. Just a sad, lonely Christmas. Looking at all your Christmas spoils just makes me feel even worse. I shouldn't have ventured into this thread...

text:would you say they are thick?  also, looking at the site i wanted to confirm. is it $16 per single pair???	labels:Yes, they are expensive socks, but if you're patient, you can find them on sale frequently throughout the year. Most of the time a sale happens, it's posted on r/frugalmalefashion   I will also mention the great return policy/customer service from Darn Tough. Had a couple of pairs (several years old) lose the elasticity around the ankle of my no-shows, and I filed a claim on their website, sent the socks in, and they sent back a $17 online voucher for the site. Highly recommended from me. I have ~9 pairs of DT, and they're my only brand of socks.

I have basically been using the same few pairs of Gildan boxer briefs because I can't find anything else that fits the way I like. Ive even found the exact same pairs on ebay but it seems they've been changed and are all tight fitting now (I wear smalls and bought mediums, the mediums are more tight fitting)  I think the fact I have a huge ass contributes, I'm otherwise pretty skinny.  Does anyone have any suggestions? It seems like every single boxer briefs I've tried are tight as hell around the ass and my thighs, which I don't like at all.

text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I think those would look really cute! I've always admired people's glasses. I actually made a big jump last year. I always had dark rectangular glasses, because I thought I needed them to balance out my "round face". But I fell in love with tortoise glasses, they looked so soft and pretty. I bought a pair and I haven't been happier!  I do see my glasses as being part of my appearance in a more permanent way, like my hair. I think as I've gotten older, I feel less angst about what I like and how I look.	episode_done:True
text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Get two types of winter Jackets. A stylish wool coat for days and nights out and a nice down jacket for every day. One that goes past your bum. Gloves, scarves and hats are easier to change up your look. I also reccomend uniqlo's heat tech line. A heat tech undershirt and and leggings under pants makes a world of a difference. I also wear a lot of mini skirts in winter. I wear them with fleece lines tights. Of course you will want some cute boots and warm socks. If you still feel cold, i reccomend buying disposable self heating body warmers you can stick to your clothes. I always wear these when Im spending the day outside doing winter activities.	episode_done:True

text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:I had bright blue Coraline hair for around 4 years (with a few months of pink or lavender intervals in that time) and it did actually change how I dressed.   I mostly wear black, with some grey and camel, but until I had blue hair I hadn't realized how many of my office tops were blue or blue patterns. I didn't like mixing the blue tones, so I ended up passing over all my blue clothes until I had pink or lavender hair again.  In my anecdotal experience, I felt like light pink went with nearly everything, but blue wasn't hard to fit into my (pretty neutral) style.
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I guess i would start by switching out one thing from your base outfit, like wear a blouse instead of a sweater, wide leg pants or a skirt instead of jeans, sneakers instead of the boots. Keep the rest of the outfit the same. Normally I'd say add accessories but with masks I find jewelry and scarves get in my way.

It also adds a dramatic volume that you don't usually get from clothes.  This is mainly inspiration. Not much of what's in this album is what most people would consider "wearable". These are almost all runway pieces and the majority of them weren't produced for sale. That said, if they were and I could afford them, I'd wear about 60% of what's in the album.  I included a bit of womenswear. There's more to draw from in womenswear, and the pieces here are wonderful.

text:It seems like it's well-known that some people wear certain types of colors and not others, and so it always confuses me when a single set of those colors dominates the selection for a season or so. Why wouldn't you stock things that work for the other set of people, instead of excluding a new group of people each season?	labels:Right?  Like I don't want them to get rid of these colors - they're great and work for a lot of people and in a lot of contexts.  I do think there are business reasons and it's kind of the nature of trends, but also, like, don't all the people need colors that work for them all the time?
text:I should have clarified. There a ton of small businesses in my city, but I have to visit their sites one by one. Which takes forever. Is there a Nordstrom or Zara for buying local?	labels:My city has a store that stocks all sorts of different local brands, but the store itself is just considered a boutique. Other boutiques in town are locally owned, but carry larger national brands, if that makes sense? You could contact your boutiques to see how much of their inventory is actually locally designed/manufactured, and then just shop there?   I've also heard that dead malls are getting remodeled to be filled with local stores only, so that could be something to look for? In the meantime, especially when weather is nice, there are lots of bazaars that have boutique tents.  You'll still have to go store to store, but they're all in one place at least. They might not have full inventory but you'd get an idea of what they carry so you know where you want to go?	episode_done:True

text:I miss shoes too :( I'm not a shoes-at-home person so I'm now barefoot or in socks 97% of the time, and when I do leave my house I'm usually in sneakers to exercise or run one (1) errand and I want to wear heels goddamn it. I might just say fuck it and start dressing up for my errands honestly....	labels:Haha I just wore some killer heels today for no reason and it felt FABULOUS!	episode_done:True
text:I received a pair of boots (Outblast TS) yesterday and I think I'll have to return them because they're too narrow ... It really sucks that very few companies will have the width in their sizing charts.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:I know I'll get alot of hate for this, but leggings are NOT pants. Sure, its cute with an oversized sweater that covers your booty and some nice boots or if you wanna workout or lounge around at home. But I always thought it was weird when adults where leggings like they're pants. I know they're comfortable but I don't think they should be considered "fashionable" imo.   Leggings look cute on toddlers tho.
text:Paypal covers some amount of return shipping per year but you have to opt in. I don't think it will fully cover a return to the UK.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:>the dress code says you have to wear a dress shirt or an oxford shirt and pants, no shorts that it. but when it gets cold what type of jacket should I wear to match most people wear a fleece over it but I don't think that matches very well	labels:Oh, right. Casual would be best, I think. Bomber or hoodie when it's chilly, peacoat, parka, or puffer when it's truly cold.	episode_done:True
text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:A nice watch.  I went a bit overboard with watches personally, but generally speaking, a midsized steel sports watch with a neutral dial colour on a bracelet or a leather strap seems like a versatile accessory for most outfits.
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 01	labels:Easy one, maybe!  Redwing boots with business slacks. Is this doable?  I'm committed to buying a pair, but for work I do business casual. Trying to think of outfits that I could achieve with this when I purchase my pair this week.  Site is offline or I'd show a pic! They're not dress shoes,I'm talking the boot options here.
text:Shitpost Saturday: Ghost Outfit	labels:I'm the ghost dressed in a tee shirt, bare feet, dog hair, and ratty-ass ancient leggings that were black once upon a time and are now that ghastly not-black color.  My ghostly manifestation will be shedding dog hair. You're not gonna see me because I'm embarrassed that I look awful, I'm just going to leave dog hair  on your furniture.  Added: My name is Deborah Hairy, and I haunt people who don't have dogs because that makes the dog hair manifestation more interesting. For me. I died standing at the door waiting for my little dogs to explore every square inch of the yard, for the twentieth time.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:I literally never match my shoes to my outfits.   All of my dressy shoes are black, with one taupe exceptions, and my everyday shoes are brown leather so they match up easily.   Before them I wore burgundy Chelsea boots that matched NOTHING, but I've never had more ppl compliment my footwear. Before those were grey and red hiking boots, which I also never matched up	episode_done:True
text:Can You Wear a T-Shirt Under a Blazer and Not Look Like an 1980s Leftover?	labels:The tuck is key to pulling off the blazer and tee look, which can be stylish. Tuck the tee in and belt it.   Another factor is how formal/casual the pant is. I love a nice pair of jeans with a tucked tee and a casual blazer on a man--effortlessly classic & sexy. If you're set on untucked, you'll want a sweater tee (short-sleeve sweater, with whaling on the bottom.   While we're at it, a sweater-blazer combo is classic and casual.

text:Your favorite ___ for $___: Henleys	labels:Any UK suggestions? I love a Henley...
text:(Man) Repeller: A postmortem	labels:You can't force people in charge of a business to work with others if they don't want to. That's their business, therefore it's her decision. What you can do is not support them.  The fashion *blog* alone will not survive. The future is social media. That's unfortunate as I don't really care much about social media. I'm mostly a youtube video rat.  Never cared about man repeller. I think I read it occasionally but out of google search for specific topics, not really out of a habbit.	episode_done:True
text:Unique brands/boutiques in your city?	labels:Fiat Lux is a beautiful jewelry store in San Francisco. It's in the Mission (quickly gentrifying neighborhood) where you'll also find some other trendy boutiques and local brands like Curator and Gravel and Gold. Fiat Lux has a sister store called Rose Gold's that does piercings and tattoos, and they sell some of their own body jewelry at both locations.  Someone already mentioned Esqueleto in Oakland here, and that store also has a location in LA now. I used to be into the Brooklyn boutique Catbird and wished I had some local equivalents in the Bay Area - now I have at least 2!	episode_done:True

Also, americana (essentially flannel+jeans+boots) was big here 5-6 years ago but most people are over it.	labels:it has nothing to do with the rings lol. it just seems like conventional fits arent welcome here
text:I have a tee shirt of a rabbit lifting weights that says "working on my buns." The weights align perfectly, coincidentally, with my boobs.  It's tacky and awful and I love the shit out of that shirt. It used to be my go-to when I'd go kickbox at the gym.	labels:I don't usually like sayings in t-shirts but anything with a good pun and cute animals will lure me in.	episode_done:True

text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:I tend to go black-heavy with clothing anyway, but especially when I'm rocking the crazy hair.   The only real planning I put into it is trying to avoid color combinations that evoke holiday vibes or something I'm specifically not wanting. With my fire engine red, I avoided wearing green, except for Christmas, for example.	episode_done:True
text:you can find a lot of dollskill items on depop!	labels:Nice, like thrifting leather when you don't want to support the industry!	episode_done:True
text:What socks do you guys wear? and some advice on socks please?	labels:I'm big on merino socks. Currently have outlier merino socks in black sadly no longer being made in that color way. I also have unbound merino socks and wool and prince merino socks. I carry a couple of nike cotton socks for harsher conditions that warrant more wear such as running. I've also heard very good reviews on darn tough socks which is a combo merino blend if you want to take a look at them. They will be my next purchase. Hope this helps.

text:As I wait to hear if I have to evacuate due to CA wildfires, here’s a hypothetical I had to do: you have time to prepare before your evacuation and pack up your car. What clothes do you bring and why?	labels:I'd grab my uniforms, my work uniform, my at john uniform, my cadet uniforms, all my cadet camp shirts and jumpers, and then probably 2 pairs of Jean's and some leggings. I've got probably 10+ poloshirts and tshirts from cadets, completely irreplaceable, but I also wear them most of the time anyway so it wouldnt be much of a change style wise for me if I only had them. I'd also grab my grandads old flying jacket which is now my flying jacket. I dont really have any sort of emotional attachment to any other clothes, so it would be inconvenient to replace everything else but it wouldnt bother me at all	episode_done:True
text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive piece of clothing is probably my pair of black vegan leather Doc Martens. I probably wear them about twice a week and I love them! I think it cost me about $120 or so from Amazon.	episode_done:True
text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:I'll be interested to see what happens. When they first changed to Walmart, I noticed a huge drop in quality but over the past year or two I definitely think it improved - or it matched my taste better, anyway. I hope it stays good.	episode_done:True
text:[Inspiration] Jewelry	labels:Nice album OP. I've been into jewelry for some time. I've always liked bracelets and such, but lately I've been into rings. Just wish I had the guts (and budget) to start wearing them. It's one of these things that I like seeing others wear but I feel that wouldn't be able to pull of.  I might start to wear bracelets again and go from there.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 14, 2021	labels:I've been hunting for t-shirts online and having some real trouble finding two specific cuts.   The first is the 'cuts' fit. i.e. fitted, elongated t-shirt with curved hem 'cuts clothing' does them -- but it seems like I should be able to find them somewhere like H&M or Zara (who don't have them).    The second is the baggier t-shirt with huge open/torn collar look. Are people cutting these themselves? it seems like the ones I've seen in photos have a hem along the collar...
text:How do you feel about vegan/faux leather?	labels:I hate it. It isn't durable and wears out quickly, and is usually made from petroleum products which makes it just as bad for the environment (if not more so) than real leather.
text:I (M/39) just bought some bright yellow, women's, terry loungepants from August November. What wonderful "non-female" fashion items have you purchased recently? Do you ever dip into the men's section?	labels:I have a lot of luck with men's sweaters when I'm thrifting, and also at stores like H&M, where I can get cotton or merino sweaters for the same price as acrylic garbage in the women's departments.  I usually go for sweaters with raglan sleeves so that shoulder fit is less of an issue, because I'm quite small, set sleeves on menswear don't really work for me.

text:lol for real though those LL Bean canvas totes will make it through anything. we have a big one that got frozen under a dock all winter (I LIVE IN NEW ENGLAND OKAY) and came out good as new. you could perhaps perform a nuclear test on New England and then pry our LL Bean canvas totes out of our cold, dead hands, and then keep them for yourself.	labels:I've had my LL Bean tote for 10+ years and I'm pretty sure that thing could stop a bullet. I don't use it much anymore, but I'm afraid to throw it out. I don't want to anger it.
text:What are your favourite places to find loungewear ?	labels:Vuori
text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I think a lot of these rules come from old fashion norms that are meant to make people look as thin as possible so I hope they become a thing of the past! I remember once seeing in a magazine not to wear turtlenecks or high waisted pants if you have big boobs and that's basically all I wear. I think the example picture was Jessica Simpson and I thought she looked gorgeous in that outfit.  I also love mixing black and navy.
text:Fold VS Hang	labels:It really depends on the garment and it's composition.  Dresses and skirts - hang them.  Shirts/blouses are better hung but can be folded.  Trousers can go either way.  Anything that is going to get fold creases in it I hang.	episode_done:True
