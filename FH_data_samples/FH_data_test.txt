text:Shitpost Saturday: You Are What You Wear	labels:I love J. Crew and am so boring that a pop of mustard or (gasp) tartan are daring and envelope-pushing.  Alternately, I love Unique Vintage because I can't accept that I'm 35 and my cute, bright sundress years are waning.

text:Good quality men's jeans?	labels:> * The crotch tearing (this one's a reoccurring theme) * The dye running onto white shoes (probably the cheapest pair I've had has done this) * The jeans losing their shape/fit and turning loose  1. This happens when your thighs rub together and there's not enough fabric slack there. You may want to try sizing up at the thigh. Also, get a few pairs and rotate so that each pair only sees a third or a quarter of the wears instead of one pair getting it all.  2. This is called crocking, where indigo flakes off/falls off when abraded against something else. That's part of indigo, whether you're talking about jeans, jean jackets, etc. You can help remove excess dye with a wash and try a magic eraser on your shoes.  3. That's normal. The warp/weft weave will stretch out like a sweater after each wear, becoming noticeable in time. Wash them when they get too out of shape.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 15, 2021	labels:I'm at a point right now where I'm able to buy some new clothes for the wardrobe. I live in Japan, where it rains pretty frequently, so I'm thinking of trying out techwear as a way to stay stylish on those rainy days. Can anyone recommend some cheaper tapered cargo pants and hardshells/jackets for a beginner to try out the look? No solid price range, but obviously I can't afford acronym or anything crazy like that. Only requirement besides style is that it still has to be functional enough to actually wear in pretty heavy rain.	episode_done:True
text:clothes + art: random inspo	labels:Thought I’d put together an inspo that more heavily focuses on art and clothes. While there may not be an intersection between many of these paintings or pieces of clothing, there’s always something to pull from works of art, whether it be how colors work together or how the form of the piece can inform your own choices about clothing. I think that grounding clothing choices in the context of the art, architecture, or anything else that surrounds you can be a really good move overall.

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I often buy multiples of items I love. I bought several of the same cardigan after I realized that I wore it more than any other sweater I owned. It's great!  Another thing I do is, when I see an item I like, I mentally run through my closet and see if it will mesh with what I already own. If it works, I get it. If I'd have to buy several new items to make it work, I don't. For this reason, I don't own many t-shirts, but I do own lots of sweaters and dresses.

It can be a bit exhausting but you can pick one one item that you would like to focus on (a top that you recent bought or pants that you never got the chance to wear) and start trying on different pieces until you get an outfit that you like with that piece!  I find that this way makes the process less overwhelming and is an easy way to incorporate new pieces into your cycle.   You can also try and replicate an outfit that you see on Instagram or even google an “aesthetic” that you’re interested in with what you have in your closet!	episode_done:True

Whenever I go shopping/out on the town I feel like I have to be 100% on point outfit-wise or I get tons of negative attention. It’s wild having people be extra sweet/accommodating to me when I’m wearing a blazer/Americana vs gettin my ass followed around by security guards when I’m wearing a sweatshirt and J’s or a Punky outfit. Definitely feels like people cross the street to avoid me/strangers don’t treat me as nicely when I’m wearing less “nice” clothing too.

In more conventional times I’d also sometimes have concealer or lipstick with me for touch ups but now what I carry is pretty minimal. I sometimes have a few other things thrown in there depending on the circumstances but these are my every day items. I carry a specific bag for work since I need to carry my laptop and files for work.   Edit to add: hair ties!	episode_done:True
text:It did directly compare it to American slavery, but yeah, I get your point. I guess they do that since when most people hear slavery they think of chattel slavery, which was incredibly brutal. What's happening now is a bit more iffy. Not only is it a lot less brutal, people aren't really owned 24/7, like a slave. People in Uzbekistan are (mostly were these days, as you read) forced to work at certain times of year, so they're temporary slaves, which just sounds kinda odd.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Reigning Champ Hoodie: 2 months later	labels:Often times, cheaper, more utilitarian fabrics are more durable. While I can't speak to RC's quality as I have never owned any of their stuff, terry-cloth is generally a softer material and can be more likely to abrade. So if you are like me and place a lot of weight on your elbows while seated at a chair with armrests (esp if you have pointy elbows), then you might find that you develop holes there and so you either change up how you sit or you realize that you need something that will work with your use-case (denser weave material or maybe reinforced elbows/elbow patches). Not dissimilar to how some people put holes in socks more easily than others. Shape of your body and how you do normal, everyday things can impact how things wear on you.    More expensive does not mean more durable. These are not the same thing and it's something that people really need to stop using as a reason to spend more on something. Durability \*can\* be a high-quality product's claim to fame, but is certainly not generalized to everything.    Durability is also not a measure of quality. It can be part of why you consider something to be "quality", but that's up to you what you want from your garments. Unfortunately, you don't know what you don't know, and going by what people recommend means that you're basing your purchasing decisions on other people's preferences. Fashion can be an expensive hobby and there is a lot of trial and error as you learn about yourself and about the various things that go into making a garment.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:Great responses already. I'll rant a little bit about footwear since that's my specialty so to speak.   I think people still spend far too much on footwear generally. GYW and stitched construction is nice and all, but it's not a cheap option by any means. You get quite high quality leathers from plenty of makers in the <$350 range and there are good options in the $200 range as well depending on the type of shoes/boots you're looking for.   I'm working on a post that talks a bit more about the individual economics of owning even a single pair of "high quality" footwear. Cost of ownership is vastly under estimated by newcomers and expectations overall tend to be set too high.   I still agree that footwear has pretty high diminishing returns, but I also think that a *lot* of people talk themselves into buying stitched construction shoes that are far far too expensive for what they really want.
text:No clue about winter wear. Please Help!	labels:As someone who lives in canada and has experienced -50 C days, you should also consider how much time you spend outside.

text:Chelsea boots under €200	labels:Honestly... if your feet aren't done growing just pick up a pair of ASOS brand chelseas. Not many other brands under $300 attempt the sleek SLP silhouette (even ASOS doesn't do it that well).   In my experience while the ASOS chelseas aren't amazing and don't compare to my Story et Falls at all, they're great for trying out the look and also holding yourself over while your feet are still growing. While they aren't great, they'll last you at least a decent amount of time. Lots of "budget" boot companies make chelseas but they're often chunky or have a very short and wide shaft which oftentimes isn't exactly what people who want chelseas are looking for	episode_done:True
text:Could you say more about why those systems are unsubstainablr?   I'm not very rich, I would struggle to afford a house in my expensive city, but I have dropped a few thousand on a suit - made with good materials by a local bespoke maker.  I think extreme wealth gaps are unsustainable, for sure, but dropping a few thousand on a suit every couple of years isn't much more than people spend on a computer, out drinking, or on games and gaming systems. For me, it's a hobby I get to wear.	labels:One decent suit in any closet is always a must, a couple of times I got the job I was interviewing for simply because I wore a suit and tie to the interview.   Sustainability and changing trends are another can of worms which depend on the individual. Contemporary vs Classic, $300 suit which can be altered by a tailor vs $4,000.00 fitted suit. Like he said “buy the best you can afford and take care of your purchases”
text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:Not a must in my opinion.  I had some black dresses a couple  of years ago and I never wore them.   What works for someone else might not be for you.

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:Some really great tips here! Here's my two cents:  1) If the seller doesn't respond to your questions, RESIST the urge to buy anyway. This seems really obvious, but I've made the mistake many times of panic-buying b/c I was afraid I'd miss out on the item, against my better judgment. Someone else may snap it up, but you've saved yourself the headache of wasting money on something that doesn't fit/is damaged/itchy/smells like cigarette smoke/etc.   2) Poshmark and eBay work better when you are familiar with the exact brand and model of clothing. They're not great for browsing due to just too much crap and too much inconsistency in the listings. If you don't really know what you want, I'd suggest browsing TheRealReal. They skew higher-end, but have a quite a lot of choice and have filtered out the trash and no-name brands already. Often you can find really rock-bottom prices for what you're getting (like Rag & Bone jeans for $30). You can search for something like "women's wool trousers" and then filter by size and color and sometimes style (cropped, wide-leg, etc). You'll be exposed to a lot of brands and styles you may not otherwise have thought of. Another pro (or con, depending on how you look at it), is that the clothing sizes are broken down into XS/S/M/L/XL categories, rather than numerical. So if you filter by "S" it will include 26-27 jeans, 34-36 Euro sizing, 40-42 IT size, etc., which is good when you're dealing with international brands. Even better is when the item includes measurements, which they often do, which are always more helpful than a number on a tag. Finally, on full-priced items (except for the really high end stuff), you can automatically get 20% by using their REAL code.	episode_done:True

text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:When I was a student, I did buy quite a lot of fast fashion (e.g. Primark) and high street items, particularly when there was a good sale on. I enjoyed it and was exploring my style, and it was all balanced by not spending as much on nights out, drinking and takeaways.  Once I started working, I divided up my money into buckets: monthly fun money (£100) that can roll up, monthly luxury savings money (£100) that would accumulate until I could afford the £££ item I wanted, monthly travel/experience money budget that would also accumulate, general bills and the rest into savings. Ultimately these numbers are arbitrary and was the way that allowed me to splurge sensibly whilst saving, guilt free.   Remember that you can always earn more money so don't be too hard on yourself, but also learn how to be fiscally responsible! It's a balance and learning experience for sure, and will change as life happens (*cough* Covid *cough*).	episode_done:True

I know you’re on a budget, but it can be done!   Literally all of my cashmere is either thrifted or bought on clearance, so the max I would have paid for a sweater is around $35, with the low end around $12.

text:How do ya'll express your culture or traditional fashion in modern clothing?	labels:I’m Vietnamese, and I’ve only recently been interested in my cultural clothing because of - well, internalized racism, which wasn’t great, LOL. But what I’ve done is save up for custom áo dài!  Traditionally, áo dài is pretty eye-catching, especially in the U.S. (where I live). I’m saving up to create tailor-made áo dài that’s more modern and something understated I could wear often: for example, switching out white silk pants for black ones, and the main dress for a crushed navy velvet. I find that modernizing cultural clothing can be a way to represent your cultural and ethnic roots without feeling strange or like an impostor, and seeing the same, familiar cuts in different prints and tones that I like fills me with a whole new type of joy.  I also follow other people who wear modernized cultural clothing. The first example that comes to mind is @asunnydisposish on Twitter, who is an artist but often posts pictures of her putfits (modernized hanbok). I have an album of Vietnamese clothing outside of áo dài (like áo nhật bình) and other designers’ takes on modern áo dài, and another album of textures, prints, and fabrics I would kill to wear.   Other ways you can incorporate this into your clothing is supporting artists and designers from whatever ethnic group/culture you belong to!  If anyone’s interested in seeing the albums, I’m more than willing to share; I just don’t know how to operate imgur yet, which seems to be the go-to for everyone here. I hope this helped! Best of luck!

This year, spending the holidays at home, is the perfect year to wear it! First Christmas as married people and no one to see it but me, husband, and the dogs!	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:Go find yourself a pair of really exciting pants. High waist/wide leg is in right now, so maybe try that silhouette but in a bright color or print. When you get dressed in the morning, sometimes start with your bottoms. Grab your fun pants or a skirt, and build an outfit from there. Honestly the best thing to do is to just make yourself do it.	episode_done:True

text:Ellen McArthur Circular Economy Report: by 2029 Resale is expected to be bigger than Fast Fashion	labels:Psyched to hear it. I'm a huge fan of physical and online consignment stores.   Thrift stores are great and I sometimes have the energy to dig through the esoteric offerings they have, but a well-curated consignment shop, especially an independent one is great for the community, great for sellers, great for the environment and great for me. So long as store owners are conscientious when examining the pieces they accept in-store, and are reasonable when they do the pricing, I think consignment shopping is the ideal shopping experience for me. I can find excellent condition, unique pieces from a variety of brands, at different price points - at price points far below what it would cost retail.	episode_done:True

These days, I've opened up myself to a few new colours (green and burgundy mostly), and I like the contrast they give with my tips.

During this time, Christmas sales are so tempting, and I work in retail so it’s hard not to go into work and think ‘what can I buy today with my 50% staff discount, and the others sales going on at the mall?’  I always go in a shop with a minimalistic mindset, and while I’m no true minimalist with clothes, I hate clutter and excess. But I still love to experiment with fashion (I went to school for it, it’s hard not to be creative). Look in your wardrobe, watch YouTube or look at Instagram and have intention on what style of garment you want that will suit you. Also, have patience in finding the right one you will be happy to keep for a LONG time.	episode_done:True

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.
text:While natural fibers are hard on the environment, man-made fibers release microfibers into our water ways, which are polluting the ocean. Fish have been caught that have balls of microfibers in their stomachs, and even people are thought to have microfibers circulating in our bodies. These microfibers are terrible for the oceans and may have an effect on our health. Scientists are trying to study whether microfibers cause inflammation, which could implicate these fibers in cancer. Man made fibers also often require toxic chemicals to be created, which harm the workers who make the fibers. There is no perfect solution, but I think figuring out how to filter out micro plastics or making synthetic fibers that don't harm the workers who create them and can properly decompose or be recycled easily would be sustainable solutions.	labels:	episode_done:True

You’ve put into words a lot of the smaller aspects of looking at construction outfits really perfectly, I’d consider myself at least marginally better dressed and this is still a really helpful method of approaching fashion.  >What is your relationship with gender and identity within fashion?  In particular may be the hardest question to actually answer here(or maybe that’s just me), the past year or so I’ve very much been questioning my sexuality and as a whole I’ve never exactly felt like I identified with or liked traditional masculinity, I’d say my current wardrobe leans much more heavily into categorically masculine items and fit and it’s def something I’ve been wanting to shift away from.   I’m like tiny and prefer high crops anyway so I really need to just start embracing more womenswear but I’m lazy and haven’t bothered to learn about womenswear brands uet
text:Seconding this, but also want to say that sometimes the fit issue is not a clear cut as the front rise being too short. It can also be the curve of the front rise that creates the creases and gives “camel toe.”   Additionally, some of these problems can’t be solved by a tailor—if you find crease lines pointing from your collar to your armpits, it’s a problem with the flat pattern, and you cannot add fabric into a pre-existing garment to fix that.  Finally, if you find that your clothes have a lot of these creases indicating fit issues, just remember that **your body is not the problem.** It’s a problem with the RTW industry.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I love dusty pinks and mauves.  I cannot express how badly those colors look with my skin. I've had *strangers* ask me if I was ok because they assumed someone who resembled a corpse that much must be actually nearing death.   I love heels and very sleek business casual as well as what I can only call ho-fits. I have bad ankles fr from working on concrete floors too many hours, and take public transportation. It's too much of a risk I could sprain my ankle from how much I walk, and I can't afford another sprain. My office is not business casual or sleek, but a no fuss "just don't wear t-shirts with slogans or anything" type of place. I am decidedly over my ho phase, despite my continued love of the clothes.   My fantasy of wearing heeled booties with a structured fashion blazer over a mauve dress is not any less real just because I have the common sense to not go through with it.  Fashion fantasy is still a valid form of participation!	labels:>I love dusty pinks and mauves.  >I cannot express how badly those colors look with my skin. I've had strangers ask me if I was ok because they assumed someone who resembled a corpse that much must be actually nearing death.  My way around this is that over the past 12-8 months Athleta and Lululemon have had a lot of merchandise in these colors so now I have a bunch of athleisure leggings, joggers, and culottes in shades that would make me look dead if they were anywhere near my face but are okay below the waist.

text:What’s your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:I found a wool midi skirt for $10 at a thrift store, and I *love* it. I feel fancy in it with an off the shoulder cashmere sweater, or comfy if I tuck a t-shirt into it. I also love Oxford heels in place of booties for a daintier look. Black tights, especially ones with subtle polka dot or other whimsical patterns, bring rompers and shorter skirts into the season. I also splurged a bit on a tailored tweed winter coat that makes me feel very put together and feminine.  I wear fleece leggings under everything; other leggings, jeans, skirts, bodysuit, doesn't matter.	episode_done:True
text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.

I wore this once while having to give ‘life advice’ to some ass who was hoarding stuff in covid supermarket stashing days, the name just stuck.   He is quite the creative.	episode_done:True
text:Exactly. It’s the fantasy life that those images convey. When I see someone wearing crisp trousers, soft button ups, stilettos, etc., I imagine that I’m living the life of someone wearing them. Effortless, breezy, maybe wandering around Paris window shopping on a nice spring day... but in reality I’m working from home on my couch. Structured trousers would be uncomfortable AF, cotton/linen blouses would be a wrinkly mess, my cat would get fur everywhere, I’m allergic to wool and I don’t wear shoes in my house, because ew. Or I’m going for a walk in my neighbourhood after work and it’s raining and dark, so I need a waterproof/reflective jacket and sturdy boots. It’s fun to look at pictures of nice styles, but they aren’t my reality.	labels:Ironically, right before the pandemic I was looking at buying a new suit, as I was just months into a new job that required me to be a bit more "business" (at least on 5 or so days a year) than my previous "distracted-professor" type jobs. I'm now glad I hadn't bit the bullet yet.   I just bought a new pair of jeans, as I was wearing out my previous pair.

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I’m queer and get read as straight a lot, so clothing is a tool, albeit one I don’t always feel comfortable using.  The other thing for me is that I sometimes feel like my body is incompatible with queer fashion? I’m pretty fortunate to have a relatively “desirable” body, but I’m short and top-heavy, so I feel like the androgynous queer outfits I like are meant for people much more willowy than I am, the femme-er stuff is more feminine than I feel comfortable with, and the more masc stuff is too masc for me. So I default to just whatever I have that I like, which tends to read as straight, if not quite conventionally feminine and sort of sweater-heavy. And when I’ve leaned into what feels like queer fashion to me, other people tend not to read it that way.  Anyways this was kind of long but to actually answer your questions:  1) Yes I do, though at this point mostly in the form of jewelry and more recently hair 2) Sometimes it means signaling and sometimes it means wearing clothes that (joyously?)  reflect your authentic self even in defiance of cultural norms. I would probably be better off if I figured out which definition I want to define myself with  3) IMO sometimes the stereotypes are a way to signal because the media denies us representation and sometimes they exist because of the representation the media gives us. For people my age (20s) I think it’s more the latter  4) I always feel pressure to present gayer. I think impostor syndrome is common in minority groups and when the thing that makes you different isn’t immediately visible, it’s natural to want to either bury it or lean in and use it as a shield or a signal. I haven’t figured out what that means for me in practice, but the urge is there.	episode_done:True

Keep anything heavy in your personal item/ backpack to avoid overweight items. Jeans or black bottoms go with just about everything and allow you to mix up your outfit. Also roll your clothes rather than folding them flat for optimal space and consider buying a Turkish towel rather than traditional bath towel	episode_done:True

Does anyone have any stylish but functional suggestions? For the time being I've been unhinging my jaw like a snake and fitting everything down my gullet till I need it, but space is limited and I'd like to be able to carry a few more essentials. I really am a purse person.

text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:I love this thread! I was homeschooled by religious, conservative parents for much of my childhood. For a brief period of time, I was only allowed to wear modest dresses, and the rest of the time, I dressed like a stereotypical homeschooler, because we were poor and I wasn’t allowed to wear much.   By the time I was in middle school and earning my own money babysitting, I started to dabble in thrifting. By the end of high school, when I went to public school and eventually had a full time job shortly after graduation, I really got into it. I spent so long learning to be okay with looking different from the status quo that I eventually really learned to embrace it. I’m thirty now, and I love standing out and wearing things that other people say they could never pull off. I also have a body that the fashion industry loves, so that part was easier for me to feel like “I fit in here” (to its discredit- I fully believe it should be inclusive and celebratory of every body).   Really, it’s been a place of refuse where I can feel belonging while still embracing my “weird kid” roots.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:Short of getting a bit of insider info, I think the only way to really have success at those stores is to browse them at least once a week (probably twice).  My aunt tends to go every other day and finds some amazing stuff…because she goes *every other day*.  She says it doesn’t take her long because she’s so familiar with their stock, but it still seems exhausting to me.  (As opposed to spending three hours scrolling through Poshmark in bed every night…)

I think people assume you’re confident just because you’re rocking something unusual!

text:What are your 2021 Fashion / Style Goals?	labels:2021 I'm making an effort.   I can be a middle aged mom, and not be frumpy.   2020 I started out fine, but working from home and covid I sort of gave up. I stopped doing my hair, and stopped putting on makeup.  I stopped exercising (yoga pants and hoodies are so forgiving. Not to mention sports bras and cotton undies rather than sexy lingerie that made me stand up a little bit straighter and smile that secret smile to myself. )  I can be chubbier than I'd like right now, and still have nice style that makes me feel sexy and attractive and good about how I present myself.  I can wear cute shoes and accessorize again, even if I have a mask that covers my smile.   I can also take care of myself and enjoy exercise and healthy foods, and get to a place where I feel better about my body in a swimsuit.

We hauled our purchased goods out in a silver trunk marked “biological waste” and no one was the wiser.  The kids? Oh, we just left them in the vehicle.

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.

text:I love the idea of a weekend wardrobe! I work in an office where everybody is super casual (jeans and T-shirts) that whenever I dress up (wear a cute dress or even mini skirt + stockings in the winter), I get asked if I have plans after work or I end up feeling overdressed. So even if I do feel good when I leave the house, I feel super conscious by the time I get to the office. A weekend wardrobe sounds like a good plan!	labels:I was in the exact same situation as you a couple years ago! When I first started wearing cute clothes to work I def felt self conscious. I'm sure I got a lot of "why the heck is she so dressed up" stares. But I kept dressing cute and eventually people were like oh that's just how she dresses - i.e. you just gotta own it. (I did start slow though, so like I worked my way up from casual to minor upgrades to clothes to more cutesy looks)  Disclaimer: everybody's situation is different and this might not work for you.

I always had a soft spot for that bag and to find it for such a deal was incredible - my hands were shaking when I left the store!

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:I used to always wear jeans and t-shirts too (and still do a lot of the time), but what has helped me is just paying attention to people around me and what they wear. Friends, acquaintances, strangers. For me, this helps a lot more than looking online because I feel like I can't really tell what the clothes look like in real life.  TV shows or movies help too, where I can see how the clothing a character wears contributes to their "vibe" and matches their personality or other things the creators want to show. Sometimes that's even better than real life because so much thought goes into what the characters wear and what it says about them.  A big barrier for me was the cost of buying new clothes when I'm not really sure if I'll like them long-term, so it's helped to borrow or trade clothes with friends to try new things out. One of my friends used to organize a big clothing swap once a year. Thrift stores, Facebook buying & selling groups, and discount places are also a good option.  Another barrier was that I had only really seen fashion as being about creating a feminine image and emphasizing a slim body type. I would always be upset with my body for not looking like that. I've recently learned I feel much more myself in more androgynous and masc clothing, which I think is why I liked jeans and T-shirts so much. Realizing what I actually like to look like makes it feel a lot more natural and intuitive.	episode_done:True

text:Alexander Wang accused of a history of sexual harassment - fashion in a year of reckoning?	labels:Alexander Wang has already been shady and allegations about him groping / assaulting models have been somewhat talked about on Twitter.

Plus didn’t he have R Kelly in one of his campaigns in like 2014 ?	episode_done:True
text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I've been conscious of the impact of just buying junk for a lot of years now, but the current state of the world is just hitting even harder now and it's even MORE important to me that the things I buy are:   1. useful with what I already own,   2. actually going to make me happy longer than the "new stuff" endorphin rush lasts,   3. actually functional and as well-made and low-fuss as possible.   I just want things that I can put on, take off, wash, hang, and wear again time and time again without it being a fight. The 'YAY NEW THING' glow wears off almost by the time you get the shipping notice, so there has to be more reward in it for it to be worth it. There's more joy to be had (more long-lasting joy anyway) with finding new ways to wear old things. If I can remix a piece 9 different ways, I feel pretty baller about it! So that's my focus. If adding something new to the mix will make the remixing easier for lots of other items (a blazer, for example, that means I can wear 5 other tops to work that I couldn't before) then it's probably a good purchase. So I suppose "shop with long-term remixing in mind" is probably my biggest suggestion.  Personally I haven't had much luck thrifting but that's probably due to a champagne taste fighting with a beer budget city. Can't find treasures when the stock isn't super great. That said, we're at least stellar for used outdoor clothing and gear, so I guess I can't complain there.	episode_done:True

text:Ah sorry for the delayed response!!  I was really into Kensie Rebekah Crepe blazers (with satin lining) for a while - they are pretty comfy and come in a ton of fun colors, but some of them looked cheaper than others and I just couldn't put my finger on why other than that perhaps the fabric content wasn't identical with some of the colors, causing some to pile more easily than the others.  I ended up selling a few on poshmark.  I really like the drape and fit of NY&C Ponte/Sweater blazers - they have a longer length than the Kensie ones and feel more casual prep than the Kensie ones - and they are super versatile and comfy, but they have enough structure to feel professional.  I wish I could find more of them but they seem not be sold too often at the official site so I rely on Poshmark - I have one in black and also a heathered tan/oatmeal color.  I have recently gotten into these relaxed/cardigan type blazers that I got through Stitch Fix - FrenchMauve Melanie Knit Tunic Blazer and Skies Are Blue Hannah Modal Scuba Blazer are really comfortable.  They have a similar long length as the NY&C ones but are much less structured - they are more flexible/thinner and feel like a dressed up cardigan that's a tad less professional.  J. Crew also has some nice sweater blazers but it's a bit of a hit or miss for me on fit/cut/drape - good structure though!!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:The joy of cordovan—and how to wear and maintain it	labels:Cordovan is an Instagram dream - it’s lustrous and has a ton of color depth. Unfortunately I find  actually wearing it is a different story. It’s extremely stiff and inflexible, especially during the first 20-30 wears. It’s the coldest leather I’ve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I’ve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I’m glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there’s no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.

Like do you think I'm stupid, I'm not gonna buy sustainable t-shirt from fast fashion brand that clearly doesn't care one bit for sustainable quality clothing and only uses it as marketing word/tag making it totally worthless.

I also had stocked up on tops that need a 3rd piece. But they do not work on their own due to shape, or cut, or something else. I am not really a t-shirt as part of my outfit person, unless it is a graphic tee. And as I got bored of my cardigan, the more wrong these shirts felt.   I feel like I had the most stand alone tops during peplum wave v1.   I realize this puff sleeve moment is the time I need to stock up. The puff sleeve really works for me!

text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession). I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession 🤣

text:What’s a fashion rule you defy (dressing for your shape, weird color combos, interesting silhouettes etc) that you just love?	labels:Oversized on oversized. Lately i like pairing oversized shackets with wide leg or baggy jeans. Maybe it overwhelms my frame but I think it’s cool. Maybe I just look like a bag woman.
text:Haha I’m glad you enjoyed it! I also love seeing other people’s closets. Uncomfortable sleeves are the worst... I used to do that all the time too because “it’s a perfectly good piece of clothing” but it’s not helpful at all if you’re not going to wear it. (Or worse if you wear it and are uncomfortable all day).	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Hi! Former stylist.  1) Pay attention to the fit of things and figure out what cuts and shapes look good on you. Paper bag pants and some joggers have similar fits. Some mini skirts and shorts hit the same place on your legs and can have the same waist height. Find your sweet spot and don’t be afraid to buy multiple things in silhouettes that work for you.   2) Get some statement pieces that you would die for. If you are wearing a pair of jeans that fit well and a t-shit purchased within the past 3 years with some awesome earrings you going to look and feel great. If you are wearing an amazing dress and simple white sneakers you are going to look and feel great. Don’t overthink things but try and wear at LEAST one piece you are excited about at a time.   3) Don’t buy things just cause they are on sale, you saw your friend wearing it, or you feel like you “need” something in your wardrobe. You should love everything in your closet in its own special way unless it’s workwear and you hate your dress code for work. Something as simple as a T-shirt has so many different factors like cut, material, neckline, sleeve length. Purchase what feels good and don’t bother with the rest.

There are a lot of things wrong with LA but it doesn’t appear to be a drop shipping site. They’re a lot like Bronson MFG, only Bronson doesn’t steal contemporary designs.

text:What are your fashion tips for looking good on Zoom?	labels:I think it's all in camera placement and lighting.  Have the camera at eye level or slightly above it. My laptop webcam was at a seriously unflattering angle, even when propped up. I just got a webcam that I put on my main monitor and the angle alone makes me look 10x better.   Get a light source behind your camera that's pointed at your face. Get a ring light if you can. Play around with desk lamps. If you have 2 lamps, try placing them behind the camera, one on each side of you. If you have 1, try placing it behind the camera pointed directly at you, try to bounce the light off the wall, etc. If you're sitting with your back to a window, close your blinds.  What color is your desk chair? Don't wear a shirt that's the same color. Other than that, I think anything goes with respect to fashion. You only really see like 10% of the person's top on videos.  Makeup wise, I like to wipe my face with an oil-blotting sheet to make sure I'm not shiny, lots of blush and bronzer, and  a YLBB shiny lip balm.	episode_done:True
text:Good Cheap Stuff Appreciation	labels:It may be a US thing but Walmart. George brand tees and jeans or chinos (one size smaller than you think) is a clean look followed up with George brogues or "chukka"boots and you're looking better in a $70 outfit than you should!	episode_done:True
text:That would probably be a bad match. Oxford and flannel are good heavier textures. If the pants are dressy, you can't go wrong with broadcloth or twill. Herringbone can make for a nice, soft, in-between shirt. Denim is less summery than chambray.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:I was definitely in my feelings after the Gen Z vs Millennial fashion thread, and after months where I've only bought a few items on poshmark, I ended up placing two orders trying to prove to myself that im not an old millennial that doesn't know how to dress. and then i bought some new athletic gear because I had already warmed up my credit card so, fuck it budget to the wind.	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:Yeah, I wear dresses probably like 80-90% of the time, I think, and usually if I'm not wearing a dress then I'm wearing a skirt! For me it's just that it's easier to find dresses and skirts that fit better off the rack so they need a lot less tailoring, whereas jeans and trousers need a lot of tailoring for me and it gets expensive and time-consuming.  I have a lot of jumpers because I often wear them over a dress in autumn/winter, but otherwise my selection of tops is woefully pitiful haha. I quite like a nice lightweight camisole tucked into shorts or a skirt in summer though! But generally I don't wear a lot of separates (easier to coordinate that way too 😆).	episode_done:True
text:Mid 30s, and this all rang so true for me. It was a sad day when I was finally honest with myself and realized I just don’t like “going shopping” anymore.  I used to be able to spend hours combing through the racks at Last Call or Off 5th looking for an amazing deal or whatever struck my fancy.   Now I know what I want, I want to price check a few other sites to make sure I’m getting a decent price, and I want to be done with it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:This + good lighting.   &#x200B;  It may be worth investing in a ring light (there are some good ones for 15-25$)	labels:Ah that's a really good idea, thank you! I thought only influencers used them lol, but I bet they're great for wfh too.
text:What are you hoping to buy on Black Friday?	labels:I haven’t planned yet but I’m glad of a few weeks to prep.  Most importantly, I need new running and hiking shoes (different ones) and would love to nab them on sale.  I’d also love to grab new socks and tights and replace some worn out pairs in my drawer, and maybe score one great underwire bra to complement my bralettes. Optionally, id also love a new swimsuit, but it’s very easy to pick the wrong size online.   In sartorial matters, I have been doing luxury minimalism for a long time and would love to score some loud accessories - a new everyday handbag in warm brown/ taupe tones (I have several in black but none in brown), some statement jewelry or scarves. I am also in the market for really adventurous, ethereal pieces, like big dresses, loud coats, colorful blouses, and structured pants.	episode_done:True

text:How would you style or rebuild your wardrobe around your holy grail fashion piece?	labels:Pear shape with a big arse - I want Lauren Bacall style wool trousers. Fluid, full, and fitting just so on the waist. Styled classic for work with an equally full and fluid washed silk shirt, rolled up sleeves and tucked in with a patent waist belt. For brunch dates with a bateau neck tee that fits like a second skin, and for evenings with a low backed long sleeved version of the same. A chunky, cropped length fisherman’s jumper if theres a chill on casual strolls
text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:it depends on the item of clothing? like I do laundry weekly, but I wash things separately. sheets and towels etc are washed with an unscented soap in one load, certain clothes are hand washed and line dried, some clothes are run in a cold cycle, some clothes are worn multiple times before washing. so it varies widely but laundry every 1-2 weeks makes sense for me when I’m only doing my own laundry

My scrub store didn’t have too many options for tall women and this was one of my only options (they do regular and petite too!). They didn’t have a variety of styles at the store I went to but I later saw they have a lot of variety. My biggest thing is that they fit nicely, stretched well, and material was comfortable as I am super sensitive to materials. My friends have their “yoga” style and it’s nicer and more form fitting. I haven’t strayed from this brand yet.	episode_done:True
text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I think the biggest miracle was when my favorite summer top (a black tight crop top with lots of straps in the back) came back in stock. It was on sale (it was too expensive for me to get at full-price) and was sold out before I got my hands on it. I checked the site over and over if it was back. One lucky day, I was in the cafeteria with my friends and eating lunch, I decided to check it again. And it was back, only one piece, and in my size! You can guess how fast I clicked the order button.  My second best miracle was finding black Dr. Martens at TK Maxx for only 50€ (they sell for about 200€ usually). They've been my fall and winter staple ever since.	episode_done:True

text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:Here's the best advice I've ever heard in my life: No one is looking at you, thinking about you, critiquing you as much as you think they are.  Everyone is busy looking at, thinking about, critiquing themselves.  So wear what makes you happy! Try new things!   Edited for concision.
text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:Coach has really upped their game the past few years and you can get a really good quality genuine leather bag that could last a long time. They also have relatively good sales around holidays!  I personally wouldn’t dip into the Michael Kors / Kate Spade of it all unless you get it from the outlets. I’ve found their bags can sometimes be made with cheaper materials and don’t last as long.  I do really like the Rebecca Minkoff bags I’ve had.
text:What are some stores/brands that have surprised you?	labels:Old Navy has surprised me - their athletic collection is great. Some of the best leggings I own! Also like another comment stated, Abercrombie has come back in my rotation due to their rebrand
text:Alexander Wang accused of a history of sexual harassment - fashion in a year of reckoning?	labels:I work in fashion and feel that the rage and “do the right thing” mentality only lasts as long as everyone sticks together (during a moment like #metoo or the protests after the murder of George Floyd.) A lot of people working in fashion are on a gig-by-gig basis so it’s Everyman for himself as far as success goes. People will turn a blind eye to the wrong doings of companies if it means that they themselves can get another paycheck or take a step up the ladder. It’s not that they themselves are immoral but it’s a hard industry to make it in and you can feel powerless when you’re not at the top. When you are on your own, which is most days, you will lose sight of the bigger picture of an ideal future.  For example this summer I read that FreePeople implemented racist practices within their stores. I added them to a list of companies that I didn’t want to work for (I’m freelance.) A month ago I was offered an opportunity to work with them and even though on principal I didn’t want to, I still considered it because I need a paycheck and the name would be good for me to have on my resume and would lead to more work.  Until their are unions to protect freelancers the fashion industry will remain corrupt. Everyone is afraid of being blacklisted and/or broke.

This just isn't yellow sundress with sandals vibes. I hope, hope, hope summer 2021 is different.	labels:Ugh... I'm super, super lucky to be in an okay place financially during these times, but I haven't done any shopping at all since the pandemic hit because I never leave the house.

text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Nothing that needs to be dry cleaned except winter coats. Hate the smell, hate the bother, hate the expense.  No glitter, no metallic thread. I like it on other people, but on me it makes me feel like I’m wearing a costume. Sequins and paillettes only on formal evening wear (for me).  No dolman sleeves (for me). I don’t like how they look on my busty inverted triangle shape.
text:Tailoring as a lifestyle choice - Suiting in The Crown	labels:Very interesting read, I’ve never seen The Crown but I might have to check it out!

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.

text:I've tried that but feel like the outfits are too much for a casual stop at the grocery store. Any tips on that?	labels:I look for ways they can be made more casual by focusing on the silhouettes or components. My Pinterest is full of wool trousers, delicate gauzy blouses, full skirts, and chunky sweaters. I probably wouldn't wear an outfit with all of those components to the grocery store, but I might wear mom jeans with a pretty blouse and Keds, or a more casual skirt with a chunky sweater and some flat ankle boots, for example.
text:Your 2021 trend predictions?	labels:i think fancy loungewear is going to keep being a thing for a while, and 70s style maxi dresses too for the long, flowing, glam-but-comfy thing, but once the pandemic is over i could see things going the opposite way and super structured, tailored pieces become more fashionable. i definitely think that when we can safely go out again maximalism will be big - lots and lots of accessories, chunky jewellery, sequins and glitter.
text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:I would suggesting even wearing a more business causal version of your current style and then fine tuning it from there. You always want to look nice on your first day/week and rather be over dress than underdress.   I also feel like if you set the bar too low, when you do start dressing up it becomes more noticeable than when you start dressing down. In experience people are less likely to point out how causal you look but the will point out when you dress up. It's not usually ill-will, more like oh do you have a special event or whatever later?   We have a pretty casual office and we have a lot of people in varying function and formality. We have a lot of jeans and tees, but we also have people in button downs&slacks, dresses and heels, etc. Also literally, we had a guy on campus that wore a wizard hat all the time. At the end of the day, no one really cares.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:I pretty much exclusively buy second hand/ thrifted clothes as I can get MUCH better quality clothing than if I were to buy new. I tend to buy off eBay, depop and vinted. I search for the brands I live pretty frequently (just the brand name, no other filters) then see newly listed items. I regularly pick up sezane, self-portrait, COS, Claudie Pierlot items at really low prices. It helps when people don't know the brand so well (Claudie Pierlot for example- just bought a perfect condition puffer jacket RRP £350, currently on the outnet for £169...I got it for £15.) Or for example a brand new La Perla full length night dress for £20.  I think it helps that I also sell a lot, so if an item isn't quite right I sell it on.	episode_done:True

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls” catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your “fashion house designers” but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I’ve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.

Latching on to "rules" makes it easier both for advice receiver (easier to understand) and easier for advice giver as well.

text:Goals and Resolutions Check in: February	labels:My goals are going well! A couple of ours are essentially the same. Good luck, we got this!  1) Wardrobe Overhaul  At the beginning of the year, all I owned was athleisure. I was a very cozy, but very bored, person. So I’m working on filling my wardrobe with clothes that really make me happy, and it’s working! I’m in a fortunate position right now, so I’ve been spending the last stimulus check on ThredUp and Poshmark. I gotta say I am loving online thrifting.  2) Dress for my emotions rather than comfort.  Part of moving away from athleisure. My clothes really influence how I feel, so dressing up to look like a badass bitch makes me feel like a badass bitch. Even on days I work at home, I wear outfits to emotionally prep myself to enjoy being productive. I change into pjs when my work is done for the day, so I actually get to look forward to my comfy clothes rather than feel like it’s just another lazy day in leggings.  3) Focus on fit and proportions.  This one is harder but is making me feel the most ~fashionable~. I’m trying to identify how/why certain pieces work on me while others look slightly off. I take videos of myself where I make a bunch of tiny adjustments to my outfits to identify the little details I do or don’t like. This is definitely the biggest of my goals, and will take a long time to really figure out. I can often tell when something isn’t right about an outfit, but identifying that element is tricky.

text:What are your coziest winter finds/essentials?	labels:This year I've finally come to the realization that I can layer all the sweaters I want, I'm still going to feel cold if my legs are cold. So I got merino wool tights from Icebreaker (the 260 weight) to layer when I'm outdoors, as well as a couple of pairs of cheap "fur-lined" leggings for lounging at home (purchased from whatever Instagram brand advertised them to me first, I'm ashamed to admit). The wool tights are great of course, as expected, but the cheap leggings are a pleasant surprise! They fit decently although they're not as high-waisted as I would personally like, and they are definitely warm.	episode_done:True

text:Thank you for this thoughtful and helpful answer! I come from the opposite end, full closet, constantly shifting from boho to grunge and then to sporty again until I was fed up with the whole "I don't know what to wear" thing - I never understood what exactly I liked about a clothing piece or style.  I ended up with some good quality basic pieces, not boring, functional, versatile and now I try to build from there. What I am really looking for are clothing pieces, in which an idea, a thought was invested - meaning there is something deliberate about it, interesting cut, texture, print. But I also want them to work together with other things I own.   Thank you for recommending Gianni and Comme des Garcons, I have some things from them and they are more affordable for me. I also like COS for good fabrics and robustness, but then again it is quite popular where I live and many people shop there too. Arket is even cheaper, but it is a little bland for me. There are also some european brands like Closed or Baum und Pferdgarten, Essentiel Antwerp, however it always depends on a particular season/trend whether I find something there or not.	labels:> Baum und Pferdgarten  Ohhh I love them, my local boutique has finally started carrying this and it’s so fun!	episode_done:True

text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:I can’t stand faux leather. Not for shoes, bags, clothes; anything. Plastic can start to degrade after some time (6-10 years). I had some faux leather hiking boots that turned to mush just sitting in their box in my closet. The handles on faux leather purses start to peel and the bottoms wear very fast. They simply do not hold up like leather.  I have vintage Dooney&Bourke leather bags that are 25+ years old. I keep them polished, clean and in dust bags when not in use and they look new.  If you can afford a genuine leather bag, even secondhand, it is the best choice imo.

text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I work in an engineering office, where the men usually wear a dress shirt + pants Mon-Thu and khaki + polo on Fri. My interpretation of “casual Friday” isn’t necessarily dressed down, but showing more of my personal style. I usually wear neutral coloured blouse + skirt, and on Fridays wear the same type of outfit but with a brighter colour and/or louder pattern, with bolder accessories.   Eg. Thursday is blue striped button down shirt and black pencil skirt. Friday is buttoned up Kelly green cardigan with a panda brooch, and shorter houndstooth a-line skirt.	episode_done:True

I love their channels and their styles . (Even though my own style is of course different but I do want to incorporate some elements of their style into mine and make it my own because that’s what style to me kinda is I guess lol. )   Other than that nothing or no one really comes to mind.

text:Store closings at malls	labels:I pretty infrequently went to the mall, but stores closing retail locations really doesn't impact their online store much. It can, if the stores are fulfilling the orders, but most major brands should be adapted to online long before today and are able to fulfill orders. It impacts the business in that they're not getting the retail location revenue but they're already established online with processes and can usually just adapt. Unfortunately, brands with retail locations can't be like Amazon because Amazon's business is really hosting the retail of other brands with some of its own products, which means it has more resources and volume to make various returns, deliveries, etc. more efficient. It's not without its issues itself. Unfortunately, it's a hard time for retailers. :(	episode_done:True

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:What length skirts do you gravitate toward?  Most of my skirts/dresses are mini or midi length, so I usually wear ankle boots or knee high boots.  I like my ankle boots to hit at the thinnest part of my ankle (right above the bone) and my knee high boots just below my knees.    I’m not a huge fan of mid calf, because that cuts off my leg in an awkward place and I don’t have enough leg to be doing that. (I’m 5’1”.)  My choice of boot depends on  1) how cold it will be 2) how long I’ll be in the cold 3) my coat  For example, if I’m going for a girls night (pre covid) I might decide to wear a mini with ankle boots, but have a longer coat that I can keep me warm if we’re moving around.  If I’m going to the farmers market, I might decide to wear a midi dress with knee high boots and a wool coat, so I can take my time.  I’m a big fan of knee high boots with midi dresses and long coats. The overlap really keeps out the cold. It’s definitely a 70s kind of vibe which isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. but maybe people will come around because Nicole Kidman rocked this vibe in the undoing...	episode_done:True

Removing those updates from brands and sales and such was helpful, especially since we're so inundated with online marketing nowadays.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:Hello there I am new here in this subreddit 😅  Anyways I have been eye-ing for a shoe that I have been interested for a while now, that particular shoe are the "Nike Cortez Leather" (Red And Blue Varsity) which I very have grown accustomed to. I have researched this shoe and even watch certain reviews for it that I conclude that I want to buy it.  However in my case getting this variant of this shoe and to my proper size has been quite a challenge for me. It's availability is quite rare in my Country (SEA) and all the shoes that I have found are either fake knockoffs and well soldout ads for other shoe websites.  Recently within my dedication to get this shoe, I thought of just buying the "Basic" Variant of the Cortez, and dissapointment follows as I picked the wrong size for my shoe (in my haste to buy the shoe) I measured my foot and it is exactly 26cm and and alongside with the confusion for the knowledge of the older shoe that I bought which is US 12 and EU 44 "World Balance Freeman" it confused me and well....... I bought a Large Shoe 😂 (specifically I bought the size 12 Basic Cortez). Although I placed an exchange size for an US 11, I might be in a pickle since it will still be big for me lol.  Now anyways to finally ask my question, If by somehow the exchange US 11 were still too big for me, Can I wear a WOMANS "Nike Cortez Leather" instead???? For that I will also need advice for the sizing and basically an expert knowledge in this situation. In my case all that is available for this shoe are for Womans Shoe, and within my research I read that Nike Shoes are Unisexual (but for now I need an Experts Advice on this matter) really in a pickle, so pls help ma dudes.	episode_done:True
text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:The company already made money off of the original purchase of the shirt, so you buying second hand doesn’t really benefit them in any way.

If someone asks where the piece is from, just say you don’t know so they won’t be tempted to buy from the brand lol

text:And that may very well be. My idea for wanting to set up a capsule wardrobe was because in the last 5 years, I've moved 7 times, so I'm trying to keep my clothing as little as possible. With a capsule wardrobe, I can have, say, 20-30 pieces and 50+ outfits with them instead of having 20-30 pieces of non-matching color schemes and having maybe 20 outfits.	labels:I feel like I'm just being an enabler here, but I've moved 10 (!) times in the past 7 years and what takes up the most room isn't clothes -- it's shoes! So if you can pare down your shoe collection to go with most of your clothes I think you wouldn't have trouble having a large-ish wardrobe.

text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I'd get a really nice piece of outerwear, either a coat in a quality material like wool or a leather or shearling jacket. If you live somewhere with colder weather during part of the year, outerwear is something you'll be wearing all the time so it's worth investing in a piece that's great quality, keeps you warm and makes a statement. I think an amazing jacket or coat will elevate even the most basic outfit, whether it's a more classic piece, something utilitarian like a puffer jacket or something more extravagant. Personally I think Acne, Chloe and Tibi are brands that make great high-end outerwear in a variety of styles.

To start shopping for me it is helpful to have an idea of what I'm looking for or what stores I like so it doesn't get overwhelming.  I also recommend beginning to look online. It is easier to do a little at a time and you can see what's in stock at stores near you.   Also recommend depop!!

I have also noticed that when I wear pieces that I love, my confidence increases throughout the day. Sometimes I have moments in the day where I look down and think "dang, this outfit is cool and I feel cool!" Those moments just give me a boost of confidence all on their own. The last thing is that people are generally too busy with their own lives to notice what you're wearing. They're doing them, so do you and have fun with it!   edit-words

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting our 'Finding A Style and Building A Wardrobe' guide	labels:one thing i noticed in my fashion journey is the effect that location has on style, and to be aware of it. is it something you like, or dislike?  i went to college in the north east in the late 2000s and it was all prep all the time. i was in academia at the time, and fully embraced prep into my life, even though it felt like a facade.  then i moved to NYC and  i stuck out like a sore thumb lol. slowly, and without realizing it over the course of a couple years, my style went from typical new england prep with lots of fake pearls and plaid and corduroy and navy and JKP lusting, to all black all the time city girl.  i LOVE my style now, it just feels very "me" and can't ever imagine wearing a navy blazer again in my life. but if i was to move to the north east again, or down south or somewhere else with a different local aesthetic i would pay a lot more attention to my buying choices to make sure i   maintain my style in a way that i like, and if i ever decide to change it up to make it a conscious decision. it would have saved me a lot of money during that transition period when i had no cohesive items to wear together.  a navy wool blazer from jack wills doesn't really go with leather shorts!  &#x200B;  \[edit\] i'm not sure how it would be worked into the guide, though. maybe when talking about climate which heavily affects people's fashion choices and is also very regional, regional (even hyperlocal, different neighborhoods in NYC dress very differently) style trends could also be mentioned?   it would have been helpful for me when moving to a new city to have had that seed planted in my head. if you're freshly moved or have been living in a place for a while and want a new style, look at the people around you! they'll probably be wearing clothes that can be found locally, and if you like how people dress it's a great way to get inspiration on what's current in that area.   it's also great because if you DON"T like how people are dressing you can consciously make the decision to avoid those choices.

text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:Logos are *trademarked. Clothing designs are... a more grey area. Like, a v neck knit sweater can only be designed so many ways, you know? However there are some instances where parts of a design are copyrighted, like i think the red soles on Loubitons, which i cannot spell, are copyrighted/trademark. Prints and artwork are a whole other story.  There are a lot of factors and copyright and intellectual property law also differs from country to country - there is no international copyright law, just general agreements between specific countries.  I personally feel that knockoffs and replicas are different. Replicas are illegal as they are faking an item AND copying the logo. Knockoffs that just copy the design... not illegal, generally speaking. Ethical? Truly depends on the situation.  In your specific examples, yeah theyre probably inspired by Sezane but tbh theyre not really dupes, there are clear design differences in each example.

text:Researchers use AI machine learning to let people try on clothes virtually based on just two separate images	labels:Pretty fun and niche crossover between fashion and visual machine learning I thought I'd share. It's based on Style Generative Adversarial Networks (StyleGAN) where there's been a lot of innovation and leaps in recent years in machine learning research.  The application to consumer is pretty nice for "virtual try-ons", but also there's a business case for better promo/model pictures for online stores too.

My color 8, black and cigar shoes all deal really well with rain and mud and I find them much easier to clean than calf skin/cow hide boots. Now that I think of it, maybe there’s so much rain here that they now have ’even‘ stains. Shell shoes can be enjoyed as heavy beaters, I believe.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:<rant>  If I said "Wear cropped jackets so you look taller" I'd be laughed out of the room but somehow "Short people shouldn't wear long coats" is a valid thing?   Also what's defined as short? If someone is 5'7" do they get to wear long coats? What if they're 5'7.5"??  It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering". If you care so much about these gender norms, masculinity and being ~ flattering ~ then sack up and wear the clothes you like.   That whole thread is just people saying that someone else told them they couldn't *wear a coat* so what should they do? Oh idk. How about tell them to fuck off and wear the damn coat.  </rant>
text:Derek Guy: The Crown’s ‘Balmoral Test’ Barbours Are Not Just Jackets	labels:It's the one reason I can't stomach Barbour, the upper crust British association rankles. It's reflexive. I love other British producers, have Trickers (official shoemaker for the Prince of Wales no less), Cheaneys and a good chunk of my wardrobe is SEH Kelly but that landed gentry aesthetic from Barbour just doesn't sit. I'd say it's an Irish thing but there's no shortage of people walking around Dublin in Barbour and I even remember a period in the late 80's / 90s when wax jackets were all the rage in rural Mayo.

text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:Zella is a one of Nordstrom’s private label brands that they develop themselves; the Live in Legging (which I’m guessing is the legging you know and love) is a replenishment item that they continually carry inventory of year round and increase their purchasing quantities to support the increase in demand going into the NSale, meaning that you’ll find a mix of inventory that was in their network before the sale started and inventory that flowed in to support the sale. Usually with replenishment items you’re not likely to see a shift in quality or production since the sale is a long planned for event and margin is built in across the year to support the promotion during the sale. Special items that are just purchased for the sale, or for any off price retailer, then yes - absolutely, you’re likely to be getting a lower quality product since buyers and vendors have margin targets they still need to protect so they need to make compromises somewhere when they’re planning to sell the bulk of the units at a discount.	episode_done:True

One thing I do often though, is air clothes out, even if they don't smell, specially if it's clothes that touch my skin directly, like tshirts and tight fitting knits etc, these items might seem clean and free of smells but if left in the wardrobe for a long time, will start to smell, airing them extends the freshness.  The only exception is pants and socks, they are washed after every use.	episode_done:True

text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:They offer a "from scratch" option on the website. Don't start from anything, have them measure you and make that jacket. They're being firmly lazy with you, you have to be firm and demand a good fit.  The store I walked into, the guy promised that their new "custom - from scratch" option included things like armhole size, shoulder slope etc. So that has to be the way to go.  Contact Black Lapel and see if they can do that. If not....  Where are you? Kent Wang MTM offers a *ton* of options, but it's NYC only. There's Spier and Mackay, Imparali... What's your budget, around $1200?
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:In the Before Times I would host one or two per year--I would make a facebook event and invite maybe 20 people (and just text friends who didn't have social media) and I'd usually get around 10 folks that showed up. I usually served mimosas and encouraged people to bring hors d'oeuvres so that it was also a little brunch gathering too. Some of the pieces I got from those have given me the most mileage over the years, and often they're items I never would have thought to look for!   I don't know if I'd do the digital ones, feels more like thrifting given the shipping cost and these days I prefer to buy secondhand via poshmark and whatnot since I am better able to find exactly what I'm looking for. Personally I'd be comfortable right now with an in person swap that takes place entirely outside (with mask required to use the bathroom) with a very small group of people I know, but I don't want to put pressure to do that on anyone else so I've just donated my clean-out clothes. Plus half the fun is trying something on and having your friends help you decide to keep it or leave it, and I don't know how I'd make that work outdoors. God I miss pre-2020...

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:I have a diploma in fashion design and worked in the industry off and on for 15 years, and have been a hobby knitter for about 20 years, I would say creating something that looks store bought takes far fewer hours of practice, and there's far less to know with knitting.  Knitting is just so much more rudimentary.  Once you learn the basic stitches and get a decent tension, you are pretty much on your way, if you are patient and can follow basic instructions like a recipe, you'll make something good.  Be thorough, swatch and block, and buy good yarn.  I think one if the biggest issues I see with home sewists is incorrect fabric choice, it makes a very big difference in a finished product, and is usually my first tip that something is homemade.  Notions are another big one, good quality, professional looking notions are a lot harder to find in retail stores.  Stitch choices, stitch quality, proper cutting, finishing methods are also all big giveaways that make stuff look unprofessional, and unless you have industrial machines and tools, some of that is out of your control.  But with enough practice you can get some pretty decent homemade products in a lot of clothing categories.  Stuff like jeans, leather, fur, swimwear, I think are always best left to professionals with specialized tools.  Reading up on fabrics and practicing high end finishing techniques is a good start.	episode_done:True

I caught a couple of those amazing sales and I added a lot items. I got a really good  "ooo 75% off!" high. Then I looked at the cart and logged off. I never actually purchased the items.

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:Hi! As a stylist I get this question ALOT. For starters don't get rid of too much before buying replacements. What ends up happening is we get rid of everything without establishing what pieces we actually need.   Start with establishing your personal style. What do your want your closet/style to be? What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping! Now that you have a moodboard and list of things you need you can shop to fin in the gaps and more importantly you can shop with intention!   &#x200B;  I hope that wasn't too much and was helpful haha. I'm always happy to help.

text:Can Your Outfit Influence the Way You Feel? Enclothed cognition describes the effect that clothing have on how an individual thinks, feels, and behaves	labels:I have said this before when people ask me why I try to make an effort to dress up even for non-formal occasions. I dress well (hopefully anyway) because it is like wearing a suit of armour, it protects me and helps me feel the the best version of myself.	episode_done:True
text:How many distinctly different outfits do you have?	labels:I don’t think you should have to change unless you wanted to:) You sound like you have a fantastic wardrobe that works for you and brings you joy. I also love neutrals, wines, and forest greens and I don’t think there is anything wrong with it!   Perhaps some people might not notice, but the same people may not notice even if you had a diverse wardrobe because they may not be too interested in clothing in general. So please don’t let that discourage you.  I think it’s lovely how you pick clothes that have details that set them apart from others, and I think the people you meet often or people who enjoy style and clothing may notice and appreciate the differences.   There is also quite a large capsule wardrobe community these days so you might find that interesting. Everyone does it a little differently so you might want to browse around a bit to find someone who does something similar (some are more rigid than others), but capsule wardrobes tend to have focus on quality over quantity, and appreciating the smaller details. Maybe you’ll find some inspiration without any pressure of having to drastically change your wardrobe;)	episode_done:True
text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:This style was trending waaaay before the pandemic in the slow fashion world. Oversized prairie dresses, loose billowy tops, elastic waist wide leg linen pants, dresses that resemble paper sacks, etc. I always wanted to try some of these styles but at work I mostly wore fitted and the more traditionally feminine  business causal clothing. To me a lot of the slow fashion stuff looked comfortable but not something I could pull off in the office and I always had a mental block about justifying spending money on clothes outside of work wear. Now that I don’t go into the office I’ve spent a ton of money on these types of items, and I suspect there are a lot more like me.	episode_done:True
text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I did a no buy from June 2018 to June 2019 because I was getting married and then some other life things happened right after. What it did for me was made me realize how much I didn’t need to buy clothing like I had been, and it made me transition to buy almost solely secondhand. I’m still buying almost completely secondhand, but, I have relaxed a bit because 2020 is a shit year and I told myself that, if I can afford something without financial hardship, than get it if I want it.	episode_done:True

text:Villanelle's Killer Wardrobe, Once Again	labels:I'm usually paying attention to her face because she's such a great actress but I had a lot of fun looking at these outfits and paying some more attention to them. I find it interesting trying to break out what she wears when she's not playing a character and what she wears when she's trying play a character or when she's not trying but still is being manipulative. (**POSSIBLE SPOILERS UP TO END OF S3: DON'T READ AHEAD IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED AND DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED ALSO IF SOMEONE KNOWS HOW TO BLOCK THEM OUT AND CAN LET ME KNOW THAT'D BE AWESOME)**  &#x200B;  The little girlish dress with the cut out heart when she's pleading with her mom to form some kind of relationship with her and the pink dress when she's trying to trick Konstantin into thinking she's worried about him so she can steal the card with the next job on it.  When she's feeling herself and doesn't have to play a character she's usually wearing a patterned suit or some comfy black pants and a cool top. When she was playing Billie she wore two kimono-inspired jackets, which is pretty interesting and I just noticed the continuity for that character. When she was starting over after she thought Eve was dead she's wearing stylish romantic dresses which match her new villa in a way.    &#x200B;  **END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS**  &#x200B;  Anyway I enjoyed the album, she has a really interesting style and wears everything so well.	episode_done:True

text:"Can people just hate fashion again" - Synecdoche When Talking about the "Industry" Discussion	labels:> Should spaces & industries for fashion lovers, clothes lovers, and people that have to wear clothes be completely separate?  I don’t think that any of these groups should be completely separate however I do find them all being lumped into the same spaces very frustrating as someone who does love fashion as a form of art and creativity.  I like harsh and blunt constructive criticism in pretty much all areas of life and I most certainly want it for my outfits as well. I want to hear what other fashion lovers and artists think of my colour choices, proportions, textures, fit, etc. and be able to refine those things and really flex my creative muscles when creating an outfit. Instead, many fashion spaces are dominated by ‘you do you hun!’ and ‘so long as you like it, that’s all that matters!’ which is great for someone *who has to wear clothes* and doesn’t actually care about fashion but joins fashion spaces because they feel some obligation as a woman to care about it but... those spaces just become unhelpful and bland for those who really love fashion and want to get better at it.  I’ve been an off and on follower of FFA for a few years and I feel like it’s definitely dominated by the “people who wear clothes” group and unfortunately it limits the amount of critique that is acceptable to give.

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.

I'll have a bag of clothes lying around forever so I can “take it to goodwill” or “sell them on poshmark” but I never do. ThredUp either sells my clothes to a new owner or recycles them and maybe I even get a couple bucks out of it.
text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I feel the opposite, right feel like almost every “outfit” I see influencers in nowadays is just jeans and t-shirt. If they weren’t hot and young, the same outfit would get dragged. Like mom jeans and a giant tucked t-shirt that looks like it came from Walmart and we’re raving about Bella Hadid’s style. I find it very hard to find fashion influences for adult women that aren’t super basic, skewed super young, or just generic preppy “put a blazer over it!” J-crew style. The only place I see any creativity at all is in super high end fashion, but that’s not within the reach of most of us. The whole fashion industry in general is skewed so young, it’s like after 30 they think I should just wear a sack. The only reason the super high end brands cater to an older demographic at all is that older wealthy women are the only ones that buy their clothes. Any price point below that is plain plain basic city

text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:There's only one person who wears a perfume I don't mind, and that's a woman in my office who makes her own perfume. The first version was giving one of the people in our office headaches, so she changed up the components and that solved that problem. For me, most perfumes trigger headaches at best, and migraines at worst, so I avoid people who wear perfume. It seems like perfume has become less prevalent in recent years, and as far as I'm concerned I'm thrilled about that since it's difficult to avoid scents as a health trigger.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I work in a food safety lab, so we have to wear lab coats, uniforms, and even specific shoes. My off-duty wardrobe is, like everyone else's in our position, larger than it needs to be.  But since I live in a colder climate, I've gotten really into outerwear like coats & scarfs since that's the one thing I can control every single day on my way to and from work!  When I first started in my lab, I didnt want to put on a whole new outfit when I got home because I'm lazy and hate doing laundry.  But after a while, I got to the point where I just wanted to feel cute and like myself! These days I basically change outfits entirely in the evening when I get home just to have a little style in my day.  I also started wearing my "special occasion" clothes more regularly too since when else are we gonna wear them?!  Last night I wanted to look cute but didnt want to put any effort into it, so I put on a chiffon tank top and cozy sweater with nice leggings.  And you know what - I felt fancy as fuck sitting on my couch eating burritos with my husband.  I've decided that it's just about finding that balance between needing to feel put together at some point during your day/life, and how much effort you want to put in.	episode_done:True

If you want to do actual apparel design, sketching, building concepts, technical design, etc I don’t see how you’re getting in the door without a degree unless you have an EXCEPTIONAL portfolio, even at at ‘mid-range’ brand whatever that is. Even FIT grads with exceptional portfolios have a tough time finding a job.   As someone who has worked in fashion in New York for over 20 years and hired for countless entry level positions, take it from me: you have to do the work.

text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:Age plays far less of a role than lifestyle.   If "fashion" is done right for the common man it's lockstep with lifestyle providing functionality and a look that's still flattering, interesting and portrays an image the wearer wishes to project.   That's age indiscriminate really.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:As a maximalist, I just mix whatever colours, textures and patterns resonate with me. I don't love super strict rules about how many colours we should wear or whatever. More is more and fashion should be fun and have a sense of humour. I especially like making references to particular vibes (e.g. Latin American drug lords with colourful print shirts and gold chains, but really exaggerate it and make it more fashion-y).  Obviously, not everyone feels the same way. You do you.	episode_done:True

text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:I buy/wear items that I like, whether they are in style or not, whether they are considered classic or not. For example, I love high waist pants and maxi skirts - both were "trendy" a couple years ago and I'm so glad they were produced more as a result. I will keep wearing them even though they're no longer trendy, because I love how they look and feel, even if no one else is wearing them.   Another example for me: neutral colors are considered classic, as well as patterns like plaid and houndstooth. But I love fun colors and funky patterns, so those are what I wear most, no matter if others are wearing different styles.  Just because something is labeled classic or trendy by social media, fashion brands, retailers, etc. doesn't mean that we have to adhere to them. You can wear whatever style you like, whenever you like, regardless if others woild label those items trendy or classic.	episode_done:True

text:20 Sweaters for Less Than $150, So You Can Achieve Peak Coziness - Esquire.com	labels:So I shopped for knits from Uniqlo to BR, Jcrews. Then I upgraded to Harley of Scotland/Howlin -> handknitted Inverallan/Northern Watter.  Every single upgrade I see an increase in material quality, craftsmanship, and design.  I absolutely think your baseline should be around 70ish (used from ebay). Harley, Jamieson, and some brands about that price point are what you want to have. The Japanese made some good one too if you can get it proxy. Beams+ have some good ones and sales randomly, you have to keep checking though. Inis Meain is rare to come across at a low price. I bought one luckily from an eBay auction and it was 150 already for a cardigan.  If you are really into it, Inverallan, Northern Watters are what you wanna seek after.

text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Many years ago I moved from Hawaii to college in the Northeast. I would recommend 1) Buying it all there, because they'll have what's good for their climate and 2) starting out with cheaper options (thrifted, Old Navy, Target range) even if it's not quite your style. Don't spend much time, effort, and money until you see how you really feel after at least a year of seasons. Maybe you want warmer stuff than you thought you would, or realize you should invest in nicer socks, or discover you don't actually like turtlenecks, or shift to a different style when you're surrounded by a new area's vibe. Let yourself experience it for a bit without pressuring yourself to do it all right.

It drives me crazy that influencers constantly advertise clothes from cheap retailers because I know they are getting the outfits for free/are getting paid to post about them. The loungewear sets are thin and warp when you wash them. The dresses are paper thin. Bathing suits feel like they’re going to fall apart. But they say “omg look how cute!” for a buck.   They also advertise the Walmart delivery service saying “omg, ordered this from Walmart 2 hours ago and it’s already here!”   If they were advertising quality clothing from sustainable companies that’s a whole different story.	episode_done:True

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:Any time you're paying more than a few thousand dollars for a basic article of clothing, you're paying for the brand; because you could have that same blazer or pair of trousers custom made by a tailor/dressmaker in the same or better quality, for a lower price.  This was the case in the 50s and 60s as well, but at the time, high quality clothing was more common, sewing skills were more common, clothes were expected to last longer, and the general public had a better understanding of what good-quality clothing looks like; people bought Chanel expecting quality construction, of course, but the main appeal of buying from a prominent Parisian fashion house was knowing that anything Chanel made would be in fashion for the upcoming years.  Now that we are immersed in fast fashion, nobody has the knowledge to hold luxury brands accountable, and fashions change so quickly that a well-made 'up-to-date' jacket from a reliably fashionable brand would be a pointless investment.  It just doesn't make sense anymore for luxury brands to invest too much on quality if there is no longer any demand for quality.  This is not *only* a recent thing: I've seen gowns from the court of Marie Antoinette made of materials costing 30+ years of a working man's wages, yet were hastily thrown together with big, sloppy stitches and tacks.  That's just what happens when your client wants their garment *right now* and will only wear it once or twice.  If you want something that's really well-made and is going to last a long time, there is certainly a market niche for that, but it's become more of a middle-class niche for people who *specifically* care about quality and durability.
text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:The present always feels “neutral”. I think if you watch any reality show from the early 2010s, even as late as 2014-15, you’ll see a big difference from what was considered “no defining silhouette” then. things like just a tshirt change slightly in cut and shape over time.

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Capsule wardrobe is not for me. But you need to ask yourself what you want to get out of a capsule and what wardrobe issue you are trying to solve.   Do you want to have less stuff? Make it easier to get dressed? Get more higher quality stuff?  Eliminate decision fatigue? Etc.   If you are moving into to this path you want to figure out two things. Your color palette and what shapes you like. These should help you figure out the base of the wardrobe. And you do not want to trash everything and get it all at once. You’ll make mistakes and learn what you like by experimenting.    Maybe try a 10x10 challenge to get a taste of a more limited wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:I wear and use my heirloom pieces inherited from my grandmother very often .  Have not altered any of them , since some of them are quite old and it would ruin the historical value .  My most interesting pieces are : A solid gold cameo set with of earrings, necklace , brooch and a ring that originaly was my great-great grandmothers , and a ruby pendant in silver from the same era (1880s 1910s) And a brooch from the napoleonic era wich is quite interresting.   My style of dress is a mix of bohemian with a good deal of influence of Edwardian (1910-17ish) sensibilites, so the jewlery work really well with that. Also have a gorgoues 50’s swing dresse that was my grandmothers, wich i have worn on ocassion. Edit to say that my grandmother was my same exact size when she was younger , so thats really fun, the clothes i have after her fits me PERFECTLY wich is great luck!  A bit controversial but i also inherited my grandmothers furs, they are still in excellent condition and i wear them almost daily in the winter months. But despite the ethical ramifications i am a firm beliver in sustainability , its better to wear and repair existing clothes then buying new .   I love the feeling of continunity i feel from wearing these treasures, that am a part of a long line of women who have worn these pieces, loved and cared for them.	episode_done:True

text:What are "iconic" items that you should know about, and their basic history? What items can singularly be identified as "starting a trend"?	labels:Timberlands yellow nubuck boots have an interesting history, kind of the first major crossing of workwear and urban street wear. Depending on who you ask, it was drug dealers or just urban blacks started wearing insulated timberlands to keep their feet warm standing on the cold concrete late at night. Timberland was slow to embrace this new market, and that brought some controversy. If you believe that it was primarily drug dealers buying the boots you can understand why Timberland didn't want to develop that reputation, if you believe it was urban blacks then it looks a lot like racism. I tend to think they were trying market to construction workers, and were worried the urban buyers would be a shorter term market. In the end, there are plenty of better construction boots out there and they went where the money is greenest and have been an fashion staple ever since.  Buffalo check (red and black check) coats were originally full blown wool blankets that women would sew into jackets for their husbands logging in the PNW. Now it's just a popular pattern in general, and some people still swear by blanket coats.	episode_done:True

It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering".

And each brand takes their spin, and washes it with their point of view. Sezane does its rendtiion in the classic, same for brands like J.Crew and Banana Republic. Madewell's version is a little hipster and boho takes on the same classics. Anthropogie is quirky femme takes on the trends. Gap would do the plainest version - yes to chunky knits but not super statement sleeves.  It is hard to deem a solid knit sweater as a knockoff, there are only so many versions you can make.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 10, 2020	labels:**Jamieson Shetland Sweaters**   I'm successively (re-) building my wardrobe around the themes of responsibility and (scandinavian) minimalism. That for me is: Few high quality items that are made ethically and sustainably and work well together to achieve the aforementioned aesthetic. Currently I'm in the market for a somewhat textured but simple grey wool crew-neck-sweater for fall and warmer winter days, preferably made in Europe. I have been looking at Harleys, Howlin, Sunspel and Jamieson's and have a tendency for the latter because of them as far as I know being actually made completely on the Shetland Isles. Now for my two questions:   1. Jamiesons's is the most affordable of these brands (which is not a priority for me but also does not hurt ofc). Do any of you have experience with their quality, longevity, fit etc.? How do they compare to the other brands?   2. Would you go for a light grey (their "Granite") or a medium-dark grey (their "slate") for maximum versatility in the context of scandinavian minimalism?

The westernish vibes from 17 and 49 are cool, 74 is channeling a bit of Harrison Ford (Indy or Han, take your pick), and 93 and 95 are quite close to modern tactical "greyman" wear, but aren't super militant, and I wouldn't necessarily pick 93 from a crowd, that sweater does a good job of casualizing (there's gotta be a better word for this) the outift. 95 does look a bit like a GoRuck ad. 71 looks a bit like he drank all of the greyman coolaid.   I'm seeing lots of room for people to blouse their pants into their boots and I dig it.   I got into MFA to get away from costumey clothing but I'm finding it might get me back into it lol.  Edit: the presence of fanny packs and even binoc harnesses here also surprised me. Y'all do function and I love it.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 15, 2020	labels:So, I generally think that the phrase "toxic masculinity" gets thrown around too casually nowadays but on the Facebook Red Wing group there is a seemingly weekly post by someone complaining about cuffed jeans and/or bemoaning the fact that RW Heritage are fashion boots. Inevitably the comments use the word "hipster" as an insult when it is so clearly a euphemism for "fag".    The whole thing is so gross and tiring. I guess that can be said for lots of stuff in 2020.

text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:i actually finally got a breast reduction surgery this summer which definitely let me change my style so much i’ve defitnely felt very inspired by recent trends and felt more connected to them than i have in the past but whether that’s cause of my surgery finally let me feel connected or them just being my taste i don’t know  i’ve felt drawn to things that are both comfy and fun patterns or fabrics (stuff like corduroy and satin) things that are both cute and comfortable at the same time as well  i also have developed an insanely large tank top collection but i think that’s just me feeling comfortable in a tank top for the first time in years  i’ve found myself researching things more as well  like i see a piece i really want but i spend time thinking about it how much i would wear it etc and then rather than take the first cheapest option i’ve been trying to invest in quality pieces that i can keep for longer i’m trying to get more comfortable with form fitting stuff that’s still comfy like turtlenecks! before it was uncomfortable as hell because form fitting just made my chest stick out more which was the opposite of what i wanted now i’m kind of scared that since my chest won’t be taking immediate attention the rest of my body will be the focus and i’ve definitely gained my own share of quarantine weight	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I ride horses professionally and manage a boarding facility, so my daily wear has to be appropriate for riding 8 horses a day (so breeches, knee high socks, athletic shirts), getting dirty (mud boots, overclothes I don't much care about), and staying warm/dry (seven billion layers of hobo coats). Unfortunately, my personal style is more of a mix of cottagecore/Edwardian/grungy Audrey Hepburn, which as you can imagine has absolutely no place whatsoever in my day to day life. I am also a compulsive clothes hoarder (screw you, Goodwill and thrift shopping!)  &#x200B;  I got sick and tired of seeing all these beautiful clothes in my closets that I *never* wore, so I purged it completely. I have two to three outfits for every occasion, two pairs of going - out jeans, and one pair of black heels now, with the ability to mix and match in between. Since I never really go anywhere, I always feel like I'm wearing something new when I do! Most of my pieces are more or less "timeless styles," and then I try and get one new thing every season to keep my wardrobe up with the times. But I have a rule that every time I buy a new thing, I have to throw one item out, which helps with the clothes hoarding!   &#x200B;  Luckily, I have some room for fashion in my work wear. I try and get trendy colored breeches in earth tones, find complementary shirts and jackets, cool socks, etc. I also have the awesome opportunity to color coordinate with my horse *and* his tack, which most people can't say, so I'll take that over being truly fashionable any day! (Did you guys know it's actually pretty difficult to pick a color scheme that also complements the exact shade of your horses coat properly? It's hard enough to determine whether humans are cool or warm or whatever....)	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 14, 2020	labels:Finally getting a pair of high top chucks.  Decided (after researching here and elsewhere) that the 70s would be best; I plan on using them as my daily beaters at college and would like the support for days that I'm walking/biking around a ton.    My issue is color.  If I were getting the "classic" chucks, I would be going with the all-white version.  I plan on wearing them with shorts and crew socks for the most part.  But the 70s don't come in all white - they have an all cream version and then a version with a white upper and off-white/cream sole+toe cap.   Does anyone have any suggestions or experiences with either color.  White would match my socks a bit better (though the AT retro stripe ones that I usually wear are getting faded) but the different colored sole seems a bit funky in the website's pictures.

text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:Personally I try to avoid faux if possible. Real leather lasts longer, faux leather is just plastic and I find it cracks and/or scuffs usually within a couple years. Granted, I haven't bought any luxury faux leather so maybe that would last longer. Also on the sustainability side I feel like real leather is better (although I'm sure it depends on processing and where it comes from)
text:Best and Worst Purchases of 2020?	labels:**Best:** Outlier Ramielight Camp Collar in Dark Forest. Such a great shirt that I ended up buying a second one in white. My favorite thing to wear outside this summer whenever I did go out.  **Worst:** Beckett Simonon Morgen all white sneakers. Note, this is my second pair, and this time I decided to go with the all whites instead of re-upping on the gum sole. It's not that I don't like this, it's a combination of not a lot of clothes purchases this year (which has been great) while also not loving them as much as the gum soles. I still have my gum soles and I almost pulled the trigger on another pair this week since they had seconds on sale for $89.	episode_done:True

This is along the lines of what I like, I love the sweater in the thumbnail and stuff from Lirika Matoshi or Selkie, both sadly too expensive for me but still my inspiration.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 05, 2020	labels:Curious to see the opinions here.  How would you modify wanting to dress the way you want in a forever-hot and humid country, like the Philippines?  I know MFA (and other fashion boards) say to get stuff like shorts-above-the-knee, lightweight linen pants, short sleeve button downs, versatile shoes, etc.  But say, if you're enamored by something like the Japanese Americana workwear aesthetic, or something like techwear, or even something like legitimate vintage clothing/workwear. How do you dress like that here in the PH? I'm so interested by the possibilities of fashion but it's so frustrating not being able to put heavier fabrics on to experiment, lest I die of heat stroke.   To make it worse, I'm one of those people who is "allergic" to sweat and heat (I get really itchy), so ugh.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 25	labels:I got a question about shirt sizing... So I'm a short guy (5ft 6in) and long sleeved shirts are usually a problem for me because I have a large chest/shoulders for my height. I just got a Taylor stitch shirt in XS as that's what they're size guide recommended me. However, as is the case with most shirts I try, it's a bit tight in the back (I have a 38in chest). This only applies if I'm crossing my arms, giving a hug, or tying my shoes or something (basically moving both arms forward). The shirt fits everywhere else and is otherwise fine. I know that it I size up though, the shirt length will be a little too long and the sleeve length will be too long, despite fitting more relaxed in the chest/back area.  Do I size up or retain my current size? Again, the only real problem area is that the shirt hugs my chest a little bit and I feel the fabric strain across my back if I try to cross my arms (not enough so that it feels like it will rip, but it still strains).	episode_done:True

text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:For me, it was the opposite... so I am still young but I grew up staring at magazines and with no one that had the same body type as me- what is now called ‘medium’. Where companies have a bunch of skinny girls and will through in few plus size girls just to get some diversity... but yet, still don’t see any medium sized girls... Nonetheless, many desi girls (desi refers to south asian).   In middle school, wasn’t a fan of makeup but my best friend was. Since as long as I could remember, she would tell me about everything she was doing and how much she loved to do her makeup. One day in 8th grade, I was staring myself in the mirror and was like hm, I want to start trying to use makeup. And from there it started... From then until about the next 4 years, I taught myself and watched video after video after video. This is what fueled me into fashion. Around my Junior year in High School, the confidence makeup gave me transferred into just wanting to look my best. I became obsessed in streetwear and just looking really cool...   From then on my style has changed a bit, but overall it was my friends and what they were into that inspired my first looks. I would take those and find things similar that seemed more like me :)	episode_done:True

text:How do I feel sexy at home in winter?	labels:matching bra and panties. it works wonders.

I swear there's a posture change when I'm wearing ratty underclothes vs nice ones. even if no one sees it, I know it's there.

text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:I think it has to do with how immediately recognizable something is as being a particular brand’s, like the ever famous red sole shoes. Most companies don’t really have these kinds of easily recognized traits (outside of trade marked logos), because putting an identifying feature on everything you make severely limits what you can produce.   Most clothes look like clothes, and could easily come from any brand, and those I don’t find a moral issue with. Especially since many designs we look at and associate with a certain brand are only because we saw it for them first/associate that brand with prestige and assume they must have come up with it first. In reality, most of them are using designs that have been around and circulating amongst all of fashion, and no one can really pin point where they came from first.   Like with your example, those are two incredibly basic designs I’ve seen around for years from many different brands. I wouldn’t even be comfortable saying the cheaper brand is copying the French brand for sure and not any number of other companies. Sure, it’s sometimes very obvious when someone is getting copied, like when a Kardashian wears anything and Fashion Nova is selling it’s version the next day. But most of the time designs are kind of free flowing.	episode_done:True

I don't crowd for new bins even pre-COVID and when everyone's in the new bins, it gives you a lot of space to peruse literally every other bin in there.	labels:Thanks for the reply!

text:Why Did Bottega Veneta Delete Its Social Media Accounts?	labels:All these thinkpieces serve to do is mystify a transparent marketing strategy dovetailing neatly with the ethos of the brand. As a brand Bottega Veneta is fashion's equivalent of your friends on social media who announce to the world that they're going to be moving in silence from now on  – a brand for those who want to be lowkey, *but not really*.  Social media makes sense for brands like LV for whom the core ethos is in your face flaunting, as Instagram is both chief flex medium and ultimate marketing tool to an aspirational public. Bottega Veneta's courtship is a bit different. If I'm BV I don't even want to be seen as attempting to court that customer, and so the retreat from social media makes sense considering the brand's appeal to aspirational customers who want to be perceived as more sophisticated than those of LV. In reality BV is every bit as accessible before (just type it into the search bar) but it's the *illusion* of withdrawal which is key, both in attracting more aspirational customers and retaining your seasonal clients, for whom discretion – especially in LVMH's major growth market of China – is key.  I don't have any experience in marketing or the luxury sector but what this tells me is that LVMH believes either that a social media presence was a waste of resources or that this'll help cultivate a fake sense of "in the know" among their growth demographic, particularly with COVID exposing the full extent of income inequality's social rot.  Considering influencer fraud, flexing, and the danger of being mixed in with the bland minimal luxury aesthetic running rampant on IG, it makes perfect sense for them to pull back.  &#x200B;  TL;DR: It's just good marketing. The brand will still be very present in all the relevant outlets that actually generate sales.

text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers. Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:I am very sensitive to temperature changes so I suffer when I wear layers. Every time I come indoors, I need to strip off everything except a t shirt but I’ll be shivering my butt off the second I go out. Best solution was to get a thick and heavy parka. I have the Moose Knuckles Beaver jacket (discontinued now). It’s so warm that I can wear only a bra under it and still leave it half zipped in -25C.   I’ve been wearing it for 5 years now and the only signs of wear are on the slightly yellowed fur that used to be white, and the stretchy cuff where some threads are coming loose. The only reason this even happened is because I wrap my whole hand in it while writing on paper, so there’s more friction on them than with exclusively winter use. I’ve even gone skiing and snowboarding with it when the slopes were icy and had absolutely no issue. I was learning too, so I spent more time on the ground than upright. It’s been beaten up quite a bit but i can honestly say that it’s still in at least 8/10 condition. The fur is also great since it doesn’t get ruined at all. I’ve been rained on too many times to count in this coat but you just gotta dry it and it’s good to go.   Compared to my aritzia coat, I’d say that it’s not even half as warm as my moose. It also doesn’t last anywhere as long and I ripped through the shell after a slip on ice. I think it lasted me 3 years, but the fur on it was ugly at the start of the second winter season so it required a lot of upkeep it keep it looking in better shape.	episode_done:True

text:I made a Hoodie spreadsheet to help you with sizing	labels:You have some great options, so I won’t persuade you one way or the other, but wanted to let you know that you can convert gsm to oz. just google “fabric gsm to oz converter”.   They’re all good sweatshirts, just look closely at the details and see what you prefer. More of a vintage style with longer rib cuffs and hem, more modern with shorter cuffs, draw cords or not, kangaroo pocket shape, ribbing at the side.  Can’t go wrong with your picks, very good list.	episode_done:True
text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:The problematic sexism aside, I appreciate that she shared her experiences.   The fact (to her) that women were her harshest critics is quite sad and also a very contemporary issue.   Her unabashed enjoyment of men is something that, at the time, was still quite taboo and I applaud that she makes no bones about it.   She seems very much her own person despite getting crap from all sides.  However, milk and raw eggs? I cannot get behind that one 😂	episode_done:True
text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:Clothes are never ever an investment. With the extremely few exceptions like Birkins and limited edition Chanel bags or stuff like that, it's not a thing.   Clothes will not retain their value and it's naive to think that you can buy something and expect to recoup more than half your money after *5 years* of wearing it. Especially since it's probably already a few years old when you buy it.  Pret a porter does not do as well as bags on the resale market. No one gives a shit that your old cardigan is designer because in another 5 years it will not only be worn out, it will be really outdated. If someone is paying hundreds for one single item, they're not buying worn from a collection 10 years ago AND still be willing to pay half the original price.
text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:Just wanted to say that I also love the glam ski vacation look! But like others have said, maybe it's not the most practical if you're actually going skiing. Depending on where you live, maybe you can incorporate elements of this style in your everyday life when winter hits. Big luxe faux fur coats, boots, etc	episode_done:True
text:Agreed. RRL has changed and isn't what it used to be. I've at least seen that with their jeans.

text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:Is anyone else kind of tired of posts and comments that variously try to "justify" the price of obvious luxury goods, designerwear, etc.?  Good thread on the SLP teddy, but just about nothing in there is surprising. Is it well-constructed? Duh, it's SLP. Does it have little refinements all over, compared to everyday varsity jackets? Yeah, that's kind of the point. Is it "worth" $2,000? No, obviously not.   Like...at some point we need to acknowledge that these efforts are misguided, even if well-intentioned. You're buying SLP because it's SLP (or Ackermann, or Dick Ovens, or whatever your thing is). *That* is the justification. And that's a fine justification in and of itself! An analysis of the materials and construction is unlikely to throw up surprises that'll make people go "damn, that really makes it worth the obnoxious price tag!"   (This observation does not apply to bespoke clothing, where the justification genuinely is that you get something more or less customized for you, and you alone.)  What do people think?
text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:My mom cared a lot of about looks and was very stylish before marriage and kids. She was beautiful in middle age but had no income for clothes and stuff as she was a stay at home mom. She did however teach us a lot about femininity and hygiene and hair and makeup. I didn’t realize how much she had taught me until recently. As a preteen I watched a lot of What Not to Wear so I thought I had become a fashion expert (even if i only got one new outfit per year and it was an embarrassing monkey character T-shirt 🤣) anyhow I always tried to give her fashion advice to make her feel better about herself and in hindsight she shouldn’t have listened to my tip to buy green seersucker capris 😂 she died when I was 17 but if I could, I would treat her to all the nice stuff I can now afford to buy for myself 🥰	episode_done:True

Sorry.	episode_done:True
text:What is the upscale version of Fashion Nova / SHEIN / boohoo / Nasty Gal? i.e. trendy + youth-oriented but not trash quality	labels:Admittedly haven't purchased before, but perhaps I Am Gia or Jadedldn might be what you're looking for? Prix Workshop might also fit, but shipping from NZ is $$$. They do pop up on resale sites pretty frequently, though. If you're looking for something more upmarket, Unravel Project and Danielle Guizio.   Also would suggest Collusion at Asos, I've found the quality to be pretty good given the price point.	episode_done:True

text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:Raising awareness of what I actually use.   Complimenting people's insistence that you budget, you also need to know where YOU will find the best VALUE of your wardrobe spending. What do you use? What are statement pieces of your fashion? What brings you the most joy?   * I have been using a closet inventory app. Stylebook tracks the costs and number of times I actually wear my clothes with which outfits too.   Although some styling habits might seem like common sense (like basic quality t-shirts and winter coating pay off), I learnt about other neat tendencies:  Scarves vs Sweaters. Scarves might seem more versatile and can pair with so many outfits for other people. But honestly, I live in sweaters.. maybe because it's cold... or maybe because I want to be cozy. If I didn't have the style app, I would probably think about 'investing' in a cashmere scarf. Now, I'm so much happier to budget for vintage pre-loved cashmere sweaters.   Do I even put on my accessories? Bracelets? Necklaces? Nope. Apparently throwing on colourful clothes is my go-to. I save so much money, not buying any jewelry - no bracelets, no necklaces, no earrings. (It makes my savings happier)  * I prioritize my next purchases from there.   The other thing I've invested in: **10x spending more in proper clothing care.** Proper laundry detergent, keeping old toothbrushes to scrub stains, a foldable drying rack, a sweater comb, and leather conditioners.   * Clothing care, only way to keep clothes looking professional and last.

RtR has a discount shop for the clothes they don't rent out anymore but it seems like they had even more inventory lying around and they handed it over to ThredUp to sell even steeper.  Add to that the great stuff happening on Postmark, Depop, Etsy, and TheRealReal, and it's awesome to be a thrifter right now. I'm glad its all expanding.  I've been doing slow fashion for a few years and a lot of my closet is now second hand which makes me happy. Idk what the trigger was for other people but when I found out that fashion is one of the biggest polluting industries in the world, it changed my whole perspective.   Also gladd that FFA is getting more behind thrifting and second hand. Yall are the best <3	episode_done:True

They look like they’re wearing the most basic clothes girls wore at my mistake of a Christian college, the removed girls, and *please* do not get me started on the white washing of some of my faves!!! What a major bummer! But your albums brought me joy and also some ideas for my own wardrobe lol!	episode_done:True
text:Messy eaters? Tell your stories and hacks / fixes.	labels:well alot of stains can be mitigated if you deal with it immediately.  for the most part, simply just rubbing a big of soap and water on the stain area immediately after the spill should make it come out quite easily.	episode_done:True
text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:It’s less about the value of the item and more about the stars aligning perfectly.  I wear a size 12-13W shoe, plus other things that make my feet really hard to fit, so I am used to buying formalwear to match the one maybe two pairs of formal shoes I own at any given time.  So when I was 17 and going to prom in 2006, my mom tried really hard to help me find shoes, any shoes, that were suitable. But we could only find casual flats or runners, and I realllly wanted to dress up nicely for the first real time in my life. So she said “you know what, let’s buy a dress and then we will just have to find a way.”  So I picked out a black and pale pink dress that just made me swoon, and I figured black heels would be easiest to find. Lol I was so young and stupid.  Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn’t find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I’d just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.

text:What was the last addition to your wardrobe in 2020 and what was / is going to be the first addition to your wardrobe in 2021?	labels:Last was a pair of sturdy Chelsea boots from Ecco back in November, and I’m very happy about them.   I haven’t decided what my next purchase will be. I want to get myself something that will make me excited to be alive, and I’m looking forward to finding that thing.

text:If you could only have one overcoat, what would it be?	labels:Anastasias oversize coat from Anastasia but in black. I have one that's dark blue, so that's alright, but there are no pockets, which I miss. I like it because it's lightweight and versatile, you can easily wear it on its own (in the springtime/summer), but because it's oversized it also looks good with a lot of layers underneath. It's my favorite jacket I've owned so far (apart from a lightweight bomber) and I find it both stylish and useful. I also love long jackets.  edit: I did not see which sub I was in sorry. Nevermind me! it's still a good coat though.	episode_done:True
text:Has anyone just said screw it and focused more on fit than color scheme for your outfits?

text:No clue about winter wear. Please Help!	labels:The fundemental key to layering is wearing soft and porous garments beneath some sort of coat or jacket that is weather resistant or less likely to let air through. Where warmth is concerned, you want to trap air between your skin and the outside. This is why winter coats like parkas have their own insulation, meant to trap warm air.	episode_done:True
text:Let's Talk about hats	labels:Assuming you’re American, the formality in clothing has drastically dropped in the last century.

I think people assume you’re confident just because you’re rocking something unusual!

text:Yes! It takes a bit of work but you can definitely replicate Drake’s styling for much cheaper.   A lot of the value of Drake’s is in their styling, and a lot of what they sell is basics. Some of their clothes are literally just marked up pieces manufactured by other brands - their suede crepe sole shoes are Astorflex, for example. A lot of it is also basics, and you can find a lot of similar stuff at other brands for much cheaper. For example, kamakura has great slim fit oxford cloth shirts with a substantial collar for a fraction of the price of Drake’s. You can find slim fit high rise jeans for much less than they charge at lots of brands nowadays.   It takes a bit of sleuthing but I’ve been able to replicate the “drake’s look” much more cheaply. For example, I really liked their crepe soled suede shoes, so I bought a pair of astorflex chukkas for $40 on eBay. I liked their corduroy chore coat so I bought a j crew one for $100. I have brushed shetlands from other brands - also made in Scotland, but a lot cheaper. The main thing that’s tough to replicate is their ties and scarves, IMO. Even that, you might have luck with some clever searches on eBay.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:That sweater sounds amazing.  source: am mom.	labels:I really didn't appreciate her taste enough. One thing I did steal from her were a pair of earrings that are just dangling wooden parrots.

text:Alexander Wang accused of a history of sexual harassment - fashion in a year of reckoning?	labels:I thought this was old news but it seems to have been buried enough that it's just getting widespread attention now. I learned about it when the video of him dancing to WAP came out. I used to think that certain industries were rife for this sort of thing, but after a career change from arts to STEM I've realized they're all as bad as each other, albeit each with their own twist.   That said - I think fashion and other arts industries (looking at you, publishing) suffer from the issue of having just enough white women and white gay male representation to pat themselves on the back with the energy of a perpetual motion machine and drown out any and all criticism about diversity and representation, regardless of how genuine it may be. And when white people are concentrated at the top of the power hierarchy, it makes intersectional issues that much harder to surface with clarity.   For every person who has been harassed by AW, how many powerful white industry gatekeepers have brushed it off because they think only straight white men can be harassers? (And, of course, when a straight white man turns out to be an abuser they still can't accept it because "he's one of the good ones" or "he just made a mistake one time, it's not fair to ruin his life").  This only starts to get fixed when the industry gives equal respect and attention to the voices of everyone who helps to create it - whether they are a celebrated designer, fashion editor, personal assistant, early career model - anyone. I have plenty of reservations about social media, but the democratizing effect of reaching a huge audience without being beholden to the industry gatekeepers has been a very good thing for issues like these.	episode_done:True

text:Sometimes I wonder how of this is bias towards the present.   There definitely have been large scale trends lately: notably luxury streetwear, which is starting to ebb (Virgil Abloh, Kim Jones, and Jerry Lorenzo have all been trying to pivot to tailoring lately).  Sure, not everybody has been on the streetwear train, but not everybody in the past marched in trendy lockstep either. We think of the eighties as pretty homogenous, but football shoulder *Wall Street* tailoring, prep, punk, and new wave were all happening at the same time, Issey Miyake was in the middle of his career and Comme and Yohji were getting their starts. If you were living in the middle of that and you cared about fashion, you probably wouldn't think there was just one trendy thing at a time either.   Maybe in 2060 we'll all be looking back on the 10s as The Streetwear Era and think that trends are just at that moment starting to die.	labels:I was gonna say something similar but you put it much better than I would have hahaha. I do think there’s more individual subcultures now than ever though! More and more people are able to dress how they want and embrace their identity than ever and it’s awesome!

text:Is anyone into MBTI? Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels:At one point on the INTP subreddit everyone was talking about how they wish they could wear a cape without it being seen as weird. I would interpret the INTP relationship to fashion as a little bit more nuanced than "drab and careless". I think the common theme is that INTPs don't generally care what others think - and so that can manifest on a spectrum from "wears whatever because does not care about their appearance at all" to "wears completely outlandish things because they care about their appearance but do not care at all what others think of it".      As an INTP myself I fall somewhere between the two. Like... I *want* fashion to be a higher priority for me, but when it comes down to it my attitude is more often just "whatever" because social pressure to look good  doesn't register to me nearly as much as it could.

text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Love your post.  I recently-ish got a sewing machine and am making myself only wear stuff I make.  Sewing can be an expensive hobby, however, I feel the clothes I do make would be less expensive than what I'd buy because I tended to go for nicer brands or linen sellers on Etsy (which can cost a pretty penny).  So, overall, I'm spending less money, have a new fun hobby, and it also makes me be more intentional with what I make since I'm not the fastest sewist.  Edit: also, in addition to unsubscribing to sale emails like you mentioned, I also moved all my shopping favorites in my browser to another folder that was annoying to get to.  I didn't want to delete it in case I do need a new winter coat or something (and can't remember brands). But this has really helped my window-not-really-shopping.	episode_done:True
text:Interesting article on luxury fashion made in Italy.	labels:I remember reading this article a few months ago, agree with u/jameane re: Deluxe. It's a good read. Luxury is so secretive about their supply chain and manufacturing that you cannot really get a good sense of who is crafting your goods and whether it's ethically done. Shit, I'll probably still buy a luxury item once in a while, but my eyes are a lot more open to exactly how much I am paying for the *experience* rather than the goods themselves.	episode_done:True
text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:It all depends on your life and climate. I think a good waterproof coat is essential and weather proof boots, but if you like in a very very dry climate where it hardly rains, then obviously it is not. For some people snow boots and really heavy feather filled winter coats are essential, I got a coat and boots I only wear when travelling in winter to cooler places and they would be inadequate for a lot of places! I love jeans, some women hate the feeling and would rather do without.  I dunno. You got to you do you, think hard of what you find comfortable physically and mentally, what makes you think "pretty" or colors that cheer you up. How much do you walk? Shoe comfort and weather adequacy really matters.	episode_done:True

text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:What pressure? There's a pressure not to dress like a child when you're an adult, and I guess that intersects with trend-following, but it's not the same thing.

text:The Style Blogger Index: finding people who are the same size as you	labels:Oh my gosh I'm so happy to see this here! I created this because of FFA! I hope you enjoy it ❤️  P.S. just a note that the size twin app is going to be updated in the next week or so -- it's very out of date. If you follow me on IG that's the easiest way to hear about updates, but I can edit this comment when it's refreshed, too!   **(11/30 update if anybody is still reading -- the app is updated!)**  Edit: since so many of you are finding the tool mostly useless, I just wanted to say that the goal was to create something that would help you find fashion inspo from people who are more similar in size to you than a fashion model in a magazine.  Of course it's impossible to get an exact body double from just 3 measurements, but that's what the standard is, and that's what I could reasonably expect the average person to know about themselves. I have to make sure that the barrier to entry is very low. The more people can join this index, the more useful it is. Please remember that I offer this tool completely for free, that I don't work in the fashion industry, and that I don't have any background in the industry (fashion, data, or web design). I just wanted to do something helpful for the community. I will try my best to make as many improvements as I can over time, but I have very limited resources, and maintaining it is quite a lot of effort as is. Sorry, all!

text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:Something I haven't seen mentioned here is clothing swaps. My friends and I are in the habit of having them at least a few times a year, and everyone walks out happy. If your friends don't do this, offer to host! We even had a Halloween costume version where we all traded outfits we no longer wanted.   Today I found success on Etsy. I was looking for tops that were ethically made, vegan, not culturally appropriative, affordable, and from a Black-owned business. I found lots of incredibly expensive brands on Google, but on Etsy I found smaller artists. So no slavery concerns (most likely), and it meets all my requirements. It only scratches the surface, but it's a place to start. It's about being intentional within the constraints.  I'm fortunate to be able to afford more expensive pieces, but wow is it hard to even know where to go. I don't shop a lot, so I really struggle with vintage and second-hand stores that only show clothing on mannequins. Before the pandemic, I never shopped online, but I also hated shopping in person because I struggled to find stores that had things I liked. It's so much easier to go into Urban or H&M or Loft. And we think of places like H&M and Forever 21 as the pinnacles of fast fashion, but I assume the worst of basically any major brand. Victoria's Secret, Gap, even luxury brands like Gucci or Prada, I assume they cut as many corners as possible.   Trying to find clothes within all my constraints helped me discover some amazing pieces that I am so excited to buy. They're incredible statement pieces that I never would have found without being more intentional in my purchases.	episode_done:True

text:How to Combat Fashion Apathy?	labels:I was experiencing the same problem especially during the confinement. I decided to push myself to get dressed even put make up on to work from home.

text:Has consulting a stylist really been a revelation to you?	labels:A few years ago i was feeling badly about myself following the end of a 4 year relationship. I decided to find a local personal shopper to go through my closet and help me decide what to keep/donate. She also provided me with ways to wear what i already had. From that, she created a list of things she thought i would need to add to my wardrobe according to my lifestyle and wants/needs. We then went to the mall a few days later and she brought in tons of things to try. The rule was that i had to show her everything, but i had the final say as to what i wanted to get. This was great because it also provided me with an opportunity to get more styling tips on items i don’t currently own but might consider moving forward.  Since then, i have felt so much more confident in how i dress and i constantly receive tons on compliments. I would 10/10 recommend this to anyone who wants to change their style or learn more about what looks best on them. I figured the $400 i spent on her was equivalent to how much money I’d spend on items i would never actually wear, and in the long run became an investment :).

text:Best way to buy clothes locally?	labels:I’m in the U.K. and when not in lockdown, I get most of my clothes from the local dress agency (consignment store) and charity shops. My SIL has also had great look on local Facebook groups. They can be a bit hit or miss as she often gets bags with a selection of things in the same size & some items might not to be her liking, but she just reposts those for someone else to enjoy. The Facebook groups are more beneficial for kids clothes though I think.
text:Have your clothing purchases dramatically dropped now that we can't go anywhere?	labels:I've been buying more than ever before. My wardrobe needs completely changed (home clothes 6 days a week instead of 1) so I needed (...wanted) lots of things like basic comfortable tshirts, cozy cardigans, and comfy pants. (I also gained a small amount of weight, not unrelated). I haven't been spending much though, basically all Old Navy.	episode_done:True

Staves off feeling like I need to buy something to recreate an outfit when I have 100+ outfits saved to the board!
text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:kind of all of them? It seems like you have to pay pretty steep prices now to get the quality of clothes that mid-price mall brands had in the 1990s and early 2000s. It seems that most stores have switched to a model of selling poor quality pieces at huge markups with the expectation that they will sell most of the stock at clearance prices. The GAP used to have quality staples, and J Crew was "fancy." Now GAP is really the same quality as Old Navy, and don't know what J Crew is anymore. The quality has certainly dropped, but I also don't get what is up with the designs since you can't even get a reasonable women's suit there these days. Madewell is not made well. Anthropologie used to sell unique pieces with really good construction, now it's roughly the same as other fast fashion, though I do appreciate that they added petite and plus sizing and carry some high end brands too. Levi's main line is terrible now, and to get the heritage quality, you need to get the Made and Crafted line, which is really expensive!  I mostly shop secondhand because I can't afford the stuff I like. When buying new, I try to wait for sales and avoid buying anything "final sale" or with complicated returns unless I know it will work. Clothes that I used to get at Anthropologie, I now get from Sezane, Ulla Johnson, Doen, and Samantha Pleet. I started buying vintage jeans over Madewell/Levi's or expensive craft brands—my 1980s Chic and Gitano jeans were probably sold at K-Mart/Target but are better quality than anything I have gotten from Madewell. I don't wear jeans/denim enough to justify craft denim prices. Patagonia is still very high quality technical wear; I just scope out the Tyler sport outlet and secondhand for deals. Shoes are hard because I don't like to get them secondhand. I switched from Adidas to Veja and Diemme for sneakers (you can find Diemme shoes for huge markdowns on Yoox during the winter and summer sales—I don't think they are worth retail price).

text:Clarks agrees £100m private equity deal	labels:If I may be so bold: Astorflex is essentially a better made, Italian version of Clarks. Less well known, but heads above in quality and build.

Honestly, if they were more well known the CDB would have (rightfully) bit the dust a long time ago.	episode_done:True
text:+J/UNIQLO SPECIAL COLLABORATION: What’s the verdict?	labels:I got the silk turtleneck is grey and black. I never see turtlenecks made of 100% silk so it intrigued me. The material is very thin as expected with silk so I skipped the white one. The standout of the silk knits would be the grey. The grey has a nice sheen to it and looks so luxe compared to a regular cotton turtleneck. They are so soft and warm and I can see myself wearing them for many years. I also got the double breasted wool coat in black. I had no intention of buying this but decided to try it on. I am a short gyal and this coat fit me so well I snatched it up right away. I was in the market for a new coat but was thinking of buying an Aritzia one but this one fit me much better. The thing I noticed with this coat is that the arms are cut in a way that it curves with the way that your arms fall on your body. It also has two inside pockets. I’m very impressed! I also tried the cashmere coats but I didn’t like those as much as I wanted something with a little more weight and more structured.

text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:Not white, not red and depending on area, not black. White and red are the bride's colors (culturally dependent). If the bride wears white, red can be considered attention grabbing. If the bride wears red, her culture probably views white as a mourning color. Black can be seen as an objection to the wedding and mourning - very regional.   Something conservative enough for church weddings. Knee length, covers shoulders? Shoulder covering can be fixed with a cardigan.   Something light for a hot outdoor wedding.   In my area, most weddings are cocktail or semi formal aka short dresses are fine. Formal would imply floor length gown, so if the store has a good one, that you like, and you think someone seems more likely to go full formal, that might be a good call.   If you have seasons, then one for each season. Think about the weather in your general area. How cold or hot does it get?

text:would you say they are thick?  also, looking at the site i wanted to confirm. is it $16 per single pair???	labels:Yes, they are expensive socks, but if you're patient, you can find them on sale frequently throughout the year. Most of the time a sale happens, it's posted on r/frugalmalefashion   I will also mention the great return policy/customer service from Darn Tough. Had a couple of pairs (several years old) lose the elasticity around the ankle of my no-shows, and I filed a claim on their website, sent the socks in, and they sent back a $17 online voucher for the site. Highly recommended from me. I have ~9 pairs of DT, and they're my only brand of socks.

You can also buy some decent quality sneakers from Amazon too, just make sure it's from a reputable seller and from a recognized shoe brand (Adidas/New Balance/etc.).  &#x200B;  However, for stuff like jeans, jackets, boots, and knitwear, I'd look elsewhere. I've bought jeans from Amazon in the past that came with low-quality buttons and ripped after 2 months of wear, so I don't think the quality is quite there. My recommendation would be to search on places like Uniqlo/Carhartt/Champion or even thrift stores to get better quality jeans/jackets/knitwear that can last you a lot longer than whatever you'd find on Amazon for a comparable price.

text:How do I feel sexy at home in winter?	labels:matching bra and panties. it works wonders. I do this in the summer too (on summer bra days, which with boob sweat there are not many). when I buy a new bra, I typically get 2-3 coordinating panties in different styles so I have some options, and then put them together under all my clothes. I swear there's a posture change when I'm wearing ratty underclothes vs nice ones. even if no one sees it, I know it's there.
text:But I feel like unlike runway fashion, concept cars are more appealing to the masses, even if they ultimately can't afford them.	labels:That’s why I like the comparison.   Clothes have a practical use. They keep you warm and dry and protect you from the elements. They also have a social use. The way you dress tells other people how you want to be interacted with. They also have an expressive use. Your orange jacket is your favorite color, the Metallica patch on your vest is there to remind you of the concert where you met your wife.  In the same way cars have a practical use. They are a conveyance to move people and things. They have a social use. A fancy new Mercedes or a well maintained classic jaguar e type tells others where you are in the hierarchy. They also have an expressive quality. Color, form, decals, tinted windows, spinner donk rims, etc.   And in both cases you’ll see where there the style portion of the item needs to be balanced against the practical and social portions. A Lamborghini Aventador is dripping in style but you can’t move furniture with it. But it still functions as a car. You can still drive it on a public highway. It still has airbags and an engine and runs on pump gas.   High fashion, like concept cars, can be completely devoid of practicality. You can see clothes warped to the point where you question how the person even walks upright wearing their outfit. Sometimes they can’t. Concept cars can be so oddly proportioned that they cant fit an engine or drivetrain. Sometimes they don’t even have working doors on hinges. But that’s the point. It’s to turn the expression and social interaction values to maximum without having to compromise with practicality.	episode_done:True

text:Online Styling Services?	labels:In addition to all the wonderful advice above, some stylists on Instagram regularly have weekly blog posts or stories posts where they ask their followers to send in any styling questions and they give their advice for free!   Personally I recommend waiting if you decide to try any paid styling services until after the pandemic because it opens up the option for meeting with a stylist in person, and also it makes it easier to try on the various things they recommend in a shop/mall as opposed to getting a couple things in a few sizes shipped to you and dealing with returns. Plus, sometimes colors differ from screen to screen so if they are trying to give advice about colors that suit you, the monitor differences could potentially cause problems.	episode_done:True

text:From Runway to reddit: Ready-to-Wear Purchasing and the Fashion Calendar Explained	labels:Excellent, excellent write up, thank you so much for sharing and breaking down the process in a way that is easy to understand.   >  If you're cruising to Cabo over Thanksgiving, wintering in the Mediterranean after Christmas, and enjoying late season skiing in Aspen in May, you must have a wardrobe to match. What designers were delivering and retailers stocking was out of step with consumers' buying habits.  This was a great way to explain how the precollections help fill in the gaps, but it will be interesting to see brands cutting down on resort or cruise collections. I normally enjoy precollections cause I find that they tend to be more fun and leave room for more creativity by the designers.  > At the high end, fashion is a relationship business. Sales associates at brand flagships and independent boutiques keep up with clients via phone, text, and e-mail. Rather than making orders through a website, you reach out to your SA and ask "do you have x in?" or they contact you as new stock comes in and try and sell you on whatever bizarre runway item people with both money and sense 👏will👏not👏buy👏.  It’s a transactional relationship and a lot of clients are addicted to the exclusivity of it all (Hermès anyone?). It’s almost a bragging right to have a relationship with a SA who can give you early access to collections or decide you’re worthy of being offered a particular handbag or watch.	episode_done:True

text:A Basic Guide to Useful Knitwear	labels:I’m going to disagree that no seams is a rule of thumb for better construction—sometimes those seams help give you more structure and a better tailored look. It depends on the type of sweater you’re aiming for, of course, but something like a shawl collared cardigan in a heavy knit would benefit from a size seam to help keep it from ending up around your knees by the end of the day.   If you’re a trans man like myself, the side seam will help give you a line for the eye to follow along the sides of your body, too.   I only add these as considerations because I knit and design my own garments and while the rule of thumb isn’t necessarily entirely wrong, it’s really more nuanced than “avoid side seams because it’s better constructed”	episode_done:True

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:I have evolved some classics I keep- I admit I dress a bit like a children's book illustration character from the first half of the last century meets femdom faerie sex witch- so it's a lot of simple collared blouse under unornemented cashmere sweaters, black opaque tights, solid saturated colours largely in jewel tones, positively ridiculous big hair bows and then flip flop into corsets and strapy, or lacey things.    I go through periods of realizing a 34 year old wearing thigh highs with maryjanes is confusing and periods of comforting myself that the lesbian in clarks and stripey socks look makes me happy and as an elder-millenenial I am basically a generation adrift.    Probably the hardest part is realizing I don't have to buy new clothing. Like, I have enough of most things and it doesn't wear out fast enough to justify replacing it, nor does it really no longer spark joy.    I have stuff that fits from college that still has *years* of wear left. Unless I gain another 20lbs more than my natural yoyo, or suddenly take up a physical job, basically only socks, shoes and underwear will need updates from just material failure.	episode_done:True

text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:I love their (Amy, Dione, and the Tibi brand) style but sometimes their pretentiousness irks me. They go like oh you can wear whatever you like but then they come up with 1000 rules about what should not be worn together. Anyway, if you like that style and also like to DIY things you can totally adjust regular items to look like Tibi ones. For instance, the asymmetrical shirt that closes a bit on the diagonal, the buttons that are used to pull up the sleeves, the ankle bands on some of their pants, etc. can all be recreated relatively easily and you don't need to spend 100s of $ on their "affordable" items (Amy's words, I always crack up when she boasts about how affordable Tibi clothes are).

text:Thank you so much for the insight. Yeah, the writing is on the wall. I know the brand was never popular since I always felt I was the only one buying their stuff. Sucks about the design team because the men’s stuff used to be good. Forever 21 had REALLY GOOD men’s stuff when the men’s line first debuted too, but they let go of a ton of designers too (many whom I heard were from GUESS).	labels:You’re welcome :) I actually met one of the Senior Designers working with the G by Guess team and he was actually really good. You can tell he was really creative and was able to design with the customer in mind. I do think that in the past few years they had a lot of limitations brought upon by upper management since the brand wasn’t performing as it used to. The brand, as a whole, is not what it used to be back in the days. Like F21, it’s days are long gone. Now, the company is only plagued by sexual allegations made against Paul Marciano, among other things. Not even their collaborations with J Balvin, JLO, etc. seem to do anything for them.

Minimalism isn't a virtue and it's only valuable in so much as it matches your lifestyle, needs, and desires. You don't have to aim for minimalism for the sake of minimalism, or just because it’s in style. It's ok to own things that make you happy. It's ok to only wear something once every couple of months (or less often). You don't have to get rid of things just because you are not living up to some arbitrary standard of use.

text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:In this hypothetical I'd go with haute couture. In your friend's situation I'd keep looking until I found a designer I liked. Bespoke would be my last option for a couple of reasons. Your friend wants contemporary fashion, but most bespoke tailors make traditional clothes for a typically older crowd (you're in NYC though so there are some bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd; make sure you look for them specifically). The bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd don't have designs as good as high end ready to wear IMO. Tailoring and designing are different skills, and there's a reason Louis Vuittion, YSL, Dior, Gucci, etc pay their head designers millions per year. Of course some $4000 coats are worth more than others, so it would be good to know a bit about general quality.  Personally, I prioritize design over fit. I can deal with a less than perfect fit if I love the design of a piece. But I won't wear a piece if I don't love the design, even if it fits well.   The middle ground option is made to measure, or MTM. MTM for outerwear isn't as common for suiting, but it's out there.

text:Can I see your casual natural-fabric outfits?	labels:I buy pretty much everything secondhand, which means I can buy nicer fabrics and fibres than I would be able to afford otherwise. I have a pair of silk slim fit trousers that are so soft and comfortable - seriously great, and they look so good worn with slouchy oversized knits. Wool blends also tend to make me itchy, so I go for 100% cotton jumpers. Men’s jumpers are great for this, as women’s usually have acrylic or spandex blends.
text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:Whoa... I am an adult woman with ADHD and I never thought about this somehow. I have MAJOR issues with restrictive clothing. Winter coats feel like a straitjacket, turtlenecks \*literally\* made me vomit when I was younger, and anything that's even slightly itchy or makes a weird noise (like a swishy windbreaker) drives me insane. I can't wear bracelets or watches because the sound of them clicking on my desk grates against my soul.  I usually live in American Eagle jeggings (soft joggers as soon as I get home), comfortable shirts, soft and loose sweaters/cardigans, comfortable ankle boots/Converse, and sometimes a well-fitting skirt with tights.  Interestingly, I have no issue with wearing tights, which I know a lot of women find uncomfortable. I don't mind wearing a bra, either.
text:Came here to say this hahaha	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:Yeah, I shop a lot because I'm usually sad and it feels like new items will fix that somehow, or make people miraculously like me more. I'm aware that it doesn't work like that, but I love dressing up as a "new me" every day and I easily get bored... but that's just mental issues :/  With autism and me identifying as queer and all, I'm not exactly popular and there isn't one version of me I'd consider the real me, which makes it even more difficult. "The real me" fluctuates day by day, and so do my outfit preferences. I often buy things impulsively that I WILL love for quite some time, but never on two subsequent days, for example. I've been mocked for this, but I've still found I'm happiest like this, with my crazy big wardrobe and tons of different styles.

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

I’m in eastern WA, so my trenches are used for about one month in fall, and then a month or so in spring, with true winter coats being used from October-April or so.

text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:I wouldn't say I inherently hate the brand but I think Champion is an example of a brand that exploded a few years back/to now basically all because some celebrities or whoever wore it- and everyone who wears it now is most likely a ding dong hypebeast type or the VSCO type girl or whatever. Like I'm old enough to remember it being bottom tier Wal Mart level shit you'd get borderline made fun of for wearing- but now all of the sudden it's enjoying this moment. So it's just that perceived inauthenticity and collective pivot in peoples' minds to a fashion name to people rather than just athletic apparel that irks me somehow.  However though, the Todd Snyder Champion stuff is PHENOMENAL- it's not the mainline stuff. You don't see any of those assholes rocking that.

text:Bottega Veneta is owned by Kering but yeah the same thing still applies to them too.  I noticed that right after Phoebe Philo left Celine and that brand changed the whole look with Hedi Slimane, there was influencers on social media etc calling BV the 'new Celine' and hyping the brand, it was getting pushed on places like GQ and other mags too. Maybe that was an organic shift and the Phoebe Philo Celine fans just wanted a new brand to love after she left but also, it could easily be inside marketing from BV and Kering to take advantage of that space. And I remember Celine never used to have an Instagram page, social media or much of an online presence at all that kept it kind of mysterious, now BV is trying that. More than a coincidence?	labels:Bottega being positioned as the 'new celine' had a lot to do with Daniel Lee taking over at BV who had previously worked under Phoebe at Celine. It was definitely deliberate positioning but the appointment of Daniel Lee meant it had some credibility to it rather being just purely buzzwords.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: What are the different use cases of boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes, and loafers?	labels:There's so much overlap between all the handsewn types, they're largely interchangeable. A lot of what people will tell you are rules or use cases are largely based on association and nothing really concrete.  Moccasins are a really good first step from "not a sneaker" without being a dress shoe. I find them incredibly easy to wear in most seasons, they pair well with many things that are fairly casual, they're pretty comfortable, and age well.  **Boat Shoes** have negative associations with prep/frats but just by association. In areas other than the Northeastern US (imo) they are much more neutral. No one associates them with frats on the west coast of Canada where I am, for example. But, of course, frats are a fairly uniquely American institution.  They tend to work best in warmer weather as the lower vamp and commonly sueded interior is quite light and good for wearing barefoot. They were, of course, designed to be worn on sailboats, so they're at home around the water and make a good beach shoe.  **Camp Mocs, Ranger Mocs, and Blucher Mocs** all fill a particular niche of being nicely casual shoes that are a bit more refined than sneakers, but pair easily with most non-synthetic casual wear. They make great seasonal transition wear (spring/fall) as they're lighter than boots but can be worn with thicker socks. They also have a variety of sole options from simple leather to treaded Vibram that can be selected for your environment and use case.  If you're used to wearing sneakers all the time, they can be a great introduction to leather shoes - imo in many cases better than boots, as they are often less expensive and easier to wear in many situations.  **Loafers** are often a bit more formal (but not always!) and can transition into business casual/formal wear. Some loafers can be worn with tailored wear (sport coats/suits). It will depend on the exact form, sole, leather, and color. Loafers can also be very casually, having a lot of crossover with moccasins, but again depending on the above factors.

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:When I watched The Devil Wears Prada, I thought Miranda Priestly explained it pretty well for a plebeian like me:  "'This... stuff'? Oh. Okay. I see. You think this has nothing to do with you. You go to your closet and you select... I don't know... that lumpy blue sweater, for instance because you're trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back. But what you don't know is that that sweater is not just blue, it's not turquoise. It's not lapis. It's actually cerulean. And you're also blithely unaware of the fact that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns. And then I think it was Yves Saint Laurent... wasn't it who showed cerulean military jackets? I think we need a jacket here. And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers. And then it, uh, filtered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin. However, that blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs and it's sort of comical how you think that you've made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you're wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room from a pile of stuff."

text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:Reading through the comments it really seems like Modcloth's problem has been consistency of quality all along, and not just since the Walmart takeover. I personally used to shop the website a lot, (especially for quirky jewelry and accessories!) and while I have a soft spot for many of those pieces (especially the blazer I mentioned under another comment) now that I'm really sitting here thinking about it there were def others that didn't last well or look as good in person. I also started thinking about how at that age pretty much all my income was disposable (living at home, no kids) so I guess it didn't bother me as badly if something wasn't worth what I paid for it, especially if it was cute enough to make an outfit with once or twice. So maybe the real issue with the site is its failure to adapt to its customer base's changing needs. Or, alternatively, to attract new and younger customers by staying on trend. I think there's probably a market for quirky but still trendy pieces , but a "vintage" aesthetic is a hard sell when thrifting is much more common now (not to mention cheaper and more responsible).	episode_done:True

I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.
