text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:Hey, go on pinterest and keep exploring clothing styles, lookbooks, etc. Pin the ones you like...don't overthink it...they are just pictures; you have nothing to lose. After a while, look at your board and look at the styles that repeat or similarities in what you've chosen. That should give you an idea. It'll take time but don't worry....you subconscious likes and dislikes won't disappear just because you haven't thought about them in a while.	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:i would say to just experiment with pieces. when it‚Äôs covid safe, go to the mall and try on some stuff in changing rooms. see what ‚Äúfeels like you‚Äù and looks right on your body and run with that. style is dynamic, and sometimes you just stop liking things. it happens! i also recommend pinterest, go on there and look at outfits, and pin all the ones you like, then go back and try to notice similarities, either in aesthetic or specific looks. good luck on your style journey!

text:Great minds? Too cheesy? :D	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:I feel like others said Pinterest is a good idea. Don‚Äôt feel pressured to stick to a certain style though. I don‚Äôt feel anybody completely embodies just one single aesthetic, people are more complex then that.   Also as far as making it easy to put cool outfits together I‚Äôd say find some colors you like some being neutrals I personally recommend main colors 3 - 6. It‚Äôs definitely not necessary but it‚Äôs really helped me out personally!   I also feel organizing ones closet in a way you like can make one appreciate there clothes more and easier to style. Like I mentioned before keeping a pretty strict color scheme in my closet is very important to me so I organize mine by article of clothing and in a color gradient.   I was in a similar spot before accept I more willingly just let my mom dress me. I understand how hard it is but now I‚Äôve had my own personal style for 3 years and the amount of growth, and style phases I went through is insane! I made a discussion post about style phases if you want to check it out! I now have a personal style and good sized wardrobe that I am really happy with!	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:a little late to the thread, but i would say first and foremost be practical...are you in a warmer or colder environment? Are you a student, or professional? do you go to a lot of fancy restaurants and the like in your free time (pre-covid obv), or are you more outdoorsy? This may seem kind of obvious but you'd be shocked at how many people don't think about these things when they dress, and your lifestyle is really important for creating outfits that you not only like, but will wear often! Pinterest is great but it can also be a little unrealistic sometimes. After you consider practicality its much easier to put together outfits and find things you like that match the occasion. Also, congrats on getting out of your parents' house, and good luck with the search!! you'll do great :)	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:To add onto some already really good advice, what you like may not be what you look really good in. This part took me the longest time to figure out. Key here is to keep an open mind. Your likes will probably change every 2-4 years, so when you buy new clothes, take note of whether it compliments with your features,is easy to mix and match with other things in your wardrobe and how wearable it is for your lifestyle. Once you start understanding a bit more about what works for you, even if your style changes over time, you'll know what to avoid or what to look for.	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:Loads of good advice already. I would also consider how you want to express yourself and be seen. E.g. Fun? Classic? Quirky? Uncomplicated? Elegant? That sort of thing, do some navel gazing. Do you want to show off your body or obscure it? What looks do you love on other people? What colours and fabrics do you love (or not).	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:Go thrift shopping and try on whatever strikes your fancy. I like thrifting for this because just about every cut, color, fabric and style are available and you can get an idea of things you like that are not in new retail stores at the moment. And everything is much cheaper, of course.   All the secondhand stores in my area have closed their dressing rooms, so this isn't as doable right now, but it is still fun to cruise the racks and get an idea for the range of clothing that is out there.   Have fun!	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:My advice is to notice what people around you are wearing.  Take notes!  Are you in school?  Glance around the classroom to get ideas.  Do you have a job?  Are your coworkers wearing mostly jeans, or something else?  You can balance that with what you see on pinterest.  I was in a similar boat in that my family was super poor growing up, so I just had to wear whatever was given to me.  It took me a while to figure out what to buy, I would end up in situations where everyone else would be dressed one way and I would be dressed another -- like, say, wearing jeans and a sweater while everyone else was in dressier attire.  It also helps to notice what you find yourself wearing a lot.  For example, if you start with two pairs of shoes, heels and sneakers, and you notice you wear your sneakers way more, then you've learned: you should own more sneakers than heels.	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:Like everyone said Pinterest is a good place to start. Maybe start by looking at what you find yourself picking out of your current wardrobe for casual days and days you feel like dressing up and see how you would want those styles to evolve since you‚Äôre a young adult now! I follow a lot of fashion you tubers as well and there‚Äôs a variety of trendy (bestdressed)/minimalist(Gemary)/ grunge(Sarah Hawkinson)/tomboy(madeyoulooks) style channels. I also find myself taking inspo from tv show characters.	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:My situation was the opposite as far as I know me and my sister were allowed to choose to wear what we wanted from as early as I remember. I also had a job as a teen so I could afford my fashion design hobby. I'm in my early 30s now and I think I finally found my style, but I'm struggling to feel amazing about it as I'm a bit overweight and I think things that I like simply look better on slimmer women.  Anyhow: I experimented loads as a teen and ever since, really. Buying things, wearing them or not, making things. It takes time to figure out which of the things you own get a lot of wear and which don't. You could go to second hand shops as it's cheaper to buy more here to experiment with. A lot also depends on any demands from your job, if you currently work. If you can freely wear whatever, you can go nuts. Some things that are great staples irrespective of style are some quality black leggings, nice trainers, good tops or bras for support, a nice handbag, backpack, and a few nice coats.  You could flip through magazines or websites and save any photos of style that appeals to you or simply individual pieces you like. Look at people in the street and take notes of any insights you gain from that.  I was very into goth stuff for daily wear until I went to art school and didn't want to get nice clothes dirty so I ended up wearing sports/athleisure gear. Now that I have a working from home office job I'm just wearing athleisure)chill stuff too but when I go out I try to dress in my style, which I've accepted is boho/eclectic/a mix. I've stopped trying to find a style and I'll just wear individual things I like, so I end up with a lot going on at times (big coat, patterned leggings, coloured trainers, hippie jewellery, an army style cross body bag etc. That's just me. I'm happy to look a bit strange and not according to one style.  You'll get there :).	episode_done:True

text:Did you see this in real life? I‚Äôve seen them on ig or youtube, but no one at the trader joes or coffee shop.	labels:well I wore a lot of these, so yes.

text:How do deal with being pressure to find ‚Äúclassics‚Äù and ‚Äútimeless pieces‚Äù when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels: This seems like more of a psychological problem than a fashion problem. People tend to have different priorities and motivators. For some people, ‚Äúfitting in‚Äù, ‚Äúmeeting societal expectations‚Äù, and things like that are very important. To other people, ‚ÄúBeing true to yourself,‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing individual‚Äù and other things like that are quite important. A lot of people end up straddling both though, and the decisions that you make should depend on the values you identify for yourself.   We are very influenced by the values of those around us, so you may feel this disconnect because what you value may not be the same as what your friends value, or what your parents value, or what people on the internet value. But we feel influenced by the values of others anyway if we want those people to like us. So what you should do is identify which things come from yourself and which things come from other people, and then which values out of that whole set you really want to embody. If you can label this more firmly, it may help to ‚Äòown‚Äô whatever decisions you make regardless of the values or expectations of other people.  It‚Äôs also important to remember that you can‚Äôt please everyone. People who value timelessness, elegance, and classic pieces might look at other people and describe their outfits as tacky, childish, too trendy, etc. Meanwhile those other people are looking at the timeless/classic people and describing their outfits as boring, aging, and bland. Neither camp is really better or worse, it‚Äôs just a different perspective - and it‚Äôs not like there are only two camps. But there‚Äôs no way to please everyone - so you just need to confidence to choose what you want to wear for reasons that feel right to you and then you need to own that choice.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find ‚Äúclassics‚Äù and ‚Äútimeless pieces‚Äù when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:I think I figured out how to ditch that pressure after I realized that I didn't like most items in all those "10 things every girl should have in her closet" listicles. I know that's less about trendiness, but it is about realizing that "classic" pieces really aren't for everyone.  It sank in even more when I got older and truly experienced how today's "classic" is tomorrow's "dated": Trust me, in 20 years no one's going to think those silk blouses, ankle-length pants, and button-down dresses really were the end all be all of timeless fashion, no matter how plain and minimalist they look to young eyes today.   That doesn't mean fast fashion is great, if only because the business model is unsustainable in a plethora of ways. But that's not something wrong with your preference for novelty! People have always liked novelty in their clothes, it just wasn't doable to buy tons of completely new garments so they made smaller changes. Buying less really is a good thing for the world, but "buy it for life" is a nonstarter for women's fashion unless you're a true ascetic.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find ‚Äúclassics‚Äù and ‚Äútimeless pieces‚Äù when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:When I was entering adulthood I mostly just bought secondhand clothes to experiment with and then resold them when I got bored or the trend was done (or if they didn't work for me). My "timeless classics" are pretty much just the experiments that worked - pieces that stayed in rotation or got so much use I needed to replace them with something similar later on, etc. I do keep on experimenting with little trends here and there, but it's also a nice comfort to have my classics around to mix in.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find ‚Äúclassics‚Äù and ‚Äútimeless pieces‚Äù when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:There's no pressure? Buy what you want, wear what you want. That's what I do, and I've been an adult for a few decades now. A wardrobe that contains (also, or mostly, or some, depending on your preference) timeless pieces, is something that builds over time. You don't just go shopping one day and get it all a-la-Pretty-Woman.	episode_done:True

text:How do deal with being pressure to find ‚Äúclassics‚Äù and ‚Äútimeless pieces‚Äù when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:What pressure? There's a pressure not to dress like a child when you're an adult, and I guess that intersects with trend-following, but it's not the same thing. Most fashion brands make their money selling to adults not kids.  While you can't quite 'wear what you like' and still be socially acceptable everywhere, you can most certainly follow fashion if that's what you want to do.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find ‚Äúclassics‚Äù and ‚Äútimeless pieces‚Äù when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:I buy/wear items that I like, whether they are in style or not, whether they are considered classic or not. For example, I love high waist pants and maxi skirts - both were "trendy" a couple years ago and I'm so glad they were produced more as a result. I will keep wearing them even though they're no longer trendy, because I love how they look and feel, even if no one else is wearing them.   Another example for me: neutral colors are considered classic, as well as patterns like plaid and houndstooth. But I love fun colors and funky patterns, so those are what I wear most, no matter if others are wearing different styles.  Just because something is labeled classic or trendy by social media, fashion brands, retailers, etc. doesn't mean that we have to adhere to them. You can wear whatever style you like, whenever you like, regardless if others woild label those items trendy or classic.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find ‚Äúclassics‚Äù and ‚Äútimeless pieces‚Äù when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:IMO there is \*almost\* no such thing as classic and timeless.  Just buy the things that you like, it's fine if you like trends and your style changes over time.  The idea that you become and adult and you must ditch trends is an internet myth, if you look at actual people (adults) that have some interest in style/fashion - they are following trends.  Maybe not in the same way or timeline as teenagers but they are not just wearing white buttons and trench coats all the time.  And even if they were, white button downs and trench coats are not exactly the same now as they were ten or twenty or thirty years ago.	episode_done:True

I have an athletic build - big thighs, an ass, but not an enormous waist (but not hourglass, I'm rectangular by all definitions), and finding jeans that fit or even come close to fitting is a challenge. I don't want skinny jeans and am just fine with a high waist, but when I sit I need to not feel constricted and they need some stretch to accommodate my legs and butt. I went to my favorite denim boutique for a personalized shopping experience and tried on just about everything in my size. I bought some jeans, but they're still not what I was looking for. My favorite is my husband's old ass sevens that have a huge hole in the ass (that I still wear out in public because why not), but they're not super flattering, just comfy.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:eBay:  - Filter by fabric content. Try searching for wool, silk, cashmere, and other nice fabrics.  - There‚Äôs a filter for vintage that‚Äôs useful for finding unique items. Also make sure to look at sizes that you may think would be too big. Vintage clothing tends to run much smaller.  - Avoid stuff labeled as ‚Äúunbranded‚Äù its mostly just cheap junk mass produced in China that is heavily advertised on eBay  for some reason - Make use of the extensive filters eBay has, you can use them to find very specific items.    Poshmark:  - Sort by recently price dropped. This means the seller is really trying to get rid of the item and you can get a better price.  - Don‚Äôt be afraid to make an offer. I‚Äôve made offers I thought the seller would never accept, but they did and I got some great items for insane deals.  - Search by key words, the filters are not as good as eBay  - You can filter by your specific sizes, but I don‚Äôt recommend this on Poshmark. The system does not work well. For example, I put my dress sizes as 4 and 6, and they only show me dresses labeled those sizes while leaving out dresses labeled small or medium.   In general for online thrifting: - Ask the seller for measurements if they aren‚Äôt posted already, and compare to clothes you have that fit well.  - Filter by size, color, or brand to find more specific items.  - Create saved searches if there‚Äôs a specific thing you want that you can‚Äôt find
text:For Poshmark sizing, you can also select sizes small and medium. So I usually check the pant size (26/28) ‚Äúdress size‚Äù (2/4) and the regular size (s/m) to get all of the items in my size!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:I shop a lot on Poshmark and I find it helps to think of it as ‚Äúslow‚Äù fashion. I don‚Äôt expect the instant gratification of typical online shopping.   I search for brands that are typically out of my price range, that I love. I save things by liking them and wait to see if the seller will make me a reasonable offer. People sometimes give amazing deals if something has been sitting long enough.   As others have said, use those filters!
text:I've been able to get some great deals by finding a specific item I'm interested in and then doing a new search for just that item. I look through the available listings and if they're all in the same or similar condition I like all of the lower priced ones and wait for the offers to come in.  I do sometimes make offers myself, kinda depends on how much I want the item and how unique it is. Like, I'm much more likely to make an offer on something vintage that I know I won't easily find another of. I have one in my likes right now I'm waffling on but I really do want it. For offers, typically you can expect to make an opening offer around 50-60% of the list price and still be considered reasonable, especially in reseller closets. (Full disclosure I do flip on PM as a small side hustle, I mostly use the funds to buy new things for myself.) There's a 20% commission fee and the shipping discount comes out of the seller's pocket, so they generally list higher to account for these in their profit margins. If I'm lazy and just want the item sometimes I just make an offer that essentially gives myself free shipping lol, better margin for the seller so they're more likely to accept.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:I pretty much exclusively buy second hand/ thrifted clothes as I can get MUCH better quality clothing than if I were to buy new. I tend to buy off eBay, depop and vinted. I search for the brands I live pretty frequently (just the brand name, no other filters) then see newly listed items. I regularly pick up sezane, self-portrait, COS, Claudie Pierlot items at really low prices. It helps when people don't know the brand so well (Claudie Pierlot for example- just bought a perfect condition puffer jacket RRP ¬£350, currently on the outnet for ¬£169...I got it for ¬£15.) Or for example a brand new La Perla full length night dress for ¬£20.  I think it helps that I also sell a lot, so if an item isn't quite right I sell it on.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:Filters are your friend. I like to start with brand - otherwise the search is way too broad and overwhelming. If you fill in your sizing the app will automatically filter out things that will not fit you (which culls the list quite a bit). If you find an item you like try looking through the seller‚Äôs other listings as well- often I‚Äôll find other items that appeal to my taste or discover new brands this way. I think you can suss out a lot about the seller based on the way they describe the items & pics they take too - someone who just Marie kondo‚Äôd their closet will have different kinds of items than someone who sells as a side hustle  The big appeal to me is the thrill of the hunt!! Happy shopping :)	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:I have a really hard time shopping on poshmark. I find I have to be super specific and it's not great for browsing. For instance "j crew tan cashmere cardigan" gets a manageable result but "flowy top" does not. I also uncheck boutique as that's all cheap stuff from china and search by brand when I have one in mind.   Ebay is has more filters which helps to narrow items down. I usually filter by material and country (only shop within the us since that's where I am, this gets rid of all the new stuff from china).  Also, I would definitely recommend thredup because you can return things. I recently placed my first order from them and ended up returning about half of it. They charge $2 per return and for free shipping you have to take store credit, which I think is fair and way better than just being stuck with something that doesn't fit. You can set up saved searches to make it easy to check for new items and also filter by brand/material/size/condition and sort by newest first.   Depop is also worth checking out, I find it to be a bit more curated and trendy than poshmark but often overpriced. There are less items so searching is more manageable, and search results are based on an algorithm (poshmark is just newest first). Also shipping is cheaper for small/light things.  Another one people are into is the real real, I haven't ordered from them myself but have seen it recommended. I think it's pretty much a higher end thredup.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:Some really great tips here! Here's my two cents:  1) If the seller doesn't respond to your questions, RESIST the urge to buy anyway. This seems really obvious, but I've made the mistake many times of panic-buying b/c I was afraid I'd miss out on the item, against my better judgment. Someone else may snap it up, but you've saved yourself the headache of wasting money on something that doesn't fit/is damaged/itchy/smells like cigarette smoke/etc.   2) Poshmark and eBay work better when you are familiar with the exact brand and model of clothing. They're not great for browsing due to just too much crap and too much inconsistency in the listings. If you don't really know what you want, I'd suggest browsing TheRealReal. They skew higher-end, but have a quite a lot of choice and have filtered out the trash and no-name brands already. Often you can find really rock-bottom prices for what you're getting (like Rag & Bone jeans for $30). You can search for something like "women's wool trousers" and then filter by size and color and sometimes style (cropped, wide-leg, etc). You'll be exposed to a lot of brands and styles you may not otherwise have thought of. Another pro (or con, depending on how you look at it), is that the clothing sizes are broken down into XS/S/M/L/XL categories, rather than numerical. So if you filter by "S" it will include 26-27 jeans, 34-36 Euro sizing, 40-42 IT size, etc., which is good when you're dealing with international brands. Even better is when the item includes measurements, which they often do, which are always more helpful than a number on a tag. Finally, on full-priced items (except for the really high end stuff), you can automatically get 20% by using their REAL code.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:Poshmark filters suck, but the fact that you can ask the seller for more details and they can offer you discounts means that you can find great things!  I find that if I like something, about 30% of the time the seller will offer me a discount right away, so start going crazy on the likes if you are ready to purchase something.  I always sort by new so you get first pick of the best stuff.    I search for specific fabrics, but this doesn't work perfectly on Poshmark.  I love linen, so I often just type "linen" into the search bar and see what I find.  The problem is that Poshmark doesn't have a fabric filter, so "linen-looking" items will end up in there, and sellers that don't list fabric won't show up there.  But I've found awesome pieces this way!  "My size" straight up doesn't work for me.  It's annoying, but I always manually pick my size once I get to a category.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:As someone who makes a decent amount of money casually flipping niche designers, it's become a bit of an arms race of bots/scrapers/market data warehousing for finding true steals.   Focusing on one or two designers (monobrand4lyfe) and learning the market well enough to flip items and pay for your retail purchase of what you _actually_ want is almost more reliable than hoping you find what fourteen seasons past item in your size in good condition.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:For Ebay, filter by "auction" vs "buy it now"    If I search for womens cashmere sweater size medium filtering by auction will take search results from 130,000 to 1,900. Much easier to peruse.	episode_done:True

If you have a sharp bone structure, try sharp and crisp styles, if you look fleshy go with soft draping fabrics, if you look short then split the silhouette by colors or a belt.

I‚Äôm kind of somewhere between an hourglass and an inverted triangle shape, and only 5‚Äô4. So many outfits online have like 4 layers on top and then my shoulders look huge and it‚Äôs not cute. Or I look like a big blob because they billow out over my round hips/butt rather than draping all pretty like the stick thin girl I saw the look on online.   I wouldn‚Äôt say I have ‚Äúsolved‚Äù it but I‚Äôve found a few ways to imitate the looks I like more successfully. Finding a slightly cropped version of a blazer or sweater I admire is helpful given my height, and also because I have hips and a round butt, long sweaters and blazers tend to look boxy and strange on me. I have also been learning about and experimenting with tucking shirts and sweaters a lot. Finally, minimizing layers or choosing blazers and sweaters that don‚Äôt have dropped shoulder seams helps keep my top half looking sleek. Unfortunately dropped shoulders seem to be all the rage everywhere I shop üôÑ  I know you‚Äôre pear shaped so it‚Äôs different but I think you can look at the ‚Äúvibe‚Äù of an outfit and imitate it in a way that suits your body. Mainly I try to look at a few outfits I‚Äôm drawn to, and figure out what elements they have in common or what it is that I‚Äôm liking. Maybe the colors, textures, silhouettes, etc. I like to save them on Pinterest and make note of what I want to find when I shop to pull those elements into my wardrobe.	episode_done:True

Maybe think of it like this as a test to see if it's the bag or the achievement of a milestone. If this bag (luxury or not) was found in a thrift store, and you couldn't find it in the store of the brand or online, and you left the thrift store without it, would you be worried that someone else would buy it before you? Or would you have a feeling of "meh, I'll find something similar?" If you would be worried about missing out on it forever, you want the bag.   You could also buy the super pricey Prada (or what ever luxury brand) and if having actually bought it feels wrong, you could return it.  But I totally understand wanting to have tangible reoresentations of the milestones you hit in life. Mine is one day being a home owner and not just a renter, and I really get excited at the thought of finding a space (not necessarily big, beautiful, or expensive) and making it mine.
text:Replying to this a week late, but for future reference most high end designer stores do not give refunds. They will allow store credit, but that defeats the purpose.

The fact that you have looked at the high end, well known brands and came away disappointed indicates that (this season at least), they aren't for you.   To answer your question directly: for me, personally, showing my own style is 1000% more important than showing the status of a luxury brand. Do the two sometimes overlap? Yes, and that's fine. But I don't personally get buying something *just* because it is a certain brand. Who are you trying to impress? What are you conveying with that logo (wow, you're well off? What kind of message is that, on its own?) I just feel like people who are super into labels, not the design or the style or anything else, just come across as kind of immature? The truth is, anyone worth spending much time with isn't overly concerned with what logo your bag has. (Now! I will concede there is a difference between showing off luxury brands and having higher end items, in some circles. Like, there could be some tension if you're hanging out with super millionaire socialites and everything you wear is from TJ Maxx...but in that case, I'd still say its important to focus on personal style first. And knowing about smaller higher end designers, rather than designers you can buy at a mall, is a whole different thing too...)

What kind of message is that, on its own?) I just feel like people who are super into labels, not the design or the style or anything else, just come across as kind of immature? The truth is, anyone worth spending much time with isn't overly concerned with what logo your bag has. (Now! I will concede there is a difference between showing off luxury brands and having higher end items, in some circles. Like, there could be some tension if you're hanging out with super millionaire socialites and everything you wear is from TJ Maxx...but in that case, I'd still say its important to focus on personal style first. And knowing about smaller higher end designers, rather than designers you can buy at a mall, is a whole different thing too...)

text:Yeah, I know people with millions of dollars and they definitely have branded clothes/accessories. The main things are they aren't buying them *because* of the brand logo alone and they don't show off the logo. Like, if they're carrying a Chanel bag or whatever, they are just carrying it like a purse, they aren't shifting it so the logo is always visible and holding their arms funny so anyone passing can tell what it is (which is legit something I've seen people do)...but yeah, the idea that every really wealthy person is just minimalist and discreet is pretty laughable.	labels:	episode_done:True

New money might (like the kardashians) dress more loud, old money might dress more subtle. But even then, it's still a matter of personal taste. The Kardashians and other non rich people enjoy the loud look, that's fine, other rich and regular people don't, that's also fine.
text:Exactly, a matter of personal taste. I grew up with two billionaire's daughters (both going back at least three generations of extreme wealth), one would never wear (and still doesn't) any obvious logos or luxury designer items, the other would wear head-to-toe Chanel on the regular- she was gifted her first Chanel bag at age ten. She didn't care that "classy" people aren't supposed to wear one designer head-to-toe. When your inheritance is in hundreds of millions, you don't give a fuck what "classy" is supposed to be. That's for upper-middle class trying to be upwardly mobile.	labels:>When your inheritance is in hundreds of millions, you don't give a fuck what "classy" is supposed to be.  Yes! 100% this.

text:Interesting article on luxury fashion made in Italy.	labels:I remember reading this article a few months ago, agree with u/jameane re: Deluxe. It's a good read. Luxury is so secretive about their supply chain and manufacturing that you cannot really get a good sense of who is crafting your goods and whether it's ethically done. Shit, I'll probably still buy a luxury item once in a while, but my eyes are a lot more open to exactly how much I am paying for the *experience* rather than the goods themselves.	episode_done:True
text:Interesting article on luxury fashion made in Italy.	labels:I think ethical concerns are at the root of most luxury brands, we just don't see it. Whether that be material sourcing, animal cruelty, slave or child labour/wages etc.  One would have to go out of their way quite a bit to avoid brands that operate like this. Even Nike etc is the same story.

text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:Absolutely. I‚Äôve gotten much better at buying for what I‚Äôll actually wear vs aspiring to look like how the models (or influencers) look. I spent a fortune at Anthropologie from 2005-2010 and gorgeous dresses, most of which i never ended up wearing. I never really wore makeup.  From 2010-2012, I moved into Urban Outfitters basic-ness, trying to be a bit more edgy. This is when I started wearing winged liner every day.  From 2012-2016, I was all about Banana Republic, because of wanting to appear professional, but was so bored with my wardrobe. I toned down my liner but added neutral eye shadow.  From 2016-2018, I almost exclusively wore athleisure because of my work switching from business casual to casual. I was comfy af though. Minimal makeup all the way.  From 2018 on, I‚Äôve limited myself to second hand shopping. My look is much more eclectic now, but I find the items I buy feel more like treasures to me. I wear everything in my closet and I‚Äôve got a much more streamlined approach to shopping. If it‚Äôs not made of a natural material, I don‚Äôt buy it. If it‚Äôs not black, white, grey, blue, burgundy, or yellow, I don‚Äôt buy it. If a skirt isn‚Äôt an A-line silhouette, I don‚Äôt buy it. These hard stops have prevented me from making the same fashion mistakes over and over again. I‚Äôm a more efficient shopper and my wardrobe stays cohesive.   I‚Äôve definitely experienced a glow-up with makeup, though. I feel like I‚Äôve really nailed down the look I like and I wear it every single day - tinted moisturizer with SPF, neutral satin eyeshadow, winged liner, peachy blush, eyebrow pencil, and tinted chapstick. It takes me 5 min in total to do this look. I never get bored of it, either. When I have to do a presentation, I‚Äôll wear bold red lips and that adds enough variety for me to feel like I‚Äôve spiced it up.
text:I‚Äôm a huge fan of A- line skirts too. I find them quite flattering!   Same with red lips they are timeless and always a good move!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:Oh no. Until I was 24 I either wore jeans + sweatshirt or full business formal and nothing in between. I had like 6 JCrew pantsuits when I was 14 because I did extracurriculars like mock trial and speech. I sold or donated my suit separates, because I don‚Äôt work in an environment where most of them would be suitable (I used to be an accountant, now I‚Äôm a sommelier). I‚Äôve never been consistent in wearing makeup but I stopped tweezing my eyebrows.   I have one pair of jeans now, since I prefer wilder colors and styles (I have a lot of very funky flare pants now). I guess it‚Äôs on-trend now but I don‚Äôt like it because it‚Äôs on trend. I have one scarf I bought when I was 16 that I am wearing right now and will wear for the rest of my life, and a ring I bought when I was 12, but I haven‚Äôt had any clothes for longer than 2 years.	episode_done:True
text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I‚Äôm Op but I‚Äôll share mine -  At around 14 I had a quick phase of really liking the very early sort of e- kid bright and trendy fashion. Hot topic forever 21 sort of edgy stuff. Skinny jeans only. Small wardrobe. Didn‚Äôt look great and got bullied a little for my new look. Lowkey wanted to look like a gorillaz character. Still kinda do though lol.  Then there was a transitional trendy masculine street wear phase from when I was late 14 to late 15 . I only really wore ripped jeans, graphic tees , always a belt , with vans or converse that matched the shirt. I started getting of compliments on my style from peers.  I then had an art kid style phase late 15 - 16 years old . Very similar to before but I started adding different style jackets and pants. This was an important phase because I started adding different accessories like print socks and hair stuff.   Really quick 90‚Äôs inspired phase. I tried dressing like 90‚Äôs Britpop singers lol. A small step back I‚Äôd say.   Late 16 to current ( I‚Äôm seventeen ) changed my style over quarantaine . Asking questions here changed everything. I realized how much I loved my more dressy clothes and fell in love with the l‚Äôecole des femmes clothes. I stopped following trends and went for mature more romantic and currently Victorian styles. Man repeller slightly masculine inspiration too. I wear skirts, tights , blazers, dresses, hats, neck scarves and blouses now. I also sold my years worth of converse and vans to buy oxfords and heeled dress shoes. Though my peers understand it a little less I have never been happier. Very confident in my style currently.    [Quick note - It may seem crazy to change my style so quickly but when your young you tend to go through clothes more quickly as you grow and teens tend to be more rough on clothes ]   Thank you for reading : )
text:>I also sold my years worth of converse and vans to buy oxfords and heeled dress shoes.  Without sounding like I'm generalising, I really admire this! It's probably not common for that age group but IMO it's a great move towards the current style you speak of, not to mention quite sophisticated.  Are you a fan of the brogue style? And for the heeled dress shoes what kind of style/height have you started off with?  Incredible journey with more twists and turns to come I'm sure!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I definitely went through a lot of style changes too!  Middle School- I wore what was ‚Äúin.‚Äù Tight t shirts from Aeropostale and sweatpants from Abercrombie.   High school- I geared more toward my current look. Jeans and t shirts, or dresses and leggings/tights if the weather allowed. I was very much an Ann Taylor/Loft fan because of their petite sizing. Sometimes I wore slacks and t shirts because slacks are more comfortable than jeans imo.  College (right now.)- I wear a lot of things similar to what you described as your current style! Not nearly as often as I‚Äôd like due to weather and dresses aren‚Äôt always practical. I did just get a bunch of new stuff from Collectif if 40s/50s vintage inspired clothes are up your alley. They have a big sale right now too! I also would check out shoes from American Duchess and Remix Vintage if they‚Äôre in your price range	episode_done:True

text:I love this because I had almost the complete opposite transition. I went from aspiring to have a slightly dressy, classic style 14-16, and then in the past year and a half (17 now too lol), I had a drastic shift towards recognizing that as put together as dressier styles look, it‚Äôs not for me.   Luckily, I barely had any clothes anyway, so heading off to college soon, I decided to focus on what I actually value (comfort above all, feeling like myself in clothes, and replacing things I currently wear a ton) and now find myself in a much more colorful (unless i‚Äôm feeling all black), streetwear-esque look. Yesterday, I wore an outfit that I can‚Äôt stop grinning about today, and that never used to happen before.

text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:1.  yes, I wear some items from 5+ years ago, but I style them differently.  2. I'm 21. At 13 I wore lots of neons, but I basiclly did it to annoy my teacher who said bright colours are slutty (yes, I find it confusing too)  At 14 I switched schools and dressed like a  1960s stoner. I realized quickly I wasn't into it and that I was just copying people around me.  15-18 was grunge. Docs, faded denim jackets, jeans with 42 holes in then, plaid skater skirts . I dressed like it was 2012 when it was actually 2015-2018, but for a change I was dressing for myself, without intentions to annoy/ conform to people.   18-21 got a job where I had to wear black every day , as a result I was sick of grunge.  I started weating more colours, and becsme intrested in both 1940s snd 1970s fashion.   3 . It took me a long time to switch to grunge because that was my first real style that I built up, but switching to my current style was easier and quicker.  4 . I don't really dress trendy. If I notice a trend I really Iike I buy it, but I'm ok with wearing absulotly untrendy things.

text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I‚Äôm also a teen and I‚Äôm new to styling and clothes and fashion and all.  When I was little (basically from when I was 5 to like around 9) I was what some people called a stereotypical girly girl. I only wanted to wear skirts. Hated pants. I *loved* pink. I loved to wear cool and frilly skirts and also skirts with graphic prints (and by that I mean Hello Kitty I was obsessed lmao) and also I loved dresses.   Then when I was around 10/11 I started straying away from dresses and more towards jeans and sweatshirts and graphic tees and Hot Topic t-shirts. And basically just continued just that casual style with jeans and a t-shirt lol.   Now I‚Äôm starting to get into fashion and finding out what I like. I‚Äôm also getting into more vintage looking things thanks to vintage and sewing youtubers such as Karolina Zebrowska, Bernadette Banner, Rachel Maksy, and etc. Now I still have a lot of the Hot Topic shirts and jeans and all but I‚Äôm getting into styling them. And also I‚Äôve gotten rid of a lot of my wardrobe that I just didn‚Äôt want/like/fit me anymore.  I have/had a lot of clothes that I like but I don‚Äôt feel especially passionate about. Very few pieces make me feel especially passionate or I love thoroughly. But  now I‚Äôm getting a few pieces that I know I‚Äôm going to *love* and are going to develop the style I want (which is probably a casually edgy victorian 50s Newsie with a modern twist lmao. Idk lol) And I‚Äôm also starting to get into sewing some clothes I like (haven‚Äôt started but I bought the supplies for sewing two skirts. ).   Also now I have a badass jean jackets and more beanies. I love beanies. Lol      Don‚Äôt really have much to say about my makeup journey because I don‚Äôt wear any. Other than when I was little I use to wear it for dance recitals and was into makeup. Then I just wasn‚Äôt anymore. Now I‚Äôm getting into skincare (because of my mom) and I‚Äôm considering getting some makeup and starting off with it. But I‚Äôm kinda clueless lmao.

text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I‚Äôm 27. My style changed a lot when I was around your age, lots of fast fashion and forever 21 type stuff. Went from a hot topic emo in the mid 2000s to an ‚Äúindie‚Äù girl in high school. I was always overdressed at school which I enjoyed because I like to stand out.   Early college I had a little vintage pinup phase and would wear a full face of makeup with super coiffed curled hair. Later in college my style really started to solidify and has been the same since around 2015.   I like le cole des femme clothes a lot too!! I‚Äôd say my style now is a little bit school girl/uniform inspired, and the really typical ‚Äúfrench girl‚Äù jane birkin type stuff. I don‚Äôt buy fast fashion anymore and I‚Äôm finally in a place where I can get investment pieces and shop small. My typical outfit is maybe a pair of levi‚Äôs with some sort of thrifted blouse and mary jane heels, or a tennis skirt with tights and a sweater and loafers. I wear very light makeup now since my skin has cleared up in adulthood, even after wearing black cat eye liner for probably 15 years straight. It‚Äôs nice to look back and see how my style has stabilized and matured.

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:I'd say to some degree yes. Most fashion houses are rtw/couture first and accessories second. They dipped into the handbag and accessories market to make more money, but the real quality (and bread and butter) for most fashion houses is their rtw.   Chanel is in this weird spot where they're trying to outrun the secondhand market and regain the exclusivity they once had. They're trying to be Hermes but they could never be Hermes because Chanel is not known for their leather.   So yes, I think when it comes to handbags/SLGs/accessories most luxury houses are trying to put out the latest and greatest and kind of mimic fast fashion to some degree. They're appealing to a market that can't afford to become their regular clientele. The people whom they can't text when the latest $7000 tweed jacket is released each season and know that they can walk away with a $10,000+ sale. So brands are trying to push out the latest and greatest handbags, SLGs and shoes.   In terms of rtw, I do think the traditional fashion calendar is very fast paced, but several brands have said they will step away from the traditional calendar and cut it back down to 2-3 releases per year. It will be interesting to see what this means for S/S and F/W collections.   Commenting more on the handbag/accessories market:  I say this as someone is kind of handbag crazy, but I do wish people would do more research about the brands and bags they purchase. People assume that just because a bag is marked up it's handmade by an artisan who specializes in leather but that isn't the case for most brands.   If anyone is looking for Hermes alternatives I highly suggest Delvaux. Valextra and Moynat also have fantastic craftsmanship. But I bought my first box leather bag from Delvaux last year and it's on a completely different level from Chanel.

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:I also feel like this holds true. I also don‚Äôt see a lot of effort from luxury brands as well to counter the fast fashion feel and perception. Less craftsmanship and no real effort concerning environmental effects or lowering their carbon footprint.   It‚Äôs a shame and I think the whole industry needs big change.

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:Any time you're paying more than a few thousand dollars for a basic article of clothing, you're paying for the brand; because you could have that same blazer or pair of trousers custom made by a tailor/dressmaker in the same or better quality, for a lower price.  This was the case in the 50s and 60s as well, but at the time, high quality clothing was more common, sewing skills were more common, clothes were expected to last longer, and the general public had a better understanding of what good-quality clothing looks like; people bought Chanel expecting quality construction, of course, but the main appeal of buying from a prominent Parisian fashion house was knowing that anything Chanel made would be in fashion for the upcoming years.  Now that we are immersed in fast fashion, nobody has the knowledge to hold luxury brands accountable, and fashions change so quickly that a well-made 'up-to-date' jacket from a reliably fashionable brand would be a pointless investment.  It just doesn't make sense anymore for luxury brands to invest too much on quality if there is no longer any demand for quality.  This is not *only* a recent thing: I've seen gowns from the court of Marie Antoinette made of materials costing 30+ years of a working man's wages, yet were hastily thrown together with big, sloppy stitches and tacks.  That's just what happens when your client wants their garment *right now* and will only wear it once or twice.  If you want something that's really well-made and is going to last a long time, there is certainly a market niche for that, but it's become more of a middle-class niche for people who *specifically* care about quality and durability.
text:What brands are best for durability? I want to find the niche!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:I'd say to some degree yes. Most fashion houses are rtw/couture first and accessories second. They dipped into the handbag and accessories market to make more money, but the real quality (and bread and butter) for most fashion houses is their rtw.   Chanel is in this weird spot where they're trying to outrun the secondhand market and regain the exclusivity they once had. They're trying to be Hermes but they could never be Hermes because Chanel is not known for their leather.   So yes, I think when it comes to handbags/SLGs/accessories most luxury houses are trying to put out the latest and greatest and kind of mimic fast fashion to some degree. They're appealing to a market that can't afford to become their regular clientele. The people whom they can't text when the latest $7000 tweed jacket is released each season and know that they can walk away with a $10,000+ sale. So brands are trying to push out the latest and greatest handbags, SLGs and shoes.   In terms of rtw, I do think the traditional fashion calendar is very fast paced, but several brands have said they will step away from the traditional calendar and cut it back down to 2-3 releases per year. It will be interesting to see what this means for S/S and F/W collections.   Commenting more on the handbag/accessories market:  I say this as someone is kind of handbag crazy, but I do wish people would do more research about the brands and bags they purchase. People assume that just because a bag is marked up it's handmade by an artisan who specializes in leather but that isn't the case for most brands.   If anyone is looking for Hermes alternatives I highly suggest Delvaux. Valextra and Moynat also have fantastic craftsmanship. But I bought my first box leather bag from Delvaux last year and it's on a completely different level from Chanel.
text: "regain the exclusivity they once had" - Is that possible? Chanel has too many brand ambassadors that just doesn't scream Chanel.	labels:I think they‚Äôre headed in the right direction with all of their price increases. When Chanel increases their prices, the prices on the secondhand market go up. So I guess that‚Äôs kind of on their side. On the purse forum, people say the goal is for the jumbo flap to be 10K.   I think it‚Äôs fine for Chanel to evolve from the Lagerfeld era.
text:They need to evolve and create a new identity post Lagerfeld era. It does need a revamp so I understand why they want to go back to exclusivity but they also need ambassadors who fit that image as well.	labels:I think once there‚Äôs an established image they decide they want. Brands have to evolve to cater to other demographics and markets, especially the eastern market. So of course their ambassadors will be more diverse in style/taste.
text:I guess we can agree to disagree but one thing we can agree on is the whole industry needs a revamp. We are in a weird time in fashion history. Anna needs to go. She's a legend but her being at the helm of fashion is ruining it in the process.	labels:	episode_done:True

But as long as they can sell cheaper clothes for the same price, then it would be silly to expect them to 'go back' to having higher business expenses.  So, really, you're asking for a societal change.  I think we're seeing more pushback against fast/disposable fashion in general, but we'll have to wait and see if that really takes off enough to the point where it changes rich peoples' buying habits.   There is that other issue, though:  \>  the main appeal of buying from a prominent Parisian fashion house was knowing that anything Chanel made would be in fashion for the upcoming years.  That depends on there being distinct fashion trends, and on people feeling compelled to follow them.  In the 50s and 60s, women had to comply with fashion trends in order to be accepted and respected within society.  Personally I'm quite glad that this is ~~no longer~~ less the case, but... well, now that it's less important to be on trend, it's also less valuable to be on trend.   Is it still worth paying thousands more dollars for a garment to be in style when nobody cares and the styles will change in a few months anyway?  If trends don't matter, then what is the point of shopping with a trendsetting brand?  Are brands like Chanel literally just depending on their customers buying solely for the sake of the label?  I guess that's another thing where we'll just have to wait and see if/how fast fashion destroys itself.  Maybe trends will regain some influence if they slow down, or maybe the trend bus will finally explode and people will just scatter into a multitude of alt fashions.  Either way I think there's a possibility for luxury brands to reestablish some sort of high style niche, but I would not expect (or want) them to have the same sort of leadership influence that they did in the 50s.
text:>the main appeal of buying from a prominent Parisian fashion house was knowing that anything Chanel made would be in fashion for the upcoming years.  Yeah Chanel and other fashion houses used to set the trends and it was up to you to make it into your own way. Fast fashion are the ones that are setting up trends same with fashion influencers. I just have more respect for seamstress creating timeless looks that will last a lifetime.  I agree I don't want them to dictate wants supposed to be in but I wish that a fashion brand like Chanel wasn't so cheap. They are raising prices because they want to be exclusive like Hermes yet everything right now is cheap and then conglomerates like LVMH care about profits and mass production its killing creativity and innovation.   This is why the fashion industry is where its at today. Even American Vogue is a shadow of its former self and Anna is the problem too.	labels:	episode_done:True

I remember about 10 years ago I saw a story about someone who took a photo a day of their face over an extended period of time and I was floored by the commitment and the progression of how much someone changes facially.  It was presented in one of those flip-book-esque ways.    I was intrigued by the idea of taking a photo a day as some sort of time capsule/chronicle and started taking outfit photos when it was somewhat shameful and indulgent (at least to me then) but now I have a whole archive of outfits from ten years ago.  It does chronicle emotions and whatever period I was going through as well so your piece resonated with me a lot.

text:> Noel is just famous.  I think part of the reason for this kind of collab is that the collaborator brings their followers to the audience for the clothing company‚Äôs work.  There are a lot of choices for customers out there nowadays, and to sell high end things you first have to get people to look at them.  Fielding‚Äòs signature look is playful and casual, but still meticulous and of high quality.  For the well-paid WFH crowd, who are no longer spending their clothing budget on daily office wear, I think this collab is a good marketing strategy.

When I think of Fendi, I'm not a fan due to the overt branding on the baguettes.

The graphics also don't excite me a ton, except for the cursive Fendi coat in 23 (and I actually love the pop of the turtleneck and gloves and piping - so whimsical!) This collection confuses me as it's simultaneously very muted but also funky, but I don't feel as though there's cohesive messaging. I don't know Noel from anything besides GBBO, but I would have expected or liked a l'il more goth and/or more color out of the collab.	episode_done:True

Like, if you have only a handful of items, do you also have the time and space to do washing at least once a week? That could mean having to go to a laundromat or it could mean handwashing in a sink and hanging things to dry. If you have an in-home washer and dryer (or at least washer) it's a little different, but otherwise, that is something to consider when you don't have many options...I'm not saying capsules are bad at all! Again, I think there are tons of reasons why people like them.

text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe ‚Äî how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:I've done so twice and the first time was a disaster.   I was trying to combine advice about "classic and timeless" pieces with a look based around an entirely different aesthetic, and it turned into a mess. I was still holding onto outdated assumptions about what was fashionable. I was trying to do too much at once. I have almost no pieces left from that year.  I am convinced that for 99% of people, "classic and timeless" is a scam. If you sew your own Victorian-style pieces, that's awesome. If you have a lot of time and money to spend a lot of time looking for the perfect 100% silk and cashmere pieces from different decades, that's awesome too. Otherwise, there's a good chance that you're in denial about a dated wardrobe. A better goal for most people is to get to a place where you can update with new pieces slowly - maybe 2-3 per year. I will be buying one new wool sweater this winter.  A good place to start is with what you already gravitate to in your daily life and your own closet. Imagine that you really want to go to work (or your favorite restaurant or to do something fun on the weekend, whatever you do often) tomorrow wearing something that makes you feel special and look your best, but you're going to be wearing it all day, so it needs to be pretty comfortable. Which outfit do you pull out?   In my own wardrobe, I can look through the outfits I passed by and say why - too casual (although sometimes those are perfect for another activity), I just don't love it and it would never be my first pick, too tight, too cheap-looking, not my style, too boring. It's easier to build around what you already like than to throw everything away and try to buy things based on an imaginary person that you've never actually been. Get rid of the things that you never gravitate toward, and see what's left. From there, you might need just a few more wish-list pieces to get that smaller wardrobe you love.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe ‚Äî how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:My advice to my past self would be:  GO SLOW. However slowly you think you‚Äôre going, it‚Äôs still too fast. Find one piece that you really love- beautiful color, perfect fit, quality material, in a style you like- before even thinking about more.  Trying to plan an entire wardrobe (even a tiny one) and then trying to shop for the plan, just landed me with a bunch of stuff that wasn‚Äôt quite right. Going slowly, piece by piece, helps to make sure I‚Äôm making a good purchase rather than something rushed, trying to fill a perceived wardrobe hole. It‚Äôs also helpful, because if you go slowly one piece by one piece, you‚Äôll also be doing ‚Äúwith as few pieces as possible‚Äù, and can stop when you have what you need and love.  My second point of advice to myself would be to stay off the internet, focus on what I actually like for myself, and not get distracted by all the pretty things on all the different people.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe ‚Äî how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:If you aren't married to the idea of capsules:  Buy seasonally appropriate basics and rent fancier work clothing or special occasion garments from Rent the Runway (or another rental brand). It's a good way to take your time with building a wardrobe you like while trying out trends you may be curious about but hesitant to pull the trigger on. It's worth noting that your wardrobe is never really done. Things get worn out, fall out of favor, stop fitting your lifestyle, or you just stop liking them. I think if you have a solid foundation (jeans, slacks, a few blouses, sweaters, t-shirts, undergarments, a few pairs of black and brown shoes) you can find flexibility with styling beyond that without feeling that you have not enough clothing or a million things and nothing to wear.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe ‚Äî how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:There's often a difference between clothes that you like/admire vs what you actually enjoy wearing/works for your everyday life.  Being able to clearly define the latter usually eliminates a lot of stuff from consideration.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe ‚Äî how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:When you're looking at pictures for inspiration ask yourself if you like the clothes or if you like what you feel the clothes etc represent. If you buy clothes because of what you feel they represent you may end up wasting money and having to do another wardrobe re-vamp.  To give you an example: I find myself drawn to drapey, flowy, bohemian, artsy types of clothes. The sort that tend to look good on taller women with small busts. Now I'm a firm believer in wearing things you like regardless of whether conventional wisdom says they look "good" on you. But in this case what I was being drawn to was the lifestyle I felt those clothes represented, not the clothes themselves - which it turned out did not fit my lifestyle, my personality or my shape. It took quite a few expensive mistakes to realise this.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe ‚Äî how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:I had to revamp my wardrobe over the last two years as I changed jobs and sizes.   I had just finished a no-buy year, while I lost weight so was starting with nothing at all.   1. Buy decent undergarments. As a large busted woman, I can‚Äôt tell how anything fits without a good fitting bra. There‚Äôs r/abrathatfits to get a good measurement as many women are wearing the wrong bras. I got a size and sister size from this, went to a bra shop with a good range of bras and tried a few on to find one everyday one that fitted perfectly. Get a decent sports bra while you are there if you exercise at any speed above a gentle stroll.   2. Know what you need for where. Having items for work, weekend and exercise is important. Some people don‚Äôt separate work and weekend wear that much and others have wardrobes that look like they belong to different people.   3. Start with one or two items/outfits (especially if trying a new look) before committing. There‚Äôs no point in buying a whole wardrobe that later doesn‚Äôt feel right. I had a strong sense of what I liked and still bought a couple of oopsies.   4. A classic/go-to item might not be a classic for you. I love the look of skirts but never ever wear them. I only wear trousers and/or dresses so wasted my money on a couple of classic black skirts for work. I have worn them exactly 0 times.   5. Take risks in the dressing room. Try different colours and silhouettes on in actual shops and think about what you like/don‚Äôt like about each piece. I have changed my style a bit as it is free to try it on!   5. A decent blazer that fits well makes any outfit more formal when you need it- even us more casual people.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:You're kinda making a mountain out of a molehill here. It's not hard to wear colors. Relax about it. It's not a disaster if things clash slightly. You'll be fine. There are no fashion police.   My usual style is I get either brightly colored top or a bright bottom (or a bright dress). The other is relatively neutral to avoid clashing or being overwhelming. This is not a hard and fast rule. There are times when it's fine to break it. It's just a guideline for when I'm in a hurry.  Match saturation and brightness. Burgundy and plum are fine together because both are relatively saturated and dark. Pale pink and lavender work together. Burgundy and lavender are harder because they don't match in saturation and brightness. They aren't impossible to put together and look good but it's a bit harder.  You will not look good in some colors. This is 100% fine. Try things on. Figure out what makes you look awful. You can do this. It doesn't need any special knowledge.
text:In total agreement with this. I kept trying to find my season/palette/whatever using a bunch of systems and always got frustrated. But then I found friskygatos on IG and she was just like... "Hold up colors next to each other and if you like them together, wear it." And her lizard brain concept was super freeing.  Today I wore an all pale pink outfit and got tons of compliments and felt fabulous. I don't even know/care if it was my most flattering color, but just the fact that I looked different than the sea of neutral outfits out there made me happy!	labels:> "Hold up colors next to each other and if you like them together, wear it."  That is literally how I choose outfits and I've been told I look well-put together.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:I think an important question you should ask yourself before just trying to incorporate color is  are you actually dissatisfied with neutrals/does color really inspire you? I think the biggest reason I wear color is because when I look at it, it makes me happy, it inspires me to want to wear pieces, and I get excited shopping for it.   In looking for color to incorporate in with your neutrals, I would just first find out what colors you feel drawn to - sure maybe some you‚Äôll find will be things you like, but maybe aren‚Äôt the most ‚Äúflattering‚Äù or versatile, but I still think that‚Äôs a good place to start, because fashion should be fun.   As far as practical advice, wearing color is a lot easier when you have neutrals to pair it with. I tend to wear one bright color/color family with neutral tones and tie it in also with my accessories. Things like earrings or accessories can be good places to introduce color if you are feeling nervous about it as well.  Also, learning about the color wheel and the undertones of colors can be really useful for color matching.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:This sounds counterintuative, but you should try colourful patterns. Than, you take one of the colours from the pattern and wear another item of thar color. For axample, I have a top with  white, orange, blue and olive stripes, and I can easily pair it with any bottoms in these colours.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:Assuming you wear jeans and a t shirt now and then, go out and buy a cheap t shirt or two in a colour you like. If you find yourself wearing them regularly, buy some more bright items. If you don't wear them much, then perhaps bright colours are not for you, at least now, and you won't have spent much to find out.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:Start with colors that go with your existing colors. Navy goes really well with mustard yellow. Mustard yellow goes with black and white effortlessly.   Once you have that down, then choose colors that go with the colors you added. So, if you added mustard, than, brown goes with mustard. Viridian goes with mustard. Pink goes with mustard. So on and so forth. Some colors will look good on you, and some won‚Äôt, so, the best way to incorporate colors is to just try colors on.
text:I love mustard as a neutral!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:As someone who used to exclusively wear black (not exaggerating, it was a manifestation an anxiety/ocd problem- lots of therapy, baby steps, and now I consider leopard and hot pink neutrals), I found it easiest to start with accessories (especially shoes!) and patterns that were mostly black. Dark florals go with just about everything. Once I got used to that, I branched out into floral pants and funky sweaters. There was definitely trial and error, and I spent a ton of money on items that ultimately went to consignment it goodwill. However, now I have a really good idea of what I like, and while I still love a good neutral moment, my wardrobe is probably 1/2 colorful pieces, 1/4 non-black neutrals, and 1/4 black pieces.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:Don‚Äôt over think it. Just rip off the band aid. Head to a store that has basic tops (sweaters or t-shirts depending on your location) and pick a colour that makes you smile. Bring it home, try it on with all your bottoms til you find a good combo - given your focus on basics, there will be more than one!  Uniqlo is good for this, also banana republic usually has a table of sweaters with a few ‚Äúthis season‚Äù brights (last year I got an amazing Kelly green sweater there - works so well with navy!)	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:Colorful skirts are good options to try out. I also have a mostly neutral wardrobe, but I discovered that I can pair basic white shirts with a more colorful skirt.  It looks fun, but still "safe" because I don't have to worry about what color suits my skin tone.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:To add onto the rest of the great advice in this thread, following the color trends can be helpful in seeing how color looks on others and how you can apply them to yourself. I follow some accounts that specifically photograph folks during fashion week in various locales, and there's so much vibrancy that occurs there with colors that you might not expect to fit together. It helps to have these (kind of) practical examples in mind before you go on blowing money on colorful goods.  I've never actually done a color analysis, personally, but intuitively over time you will get a sense for what flatters you. You can even try holding random household items like Clorox wipes (lol) or notebooks up to your face or skin to see if that color would work as an actual item on you, preferably in good natural lighting where it won't distort the tones so much. I also like to accessorize with one small bright thing at a time, like bags, belts, scarves, or jewelry. Another way to do this is with wearing nail polish, either different colors on your nails all at once or specific parts of a palette to see if that combination is flattering with your skin tone.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:I hopped on r/coloranalysis and got an idea of my palette. I‚Äôve been able to add a few sweaters/tops into my rotation that I feel confident look good against my skin tone. It has definitely helped me dip my toes into wearing more color and feeling confident doing so! Before I had an idea of what colors actually worked, I felt uncomfortable buying/wearing color.  I didn‚Äôt really think adding an accessory in a color helped me feel more comfortable. Understanding color theory a little more wrt how it works on my own coloring felt more intentional in my opinion, then I just went for adding a few tops.	episode_done:True

text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:What do you mean you don't have the time to shop online? Fashion is like anything, if you want to develop a style, it takes time...for most of us that's not a cost, that's a benefit :).  If you say the stores around you are limited, you MUST go online. I'm almost jealous of you - you're going to experience so many beautiful things for the first time if you haven't been looking before!

text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:Well, i won't claim to be a style icon but my recipe since i was a teenager is essentially as follows:  1.  Buy used.  I mostly thrift but also look on used slow fashion instagram, Etsy, Poshmark, etc.  For thrifting, there is no secret - just go often, don't feel any pressure to buy something every time you go.   2.  Only buy natural fibres (silk, wool, cotton, linen) - this isn't hard and fast as I have thrifted down puffer jackets, etc but if it is touching my skin it isn't acrylic or polyester.  3.  Buy things that are interesting.  A unique shape or colour, or a beautiful material, it stands out on the rack. I mostly don't thrift fast fashion, it was shit to begin with - I am looking for vintage tags and high quality clothing.  Look at how the seams are finished, how the buttons are sewn on.	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:You're asking a couple of different questions  1) how do I build a style without much time or money?  Pinterest is a good way to do that.  Everytime you do have time and see a look you like pin it.  Pin whatever pleases you visually.  Can be other things besides fashion too.  Then when you have a bunch of things pinned look for a common thread.  Maybe it will turn out that you're a person who never knew she loved organic, flowing shapes in blues or graphic designs and structured fabrics.    2) figure out how well what you like goes with your body type or coloring and if there are ways to bring the two together.  I have a big butt so I may be able to wear some of the things i like and not others.  I also look like crap in orange but can get away with coral so I'd go for coral instead or tiny bits of orange print on a background of a color that does flatter me.  3) Yes there are staples that are classic.  black or navy or gray or for some people brown pants however if you're not a black or navy or gray or brown person you might be better off figuring out what you like first and then what would be a staple for you.	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:The most important part of expanding my closet as a college student with limited resources was  changing my mindset from always wanting brand-new clothes to appreciating thrift shopping. It's just so much cheaper and most of the clothes are in perfect condition. In addition, the vast amount of different styles from even different decades makes it much more fun to shop at.  Jeans are my absolute favorites to thrift. The wear (and tear) makes them so much more unique!
text:I agree with this mindset wholeheartedly. Fashion is an incredibly expensive hobby for me, personally, and I let it be because I can afford it now, but you can absolutely build a wardrobe off of thrifting and purchasing secondhand clothes. And in fact, once your mindset shifts to this, or even to concepts like capsule wardrobes, you'll force your mind into building more styling options with what you have, even if it's not the vast wardrobe that you might see from influencers or bloggers.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:Where are you from? Are you a student or a working adult? What is your budget and purpose of dressing up? Do you have any spare weekend to go into a megastore (e.g. Zara, your local department store...) to try out all types of colors and silhouettes to see what suits you? You're not obligated to buy even if you try it on. If anyone ask, just say you're just trying out and still thinking about it.             I suggest knowing your measurements (use a measuring tape!) and sticking to a capsule wardrobe. Black/White top + colorful bottom or colorful top + black/white/brown bottom with neutral shoes.       Keep in mind the stylish people on social media spend a ton on their clothes or rent/return them after taking photos so they are not exactly appropriate comparisons for everyone.	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:I would start with good quality basics. Having a good foundation will allow you to expand with more trendy or style defining pieces, but it‚Äôs very hard to achieve a personal style without the first step.

text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:I almost exclusively online shop. I wouldn't say that I am a trend setter or anything, but it is so much easier to look at photos online of people who have the same body shape as me whose fashion I admire, compare those photos to what I have in my closet, and purchase what is missing to make the outfit work all in one place. It sounds like a lot, but I find this so much easier, less anxiety-inducing, and less time consuming than brick-and-mortar shopping. Plus, usually returns are just a drop off somewhere with a digital reciept rather than waiting is line at a customer service counter with a paper receipt that I have lost twice, ripped, and had to tape back together. A little tidbit: the biggest trick to online shopping is to KNOW YOUR MEASUREMENTS!!! A cheap measuring tape works wonders.	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:Volume (a lot of items) and access (lots of designer things) doesn't create personal style. Personal style creates personal style, and it is a huge spectrum of things. There is no "one up" in personal style when it is authentic and your own. You'd simply appreciate all the style around you as its own, and appreciate and focus on your own style and look. Most people on social media have tacky, pointless style. They're wearing clothing, etc. for likes and clicks. The problem with this is that it means you're always cycling through what generates likes and clicks - not what is unique and stylish about you. You don't need new clothes. You don't need to change. You need to recognize your style and own it, and find the validation in it how it comes versus mirroring/measuring it to someone who is operating for validation and attention.	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:I've went through this myself, and the thing that has helped the most is to build that skill inside your head of "what does style mean to me?" The answer to this question is different for everyone, and you'll see it reflected just on the WAYWT threads - whether fashion is highlighting your existence in a certain social sphere, whether style is function over form, etc. What I did before my "outlet" grew was to source my inspiration online and think about pieces that I had and why I did or didn't like or wear them. You can do this with your existing wardrobe, or by window-shopping, which I know isn't so easy in COVID times, but you can do it online as well. What features do you love about your existing clothes? What defines "nice clothes" to yourself? I used to think that it was all about polished business casual clothing, because that reflected the work environments I had to survive in. Your staples will also be defined by what you think flatters (or unflatters!) you the most.  To be honest, I think style takes time; time to hone in on what you want or how you want to represent yourself. And if it doesn't take time, it does take money, and that's why being a stylist is a viable career path as well. But you do not need money to build or learn about style. My style has changed vastly from when I moved cross-country multiple times, and when I've changed careers. But style doesn't need to be static or done immediately. :)	episode_done:True

text:Favorite everyday-fashion magazines	labels:I‚Äôm 29, and to be honest I don‚Äôt know of any fashion magazines besides Vogue, and like you, that is just not my lifestyle. Other magazines seem to target older women. It doesn‚Äôt seem like there is an equivalent of Seventeen or Teen Vogue for us, which is a shame. I spent ALL my allowance money at the magazine stand as a young girl, I really miss those days!    Now I honestly rely on blogs like Who What Wear. Things move much faster now and there is sooo much more content that relying on a monthly magazine just isn‚Äôt realistic anymore IMO.	episode_done:True
text:Favorite everyday-fashion magazines	labels:Great everyday ones: Marie Claire, InStyle.

text:Favorite everyday-fashion magazines	labels:Instyle is probably the best fashion magazine that features a good mix of styles and price points (some stuff is definitely expensive still, but they have lower priced items too). O, the Oprah magazine, isn't just fashion, but there are usually quite a few fashion article, again with varying price points. Both also seem to include items of extended size ranges, which is also nice!
text:I too am a fan of InStyle magazine.   O, the Oprah magazine has gone digital and will only issue print magazines quarterly as of January 2021.  Personally I find this to be a PITA since I prefer a print edition to a digital format for magazines.	labels:Wow, I hadn't heard that about O! I am in charge of my library's magazine subscriptions, so I'm definitely going to have to investigate that!! (It's not unusual for us to not find out about changes in subscriptions, lol.

She flaunted its (supposedly) high price and honestly, it was hilarious lol.  The thing is, both my bff and I are massively into bags, yet MV was virtually unknown back then... and we are both Italian.  Since the lawsuit in 2017, MV has gained momentum in cheap/mid-range Italian stores like crazy, which I think really boils down to people making a connection between the brands.	episode_done:True

To start off, even though I‚Äôm not a fashion or costume expert or anything the clothing looks just so bland. Like it says almost nothing about their characters and just bland overall. Not unique.   They also took beloved characters and removed/replaced them. And there‚Äôs also the issue of whitewashing some of the characters in what was originally a pretty diverse show and it just looks like a mess.	episode_done:True

They look like they‚Äôre wearing the most basic clothes girls wore at my mistake of a Christian college, the removed girls, and *please* do not get me started on the white washing of some of my faves!!!

text:Villanelle's Killer Wardrobe, Once Again	labels:I'm usually paying attention to her face because she's such a great actress but I had a lot of fun looking at these outfits and paying some more attention to them. I find it interesting trying to break out what she wears when she's not playing a character and what she wears when she's trying play a character or when she's not trying but still is being manipulative. (**POSSIBLE SPOILERS UP TO END OF S3: DON'T READ AHEAD IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED AND DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED ALSO IF SOMEONE KNOWS HOW TO BLOCK THEM OUT AND CAN LET ME KNOW THAT'D BE AWESOME)**  &#x200B;  The little girlish dress with the cut out heart when she's pleading with her mom to form some kind of relationship with her and the pink dress when she's trying to trick Konstantin into thinking she's worried about him so she can steal the card with the next job on it.  When she's feeling herself and doesn't have to play a character she's usually wearing a patterned suit or some comfy black pants and a cool top. When she was playing Billie she wore two kimono-inspired jackets, which is pretty interesting and I just noticed the continuity for that character. When she was starting over after she thought Eve was dead she's wearing stylish romantic dresses which match her new villa in a way.    &#x200B;  **END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS**  &#x200B;  Anyway I enjoyed the album, she has a really interesting style and wears everything so well.	episode_done:True

text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:All my non athletic leggings are from American Eagle. It‚Äôs been a few years since I purchased some from there since I don‚Äôt currently need any (plus they all all seem to be high-waisted nowadays) so I don‚Äôt know if the fabric makeup is the same or not, but I‚Äôd give them a try. I also like some of their joggers. In case you need any athletic leggings, Under Armor has been comfortable for me. Just the basic cold gear or heat gear though. The higher rated ones (2.0 and up) have a thicker inner layer which I did not care for on my skin. Too much of a ‚Äúsnag and drag‚Äù type sensation if I had any dryer patches of skin.	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:I always get itchy in tights! Falke makes 100% wool tights and socks that feel great and are highly durable, but they don‚Äôt have the ability to look really fancy like a nylon pantyhose (though maybe there‚Äôs a silk option or something).   I don‚Äôt have a problem with most leggings, but I‚Äôve seen wool leggings by icebreaker and smartwool. Both those brands can be pricy, but I snagged my partner some nice icebreaker base layers on their Black Friday sale for over half off (doesn‚Äôt help this second, but watch for sales if the retail price seems too icky)	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:\--lululemon align leggings (size up).  Closest to wearing nothing that I've found in a legging.  \--gap pure body modal joggers.  These are actually like wearing nothing.	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:I LOVE Aerie leggings! I usually look for ones with some cotton content (100% synthetic irritates my skin.) But I just bought the Aerie offline goals leggings and they are like butter. No irritation, so comfy. And leggings are 25% off right now on the app!	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:I like fleece lined tights. The lack of a seam really helps with itchiness and the fleece feels softer against my skin instead of clingy.

text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:Natural fibers only!

text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:They are expensive, but for wearing under skirts/dresses, I find that silk or a silk/cashmere stocking blend works best for me. I find them used or gently used, and do my best to take extremely good care of them. I also found that going on an anti-inflammatory diet helps quite a bit, and using unscented everything and being very careful with my laundry soaps. I use wool drier balls, and am in love with those, too, in place of any softener. I generally sleep without clothing/underwear, unless I am staying at my parents or in-laws, in which case I opt for a fairly modest silk nightgown. At home, I wear 100% cotton leggings or a dress for leisure wear.	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:I've found that cotton is best, with up to 5% spandex. It's not a sexy look, but cotton flannel pyjamas are very comfy and cause no skin issues for me. I also have a couple pairs of cotton-stretch joggers from Amazon for home wear, and a pair of truly ancient 100% viscose leggings (they're basically see through now, which is probably why they're so soft). Honestly I usually wear a cotton dress around the house though - I find anything tight-fitting on the legs can cause trouble.  For tights, Falke has always been more comfortable than average for me. I buy a size up, which seems to reduce the pressure and itching.	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:I always found tights and leggings to be itchy until I tried the Vuori Performance Jogger. They aren't skin-tight and are incredibly soft. My skin can't handle fleece, regular sweatpant material, or anything remotely scratchy. The vuori joggers are my new favorite pant - I have multiple black pairs and can't sing their praises enough.	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:OP, my boyfriend's mother was tested allergic to blue dye in polyester and nylon, so she can only wear natural fibers. You should probably get it checked if those fibers are bothering you. Maybe you have an allergy with some chemicals used to dye or process these fibers. The allergist will help you figure out the category of clothes you can and cannot wear.  In my bf's mom's case, she only wears 100% cotton, wool, cashmere, and silk fibers.	episode_done:True
text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.

text:I love this answer, and I think that‚Äôs also why certain looks on certain people end up looking so costume-y. If a look is not authentic to your life and to who you are, it‚Äôs not going to have the effect you‚Äôre hoping to achieve.  The notion of appreciating fashion without feeling compelled to wear it yourself also ties into the conversations around cultural appropriation. As beautiful as I find traditional attire from other countries and cultures, or as cool as the fashion is in many countercultures, I don‚Äôt NEED to wear those outfits on my own body to appreciate and enjoy them.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I love this comment. It‚Äôs so freeing to appreciate fashion (and fashion photography) as an art and not only from a consumer perspective or through the lens of your own wardrobe needs. I have tons of Pinterest boards for aesthetics that are totally impractical for me, but I just enjoy looking at them and imagining the lifestyle of those characters. I only have a couple of boards that are for items I would practically wear. Those boards have purpose too, but I have a definite mental distinction between looking at outfits for fun and trying to fill holes in my wardrobe.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:This is a Good Comment.  Especially the part about reacting to the model's body and styling as well as the items of clothing. And man, it can be real tough to come to terms with that sometimes. Having a cohesive style certainly helps with the styling aspect in these situations, but the part about the body is rife with stress and emotion for a lot of people. There's no one right way to deal with that. Everyone just needs to find the line between what they like and what they actually want.	labels:	episode_done:True

You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.
text:Well-said! Body type especially has a big impact on how an outfit/style is perceived. Models showing off androgynous styles rarely have curvy body types. Meanwhile, "sexy" looks often go hand-in-hand with curvy. And the "off-duty model" look pretty much requires already looking like a model, otherwise you're just a chick in casual clothes. A beautiful woman looks good in damn near anything, that's why most models are beautiful women, lol.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Exactly. It‚Äôs the fantasy life that those images convey. When I see someone wearing crisp trousers, soft button ups, stilettos, etc., I imagine that I‚Äôm living the life of someone wearing them. Effortless, breezy, maybe wandering around Paris window shopping on a nice spring day... but in reality I‚Äôm working from home on my couch. Structured trousers would be uncomfortable AF, cotton/linen blouses would be a wrinkly mess, my cat would get fur everywhere, I‚Äôm allergic to wool and I don‚Äôt wear shoes in my house, because ew. Or I‚Äôm going for a walk in my neighbourhood after work and it‚Äôs raining and dark, so I need a waterproof/reflective jacket and sturdy boots. It‚Äôs fun to look at pictures of nice styles, but they aren‚Äôt my reality.	labels:Ironically, right before the pandemic I was looking at buying a new suit, as I was just months into a new job that required me to be a bit more "business" (at least on 5 or so days a year) than my previous "distracted-professor" type jobs. I'm now glad I hadn't bit the bullet yet.   I just bought a new pair of jeans, as I was wearing out my previous pair. The ones that came are a little too big (despite being the same numerical size, style, *and color* as my last pair...), but maybe that's ok right now?	episode_done:True

text:I completely agree! I love androgynous looks but with my figure I can't really achieve the look I want. The same goes with hairstyles. I have been eying the pixie cut and other shorter hairstyles enviously in the past, but it doesn't fit my face.	labels:I have the same struggle, I love androgynous/masculine looks but I'm a short hourglass so I don't feel like I effectively radiate the same aesthetic.

text:Totally agreed, and this is why it makes me a bit squirmy when people say "wear what makes you happy!" in this sub, in the sense that it should be the last word in clothing. Yes, of course you should wear what makes you happy, but what makes us happy to wear is not so simple for a lot of people.  There are tons of things I don't particularly love in isolation but make me happy on my body, and conversely things I love in isolation but *don't* love on my body, and that can come from many angles: pure aesthetics but also fit, comfort, personal goals, how I'm treated when I'm wearing it, etc etc. What exact elements contribute to any of these is really the crux of personal fashion, and it's a far more complex conversation than just "wear it if you like it".	labels:Yeah, "wear what you like!" is an unhelpful platitude. It's the "just be happy!" of fashion advice, it doesn't tell you HOW to get where you want.	episode_done:True
text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:I get this so much. I have two boards on my Pinterest because of this. I have my "things I like to look at apparently" and one I actually called "My look apparently".

I‚Äôm losing weight (retail workout/anxiety diet) and my taste is getting really forest gothy. I don‚Äôt have time or energy to sew right now but I have dyed a lot of my fancy fabrics black and hung them all up. I love seeing all the tonal and texture variations.

text:Yeah, I will be posting on insta, maybe Facebook (land of in-laws) depending on how sexy the Edie Britt (Desperate Housewives) and Shane McCutchen outfits turn out. I added the social media part moreso so people could try for themselves, because I do keep my social media private. However, I really do think you need to have some kind of goal other than "I'm going to try and dress like Blair Waldorf" to make it fun and keep momentum going.   I suppose I could post outfits here with my face blurred if anything comes together particularly well! However, because I'm not buying any new clothes, not all of the references are as spot on as they could be. As such, I'm nervous people would be disappointed!	labels:No, the not buying new clothes makes it so much more interesting! Buying the cloth is something everyone could have done. I totally get keeping socials private, but would be very exited to see the blurred edition here.
text:It is very fun! I think to myself, "what would this character do with my closet?" so even though I don't have the low-rise jeans and tight satin tops of the 2000s needed to make more exact replicas, I still have a sense of what colors, fabrics, and silhouettes the character would go for. I am also fairly curvy, with prominent dark curly hair, so have to make adjustments there as well. For example, most of what Gabrielle Solis (Desperate Housewives) wears looks much less "classy" on a curvier frame, so to get her "vibe" I have to pick different pieces to fit my body type.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Bags that are actually beautiful - what are you loving?	labels:I‚Äôm also a fan of understated but elegant handbags. I bought a pre-loved Celine nano luggage that I have been loving. I enjoy Mulberry‚Äôs designs too and will probably get my next bag from there as their bags are relatively affordable compared to some of the bigger designer names. I love Chloe bags too but I think those might be a little too trendy and blingy for me.  Totally agree with you on Bottega, I think it‚Äôs overrated, especially the dumpling looking bags.
text:I was also considering getting the Mulberry Alexa (which I wanted back in the day), but it reads a little too cutesy to me, and in general Mulberry I associate with upper middle class 40+ Londoner, though I think their designs are really beautiful.   Agree with you on Chloe designs being nice but too trendy/iconic, I swear when I was younger there were so many nice bag designs (celine luggage, alexander wang cylinder satchel, proenza schouler etc.). I just can't with the boxy BV bags either or any bags that look like a hard square...  Feel like these bags are going to be out before they are in. Heavy branding on YSL bags has already cheapened their look to me. Love Cos/Madewell bags but the colour selection is boring (just black/tan). Meh! I ended up going for Jil Sander Tootie in a pale grey/green, hoping it gives me that 'sparks joy' feeling irl :D	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Bags that are actually beautiful - what are you loving?	labels:I got a Strathberry Allegro in their midi size and in the vanilla colour. I love it, the quality is fantastic. It‚Äôs versatile, a great size, really secure and wears perfectly crossbody or works on one shoulder (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2).   I think it‚Äôs a really classic style and is a bit different to other bags I‚Äôve seen.
text:I've been debating on making Strathberry Allegro midi my next bag. Keep going back and forth, between the more structured Allegro or one of the chain styles- East/West or Stylist.	labels:Size wise I can get a bottle of water, wallet, phone, keys and a small makeup case/a thin jacket in my Allegro. I think you‚Äôd be able to fit a fairly similar amount in the East/West. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd fit much more than your phone, wallet/card holder and keys in the Stylist.   I had plenty of smaller crossbody bags in a similar size to the Stylist and wanted something a bit bigger that could hold a few more things for longer days out without being a giant handbag (a size of bag I don‚Äôt currently have) and also able to be used at work, which is why I settled on the Allegro.
text:Thanks for the insights! Similarly I have a lot of smaller crossbody bags but also a few large totes so the Allegro would be a good middle bag. Good to know what the Midi fits- I keep questioning if it would be too bag or small.  I do also want a purse on a chain so trying to be more conscious and intentional on how I am acquiring my collection of purses been frustrating.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:Most of my moves have been apartment-to-apartment in the same climate (four distinct seasons with extremes in temperatures in both directions), but I still like to use the time spent packing as an opportunity to reevaluate/purge. Generally I look at fit, condition/quality, and whether or not pieces fit with my lifestyle (e.g. if you work in a formal office you might need more formal clothes and less casual ones, and the reverse is also true).  It's also a good excuse to get rid of clothes you keep out of guilt (e.g. things you don't wear often but were a gift or that you feel bad getting rid of) so you only move things you love and are excited by.   When thinking about climate, you might not need a ton of warm sweaters, but you may still want to keep things like cardigans or lightweight sweaters for air-conditioned buildings. I live somewhere with hot summers, but I still always keep an "office sweater" at my desk because people can be a little overzealous with the AC. Yes, it might be 97 degrees F outside, but when you step inside to a 68 F building, it can be a bit of a shock. Bonus points if you own a top layer that's thin enough to ball up and put in your purse. I love breezy kimono-style layers as a hot weather third piece, but jewelry/accessories also gain more importance when trying to feel put together.  In general, try to think of your clothes in categories, and if there are categories you don't think you'll wear as often, keep fewer pieces in those categories. Also think about what things you may want to keep but store (maybe in an under-the-bed box?) for rare occasions. For example, I hate shorts and almost never wear them, but I do have a couple pairs that I keep for camping trips so that I don't need to rebuy on those occasions. Will you need warm clothes for visits to family/friends in colder climates, and if so, what quanitity?	episode_done:True
text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:When I moved from a very hot climate to a super cold, snowy one I was in a weird place both financially and with my wardrobe. It was supposed to be extremely short term but ended up being long term/possibly permanent, which definitely messed with my expectations for my wardrobe.  Eventually I got rid of all my "warm weather" clothes for various reasons, mostly size/style ones, and when I was able to started to stock up on winter wear. I didn't know what I liked so I just kind of went for it. For example, I thrifted tons of scarves only to barely use them a couple years later because I realized I only like infinity scarves. The same thing happened with multiple categories because I was so desperate to fill the missing chunk of my wardrobe.  I agree with the advice to wait as long as possible before making drastic changes. Its hard to know what you'll actually end of needing, much less what you'll like or enjoy using. See what you can pick up secondhand to try out styles that suit your new climate best before investing a lot of money or time into altering your wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:Was coming here to say this as well. I recently moved from the Midwest to Florida and my body adjusted pretty quickly to the higher temps here. It‚Äôs my first winter and I find myself still wearing my warmest wool and cashmere sweaters, winter coat, and gloves. It‚Äôs all relative, so a 30F degree drop day to day is going to feel cold regardless of if you started at 90F or 60F. I would also recommend trying to wait a year if you can before purging. I think I could safely purge my snow pants if I wasn‚Äôt planning on using them when I visit my parents. It‚Äôs also hotter longer here though, so I could definitely reduce my sweaters by 20% (the ones I reach for last anyway) to make room for more hot weather clothing. Hope this helps and good luck with your move!	labels:In regards to the snow pants: I personally would definitely find a way to store stuff like that if you like to travel or visit family. I have always lived in southeastern Texas but my husband and I tend to be able to travel when it is winter up north and I *definitely* have super cold weather (for me) items I only break out when I travel. Even though they only get used once a year or less, it is worth it to have for me.	episode_done:True
text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:I live in a small space so I try to make my pieces wearable throughout the year. I always wear a cami, jeans/shorts, and ankle boots. My open knit cardigan works all year round. You really have to be realistic and ask if you‚Äôre going to wear it in the next couple of years and how you‚Äôre going to store it. I would get rid of things that you could easily replace and polyester/polyamide (because it‚Äôs not as breathable and caused me bacne).   For the third piece, consider accessories. Belts, necklaces, bracelets, scarves, bags, hats, and earrings can add interest to your outfit.	episode_done:True

Thusfar they've had some of the mildest winters in years and NOW I am moving again to England where I have been told the weather is basically the same as Seattle. I definitely second what others have said about waiting until you need something to purchase. I am also glad I kept the clothes that I could wear freely in Seattle but get weird looks for in Nebraska for traversing the UK and Europe (post covid)	episode_done:True

text:I dyed my leather boots and here is how it went.	labels:I have dyed a leatherwallet from Fossil before! Left the leather wallet in a soaked shopping bag and forgot about it. By the time I finally took it out , the soft brown leather had a big wet stains all over it which could not be fixed. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to throw it away because it‚Äôs a gift from my mom, so I decided to dye it black. It‚Äôs been 2 years since the dye job, and the dye has held up really well (might upload the current pic if enough people are interested). I‚Äôve also helped friends refresh their leather wallets/accessories/furniture using black leather dye, all with good results.  Every time I see people saying that their dye job has chipped/faded (I remember a few youtubers trying to dye their beige Chanel bagsblack), it‚Äôs likely because one of the following three reasons:   1) the new dye was not treated with a sealant.  2) the coating/sealant from original piece was not completely stripped, or had oils/waxes (from hand/leather care products) remaining on the surface preventing the dye from sticking. 3) the material is not leather, but polyurethane.  Applying sealant is absolutely crucial for longevity IMO. r/leathercraft has helped me so much!  Beautiful work OP!	episode_done:True

text:I dyed my leather boots and here is how it went.	labels:I used to work for an airline that required navy shoes as part of the uniform, but navy dress shoes are harder to come by so a lot of us would dye black shoes navy (one person would buy dye then pass it around to others). I once bought a pair of tan shoes and dyed them navy, but then scuffs would show tan! The dye I used was not as strong I suppose, or I was not stripping them adequately.	episode_done:True

I've been looking for some again as I have a handbag that I love but it needs a little tlc.	episode_done:True

text:If you‚Äôre not yet ready to commit to investing in an expensive good quality winter coat (long ones are indeed more expensive!) before you get to feel out conditions for your new climate‚Äîan intermediate solution I recommend is that you wear a light/thinner puffer & a waterproof rain coat over it. Your puffer will keep you warm (and you can wear it solo on clear days) and the raincoat will give you snow/wind protection. They will also trap heat and warm the *air* surrounding your body, which is key!  Costco base layers are also wonderful quality and super affordable (and I think you can get them delivered online). I wore them on a pre-pan trip to Iceland during NOVEMBER and I would have to like race to rip them off when we got indoors because I would begin literally sweating lol but so warm when outside!	labels:Even a fleece and a raincoat will keep you warm. Unbreathable jackets really trap in heat!	episode_done:True
text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Many years ago I moved from Hawaii to college in the Northeast. I would recommend 1) Buying it all there, because they'll have what's good for their climate and 2) starting out with cheaper options (thrifted, Old Navy, Target range) even if it's not quite your style. Don't spend much time, effort, and money until you see how you really feel after at least a year of seasons. Maybe you want warmer stuff than you thought you would, or realize you should invest in nicer socks, or discover you don't actually like turtlenecks, or shift to a different style when you're surrounded by a new area's vibe. Let yourself experience it for a bit without pressuring yourself to do it all right.

text:Yes! I love uniqlo's' merino wool sweaters for an inexpensive, nice wool sweater. They will shrink a bit though so watch out. They also have inexpensive turtlenecks if you want to try that look out.  I live in Seattle so it's not super cold here, but I still love wearing wool socks and lightweight wool sweaters.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Depending on where you move to, there may be local thrift stores in your area that carry high quality second hand coats for significantly less than full price.  I think most of my favorite winter gear has come from second hand stores, including multiple winter coats, fleece and wool layering sweaters, heavy duty winter boots, etc.   My favorite cold weather brands to keep an eye out for when I‚Äôm thrifting are: - Patagonia (jackets and fleeces) - Sorel (winter boots) - Marmot (jackets and fleeces) ... my current winter coat is a knee-length puffy Marmot - Mountain Hardware (hats and gloves) - REI (fleeces) - The North Face (jackets and fleeces)  Edit: Just because these are my preferred types of items from these brands doesn't mean that their other items aren't worth checking out as well! All of these brands produce solid cold weather gear, and if you're ever in doubt you can google a specific item to see what people are saying about it online.   Also, as u/BeeVoltage pointed out, be cautious about going second hand for your waterproof layer and try to stick to items with tags still on them or that were released recently as waterproofing does wear out over time.	labels:Second this! No such thing as bad weather, just bad clothes.   Make sure to check FABRICS when buying secondhand. Wool, Cashmere, down (not polyester fill) for sweaters, hats and overcoats, cotton, silk, or long underwear made for underclothes. You will want hats, gloves, scarves and good socks, and sturdy shoes. All can be cute and fit any aesthetic.   I moved from southern west coast Canada to interior Canada and learned that layering was my friend. Long underwear camis, cotton tights, jeans, sweaters, usually a ultra thin down with a wool coat overtop, hats, scarves, and gloves. Cover that skin!	episode_done:True

Or I wear the boots and bring the heels and change at work. You aren‚Äôt banned from wearing anything. I have an ankle length coat so I comfortably wear dresses/skirts with tights most days. I also do have a blanket, hat and extra gloves in my car just in case, but I don‚Äôt let the cold stop me from wearing anything. You just have to make the proper modifications. I grew up in one of the snowiest, coldest places my whole life  but I love fashion and just make sure I am prepared.

I often even double up socks if I‚Äôm going to be walking around a lot and my current boots are a full size larger than my normal shoe size.   Also, other people have mentioned it, but a thermal base layer is a must, especially for your lower body. I don‚Äôt use my thermal tops that much, the upper body gets your sweaters and your coat, but if the only thing standing between the elements and your legs is jeans you‚Äôre gonna be COLD.	episode_done:True

She always seemed so impressed by each individual change that I kept going. Weekly manicures, nonblack clothing (I discovered that I look great in red!), tasteful makeup. People around the office were gossiping that I was trying to find a man. "No, a man is looking for HER!", she told them.   Then suddenly she disappeared. Quit over the phone and changed her number. I like to think she was an angel in a very impressionable time for me, but I think she might have just had issues with her work visa.	labels:I can also claim an impeccably dressed Ukrainian woman as my fashion muse.

text:Is black tie comfort fashion a thing?	labels:Yes I call it formal pajamas. Brands like Johnny Was, Citron Santa Monica, and Eileen Fisher (her silk, velvet, and silk georgette). Plus the $$$ designer versions of these. A draped  band collar top in a brocade, and matching loose pants isn't quite black tie but it is formal!   For absolute black tie, I'd say maybe...Donna Karan Urban Zen + major jewelry. something like that. Like a full length avant guarde kaftan in shockingly expensive silk with shibori tie dye or something.  However perfectly fitted vintage clothing + sensitive skin likely isn't happening.   But you can translate aspects of that to your style---like for example you can get a full length ruched parachute silk skirt with granny boots and a draped lace top + a "mourning coat" for a funky "Magnolia Pearl" lagenlook formal style.	episode_done:True
text:Is black tie comfort fashion a thing?	labels:I'm not super experienced in vintage fashion, but something that is overlooked in modern fashion is the use of undergarments.

text:Ever been censored at work because of what you wear?	labels:What kids wear isn't really relevant, it's what other teachers wear. I likely wouldn't be allowed to wear a feminist shirt to my work if someone complained even though 99% of my coworkers agree. It is inherently politically - that's the point of it!   I would get them to write down explicitly how they define political. Allowing vague rules allows them to apply it unevenly as it suits them, so get them to **write** it out. Plus, once it's in writing, you have evidence to give to your union rep if they try to hassle you over something not outside of their guidelines.  When I worked at a restaurant with older customers,, I got an upper ear piercing, so I had to wear my hair in a super weird low ponytail that covered the tops of my ears because non-lobe piercings weren't allowed.   I live in a liberal area and though political speech/expression isn't allowed at work because we're government employees, solidarity with marginalized people that doesn't specify a political issue wouldn't be considered polticial. our union literally handed out buttons in solidarity with George Floyd to wear on our work lanyards, and PRIDE/ally stuff is handed our by an employee resource group. As long as it's not saying "defund the police" or "keep gay marriage legal!" or something, then that's not politicial thats at most a social issue	episode_done:True

text:To answer the justification question - cost per wear. My own NF is going on 12 years old now and still looks reasonably new, and I am not (and have not been) particularly kind with it either. I've tossed it around, dragged it on planes, beaches, through Asian wet markets etc. and it's still happily trucking along. The LV Canvas is notoriously hard-wearing.  Along the same line, quality of material used to construct the item. I currently also own leather bags from Everlane and Away. They're both well made, but you can tell the leather is substantially lower in quality, thickness and overall substance than say, my mother's Prada totes with leather that feels really thick and luxurious and plush. And with the Everlane bag, the unfinished suede interior is much rougher than the unfinished suede interiors of say, Celine bags and the leather is much, much thinner.  And while not all designer bags will age well, there is a reason Hermes bags can be handed down through generations but my Everlane bag will probably die before I do.     ETA: LV aside, the aftercare services are also generally pretty amazing. There are brands that will take your bag back and "spa" them for free or nominal fees. You don't get that kind of service with Madewell or Everlane.	labels:	episode_done:True

In more conventional times I‚Äôd also sometimes have concealer or lipstick with me for touch ups but now what I carry is pretty minimal.

If you need to have new clothes now, buy some things you are absolutely sure you like and they will fit, but dont buy too much, don't spend too much money, just in case something goes wrong.
text:This is very true. I‚Äôm just trying to figure it out ahead of time so I can save up for my future clothing purchases.  For me, my college program is extremely small (less than 16 people) and given the context of the course, they‚Äôre allowing us to go in for face-to-face instruction. I‚Äôm hoping that maybe I could exude more style during my limited time out then, but it may not be realistic given the circumstances :)	labels:Well, you can always do your research on what you want to buy, and have your list when you can go and shop!  You can still try and buy things that you know they will fit. Dresses and tops are usually fine, but I wouldn't go for pants or jeans without trying them on because my body is stupid-shaped.   Or you can shop from places you know your size, whatever works for you best.   Just don't try to change your whole wardrobe without trying things on is all I'm saying haha

That being said, you can look in your closet for what you *really* love/looks good on you and find something similarly cut but in a different pattern/colour. Look online and see what you like; this way you know exactly what you're looking for in store thus limiting your time there.
text:I have been looking at how to dress according to body type! I‚Äôve recently been indulging myself on r/Kibbe. They‚Äôve been extremely helpful in finding what flatters me. So I know what I can wear as far as body type goes and color palette (from r/coloranalysis), I guess it just narrows down to whether I can pull it off the aesthetic without looking weird.	labels:Try Zalando. The return policy is great: you pay only after you decide what you keep/return and shipping is free both ways (at least in Europe). The packages arrive quickly too.

text:How do you guys find your style if you can‚Äôt try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:I‚Äôve been going through my closet and donating/selling everything to clear space for when I can get some new stuff to go with my style changes from 20‚Äôs to 30‚Äôs. I‚Äôm teaching college now, so I really need to change my style so the students stop mistaking me for a student.   I took advantage of Zara‚Äôs big end of year sale online and got three amazing new coats that needed replacement in my wardrobe to begin with. I can risk buying tops online because the sizing is usually correct, but for pants, dresses, skirts I‚Äôll have to wait for the case count to go down. I‚Äôm in AZ, so like, they don‚Äôt really have precautions right now, but I‚Äôm limiting my going out to just selling stuff and leaving. Built up some huge store credits!  Edit: right, I‚Äôve been trolling style blogs, insta, and pinterest for months to decide on my new style.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys find your style if you can‚Äôt try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:I think you can still return clothing you buy at the store that you aren‚Äôt feeling once you try it on at home!

This might not be the case at every store, but at the stores around me they take returns no problem.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys find your style if you can‚Äôt try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:I‚Äôve been getting really into buying and selling on secondhand apps like depop and poshmark this quarantine! It takes out a lot of the cost concerns cause it‚Äôs cheaper than buying new and if I receive the item and I don‚Äôt like it, I can just sell it for the same price I bought it for. Plus I‚Äôve cleared up a bunch of closet space by selling my clothes I don‚Äôt wear anymore. Done pretty much a complete closet overhaul in the past few months for just a few hundred bucks.

text:How do you guys find your style if you can‚Äôt try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:In college, I worked at a dept store.

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:I have a shitload of skirts, plain-colored shirts, and sweaters.

The only thing I don't do that for is pants, because I don't like wearing pants that often, and dresses are their own thing and don't need to be monochromatic.	episode_done:True
text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:I keep most of my wardrobe relatively similar.  My work outfit is one of five pairs of pants, a button down, or a tee with a blazer.  My weekend uniform is athletic wear or jeans with a tank or tee in one of like five colors.  Mostly everything is black, gray, white, light blue, navy, with some camel and tomato red.  Only dresses really deviate here.    I play with shoes, makeup, and sunglasses to mix up my basic wardrobe.  And my bikini collection is relatively extensive, I have more bikinis than pairs of pants.	episode_done:True
text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:In the old days where one got dressed I had somewhat of a personal uniform:   The perfect black pant (own four of them, cheap from h&m but perfect for me) plus the same blousish top in all nice colors they sell it in (short and long sleeve) plus cardigans in all nice colors they sell it in, though mostly black ones. Some neutral blazers. Some dresses.  For fancy appointments I own the same etui dress and blazer combination in black, navy and grey.   Shoes black leather (ballerina, winter, closed shoe, pumps).   My whole wardrobe fits in one ikea pax (1 meter/3 ft). Generally it is boring bottoms and some more color for the tops. I always feel huge in colored pants.

I'm definitely a closet maximalist and I love having very varied pieces. Always have been like this too, in college people liked to joke that they've never seen me repeat an outfit.   I will say some of my stuff fits similarly. Like MOST of my pants are high waisted skinnies, but in a bunch of colors/patterns. I have like...10-12 beanies that are all different colors...  I'd say my handbags is the part of my wardrobe I change out the least. I have a black pleather mini backpack and a beige woven cross body that are my go-tos, with like 3 other bags for special occasions.	episode_done:True

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:My closet definitely has #3 vibes. I go out of my way to thrift EVERYTHING besides specific pieces I‚Äôm in need of. I have a very boho/neo-hippy style with some funky pieces. When it comes to bottoms, I like to be consistent with skinny jeans, mom cut jeans, and harem pants. Then, I usually style a patterned shirt or t shirt with basic pants. If I have some funky pants, I‚Äôll throw on a mono colored shirt. For shoes, I almost always wear docs (I have a black 1460 8-eye pair & a brown 1460 pascal leather pair) or vans (my 20 year-old spirit is shining through lol).	episode_done:True

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:I have evolved some classics I keep- I admit I dress a bit like a children's book illustration character from the first half of the last century meets femdom faerie sex witch- so it's a lot of simple collared blouse under unornemented cashmere sweaters, black opaque tights, solid saturated colours largely in jewel tones, positively ridiculous big hair bows and then flip flop into corsets and strapy, or lacey things.    I go through periods of realizing a 34 year old wearing thigh highs with maryjanes is confusing and periods of comforting myself that the lesbian in clarks and stripey socks look makes me happy and as an elder-millenenial I am basically a generation adrift.    Probably the hardest part is realizing I don't have to buy new clothing. Like, I have enough of most things and it doesn't wear out fast enough to justify replacing it, nor does it really no longer spark joy.    I have stuff that fits from college that still has *years* of wear left. Unless I gain another 20lbs more than my natural yoyo, or suddenly take up a physical job, basically only socks, shoes and underwear will need updates from just material failure.	episode_done:True
text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:The majority of my closet follows the capsule wardrobe mentality. Colours are black, white, tan, navy & stripes. Mix of tops and bottoms that generally work well with each other for mixing it up.  I live in a hot climate as well so am slowing swapping all my fast fashion over to linen clothes as they fall apart.  My only exception to this capsule wardrobe are my bohemian, flowy, colourful print dresses (brand is Jaase if anyone wants to know) that are great for the beach, pool or hot weather. No need to pair these with anything as they are dresses. But outside of this, I stick to my standard capsule wardrobe :)	episode_done:True

text:That‚Äôs a really good point, but could you elaborate on what makes a dress appropriate for certain seasons, other than temperature considerations?

text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:I literally just spent a lot of time picking a ‚Äúwedding guest‚Äù dress and one thing I tried to take into consideration was the fact that I don‚Äôt go to a lot of weddings, so I tried to nab something that will fit me through weight fluctuation since I plan to rewear it to weddings in the future.

text:Agree with you on buying for weight fluctuations--the dresses that have lasted me through the years tend to either tie at the waist or are designed to be looser in the waist area. In my 20s I definitely gravitated toward more form fitting dresses and while I don't regret buying those at all, they are long gone... however if I found a sleeker fitting piece today for the right price and the right specific event, I probably wouldn't pass it up. But for future events TBD I definitely play it safe.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:That‚Äôs a really good point, but could you elaborate on what makes a dress appropriate for certain seasons, other than temperature considerations? I wear jeans and t-shirts all year long, so I‚Äôm very ignorant in this whole area.	labels:To me, a winter dress either has long sleeves or is worn with a blazer/jacket to cover up short sleeves. Winter dresses are either long (past the knee) or if it is short, is worn with dark colored stockings/nylons/leggings. Winter dresses are typically darker colors- blacks, browns, dark green, navy, burgundy, etc.  A summer dress is usually lighter in fabric and lighter in color- whites, yellows, periwinkle, taupe, etc. A summer dress can be long- but if it‚Äôs long than the top should be short sleeved or tank top/halter etc so you don‚Äôt overheat.	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:Not white, not red and depending on area, not black. White and red are the bride's colors (culturally dependent). If the bride wears white, red can be considered attention grabbing. If the bride wears red, her culture probably views white as a mourning color. Black can be seen as an objection to the wedding and mourning - very regional.   Something conservative enough for church weddings. Knee length, covers shoulders? Shoulder covering can be fixed with a cardigan.   Something light for a hot outdoor wedding.   In my area, most weddings are cocktail or semi formal aka short dresses are fine. Formal would imply floor length gown, so if the store has a good one, that you like, and you think someone seems more likely to go full formal, that might be a good call.   If you have seasons, then one for each season. Think about the weather in your general area. How cold or hot does it get?
text:> not red  Christ, yes. One of my old college buddies who I haven't been close to in like a decade wore a bright red dress to my wedding. The photographer took a million photos of her, to the exclusion of older family members I'd have rather had photos of. Part of that's on the photographer, of course, but it wouldn't have happened if she hadn't worn BRIGHT RED.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:One short cocktail length and one long if you feel like it. I personally wear fancy cocktail dresses no matter how fancy the wedding  I like black and navy bc you can rewear a ton. Color is great too. Just go for classic cuts.	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:Personally I try to avoid maxi dresses. I just feel that because the wedding party is often wearing floor length dresses I don't want to look like I'm trying to be part of the wedding party when I'm not. For this reason I also don't wear whatever the wedding colors are. So I would try to get a few different colors of dresses so that way you can try to avoid looking like you're trying to be part of the wedding party.  Also don't get too short or revealing, you don't want to look like you're trying to take away from the bride's attention. Also don't wear white for this reason.	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:I would get:  - a knee length/mid-calf black, brown, grey, or navy dress (good for anything and you can pair with colourful accessories for a wedding if you want)  - a flowy maxi dress (good for outdoor weddings in hot weather)  - a fun one that is still appropriate.   Avoid:  - excessive cleavage  - tacky rhinestones  - white dresses and anything close to white.  - completely red dresses   - black dresses can be a bit somber but I think can work if accessorized properly. Try to make sure it isn't too funeral-looking.   Things to keep in mind:  - at least one dress that covers your shoulders might be a good idea for any more traditional/conservative weddings.  - keep the length classy  - look for timeless styles, dresses you can wear in almost any decade and look good. Your fun one you can have fun with and have it be a trend that might not work 5 years from now.  - don't buy a dress you don't have the undergarments for/don't plan on buying undergarments for. Eg. Do you have massive boobs, and can't wear strapless bras? Don't get a strapless dress.

text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:I'd get something dark that would work with a coat for cold weather (if you have cold weather there) and a spring/summer dress.

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:This may not be everyone's cup of tea but I love wearing oversized long sweaters or sweater dresses with sheer tights and then thigh highs over that. I'll usually wear this with combat boots or some type of heeled boot as ankle booties don't look great on me. You can also wear this with a skirt/shorts and a sweater and then a coat on top. Add a hat, scarf, gloves as needed.  This combo worked great for me in the fall when I lived in Canada.	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I agree with you about black tights looking weird with certain outfits...my answer is that I specifically buy my winter skirts/dresses to look good with black tights lol. If it doesn't, then it's just not gonna be worn in the fall/winter, it's too cold where I live for bare legs and I have never really found other colors/patterns of tights that I like the look of. Plus it means that everything also matches with black boots so it just makes things easy.  Also I just want to shout the praises of fleece lined tights from the rooftop. Those and loose fitting dress=ultimate comfort, but looks like you tried. I agree with the other commenter who suggested sizing up in tights, they never fit right when I got my true size, now that I size up I don't feel like I'm constantly adjusting them throughout the day anymore.	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I also hate pants for the same reasons as you. But I also live in a Nordic country which is hella cold.   I just wear thights that are made of comfortable quality fabrics (sometimes cotton/wool blends) and I buy at LEAST one size bigger than my actual size, with wide waistbands. I want comfort above all, and for me this works.  Also if I only had to deal with cold weathers in the morning, frankly I would just put the thights on in the morning and then take them off later and put them in my bag.	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I live in the freezing north and I still wear skirts in the winter. Because I'm insane and like to look like I'm from the 1890s. (I wear fleece or thick cotton tights with long wool skirts.)  My personal thought is that the height of the shoes doesn't matter if it's wet out. I will just wear snow boots or rain boots if those are called for, and fuck the aesthetic.   If it's just dry but cold, my personal rule of thumb:  * Higher skirt = higher shaft, longer skirt = lower shaft. Basically, ankle boots with ankle-length skirts, knee-high boots or thigh-high boots with miniskirts. * I include a contrasting-color knee sock as "the shaft," so a knee-high boot with a miniskirt is equivalent to an ankle boot plus knee-high socks with a miniskirt. * I sometimes layer tights with knee socks/thigh-highs or just wear the socks alone, and if the socks are calling attention to themselves (either by color or pattern), I wear them with ankle boots to show off the socks.	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I do not like black opaque tights very often. I love a patterned sheer-ish tight - with polka dots or some other thing. A loose enough pattern that hints at your skin below.. I have also had grey sheer pattern tights and other shades, but I a dark skinned black woman, so I have some different color constraints. I generally prefer darker tights over paler ones since I am darker.   As for ankle boot height? I prefer right around the ankle, or even something that has more of a profile of a shoe. I am not a big sock wearer, but if I do want ones to be visible, the need to be an interesting pair,   I'd pick colors that mimic your skin tone or pickup a shade in the dress/skirt you are wearing. I also do not love big contrast between the sock and the tight. But it depends, if the tight matches the dress/skirt - then contrast in the shoe is fine. But otherwise I like the shoe and tight to be closer together.	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:What length skirts do you gravitate toward?  Most of my skirts/dresses are mini or midi length, so I usually wear ankle boots or knee high boots.  I like my ankle boots to hit at the thinnest part of my ankle (right above the bone) and my knee high boots just below my knees.    I‚Äôm not a huge fan of mid calf, because that cuts off my leg in an awkward place and I don‚Äôt have enough leg to be doing that. (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù.)  My choice of boot depends on  1) how cold it will be 2) how long I‚Äôll be in the cold 3) my coat  For example, if I‚Äôm going for a girls night (pre covid) I might decide to wear a mini with ankle boots, but have a longer coat that I can keep me warm if we‚Äôre moving around.  If I‚Äôm going to the farmers market, I might decide to wear a midi dress with knee high boots and a wool coat, so I can take my time.  I‚Äôm a big fan of knee high boots with midi dresses and long coats. The overlap really keeps out the cold. It‚Äôs definitely a 70s kind of vibe which isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs cup of tea. but maybe people will come around because Nicole Kidman rocked this vibe in the undoing...	episode_done:True

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I see people wear black tights with light colored or even spring dresses and I can‚Äôt stand it! Black tights don‚Äôt go with everything! Personally, in winter it‚Äôs all about fabrics. Heavy fabrics will look better with your boots and tights. I have a pair of black suede thigh high boots that keep my legs warm and go with pretty much everything in my closet. If I think black is too harsh, I have brown heeled booties that I wear with various patterned nude tights. Also sweater dresses are amazing because you can wear them with actual leggings and any boot! I also have a coat that‚Äôs nearly floor length to keep my legs warm if need be.	episode_done:True

But now, I am in hatelove with a gigantic chunky green sweater from Target that cost me all of $22, but I wash and dry it as if it were some high end boutique item from a Brooklyn designer. Gentle cycle, cold water. Fluff. Hang dry. And then I wear it again for 3 days in a row without makeup because I can't even begin to relate to my stylish clothes. They seem like old friends I've lost touch with and I forget what we have in common.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I got two black pairs of Uggs a couple Christmases ago. One pair is the classic length and one is the shorter ankle length. Both incredibly comfy and versatile with my mostly black wardrobe. I went through a phase last winter where didn't wear them because I read this article that basically shit on adults who wore Uggs. My parents spent a good deal of money to get me them and I asked for them, and let a random bitter writer shame me out of wearing them. This year of the pandemic has brought about a new side of my personality that's just like "fuck you, life is too short and fragile to not wear what I want and be cozy AF" and I do not regret it.

text:Jewelry trends for 2021	labels:I feel like delicate, minimalist jewelry in general is here to stay for a while longer among the general populous (I personally think minimalist gold jewelry is timeless). It's easy to maintain and it goes with any outfit; can be a day and night piece.  Might just be me, but I feel that high fashion is always trying to promote the big, bold, statement jewelry, which is fine! The way you describe your style mixed with the beautiful pieces you like, it sounds like it fits you to a T. Just not sure if it is trending that direction though. But I think that you should shrug off today's "standards" and wear what makes you feel happy and confident!

text:It‚Äôs also literally timeless if you are buying 14k/18k jewelry - it will last for years with the right care!

I do think there will be some post-recession/depression like trends that will start emerge in 2021, but only to one or two items in an outfit. Like for some, it may be adding fun, costume jewelry and for others it might be reflected in flouncier dresses or statement bags, etc. It‚Äôs tough to predict and may not happen until after the vaccine reaches the majority, but I‚Äôm here to see it!	labels:Be careful about certain pieces, though.

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn‚Äôt get boring?	labels:I've found that actually cutting down on the number of clothes that I have (selling what I can, donating the rest), has actually helped me be more thoughtful and creative about what I do have, rather than being overwhelmed by the sheer number and defaulting to basics.  Stylebook is great at well - building looks, having the app randomly create outfits for you, but also saving inspiration photos. Sometimes I see people on IG and think "wow that outfit is so great!" and when I really look at it closer, I realize that I'll have similar items in my closet already, but I didn't think to combine them in that way. So I save those photos in the Stylebook app as a reminder of how I can shake up my basics. If you do choose to use the app, you'll see what you actually wear and may feel a bit more justified in letting go of pieces you don't reach for that are sunk costs & taking up space.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn‚Äôt get boring?	labels:I play in my closet a lot. Just take a Saturday and try on different combinations.

I follow style that's like mine and then of course where I aspire to be or just that I find interesting and different.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn‚Äôt get boring?	labels:I have a similar style and I like adding 1-2 accessories to a basic outfit. My favorite is scarves! Not only can they be cute and lightweight, they can also be cute and big and cozy, like you‚Äôre wearing a blanket all day but it‚Äôs socially acceptable. Other accessories could be a pair of statement earrings, or a chunky belt, or a long necklace. Sometimes I just try different hair styles to feel like I‚Äôm doing something different.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn‚Äôt get boring?	labels:Okay I am totally in the same spot as you. So tired of wearing grey, I want to rid my closet of the colour. The best solution and not to rid your whole closet is to buy colourful accessories or go to a consignment store and buy statement pieces to wear with your basic wardrobe that would be at discounted prices compared to online retail like Free People and Anthropologie  (I recommend not going to thrift stores because that's more basics typically). I also have a rule that if a t-shirt or any article of clothing hasn't been worn in the last 6 months its time to donate it, that's at least 2 seasons of wearing it not being utilized. As for up-cycling your own old clothes you can buy fun iron on patches that can be added on plain hoodies or t-shirts for a pop of colour much like the brands Comme de Garcons and Scotch and Soda.  You can also embroider shirt collars, or the pockets of jeans.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn‚Äôt get boring?	labels:Echoing a few suggestions here re: accessories and shoes with some examples I‚Äôve done this fall/winter.  My standard fall/winter wardrobe is also a sweater, jeans and ankle boots. Some variations I‚Äôve tried:  I saw Pinterest inspo of statement red socks with Oxfords and I usually only wear oxfords in spring/summer because it feels too cold in fall winter. I bought a pair of red/burgundy cashmere socks from j crew and wore those today with my black oxfords, black jeans and white sweater with black stripes.  Wearing ‚Äúdressy‚Äù sneakers. I bought some MOMA vans, I have a out of burgundy suede and tweed new balance sneakers I wear to work and I want to get a basic black pair of adidas shoes. Similar goes for slip on sneakers, I have a pair of Kate spade leopard print Keds and a red leather pair of Olukais with a pretty floral design.  I have an amazing blanket scarf and even wearing a very thin black sweater or long sleeve t shirt with the blanket scarf I always get compliments even though that‚Äôs my comfy outfit. It‚Äôs not a chunky sweater but it‚Äôs still warm.  When I want to look a bit dressier I really do love wearing sweater dresses or just thicker regular dresses and tights/leggings with ankle boots as well. For slightly thinner dresses throwing a long cardigan over top.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn‚Äôt get boring?	labels:I am a very ordinary person so take this with a grain of salt. What I would do is a commitment to wear sth "new" every day. It's just not how you put it on and look at the mirror, but it also has to do with how you feel in it all day long.   Sometimes it's gonna work, sometimes it won't but you can have fun with your wardrobe everyday and hopefully you will find what goes well with what you have inside that huge wardrobe.   You are young so you can be daring.  You will be surprised.  Good luck and happy trying :)	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn‚Äôt get boring?	labels:Shoes and other accessories can be much cheaper to own and can completely change the vibe of an outfit. A different pair of shoes alone can take basically the same outfit from grandpa-core to vintage feminine to streetwear. For example I have pretty basic black cotton blend dress that I can wear with platform sneakers for a streetwear look, with flats or booties with pearl or diamond earrings for a "classy casual extra feminine" daytime look, and thigh high boots and berry lipstick for a "baddie" look on a night out.  Jewelry, makeup, and shoes are just fun easy ways to play with being someone else for a day without own multiple different sets of actual clothing. In my experience costume jewelry and second-hand or outlet retail shoes (like from places like TJ Maxx, Ross, Burlington, etc.) hold up much better for the lower prices than fast fashion fabrics do. So I like to get quality clothing and basic accessories, but then have cheaper more "out there" accessories/stuff for variety and experimental/trendy moments.  That ends up being way cheaper and more sustainable than buying a new top or skirt that will fall apart or be out of style in a year every time I want to feel different for a little bit. A change in hair and makeup is even cheaper and more sustainable because often you can use the same products, but just with different techniques/styles.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn‚Äôt get boring?	labels:Here is what I recommend:  1. Spend time in your closet regularly creating outfits. Most people know how to dress themselves, know what they like, etc. but they do not put the work/time into working with their wardrobe, or they do not do it enough. Set aside a time every few months to do it, even if it is just a mental effort of thinking out ideas and writing them down. 2. Constantly experiment. Wardrobe items turn into outfits and looks when there are elements and aspects to the look -- layering items, color combinations, mixing prints, etc. If your style tends to be neutral/basic, then this can be achieved with elements to the items like different necklines, trim and details, etc. 3. Try to create at least 3 outfits or more with each item you have. Make it a practice including when you are considering making a purchase -- i.e, what three outfits can I make if I buy this? 4. It is good to look for inspiration, but if you don't take time to make looks, it will not be useful and effective. 5. Understand your default/go-to looks and items and work them differently. Next time you french tuck the sweater with the jeans and boots, maybe try cuffing the jeans, or layering the sweater with something, or doing something unexpected with the look. This will broaden the use of your wardrobe items.  It can be helpful to have someone else you know come into your closet and show you how they'd work your wardrobe items. You could post photos of items here and ask people, "how would you wear this?" that could spark some new ideas as well.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn‚Äôt get boring?	labels:I catalogued all my clothes in an app and track what I wear. If I want to wear something different\~\~\~ then I look at the category of "unworn" clothing and pick something to make an outfit with. It's really helped me make sure I wear as much of my clothes as possible (obviously the black cocktail dress is going to see less use than the everyday pink sweater but it helps with more unique items like my t shirt with applique parrots lol). If you don't want to catalogue your clothes and put this much effort into it (lol) you could just move your clothes to another part of your closet after you wear them or reverse the orientation of the hangers after wearing. Try to move as much of your clothes to the "worn" side of your closet as possible. And when you pick a lesser worn item don't give up and just make an outfit of it! Who cares if it doesn't match perfectly, you'll do it better next time!	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:I think that how you want to be perceived is representative of who you are. This is something I've battled with over the years, not just in terms of clothes, but behavior, etc. We try to act better than we think we are, we try to dress based on how our ideal "me" would dress. At times it might feel fake, like you are pretending, but the truth is that us striving to improve ourselves (based on what we define as "improvement") is one of the biggest indicators of who we are.  Obviously in a way, our taste in clothes will be dictated by people around us, but that's true for everything in life.  At the end of the day, if what you are wearing makes you feel good, then that is your sense of style. If it ever changes, that is because of changes to who you are. We are not static, we grow and change based on our environment and internal growth, and all of those are great :)
text:This is so inspiring! I‚Äôve always been sort of hesitant about wearing certain clothes and styles (eg. Boho, chic/sexy) even if I really like them, because I feel fake just like you mentioned, almost like I don‚Äôt deserve to dress like that because my personality doesn‚Äôt necessarily match the type of personality I associate with those styles.   But what you said about improving ourselves and how that relates to fashion is such an uplifting outlook. especially since I‚Äôm working on growing as a person and what to adopt more traits that I associate with the styles that I admire like confidence and a more laidback/spontaneous outlook.   Thank you so much for this amazing advice. I‚Äôm excited to carry this attitude with me into the new year.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:One thing you could do in search of your "real tastes" is to make a Pinterest board (or equivalent) of pictures you find beautiful and evocative - pictures that do NOT include clothing. If you think about style in terms of anything else - home decor, for instance - don't include that either. Think pictures of landscapes, animals, buildings, even abstract art. It sounds crazy but it really works - patterns will emerge. For instance, my board includes things like white billowy curtains, pink clouds, sea glass, foggy beach pictures. There's a general mood that I can't really describe or quantify through more defined "style groups" like goth, boho, romantic, etc. It's just what I find beautiful.   From there, find parallels to clothing. White billowy curtains -> white billowy blouses. Pink clouds -> pink fluffy sweaters. Sea glass -> sea glass jewelry! Foggy beach pictures -> muted colors, soft textures. If you are more artistic you might not even want to create clear-cut parallels but would prefer to think in "moods," whether a certain piece of clothing evokes the same mood as your board. That works too.  I get that how you want to be perceived is part of you too, but I still think it's useful to understand your more fundamental aesthetic preferences. Personally, I feel like after spending awhile in the world of style bloggers, youtubers, etc. it's easy to appreciate a huge variety of styles or to like certain things only because of exposure. It makes it hard to hone down what exactly you want from your own look. For ME, moving outside the world of clothing seems to do the trick.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:I don‚Äôt think you can be 100% original (Did you sew your own clothes? Create the patterns? Dye the yarn?), so I‚Äôd just ask myself if I like what I‚Äôm wearing, and if others disliking it bothers me.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:Both go hand in hand, and usually the confidence that comes with those fashion choices will end up building up to a style you may finally feel your own; although I think everything is influenced by something else, so just enjoy dressing up to whatever you feel suits you and your mood!	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:I've always wondered this myself. Early on in my career I used clothes to signal maturity. I'm 100% WFH now and I've suddenly realized that I really do like dressing up and I do dress for myself.  That means 4 days I week I'm edgier and bolder than before -- I have a much bigger range than I thought. I've always worn a ton of dresses and skirts -- still do but it so many different silhouettes and patterns. The other 3 days I am in black leggings and a comfy sweater.  However, I think when I return to the office I'll still dress for the job I want, but after work change back into my Doc Martins.	episode_done:True

text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:In art school, we learned about finding out own aesthetic. Finding it involved copying others' work for a while (never for profit, btw). We learned how to develop our own hand in this process, what worked for us and what didn't. In turn, our aesthetics became really a combination of several other artists.   I think fashion and style is the same. There's influences of who we follow, but the more we try and experiment, determining what works for us and what doesn't, is when our unique style will emerge - and it'll still even then be a combination of several other styles. Experiment, figure out what's important to you in your own style. It takes time and intention.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:I know that social media can subconsciously influence the way we perceive ourselves and the world around us. Perhaps try taking a little break/limit time from exposure to social media? It might change the way you dress. Also, I find that educating myself about the world of fashion has really opened my eyes to all the possible things that one can wear, so maybe try reading up on some fashion history/watching educational videos to hopefully gain a deeper appreciation for garments? But honestly, the "real you" should be the you that you feel most comfortable and happiest in. Good luck!	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:For a while I struggled with this as well. But then I realized that If you see something that someone else is wearing or is admiring someone‚Äôs style, in a way that really is your style too. If you like it on you, you can wear in and have it be a part of you. IMO it doesn‚Äôt matter if your style differs from day to day. One time I saw someone with a super cool black outfit on the street and straight up copied it from what I had home, and I loved to wear it! Next day I wore something flowery inspired from a fashion commercial! Felt great in that too.   Clothes can be very fun if you let them! Best of luck.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:There's that saying that "you don't know what you don't know", right? I couldn't conjure up a completely original and personal style out of thin air without pulling up inspiration and learning about all kinds of different styles and clothes and fabrics and aesthetics et cetera et cetera. My style is just a big mix of all kinds of trends from the last five years, but it's personal to me because I curated it.  I like to think of personal style as an iterative process similar to design, you build on top of what's already there, see what works, what doesn't, remove unnecessary things until there's nothing left to take away. What remains is just right. The one thing to realise is that it's not something that happens overnight, most people who have a really strong sense of personal style have been doing it for years or decades.	episode_done:True

Every time I clean out my closet, I find hidden treasures, but I also discover how much of it I really hate, or how much of it seems tired to me and sort of depressing.

Stuff you'd move furniture or do spring cleaning in. Sometimes I look at these clothes and decide that I missed this or that, but most of the time, it gets cycled out after a while and donated somewhere.   I live in a very small apartment, though, and I dislike the extra work that comes with too much clutter. A lot of people like to hold onto their clothes, because trends cycle so quickly and unexpectedly

text:Shopping my own closet for the perfect tee	labels:Glad to know I'm not the only one who still owns that grey Americana Danger Days tee!

I keep my graphic/memorabilia tees and my "nice" tees very separate, though; they're even stored in separate places in my closet because they fill such different functions for me. I'm not sure if I would take such a conscientious look at my t-shirt collection as you have here because  I mostly regard tees as either pajamas (graphic) or more akin to underwear (layering) than anything else. They're just functional - not something I love or cherish or feel the draw to be more intentionally mindful about. I just Respect the Stack.
text:Yessss! Shirt twins!  Tbh most of my tees are pajamas or layering tees as well (under hoodies/sweaters).

text:Fashion "fantasies" coming true years later?	labels:A little bit different, but I remember as a kid being like "man, wish I had the confidence to wear belly shirts, they look so cool" or whatever we called them back in the 00s, and now that they're being styled with high waisted pants and skirts it's like, the best of both worlds, in that I don't have to have my full stomach out and it's way cuter this way anyways. AND the nigh waisted/crop solved the issue I had with clothes and my wide hips: low-rise pants would slide down and shirts would always ride up unless they were loose enough, so I would have to CONSTANTLY adjust.  And on the reverse note, any shirt I have that isn't cropped gets tucked in, which is funny considering how ridiculous it always seemed to me to tuck in shirts back then too.	episode_done:True

text:Fashion "fantasies" coming true years later?	labels:Male here (kind of important for this story).  Growing up I was always really jealous of female fashion, makeup and the ability to express yourself in your clothing (and it not coming down purely to details or fabric). I dabbled in the japanese rock scene back in HS, partly because I really liked the music, partly because it opened up a lot of opportunities for exploration. I didn't have the guts to go all the way though, but did some light makeup and had sort-of feminine haircuts.  Anyway, past HS this was all behind me, except in my art where I kept my aesthetic alive, though never consciously setting out to do so. I've since moved the canvas onto myself, so haven't picked up the pen much at all lately.   Fast forward 10 years or so, and I'm standing at a graduation ceremony. I work as a teacher, and I'm saying goodbye to my students, since summer break is about to come up. All teachers are lined up, and I look at my female colleagues and feel a real sting of jealousy. I'm standing there dressed in a shirt and pants while they're wearing lovely dresses, with earrings, makeup and bags.  I decided enough was enough, and went and bought nail polish the same day, and booked a time to pierce both my ears the day after. This all coincided with a long solo trip to Japan, where I bought a ton of makeup and really started to let lose. I also started (slowly) incorporating female cuts and items into my wardrobe, but every step needed quite a bit of courage, heck they still do. My comfort zone has blown wide open but anything beyond what I wear regularly gives some slight anxiety.  Then in 2020 I started posting here, getting feedback and help, and through constant cheering from colleagues, friends and students I finally feel like anxiety isn't keeping me away from expressing myself the way I want.  &#x200B;  So yeah, kind of a tangent, but that's my fashion fantasy coming true.

If I do make purchases I want to think about them long and hard, and really justify why I need them. I also want the item to be perfect if I‚Äôm going to buy it - I have a bad habit of buying things that are ¬´¬†good enough¬†¬ª in the pursuit of what I really want and that‚Äôs definitely contributed to my overflowing wardrobe.

Makeup, clothing (including bras, underwear, and socks), accessories, shoes (can replace only worn out athletic shoes), tech including headphones/charging cables (can replace my laptop or phone should they die), books, craft supplies (unless I get a custom Etsy order and need something for it), stationary/office supplies (I can only buy a 2022 planner).

text:What are your 2021 Fashion / Style Goals?	labels:2021 I'm making an effort.   I can be a middle aged mom, and not be frumpy.   2020 I started out fine, but working from home and covid I sort of gave up. I stopped doing my hair, and stopped putting on makeup.  I stopped exercising (yoga pants and hoodies are so forgiving. Not to mention sports bras and cotton undies rather than sexy lingerie that made me stand up a little bit straighter and smile that secret smile to myself. )  I can be chubbier than I'd like right now, and still have nice style that makes me feel sexy and attractive and good about how I present myself.  I can wear cute shoes and accessorize again, even if I have a mask that covers my smile.   I can also take care of myself and enjoy exercise and healthy foods, and get to a place where I feel better about my body in a swimsuit.

text:What are your 2021 Fashion / Style Goals?	labels:My style goals for 2021:  1. Be more creative with my style. I want to wear my more funky and unique pieces more often, and to make some of my pieces more personal by embroidering them with cool designs.   2. Shop my closet. I probably have about 60 pieces all together including accessories (I know this from my Stylebook app) and I‚Äôve realized that I can combine them in all sorts of new ways to create many different kinds of outfits.   2. Take videos of my crafted outfits. This has helped me a lot in seeing what is working on me and what needs a few tweaks. For example, I took a video of myself wearing a tucked in fitted turtleneck with high-waisted jeans and a belt. I felt it looked very nice in the mirror, but for some reason, it looked off in the video. I quickly realized that due to my height, my high-rise jeans weren‚Äôt hitting me at my natural waist, but were instead fitting closer to a mid rise. After noticing this, I experimented around with what I had, and settled on adding a unique 80‚Äôs jacket which made it look a lot more styled and proportionate.	episode_done:True

You can probably still buy them from LL Bean, like my Dad used to.  I'm enjoying the mixture of traditionally somewhat formal pieces mixed with the casual here,  ie tweed jacket with a hoodie.  Hadn't heard of Margaret Howell before.  She's definitely the queen of balancing the top piece with the bottom piece in unconventional ways. And her footwear styling really makes the whole look.

Sometimes I needed a size M, sometimes I needed a size XL.

My younger self's style was not office appropriate at all. I was into short sundresses and plunging necklines. My big "ah-hah" moment was realizing that I can have two styles. At work, I'm a walking advertisement for J.Crew and I feel so confident. Outside of work, I'm in a short dress and high heels. The trick for me was realizing that my body can pull off different silhouettes depending on the style. I enjoy form fitting outfits in my office wardrobe. Conversely, I enjoy flowy outfits in my non-office wardrobe.

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Lifestyle and body changes will take place and impact your wardrobe and style needs a few times over the course of your life, and 20s is sort of when most navigate this for the first time. The most important thing to determine is what if anything in your current wardrobe can work for you now, including your work looks, and what look you want to have with your style for work. This should fit into your industry and be appropriate, but it can still be 'you' (your vibe, etc.), it just takes some thought and planning. Clothing is 100% the wrapper so to speak we all wrap around ourselves, and can reflect who we are, where we are at in our lives, how we feel about ourselves, and alot of other aspects about yourselves. Aim to tie it as closely to you, and what your life needs are. That is how it has been effective for me here. If you want to share some workplace appropriate looks you like, we can help further!	episode_done:True
text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Had something similar happen, and let me just say - the first step is to find two or three good pants that you feel good in. For me, it was to leave behind shops like forever21 or New Look, and I started shopping at shops like Torrid. I know some people hate torrid, and some of their clothes are cheesey. But let me just say - they do the BEST jeans. I have bought them in size 10, 12, 14, and 16, and they fit and grow with me as my body changed and fluctuated, and then when I lost some weight, the smaller pairs still fit.      Just remember, you have to ignore the size on the rack, and instead go based on what feels good. Good, buttery jeans that make your butt look rocking are a huge confidence booster for me. Tops that hid the ladies which grew sort of uncontrollable after changing the pill also helped. Structured blazers with t-shirts and dark jeans = perfect office look for any size. Statement necklace or simple earrings always a bonus. However you are, as you said, you deserve clothes that fit, so get em, girl!	episode_done:True
text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Not really answering the question, but my issue has been the opposite. I'm about 10lbs lighter now than I was in high school, and I've stayed short and tiny my whole life. I basically kept my high school wardrobe all through college, then packed it with me when my husband and I got married and I moved. I didn't see the issue and thought it was ludicrous to get rid of an entire closet of clothes that were still intact and fit me well, until I started getting more serious about my career as a professor and realized my "professional teaching clothes" still read as "student attending an award ceremony."  Starting over the summer, I began weeding through my closet and donating anything that didn't make me happy or I couldn't imagine myself wearing in front of a classroom of college students or colleagues (except for my loungewear and workout clothes.) I felt A LOT of guilt at first, because I realized how many pieces I held onto for the nostalgia or just because they fit. I had to invite one of my closest friends over to help me make the tough decisions and she didn't let me talk myself into keeping a piece I initially put in the donate pile. That really helped my perspective, and now I can make more objective decisions without needing a cheerleader.   Once I got rid of about half of my closet (spring/summer and fall/winter wardrobe combined,) I gave myself permission to buy a few higher-end pieces that are much more my style but also fit both my daily life and professional needs. Neutral colors and versatile silhouettes. I feel so much less stress and guilt when I open my closet now, it really feels like I've moved into a new chapter of myself. It's my dream to have a 10-15 piece capsule closet, but one step at a time.  I'm so sorry I just went on a big tangent. It's been an enlightening quarantine for me obviously lol.	episode_done:True

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Me!! I am currently working through this - I actually created this new account specifically for FFA so I can feel more comfortable sharing outfits. 3 years ago I left a creative job to become a stay at home mom, and since then I had another baby and have been all over the place size-wise. Pre-kids I had a very defined personal style and was really connected to my local arts community and my wardrobe reflected that.   Now I‚Äôm kind of in a lost place (after two bouts of post-parting depression, the last one clearing up right as the pandemic started) and I have no idea how to integrate my personal style into my ‚Äúnew‚Äù lifestyle.   Currently I‚Äôm working on uploading my entire wardrobe to StyleBook, to hopefully track what I‚Äôm wearing every day to find trends so that I can clear out things I don‚Äôt wear or that don‚Äôt fit. I‚Äôve also started browsing Pinterest and Instagram a lot more to encourage myself to wear things other than sweats every day. Even though I‚Äôm at home with two toddlers all the time, I think I feel better about myself when I put on real clothes that fit and make me feel happy!   I have a long way to go but you‚Äôre not alone!	episode_done:True
text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:I can't speak on the weight gain thing other than I'm sure you still look lovely and I hope you still feel beautiful right now as well. Weight gain is nothing to be ashamed of, but I commend you for trying to be healthier - that shit isn't easy!!  As for the "wanting to look professional but wanting to look / feel like myself", I think a LOT of people struggle with this. I feel like for the emo look, wearing all black can still be seen as very professional, I think the issue more would be the cuts of the clothes. It also depends on your profession / workplace - obviously some places are much more lenient and you can get away with a lot more skin. Maybe wearing jewelry that is more alternative can also be a good way to look professional but feel like yourself.	episode_done:True
text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Are you me?!  Clothing is 100% the way I manage to feel even remotely confident in my body. I have by no means actually figured this out ‚Äì especially since I gained weight during the pandemic AND had abdominal surgery (no more crop tops for now since I don‚Äôt care to explain the marks) this year ‚Äì but these are my tips:  1) Get rid of stuff that doesn‚Äôt fit you. I‚Äôm not sure if what you‚Äôre describing with weight stabilizing in a stable relationship is eating-disordered behavior, but in my similar situation, it absolutely was. I am pretty triggered by things that don‚Äôt fit, especially across the bust, which leads to my next point...  2) Bra fitting changes everything. I love how you note your old style was ‚Äúlots of boobs‚Äù because mine was too, but kind of by accident because I had ill-fitting bras, and, by transition, clothes. I cannot recommend r/abrathatfits enough because whether ‚Äúlots of boobs‚Äù is still you or you want to transition from it, a well-fitted bra makes everything look more professional and makes everyone look incredible...and feel incredible, too!  3) Tailor to your favorite parts of you. So, I took this really radically and now make my clothes. But that‚Äôs not an option for everyone. What is, however, more of an option, is taking things in at the waist, getting things hemmed, and putting in darts (triangle folds) to better fit curves. Depending on where you live, these ‚Äúoperations‚Äù can cost like $9-20 only and make the biggest difference. I have stubby legs, a ridiculously short waist, and bras that work as hats, but in my clothes that actually fit me, you don‚Äôt see those traits so much as the total look...and I like that look! I think tailoring is the best way to make clothes work FOR you, not you have to work around the clothes.  I hope that helps!!	episode_done:True
text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:I had an accident earlier this year and now have a slow-healing wound on my knee that won‚Äôt close up. I have to wear a dressing on it, so tight jeans are a no-go. I got into the habit of dressing down every day, at first because of the pain, which was unpleasant for the first few weeks, and then because I felt down about the injury (and Covid-life in general).  It was a bit of a revelation when I realised some of the more interesting trousers in my wardrobe are perfectly fine to wear, as they accommodate the dressing. It‚Äôs been reassuring to know that even if my body isn‚Äôt moving in the same way as before, I can still get dressed up if I want to. There‚Äôs definitely some restorative power in pulling on a decent outfit from time to time.
text:I had a similar no jeans allowed dilemma! I have a medical problem that makes tight pants/denim not an option (except the occasional legging day). At first that meant I had wear the few pairs of androgynous-looking joggers which is a fun style but started to make me feel really frumpy and sad having to wear them every day. Now I‚Äôve built up some trousers that look more put together and have a loose fit and conveniently usually an adjustable waistband, which has worked great for my recent weight gain. As a result I‚Äôve also become much fonder of tight tops to balance out the looser pants.	labels:	episode_done:True

Less fancy but still memorable: we had just moved cross country for my husband‚Äôs job and I got an immediate call back from a job I applied for. Like, they called me the same day I applied and asked if I could interview the next day. All our stuff was in transit, and I had been planning to take some time off before my next job, so I had nothing to interview in and a suit is pretty much expected in my field.  I went to J. Crew, Banana Republic, Ann Taylor, LOFT, etc that afternoon and somehow NONE of them had suits in my size. The best I could find was one from Ann Taylor in a color I hated with an inseam that was 5 inches too long.   HOWEVER, I randomly passed a Salvation Army on my way home and decided to check it out. Friends, I found 4 beautiful J. Crew suits in my exact size, already hemmed to my ideal length within like 2 minutes of walking in the door. I‚Äôm pretty sure I actually did cry.

It works and I feel good, but when I take it off I start to feel like a fraud. Like I'm selling a body or image that isn't me and feel bad about it.

text:Let me ask you a few questions here...do you even like these clothes or are you more comfortable in something else? Are you dressing for you or for men? If for men, if a man is disappointed by what you're "hiding" then he's not worth it. There are plenty of great men out there who like you and your body just the way you are and they don't really care what you're wearing.   I would say we are all hiding some flaw...for me, I'm hiding my mom pooch belly. I can hide it well in clothes, but naked...nope! It is right out there. If someone doesn't like that then that's on them and speaks to how shallow they are, which is an instant turn off for me.  Love yourself first.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I have a similar body type, though recently it‚Äôs gotten very slightly curvier. I‚Äôve felt the same way, but literally everyone does this, not just us! Clothes create illusions. You‚Äôre not a fraud at all.   I‚Äôd also consider who you‚Äôre dressing for, like the other reply said. If you love what you wear obviously don‚Äôt do different because of something I say! But I felt a lot better about myself when I stopped trying to change my body type with clothes (which doesn‚Äôt mean I stopped wearing all of my more ‚Äúflattering‚Äù pieces). But I actually found a lot more confidence dressing in clothes that are easier for us to pull off. For me, that‚Äôs 1920s and 1960s inspired dresses. The ‚Äúsack‚Äù shape and drop waists are actually often really flattering on us (even with my short legs) and it‚Äôs unique because most people don‚Äôt find them flattering.   Yes, I probably look less traditionally sexy. But I‚Äôve gotten lots of positive comments on the style that mean more to me anyway. I‚Äôve gotten ‚ÄúMad Men‚Äù comments so some people think it‚Äôs sexy anyway!

text:This - many people tend to compliment things that catch the eye or are a change from the norm. They may be noticing the item itself or the alteration (e.g., from long hair to short), but this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it works for you. (Also, with friends/family, they‚Äôre likely to compliment any changes to be nice, even if it‚Äôs not an improvement.)   I agree with OP‚Äôs stance of focusing on how you feel over how others react. I love jumpsuits, and lots of friends tease that I look like a mechanic in one I own, but I like it and wear it anyway. Similarly, I get a lot of compliments on a sleeveless dress that makes me feel like a frumpy MIL, and that dress has since been retired.	labels:	episode_done:True

People aren't going to lie (Compliments, especially unprompted are going to be genuine), but saliency is the key feature.	labels:> I'd say 75% of compliments are basically "I noticed this".   Exactly! It‚Äôs for this reason that (in most instances) I usually prefer people not notice my clothing enough to compliment any specific item.   As an example, I can wear a bright coral sweater and receive many compliments on it ‚Äî but that‚Äôs because coral washes me out so badly that the sweater is all anyone notices. Or I can wear statement earrings. They‚Äôd utterly overwhelm my face, but I‚Äôd surely get comments and compliments.   A neutral grey sweater is a much less exciting item and is less likely to attract attention or compliments on its own ‚Äî but I know that grey  makes my skin and eyes/hair pop in a way that make *me* look good as opposed to the clothing.
text:This is such a great way to describe it! I reminds me of the idea of you wearing the clothes vs the clothes wearing you, with the latter in my experience being true for whenever I wear a loud or fashionable piece that maybe isn't the best suited for me but might be really nice on its own.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:People usually compliment clothes and items that stand out. It's usually not something that looks good, at least to ourselves.   I remember Karen from Karenbritchick, who often looks amazing in her clothes and designer items, talk about her most complimented item, and it's not the designer bags, cool clothes that she owns, but some wack, elaborate guitar strap for her bag.   So, our own gut feelings are important. Also, what looks good might not feel good.
text:I have an almost-completely sheer white jumpsuit with embroidered flowers on it that is super cute but when I wear it I feel like I‚Äôm wearing a clown suit. Wide legs, low crotch, etc. But inevitably when I wear it (with a super annoying bodysuit underneath because you can See Everything without it) it‚Äôs a total head turner, random people off the street tell me how much they like it, etc.   It‚Äôs a beautiful piece of clothing, but I‚Äôm self conscious and irritated by it when I wear it. Such a bummer!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:>I‚Äôd also pay attention to the content of the compliment.  This is so interesting, but this is kind of hard too, sometimes. I had thought that maybe the novelty of the color was the reason for most of the compliments, but I have had several people who know me well also tell me that they like the color because it looks like it is natural and not like I dyed it (which, I guess is true since it is the result of a botched lightening job and not actual dye?).  Then again, these people also told me for years that they liked my bangs ... maybe they're all just benevolent liars. Unfortunately my hairdresser quit during the pandemic due to having a vulnerable family member so there's no one now I trust to tell me the truth about my hair.	labels:Well, I think it‚Äôs also important to recognize that people have different tastes and preferences. Lord knows I would never let my husband, who I love dearly, choose my clothes.   It‚Äôs also possible to have multiple things be true simultaneously. The color is unusual, it looks natural on you *and also* it‚Äôs not what you wanted (I‚Äôm guessing, based on ‚Äúbotched lightening job‚Äù).  Hair color is tough because it doesn‚Äôt lend itself to the ‚Äúwell, I‚Äôll keep it in the closet and see how often I actually wear it‚Äù compromise that most of us make with clothes that we‚Äôre iffy about. Unless you‚Äôre a big scarf person or like wigs, it‚Äôs kind of an either/or question.	episode_done:True

text:It's a lot weirder for someone, regardless of interest, sex, gender, etc. relative to the recipient of the compliment, to say "you look great in x" rather than "x is cool." The less potential implications behind a statement like that, the less it has room to be misinterpreted.	labels:Exactly.

text:I made this effort a couple years ago and it was life changing. It started with me silently observing and thinking nice things about people, but then it turned into me telling total strangers they look baller and it just brings so much joy into the world.

text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:I've kept things like this a little longer due to people's compliments, or tried a little harder to sync them with my wardrobe in a way that I like better, but the vast majority of the time I end up donating or ceasing to wear the item in the end anyway.   Ultimately, aside from overarching situational appropriateness, other people's thoughts about my clothing choices (positive OR negative) have very little impact on my style and like you, my key motivator is my own comfort and confidence.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:Sometimes, I look really good in an item of clothing, but it doesn't feel like me.

text:Street style	labels:I have sort of a range depending on what I am doing, but generally I do a lot of really easy dresses, easy skirts, tank tops, etc. By this I mean cotton stuff you can find on Asos.

Also Pinterest is great if you haven‚Äôt used it yet.	episode_done:True
text:Street style	labels:As opposed to when I‚Äôm at the office, I tend to wear a lot more like loose, slouchy, oversized tops/sweaters, shorter skirts (pleated/schoolgirl-ish ones especially), more printed t-shirts, more stretchy cotton dresses, and more large belts with chain or stud details. Stuff that feel a little too revealing or edgy or casual for work but that I still like.  Typical free time outfits for me would be a stretchy, short tight, or flared cotton dress dress, thick tights and a big cardigan, or a short pleated skirt with a camisole and an oversized, off-shoulder sweater, or a long is-it-a-shirt-or-is-it-a-dress and patterned leggings.	episode_done:True
text:Street style	labels:This winter I found a coat I fell in love with, wool, oversized, soft pink, it turns heads on its own so I just find different things already in my closet to wear with it. That tends to be my approach I find... I fall in love with a certain look/item, and then proceed to wear the s*** out of it for months until my craving passes or the season changes.
text:Great idea!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you ‚Äúneed‚Äù?	labels:So what works for me is whenever I'm getting dressed and there's an item I wish I had to complete the outfit I mentally note it. Make sure to think of the category of item Ex Black Cargo pants, Brown hoodie w/ no drawstrings and no logo, white chunky sneakers. Etc.   Then as time goes by, the categories that come up over and over are the most important to grab first and would improve the most outfits. I add them to a list  If I'm shopping and I want something but it's not on my list then I try to pass on buying it. When a deal pops up and it's something on my list it's a no brainer instant purchase.   I try to be patient and wait for items that meet all my picky criteria. If I'm not in love with it I don't buy it. If even one thing is not right, I pass.   And final thing is I aim high whenever I buy for these categories in quality and spend time hunting. Ex: If I have $250 for a jacket I try and wait till a $600 jacket goes on sale for $250. You can find investment worthy designer for near regular retail prices and it's worth the extra money.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you ‚Äúneed‚Äù?	labels:Quality over quantity. ALWAYS. During this time, Christmas sales are so tempting, and I work in retail so it‚Äôs hard not to go into work and think ‚Äòwhat can I buy today with my 50% staff discount, and the others sales going on at the mall?‚Äô  I always go in a shop with a minimalistic mindset, and while I‚Äôm no true minimalist with clothes, I hate clutter and excess. But I still love to experiment with fashion (I went to school for it, it‚Äôs hard not to be creative). Look in your wardrobe, watch YouTube or look at Instagram and have intention on what style of garment you want that will suit you. Also, have patience in finding the right one you will be happy to keep for a LONG time.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you ‚Äúneed‚Äù?	labels:I'm going to try and do a clothing no buy in 2021 (I can only replace athletic shoes) so take what I say with a grain of salt.  For me, it is a matter of knowing myself.  The current trends (the boxy, oversized, neutral aesthetic) do not work for my body type (pear).  The other trend that does not work for me is the cropped/ankle pants trend.  I look like a small child who just outgrew their clothes.  I also know what I do not wear (black or khaki pants--- reminds me of retail work uniforms of years past).  When I purchase something, (in my mind) it has to "pay for itself."  Meaning I have to think of at least x times that I will wear the item before I will buy it (special occasions are the rare exception).  X means the dollar amount.  So I have to wear a $30 sweater at least 30 times to make it worthwhile.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you ‚Äúneed‚Äù?	labels:When I go to grab a piece and I either don‚Äôt have it, or I‚Äôve worn it out, or it no longer fits. But I also don‚Äôt keep stuff that doesn‚Äôt fit when I try it.  I feel too guilty and like I‚Äôm throwing hard earned money away otherwise.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you ‚Äúneed‚Äù?	labels:This is small but one piece of shopping advice I still use is, ‚Äòwill I wear this tonight?‚Äô Obviously for many items that is not a literal question but I find if I say no that may not be the right item for me.  Helps me pass on things that are nice but not right for my personality or lifestyle. I actually learned a lot from Ines de la Fressange‚Äôs book Parisian Chic. It‚Äôs a very general style book, it‚Äôs less about her taste, which is great, and more about how to have a quality collection that fits you.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you ‚Äúneed‚Äù?	labels:In general, nobody needs clothes, but want clothes instead.  You wish you could get a subscription for your clothes and identify gaps etc etc. You can, just get a personaly stylist, they'll do that job for you.
text:I second this: I‚Äôve bought too many clothes too many times to fit into a trend that doesn‚Äôt fit my style or body type.  Keep the clothes you‚Äôre comfortable with, donate what doesn‚Äôt fit/work for you anymore, and spend some time discovering your style identity before making any purchases.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you ‚Äúneed‚Äù?	labels:It starts with your personal style. If you don‚Äôt have one or you don‚Äôt know what it is, than your shopping habits will show that.   What I used to do was take photos of myself wearing the clothes I liked that I already owned, and when I‚Äôd shop, I‚Äôd try on clothes and see if they were fitting in a way that would both accommodate my style and also the other clothes. It helped me choose clothing that wouldn‚Äôt go weeks together in terms of length. I also used to take photos of my closet so I could avoid buying things I may have forgotten about.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you ‚Äúneed‚Äù?	labels:If you find yourself wearing a particular piece all the time, try and think what makes it a favorite, and what wardrobe home it fills. I‚Äôd then keep my eyes open for one or two similar pieces.   For example I bought a short sleeved button up on a whim and loved it, so now I have a bunch that I love and I wear all the time. They fill a good hole in my wardrobe (layers well under cardigans, fun print, work appropriate).	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you ‚Äúneed‚Äù?	labels:I think once you have your basics down, pay attention to the kinds of things that you find yourself wishing you had when you're getting dressed or when you're out.  If you keep consistently wanting the same things, long term, then it makes sense to add it to your closet.  It also helps if you get super specific about what you want and don't pick up things that kinda work, since you'll just end up buying a ton of similar things.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you ‚Äúneed‚Äù?	labels:Have you done a styling session with your current wardrobe to put together looks? If so, how did that go? It sounds like there is a chance you could/may need to work in your closet a little to put together outfits if you have not already. This is also a great exercise to identify what you really have to work with, and what you need. That'll help you round out what's missing and make your wardrobe more workable.	episode_done:True
text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:I sort on ThredUp by particular brands or really specific items. Like my most successful shopping experience there was looking for a silk leopard-print button down shirt. It let me sort by shirts in my size, made of silk, and then I picked animal print for the color. I found so many good options that I bought three! If I don't have that kind of specific search or a particular brand I want to browse, I find it pretty hard to look through.	episode_done:True
text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:Big plus one on filtering! I have a saved search of my favorite brands in my sizes in new or like new condition that I check periodically and more targeted searches like ‚Äúwool and cashmere sweaters from 3 brands I like‚Äù that I use more often. Size filtering and material filtering can be the most helpful, as can brand filtering. Setting up a brand filter can take the longest but a big saved search of brands you like can help a lot in browsing.  Also plus one on payout‚Äîpayout percentage increases with the dollar value of the item, and it‚Äôs so much lower effort for me to sell through them than through Poshmark. Poshmark takes forever and you have to spend so much time putting together good photos, detailed descriptions, and offers to potential buyers (plus then there‚Äôs the whole expectation of making you package cute with tissue papers and whatever to get good reviews). My time is just worth more than the additional payout I get from them. Thredup also will donate and recycle items they can‚Äôt sell, which turns it into a one stop thing for me. I will take my higher end items elsewhere for a first look, but if my local high end consignment shop won‚Äôt take it, I‚Äôll let Thredup have a pass at it. Love the convenience factor.	episode_done:True
text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:Personally I don't care that ThredUp gives me very little money because I see their clean out bags as an effortless way to give clothes I don't want a new purpose.

ThredUp either sells my clothes to a new owner or recycles them and maybe I even get a couple bucks out of it.

I generally stick to natural fibers, as polyester and rayon can be very hit or miss without feeling it. I don't buy anything with any damage.

text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:Easiest way to sort out the crap - filter by fabric.   I always filter to only look at clothes with cotton/linen/silk/leather/wool.

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:From 2001-2005, clothing I wore as a high schooler/college kid: low rise bootcut jeans, fitted graphic tshirts, fitted polo shirts, fitted shirts in general (shirts were so tight- maybe that‚Äôs why we layered??), always layering shirts- and shirts were super long and over your hips, but tight- never tucking them in, cutoff denim skirts, cotton shorts (like soffees) with words on the butt, necklace with my first initial on it, platform flip flops, dresses with Hawaiian prints (like flowers or surfers etc), hoop earrings, fitted hoodies. That‚Äôs what I can remember.
text:Ugh. Those tight long shirts with low rise jeans gave me a ton of body image issues. I wasn‚Äôt overweight by any means but that style just made me so self conscious about my love handles and stomach.

Lizzie McGuire, Mean Girls, Paris Hilton were who I wanted to BE in the 2000s as a kid lol. Now as a 26 year old I'm reading these comments about girls who wore long silky camis and super low rise jeans to frat parties and honestly yall still somehow sound so cool to me (even though I already went through that phase wearing the mid-2010 crop tops + high waisted jeans trend)!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Your comment about thinking each new piece will ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù your wardrobe is so spot-on - I‚Äôm the master of convincing myself that once I have a [insert item here], my clothing collection will be complete and I‚Äôll never need anything again. Surprise, surprise - there‚Äôs literally always something new that I ‚Äúneed‚Äù to ‚Äúfinish off‚Äù my wardrobe.   Like you, I‚Äôm trying to learn to work with what I have and narrow down exactly what I feel best in. I like high-waisted everything, plain tops in neutral colors, subtly patterned pants, button-downs that don‚Äôt need too much ironing, and a variety of jackets and shoes to switch things up. (Which I already own in spades.)   For 2021, I‚Äôm hoping to curb any non-necessary shopping impulses and am creating a shortlist from which I cannot deviate (as there are a few items I still want to add, such as a camel coat and a ski bib).	episode_done:True
text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:I did a no-buy year and a low-buy 6 months after that in 2018. I'm probably going to do the same this year.   I started as I needed to spend as little as possible as I had a pet who cost a lot for an ongoing chronic illness before he died.  I think I became more selective about what I bought. I also unsubscribed from a whole lot of sites. I also  became much better at money management and making outfits work in different ways. Also, by the end if I didn't wear it, it was worth thinking about what didn't like about it so I wasn't tempted by something inappropriate in the future.   The only reason it ended was I changed jobs and lost significant weight. But now my new wardrobe is complete, I don't need anything in the forseeable future. I'm probably going to just go through clothes seasonally  and  make a list if I need anything.  I did this before my no buy year and it worked well, but I had a lot more than I needed. It should work better now as I'm comfortable with the amount.	episode_done:True
text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Your post really resonated with me. First and foremost, hats off to you, for real. I definitely would not consider a no-buy during 2020 easy, at ALL. Yes maybe on a superficial level it would seem so since we are all just sitting around in onesies watching Netflix, but shopping - especially for new clothes - is an extremely effective way to self-soothe and lord knows we have needed a lot of that in 2020.   I personally broke up with fast fashion in 2019 during my second pregnancy (which really was easy in a way, because I didn‚Äôt actually fit into anything so it was difficult to justify purchasing new clothing). I‚Äôve had a few weak moments but have discovered sewing/dressmaking. It is really exciting in its own right because, as you said, I actually have a personal style and a lot of my dream pieces are actually super attainable. It also just feels so good to finally be outside of the hamster wheel of endless trends, sales, promotions, influencers, newsletters, marketing and whatever else have you. Good luck in 2021!	episode_done:True
text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Congrats! I did this in 2019 and I bought so much less in 2020 than I did in 2018. It's still really hard to resist buying clothing, but knowing I did it for a whole year without losing it does help.	episode_done:True
text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:I really like this and definitely also ‚Äúsad shop‚Äù online. I like the idea of no new clothes for the year - especially since I have shirts from 2020 that have never been worn due to shelter in place.  Thanks for sharing!	episode_done:True

text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:\#3. really spoke to me. I used to be subscribed to a ton of clothing brand emails. I ended up shopping much more for things I didn't need because of FOMO. Now I'm pickier about which brands I get emails from.	episode_done:True

text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:With sales, I am working to remind myself that it is cheaper to buy nothing at all.  I have considered challenging myself to a no buy with one exception - I can make things. I love knitting and sewing and I‚Äôve really enjoyed creating items to wear. However it is so easy to buy fabric for the same reasons you listed above. My goal is to be thoughtful in what I make, also focus on making things for other people. I can still fulfill that creative drive that way.	episode_done:True
text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Love your post.  I recently-ish got a sewing machine and am making myself only wear stuff I make.  Sewing can be an expensive hobby, however, I feel the clothes I do make would be less expensive than what I'd buy because I tended to go for nicer brands or linen sellers on Etsy (which can cost a pretty penny).  So, overall, I'm spending less money, have a new fun hobby, and it also makes me be more intentional with what I make since I'm not the fastest sewist.  Edit: also, in addition to unsubscribing to sale emails like you mentioned, I also moved all my shopping favorites in my browser to another folder that was annoying to get to.  I didn't want to delete it in case I do need a new winter coat or something (and can't remember brands). But this has really helped my window-not-really-shopping.	episode_done:True
text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.

text:How do I know I‚Äôm not being scammed?	labels:I think if you see the same clothes on Shein, then the boutique is not being honest about where the clothes are coming from. Someone on this sub linked a cute ‚Äúhandmade‚Äù smart watch band from a shop on Etsy. When I went to buy it, I found the exact same watch band on Amazon for $10 cheaper. It was clear the Etsy shop was just marking up a mass-produced item and claiming it was handmade. They even used the exact same pictures as the Amazon listing. When shops aren‚Äôt honest about that stuff, I have no qualms purchasing the exact same product somewhere cheaper.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I‚Äôm not being scammed?	labels:Chances are, if you find the boutique selling the same things as everyone else is on Instagram, it‚Äôs dropshipped. You‚Äôll have to look at reviewers (not anyone paid) to really know. I watch a bunch of Youtube videos and if not available, check reviewing sites.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I‚Äôm not being scammed?	labels:I know that legitimate IG shops exist. But for me personally, any IG shop I've "discovered" has clearly been either a scam or uses drop-shipping. I simply refuse to shop on IG all together.  I really recommend thrifting and organizing clothing swaps with friends (if/when safe, of course!) and/or using online alternatives like Poshmark, as someone else suggested.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I‚Äôm not being scammed?	labels:I don't trust boutiques on insta, they always seem to be fake low quality stuff. Generally you can plug the items name into a google search and see how many variations come up. Or use the same descriptors they do. Reverse image search on chrome works too.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I‚Äôm not being scammed?	labels:Find actual boutiques in your town/nearby cities etc. Either use Google maps, try posting on reddit/facebook pages from those nearby towns or cities.  Then check if they have a website. I would expect the contact details to have their actual street address (verifiable on google maps and street view, or a drive past), contact details (call them up and ask some questions) and their refund policies etc.    Most of the actual boutiques I know of - their photos (Instagram especially) are all taken in store, in front of the store, or nearby. They typically use the staff working there or regular customers as models - you tend to see the same faces.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I‚Äôm not being scammed?	labels:These are all pretty much dropshipping the same cheap clothes from Ali. Unfortunately affordable and ethical usually mutually exclusive because our idea of what cheap clothes should cost is based off a fast fashion model that can't work at a smaller sustainable scale. I would highly suggest the used market for affordable ethical clothes. threadup and poshmark are my go tos. But if you want to buy new Universal standard and Pact are good. Its also worth remembering that a lot of 'ethical' brands are really just greenwashed so who knows.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I‚Äôm not being scammed?	labels:I haven't had a lot of success with boutiques found on ig - I have a hard time deciphering if they are drop shipping like you mentioned.

text:Well it varies! For a simple, basic cotton t shirt that is decent quality I‚Äôm willing to spend about $30 or so. For jeans, between $100-$150 (although cheaper would be great!), etc.   This is for every day clothing of course. For an evening dress I‚Äôll spend $$$ for good quality, design, etc.   I just bought a $400 leather jacket.   So I guess the answer is it just depends! My main focus is decent quality, better than forever 21, SHEIN, etc. But not necessarily $50-$60 for a single shirt.   Sorry my answer isn‚Äôt more concise üò≠	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I moved from a tropical climate to a place with seasons and my style totally changed! Now I loveeee dressing up for colder weather (even though I hate the cold) and have neglected my summer style.  I think my style before was really based on the culture of where I lived - super beachy and low effort. Moving to a bigger city helped me develop my own style.	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:When I moved from a very seasonal American city to South East Asia, I for whatever reason thought that I _needed_ to live solely in very thin, very loose cottons and breezy skirts. I didn't bring a single pair of jeans or boots because I was fairly certain they would cause me to immediately melt into a puddle. For a period of time, I prioritized the heat over everything, so my style became really plain and blah, whereas I used to be fairly experimental back in the US.  Luckily, I then realized the key to dressing in the heat is just finding a balance. A thin turtleneck is fine with a skirt. Jeans and boots work fine with a tank top. Light weight blazer or loose oversized button-ups have replaced coats and sweaters, but still allow for some layering.   I've come to a good place with what I view my style as now, but I find that I do have to repeat a lot of basic "outfit formulas" and feel a bit envious of people who live in the cold and can layer to their hearts content. I think the cold weather lends itself to more creative combinations, whereas being stuck in perpetual summer makes me feel confined to a life of sun dresses.	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I moved from a place which has four seasons but it often grey and overcast to a place just a little north of the tropics with a lot of heat and sun. I still favour similar shapes but now in much lighter fabrics. The biggest difference has been the amount of colour in my wardrobe. I‚Äôve gone from a mainly navy and blacks colour palette to wearing such a variety. I find myself often wearing seasonal colours as if I‚Äôm trying to create seasons which simply don‚Äôt exists in the weather!	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I think it did for me, however im trying to fix that. Id say my style in general is feminine/pretty and dressy. The weather in one location was mainly rainy, but also had alot of hills. So I ended up wearing jeans, a sweater/shirt and trainers for the majority of my duration there, unless I was going out. In that case, my style showed through more. Ive now moved back to my home country which has all seasons. During the summer, its hot so im normally in a feminine, flowy dress, but once winter hits, its just way too cold lol. Ill kind of go back to swearing jeans, a sweater and boots, but try to style it with more accessories (colorful scarf or a checkered jacket with some mid sized earrings). I bought a pair of knee high boots, a skirt and a couple thicker winter dresses this year to push myself to maintain my style whilst staying warm. We shall see if I stick to it, lol.	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:Moving to San Antonio encouraged me to explore my summer style! I'm into linens, rompers, light fabrics, and sleeveless/short sleeve button shirts. Its been a lot of fun. I used to rely on layering to complete my outfits. Now, I look at accessories (mostly earrings, scarves, and belts), textures, and shoes to tie everything together.	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:Where i live does not get extremely cold but you definitely have to change your clothing if you dont want to freeze to death.  I can still wear clothes from the summer in winter here but it‚Äôs all about layering! I have a ton of scarves, coats, jackets and most importantly, tights to wear under dresses, and skirts. I also almost exclusively wear my thigh high boots in winter/fall	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I have lived in the pnw my whole life, and when my husband and I moved to cali we were shocked with how our style changed because it NEVER rained, and any rainproof clothing just became sweat too much clothing.

text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I moved from a place that was overcast and rainy most of the year where even the summers didn‚Äôt get warmer than 24C and the winters were around 10C to a place with hot (30C), humid summers, rainy and overcast late falls and cold (-10 to -30C) winters and where spring is so short it doesn‚Äôt count as a season. Boy has my wardrobe changed. I wear dresses, baggy pants and shorts in summer, the stuff I wore all year (jeans, t-shirts, sweaters, light rainwear) in the former place now works for fall. I wear layers of Heattech and down in winter and very rarely leave the house in a dress and only then if I‚Äôm going by car. Uniqlo has replaced Lululemon as my favourite place for basics. Since I walk and take public transit all year round and my outerwear is what most people see me in during the winter, I‚Äôve got a closet full of winter coats and winter boots. It‚Äôs taken nearly a decade but I‚Äôm ready for every possible occasion and temperature and every storm.	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I moved from the Midwest to California this summer and I was so excited to incorporate a lot more linen into my wardrobe!

I now own 3 pairs of linen pants, lots of breezy linen tops, and more sandals.	episode_done:True
text:What‚Äôs some of the best general advice you‚Äôd give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Don't try too hard to fit into a style box or get too rigid about style rules. Be very honest with yourself about how something makes you feel as much as how it makes you look- and remember that being comfortable and confident makes literally any look 1000x better.  And for less woo woo advice- type of fabric makes a huge difference, the cheaper stuff usually isn't worth it. That's probably applicable to a lot more than women's clothes though.	episode_done:True
text:What‚Äôs some of the best general advice you‚Äôd give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Keeping proportions in mind has been helpful for me (I am long-waisted relative to my height). Also, I have found the phrase "just flattering enough" to be helpful. An outfit doesn't need to be perfect for you to enjoy wearing it.

text:What‚Äôs some of the best general advice you‚Äôd give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Honestly I think the best rules are the ones you come up with for yourself that suit you body best. Like for me, I only wear skirts or pants that are fitted to my waist, and my thighs are large(r) so I prefer straight cut jeans to skinny jeans to hide them. I think most people would come up with rules like ‚Äúnever wear 2 different plaids/ prints/ etc in one outfit!‚Äù But I do all the time because it‚Äôs fun for me	episode_done:True
text:What‚Äôs some of the best general advice you‚Äôd give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:- Above all wear what makes you happiest   - Many women feel the best when dressing to their body type (apple, triangle, etc)  - Many women also feel best when dressing in their colors (autumn, spring, etc)	episode_done:True

text:What‚Äôs some of the best general advice you‚Äôd give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Accessories can change a look so much.

text:What‚Äôs some of the best general advice you‚Äôd give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:I would say start looking into what specific fabrics do and how to clean and treat them. You can invest quite a lot in a good cashmere sweater, but if you don‚Äôt wash it properly no amount of money will safe it. Same goes for a skirt from a fast fashion retailer, is it worth the x amount of money if it is made from an acrylic fabric? Wouldn‚Äôt you rather pay less at a budget retailer for the same quality?	episode_done:True
text:What‚Äôs some of the best general advice you‚Äôd give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Lots of good advice here already. One thing maybe worth adding: be aware that a lot of women's retailers use soft-feeling but lower quality fabric. At places like Zara and H&M, the men's clothes will be made of nice cotton or wool blends, and then nearly identical garments in the women's section will be flimsy rayon blends (knitwear, especially). It's easy to get duped by something that feels nice in the shop, until you get home and realise it's made of nasty sweaty acrylic. The stitching and construction can also be shoddier, so you'll end up with garments that look warped and awkward after one wash. (My husband is often shocked by the difference in quality when we shop together.) Maybe you've already noticed this, but I wish someone had told me these things when I started shopping for myself :)  Another thing to know is a lot of women's clothes are labeled "dry clean only" or "hand wash only." You'll want to carefully read the labels so you don't ruin anything! The tumble dryer is not your friend, except for socks/undies/workout clothes. That said, most "dry clean only" items that aren't heavily embellished can be gently hand washed and air dried, but if you don't want the hassle, check the label before you buy.	episode_done:True
text:What‚Äôs some of the best general advice you‚Äôd give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Don‚Äôt jump on trends...everything falls in and out of fashion if you wait long enough. Find a store/brand that you like the fit and cut of clothes on you and try to build a capsule wardrobe. Once you see what you like, you achieve a timeless look that doesn‚Äôt look trendy or dated. From there, feel free to incorporate fun pieces that can be easily added to other outfits like accessories or shoes.	episode_done:True
text:What‚Äôs some of the best general advice you‚Äôd give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Honestly, accept that you‚Äôre gonna walk out the door and realize that your outfit looks ridiculous sometimes.  And that‚Äôs ok, especially when youre experimenting with new looks. As long as you liked the look before you stepped out the door and you figure out what you dont like about, it‚Äôs good!	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a ‚Äúformula‚Äù to create their outfits?	labels:I like a fitted piece with a looser piece. Two looser pieces look sloppy and too many fitted pieces look try hard to me. So slim trousers or skirt with a looser fitting top for example.   I like to mix stripes with patterns in similar colours and fabrics.   I wear sundresses with Sandshoes in coordinating colours all the time in summer. I am trying not to surrender to the need for little coordinated cardigans with using a nice denim jacket I‚Äôve had for years.   In winter I love capes and wraps over either dresses or trousers. I don‚Äôt love jerseys and sweaters as the weather here changes all the time.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a ‚Äúformula‚Äù to create their outfits?	labels:I generally find its easier to base your outfits around one piece, often an accent piece or statement piece. I got the idea from storytelling/art composition seminars, its infinitely more easy to come up with a composition once you know what your main character is interacting with scene/item wise. The same applies to outfits, once you have your main piece for that outfit you can decide how casual/dressed up you want to be, whether you need to add more textures, and what colors will match with said pieces color.  Generally I stick to the rules of trying to match the metals/detailing of outfits, trying to either go with neutrals for primary pieces with skintone matches to accents, or going with monochrome outfits(which generally look very stylish automatically). Fit wise, I generally make sure that I alternate between loose up top/form fitting below the waist, or vice versa. Silhouette is the most important thing, I try to go for clean lines.  Pattern wise I limit them to one pattern max, the same goes for textured pieces.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a ‚Äúformula‚Äù to create their outfits?	labels:I don't have a system per se. Rather, I have a kind of "capsule" mindset for my wardrobe: not too many statement pieces, and everything in my color palette (black, grey, Ivory, Navy, taupe, blush). I honestly haven't had to think about an outfit in years (outside of accounting for the weather). I can pick up practically any blouse, trousers, jacket, and accessory and they are almost guaranteed to match. I do find myself gravitating to layers (sweater over a blouse, cardigan over a top, etc) but I'm not too specific about it and I usually just choose whatever sounds most comfortable.  It works so well that I started doing this with lingerie too -only buying my lingerie in black, blush, or nude. Now my underwear always matches and it gives me the strength of ten men.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a ‚Äúformula‚Äù to create their outfits?	labels:My aunt has a "1 of 3" rule that I like: only one of the following areas should be shown/highlighted, cleavage, legs or back. For example, if the top is revealing cleavage, no short skirt or backless top. If the skirt is short, no cleavage or back, and so on. She says "one is attractive, two becomes trashy".	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a ‚Äúformula‚Äù to create their outfits?	labels:i kinda just got with what i know works for me. prioritize colors that make me happy, cuts that make me happy, things that fit right no matter what size it says it is, and comfortable fabrics so i don‚Äôt have a sensory issue with irritation.   so i guess my formula is more does this feel right to my needs and less ‚Äúdoes this feel like a conventionally good looking outfit‚Äù	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a ‚Äúformula‚Äù to create their outfits?	labels:I'm a Sagittarius with a Taurus moon, so my formula is just abject chaos but make it luxe (ie. I wear a flat gold herringbone chain, gold or tortoiseshell earrings, a little gold watch, and a gold signet ring + my engagement ring at all times, even if I'm wearing leggings and a sweatshirt to play Stardew Valley all day).   More seriously, my jewellery basically never changes (see above), so I guess that's my formula? I wear that combo whether I'm wearing a dress and heels to go out (in theory, who even remembers going out?) or jeans and a sweatshirt to go to the grocery store (in theory, we just do pick up orders now). I did just get a new big-girl job, so maybe this will change as I'm able to better afford the wild 1940s wardrobe of my dreams?	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a ‚Äúformula‚Äù to create their outfits?	labels:When I was younger and experimenting with fashion and style, anything goes. Some days I hit bingo and come out looking fab, and other days I walk around knowing that I was a fashion disaster (incomplete outfits, too much going on,  non-cohesive outfits).  You know what? Everything is fine and the world keeps spinning.  I‚Äôve since accumulated enough experience styling myself that those fashion disaster days are less and less. I just learned how to dress myself to my own satisfaction, efficiently. And this requires experience, experimentation, and learning.. from my good outfit days and my bad outfit days.  There really aren‚Äôt rules to fashion; what is a faux pas on someone, might be something you can pull off. It all depends on your style, personality, context.. so many factors.  I think this is how I would like to answer your question: what is the goal of a formula even? Where is this fear of failing an outfit coming from? Nobody really cares if your outfit is one necklace and a watch away from complete, or if you‚Äôre wearing one too many colors.  There are good and bad outfits, (or should I say outfits you like and outfits you don‚Äôt like), but it doesn‚Äôt mean the latter has no or negative value in your fashion journey. Don‚Äôt be afraid of making fashion mistakes! Cos unlike most mistakes in life, there aren‚Äôt really big consequences to it, and frankly nobody cares.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a ‚Äúformula‚Äù to create their outfits?	labels:As a maximalist, I just mix whatever colours, textures and patterns resonate with me. I don't love super strict rules about how many colours we should wear or whatever. More is more and fashion should be fun and have a sense of humour. I especially like making references to particular vibes (e.g. Latin American drug lords with colourful print shirts and gold chains, but really exaggerate it and make it more fashion-y).  Obviously, not everyone feels the same way. You do you.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a ‚Äúformula‚Äù to create their outfits?	labels:Some of mine in no particular order; I don't think about it all the time but my dressing habits are based around this:   * No more than 3 colours (I don't wear much black and have a lot of different neutrals, so I have to be aware of this). * Try to have something more interesting than just a crew neck sweater + pants. I am so guilty of falling into this when I get lazy.  * Don't wear the same colour pants and coat. People can probably pull this off no problem but it is something I avoid for some reason.  * Like someone else said, for tops and bottoms no tight/tight or loose/loose. I just don't feel comfortable that way. I feel better when I emphasize either my waist or my hips.  * Only wear 1 uncomfortable item at a time. Ideally you would have no uncomfortable items but unfortunately I have a few pieces that I am not willing to get rid of. If I wear them all at once it's like I am crawling in my own skin, so I try to be aware of this when I dress to leave the house.	episode_done:True

text:My 10x10 Capsule wardrobe challenge results	labels:I‚Äôve never tried the challenge myself so it‚Äôs cool when others do and share their results.  I think outfit #9 works best because of the colours (green and white are dispersed well visually on top and bottom), the fabric weight matches for the top and bottom, and the contrast in size/busy-ness of the patterns.  I think #2 is my least favourite because it looks like you‚Äôre kinda divided into 3 harsh segments (black / blue / black). Maybe if you had something blue on top it could help integrate the outfit better? Like maybe a blue necklace or scarf or some other accessory with some blue.	episode_done:True

text:Alexander Wang accused of a history of sexual harassment - fashion in a year of reckoning?	labels:I thought this was old news but it seems to have been buried enough that it's just getting widespread attention now. I learned about it when the video of him dancing to WAP came out. I used to think that certain industries were rife for this sort of thing, but after a career change from arts to STEM I've realized they're all as bad as each other, albeit each with their own twist.   That said - I think fashion and other arts industries (looking at you, publishing) suffer from the issue of having just enough white women and white gay male representation to pat themselves on the back with the energy of a perpetual motion machine and drown out any and all criticism about diversity and representation, regardless of how genuine it may be. And when white people are concentrated at the top of the power hierarchy, it makes intersectional issues that much harder to surface with clarity.   For every person who has been harassed by AW, how many powerful white industry gatekeepers have brushed it off because they think only straight white men can be harassers? (And, of course, when a straight white man turns out to be an abuser they still can't accept it because "he's one of the good ones" or "he just made a mistake one time, it's not fair to ruin his life").  This only starts to get fixed when the industry gives equal respect and attention to the voices of everyone who helps to create it - whether they are a celebrated designer, fashion editor, personal assistant, early career model - anyone. I have plenty of reservations about social media, but the democratizing effect of reaching a huge audience without being beholden to the industry gatekeepers has been a very good thing for issues like these.	episode_done:True

A lot of people working in fashion are on a gig-by-gig basis so it‚Äôs Everyman for himself as far as success goes. People will turn a blind eye to the wrong doings of companies if it means that they themselves can get another paycheck or take a step up the ladder. It‚Äôs not that they themselves are immoral but it‚Äôs a hard industry to make it in and you can feel powerless when you‚Äôre not at the top. When you are on your own, which is most days, you will lose sight of the bigger picture of an ideal future.  For example this summer I read that FreePeople implemented racist practices within their stores. I added them to a list of companies that I didn‚Äôt want to work for (I‚Äôm freelance.) A month ago I was offered an opportunity to work with them and even though on principal I didn‚Äôt want to, I still considered it because I need a paycheck and the name would be good for me to have on my resume and would lead to more work.  Until their are unions to protect freelancers the fashion industry will remain corrupt. Everyone is afraid of being blacklisted and/or broke.

I'm thinking a lot about velvet and knit and texture, trying to do longer (and warmer!) skirts than my usual pencil skirt without looking girlish or dowdy... and trying not to splurge on every coat known to man (four wool coats and a cape isn't too-too much, right?)

text:What's on your 2021 fashion wishlist?	labels:I used to have a more preppy/minimalist style but these last two months or so I‚Äôve been really getting into the more ‚ÄúTik tok‚Äù sporty Rihanna vibe with big sweatshirts and biker shorts and things like that. I always felt like that wasn‚Äôt me and it didn‚Äôt fit my more big busted body type. But I just took a job where I‚Äôm WFH most of the time and going into the office occasionally and I can wear whatever I want. So I‚Äôm excited to explore!!!	episode_done:True
text:What's on your 2021 fashion wishlist?	labels:I‚Äôm going back to work where I wear a uniform so I really want more high quality super comfy lounge wear and pajamas and in contrast, I want some awesome new party outfits! Sequins and velvet and a good set of heels. Those are the only things I would need outside of work haha oh and a new swimsuit. I just read Nicole Byers‚Äô book and now I want to brave a bikini for the first time in nearly a decade.   But mostly in 2021 my goal is to spend more time/energy/money on non clothing fashion, like actually getting my hair cut and colored instead of doing it myself, getting my nails done regularly, maybe getting laser hair removal, and a new tattoo. I want to feel polished all over.	episode_done:True

text:What's on your 2021 fashion wishlist?	labels:Camel-colored coat (maybe Aritzia or MaxMara, trying to only ever buy one)  Cable-knit White sweater  Champagne-colored satin skirt  Black leather ankle boots (maybe Dear Frances)  Fun splurgey items: Chanel ‚Äò19 purse, Chanel brooch, Merjuri jewelry

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Disclaimer-- I know myself well enough to know that a capsule wardrobe is not for me.  When I get back from traveling, I cannot wait to wear different clothes.  Consider your laundry situation.  Having a smaller wardrobe means that you will be doing laundry more often.  If you're one in a family of 6, it may not be a big deal.  But for a single apartment dweller (pay per load), the additional costs can add up quickly.   Because I pay per load, I make sure that I maximize the capacity and only wash full loads (I'm paying the same no matter the capacity).  I am not one to hand-wash clothes in a bathroom sink.  Not now, not ever!   I do laundry roughly every other week alternating lights and darks.  (Sheets and towels are their own ballgame, and I will sometimes throw things in with them.)	episode_done:True

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I don't have a capsule wardrobe, but have curated my closet with the... Spirit of the capsule wardrobe in mind? Starting with going through each item and doing a major cull, then really assessing what I have and what I "need" to make things work more to my liking. does everything go together all of the time? No, have I honed in so I have more options around my favorite pieces, yes absolutely!!   Also wardrobe tracking will help A LOT so you know what you ACTUALLY wear vs... your pinterest "look"
text:Would you mind expanding a bit on the wardrobe tracking idea? Sounds really interesting!	labels:I personally started using an app (closet for android) where you put in every item of clothing you own, and log each day what you wear, so you KNOW how many wears your getting out of each item. Logging every item was weirdly fun, and really made me asses why I kept what I kept. But the app was a bit clumsy, so I made a secret instagram account to just take an Ootd (outfit of the day) picture as I headed out the door (or when covid hit, on my way to the couch, ha ha)   If you have apple I have heard great things about their apps, some people on here use airtable (if you search the group there are loads of better informed wardrobe tracking, and mgetsdressed blog has many many posts about it)   I personally found looking at what I'm ACTUALLY wearing, not what I aspire to wear, helps me be realistic about what to add to my wardrobe, and being more aware of everything I own now I've done several purges makes me pull out lesser worn items to I have an excuse to keep them	episode_done:True
text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:i don‚Äôt have a strictly capsule wardrobe, but the colors i feel best in are pretty neutral, so i stick to those. black, white, grey, shades of green, navy, some tan/brown. most of these colors go with each other.   in high school and my early college years, i was much more experimental with my style. now i know what i feel good in, and i know i don‚Äôt have an unlimited budget, so i try to buy pieces that will go with most of my other clothes. i think there‚Äôs a financial benefit to this (getting lots of ‚Äòwears‚Äô per purchase). it also makes putting outfits together faster and easier.   i still buy ‚Äúfun‚Äù pieces and mix them in, but my higher priced items need to be able to go with most of my other clothes.	episode_done:True
text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I wouldn‚Äôt call what I have a capsule wardrobe but I have a wardrobe of about 50-70 pieces including all my winter and summer wear. Everything I own are neutrals and warm toned. I have a warm complexion and cool tones just don‚Äôt look the best on me. I like to get things in various cuts and styles so that I can play with shapes and proportions in my outfits.   For example I have 7 pairs of pants which includes 4 pairs of jeans. 1 light wash in a straight leg, one medium wash in a wide leg, one black straight leg and one black slim cut. I also have a pair of wide leg black trousers, a pair of wide leg beige trousers and a pair of cream cargos. I don‚Äôt double up on cuts and styles so that I still have lots of options and not a wardrobe full of the same things.   My tops are mainly tanks and t shirts in black and white, a few button ups, and turtle necks and sweaters for the fall and winter.   I do have quite a few jackets, about 10-15 so that i still feel like I have options and not get bored. Coats and jackets are my favourite layering piece and really helps to make each outfit look different. I have a white cropped jacket, a black cropped jacket, a white flowy shirt jacket, a forest green shirt jacket, a tan blazer, black blazer, plaid cropped blazer, black wool shirt jacket, black leather blazer, beige trench coat, camel wool coat and a black puffer.   I make sure that everything goes together in terms of colours and undertones so that I can pull anything out in my wardrobe and know that it matches. I also don‚Äôt get bored because I put thought into making each piece different enough to still have plenty of looks/options while not having a massive wardrobe. I don‚Äôt have the most minimal wardrobe like those 30 item capsules but it works for me :)
text:I'd say this is a pretty successful capsule wardrobe! Most of the 30 piece ones I've seen have been by extreme minimalists or only work for the warmer months.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Capsule wardrobe is not for me. But you need to ask yourself what you want to get out of a capsule and what wardrobe issue you are trying to solve.   Do you want to have less stuff? Make it easier to get dressed? Get more higher quality stuff?  Eliminate decision fatigue? Etc.   If you are moving into to this path you want to figure out two things. Your color palette and what shapes you like. These should help you figure out the base of the wardrobe. And you do not want to trash everything and get it all at once. You‚Äôll make mistakes and learn what you like by experimenting.    Maybe try a 10x10 challenge to get a taste of a more limited wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I have what would pretty loosely be defined as a capsule wardrobe -- everything is in a limited palate, and goes together. I love it, and don't plan on switching any time soon -- but I don't super-strictly limit the number of pieces I have either, which gets me out of the "Ugh, I hate all of this and I'm sick of it!" rut. While I've got a lot of strong investment-piece basics, there's a generous sprinkling of new (well, new-used) stuff coming in and out often enough that I don't get bored. Also, I don't stick just to neutrals; two of my four colors are green and purple.   I love that setting limits on myself has curbed my shopping addiction. I love that I'm pushed to be creative with what I have and think more carefully about how what I buy goes with what I have. I feel like I'm being true-er to my aesthetic because I'm not letting my head get turned by clothing that is objectively completely gorgeous but isn't for me for style/color/age reasons. And I love feeling put-together more often than I did when I didn't have limits.	episode_done:True
text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I've been using a capsule wardrobe of about 30 ish pieces since March so I have some pros and cons to contribute!   Pro: I wear more "out there" outfits. I know its counterintuitive to most people's neutrals capsule, but I put away every piece of black clothing I own and chose lots of color for my capsule and I've been having so much fun with it! Since I took the time to pick colors intentionally, I know when I'm picking outfits that my yellow plaid pants actually do go with almost all my shirts, and therefore I wear the fun pieces I love more often!  Con: I can't go out and buy new clothes when I come across an inspiration photo on Pinterest or instagram or whatever that I want to recreate. There's some clothes that I know won't look good with the majority of my closet, whether because of silhouette or color, so I can't justify buying them (I'm looking at you, wide leg flair pants).  Overall I've loved my capsule and I'm keeping it up for now!	episode_done:True
text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Try out a capsule wardrobe yourself first! Just pick a subset of clothes that constitutes your capsule, and try just wearing those for a month. If this issue is that you don‚Äôt feel like anything goes together, but you otherwise like the fewer options, then a capsule wardrobe seems like a good fit. If you feel like nothing goes together AND you‚Äôre bored of your options, you might just want to go shopping for some basics but not have a capsule.	episode_done:True
text:2020 Christmas Gifts Thread	labels:My husband got me a necklace. It‚Äôs one of those circle charms with writing on it. It says ‚ÄúI love you and I like you‚Äù. It‚Äôs a quote from parks and rec. it‚Äôs absolutely perfect and I haven‚Äôt taken it off since Christmas morning. I‚Äôve always liked those small circle charms with writing on them, but I wasn‚Äôt sure which would be right for me and also sort of wanted it to be given to me by someone so it really meant something. I‚Äôve never told anyone that. He chose this totally on his own; which makes it even more perfect.   I also got some great lounge wear, pants and shorts.   We also got each other the same cat headphones (though they won‚Äôt work for his computer). It worked out though since the ones he got for me hadn‚Äôt been shipped he was able to cancel and get a refund and I keep the ones meant for him.	episode_done:True

text:2020 Christmas Gifts Thread	labels:Oh my, I go all out of Christmas gifts for my family. My brother and my mom do a lot for me and have supported me immensely through years of mental illness and addiction issues (sober for 6 1/2 years wooo) so I try and do something special for them.  For mom I got her a jersey, lime green Bottega Veneta shirt, and a golden yellow scarf from Bottega as well. I initially only bought the shirt and then I saw the scarf and knew I had to include that as well!  For my brother, not fashion, but I got him an authentic Penguin pitcher from Argentina, where our dad was from.  Sister in law and best friend, I got her a black hooded Apparis coat that I found on sale for $150!  Aunt and Uncle got puzzles and flannels from LL Bean, their favorite.  For my fiance, I got him a simple black windbreaker from Bottega.  Now on to what I got!  My fiance got me rainbow huggie earrings from Stone and Strand and I'm never taking them off!  My mom and brother got me a green Bottega mini pouch bag.  My aunt and uncle got me this fuzzy fleece sweater that may be the softest thing I've ever touched.	episode_done:True
