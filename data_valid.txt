text:DAE feel they made incredibly ODD fashion purchases, this year in 2020?	labels:For me, 2020 was not much different to any other year!  Little Old Lady here, one friend, no family.  All my clothes buys are always utility.  This years were two pull-over hoodies, a sweatshirt, two cardies, a jacket, three flannels and another shirt, a pair of jeans, two pairs of cargoes.  All charity shops except one of the cargoes.  All will get worn until unwearable as usual.  Mostly slightly different things to what I have worn for years.  Don't think for any reason, just things I saw and liked.	episode_done:True

However, it does give me a new perspective knowning I‚Äôm fairly happy with my wardrobe and I don‚Äôt need anything new.

text:I too want to chime in that I don't think there was shade, and that I, too, believe velvet is a staple fabric that should be available 3/4's of the year.  My personal white whale is silk velvet - it is impossible to find.  Now it is all viscose with 6% silk at most.  Bring. back. silk. velvet.  It is why vintage dresses of yore were so drapey and sumptuous.  Edit: try Eileen Fisher's velvet pieces.  You can always find them pre-worn and in resale.  They hold up very well..  I have machine washed many a piece and they look perfect. It's also a great way to find office-appropriate velvet pieces.  Velvet dresses are a basic necessity.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does Anyone Ever Feel Like It‚Äôs Hard to Find Basic Clothing Items That Were Plentiful in the Past?	labels:When I was younger it was a lot easier to get basics in neutrals and a variety of colors from brands with ‚Äúbetter‚Äù quality. This was common at every price point from discount to mid-range.   Now the mid-range is terrible quality. And the brands know for basics focus on neutrals and 1-2 seasonal colors.   As for your comment on Velvet dresses? Those tend to be pretty seasonal - for holiday parties. And this year there won‚Äôt be many holiday parties so brands likely scaled back their social occasion collections this year.	episode_done:True

Both shoes and purses seem prone to being "collector's items" moreso than other garments (leggings, sweaters, etc.) and it makes sense to me as a fashion hobbyist and collector that people would have more than they "need" or use regularly. Also, as people age they typically gain more buying power, space to store things, and access to various occasions (business events, formal events, lifestyle changes that may necessitate a wider variety of things to fulfill a wider variety of functions).   Furthermore, I haven't found this sub's focus on "purging"/closet cleaning reflected in real life--while people do obviously consign or donate old clothing, it's pretty common for people to keep things or simply put things in storage as their use wanes.

text:Fwiw I know at least two men who own a ton of shoes and hats. As in 50+ pairs and a store rack worth of hats. One of them collects sneakers as a hobby while the other just likes his shoes and hats to match every outfit. I would guess it's similar for women who own a lot of purses.   I personally don't like purses at all so I only have one for when I absolutely have to (dress codes at fancy events, weddings etc). With "nice" shoes it's hard to find any that are remotely comfortable, so I see a lot of women buying various pairs of torture devices in hope of finding the perfect ones, only to end up with a ton of impractical footwear that never gets worn. I myself own 3 pairs of ballet flats that give me blisters and I haven't got rid of yet. But then if I'm invited somewhere I won't have any nice shoes and idk if I should keep the toe blisters ones or the heel blisters ones or the ones that fall off my foot every other step.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:This is a comforting thread despite talking about discomfort! My biggest thing that I .... just cannot do is anything that's all up in my armpits. Tight sleeves and/or excessive bunching of fabric.  So capped sleeves are a fuck no for me too.   Sleeveless tops are my staple. When I'm cold I put something like a large sweaters or jackets and oversized styles over them to avoid my armpits getting suffocated.

text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:I was just thinking about this the other day because i feel like I have cracked the code! Maybe I'll do a whole post sometime. I'm also in the cusp/extended sizing realm of things.  Caveat - i only buy second hand, generally from ThredUp.   Favorite brands:  J.Jill and PureJill. I hear they have good sales if you prefer to buy new. Most items dont have tags at all, a LOT of 100% cotton items, and things are soft and loose in the best way. Partly because all sizes run half to a full size large.    Max Studio runs smaller, but they also have some extremely soft fabrics, and they have really good options for those tight skirts that you can wear with leggings and loose tops.    Eddie Bauer runs fairly large, very few synthetic blends, easy to find super duper cheap second hand.    More generally, I look at fabric content. Usually with my trusted brands and ALWAYS with anywhere new.  I find that the closer I get to 100% cotton or cashmere for things that Im wearing next to my skin (tops and dresses and sleep clothes) the more I go to that item over the long term.    I also like Aerie for underwear and leggings. A lot of seamless options and breathable fabrics.    And finally - sending so much love to my sensory sensitive ladies! I'm really glad this got posted and has had so much engagement.	episode_done:True

text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I haven't worked in a proper business casual place in a long time. My office is casual and I tend to dress up.   As mentioned, it depends on what level of casual is implied. I always took it as sort of one casual element, and the rest is regular business.   So I feel like you can do a couple of angles.   One of my favorite angles is a fancy version of something casual. E.g. a jogger in a trouser fabric or a shirt dress shape in a nicer fabric (like a wool knit, or some sort of jersey knit or silk. Or a shirt dress but with sheen.   The other angle is one casual element with a dressy outfit. E.g. nice dress with fancy sneakers. Or jeans with a blouse, blazer,  and "nice shoes."  Or maybe a sheath dress with a moto or jean jacket.   My default work outfit is usually a dress, and I feel like depending on the shape it could either go casual or dressy. And it jut ends up being a lot easier for me. I have dresses that are a bit more casual and ones that are a bit more fancy. The fancy ones get a casual piece and the casual ones get a fancy piece.	episode_done:True
text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I work in an engineering office, where the men usually wear a dress shirt + pants Mon-Thu and khaki + polo on Fri. My interpretation of ‚Äúcasual Friday‚Äù isn‚Äôt necessarily dressed down, but showing more of my personal style. I usually wear neutral coloured blouse + skirt, and on Fridays wear the same type of outfit but with a brighter colour and/or louder pattern, with bolder accessories.   Eg. Thursday is blue striped button down shirt and black pencil skirt. Friday is buttoned up Kelly green cardigan with a panda brooch, and shorter houndstooth a-line skirt.	episode_done:True
text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I see business casual as an opportunity to express yourself a bit more. My casual Friday go-to is jeans (because I don't normally wear those M-TH) and a trendy sweater or blazer w/ men's type shirt under-- coordinating belt and accessories are a must for me no matter what day. Pair this with casual flats or boots. My Friday looks are less stuffy than my M-TH attire. I work in higher ed; it's not suits level attire M-TH, but managers on up shouldn't be wearing jeans during the week at my place of work. Friday is where I show a bit more of my personality. I never knew I had so much to say about casual Friday attire. lol	episode_done:True
text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I have three basic outfits I go towards for casual Fridays depending on the time of year and plans:  * Long flowing maxi-dress with a longline blazer. With comfortable shoes. * Fitted Midi-dress. With comfortable shoes. * High waisted jeans, a dressy top/knit jumper depending on the weather and oversized blazer. With comfortable shoes.  All of the above are a marked improvement on my usual silk shirt, midi skirt, blazer and heels combo. I will note that I'm more inclined to go with either of the first two options. These are my preferred silhouettes.  I also go slightly bolder with my necklace choices. Instead of my usual gold Common Era necklace (which I wear every day), I go with my more colourful Lizzie Fortunado options.  My goal is to be my more colourful self, just a very polished version. With comfortable shoes.	episode_done:True
text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I work in local government so we‚Äôre on the casual end of business casual most days. On Friday I usually wear cute jeans and tshirt with the city logo on it. Today that combo is paired with slip on keds and a cardigan.	episode_done:True
text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I work in an office where "casual Fridays" are very casual. I'm currently wearing a yellow buffalo check Levi's shirt with jeans and sneakers. Sometimes I'm super casual (jeans and a plain t-shirt) or semi-dressy (last week I wore red kitten heels with a white pussycat bow shirt tucked into ankle length high waisted boyfriend jeans). I've also worn said boyfriend jeans with a lavender terry cloth cropped Nike sweatshirt over a white button down and brown ankle booties. Basically I wear anything I own that I can't wear to work Mon-Thurs. It's my favourite day to style because I can take some fashion risks and I love to style super casual with dressier pieces!	episode_done:True

text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I rarely see people dressed in business formal unless it‚Äôs a huge meeting, so most days it‚Äôs business casual. Then on Fridays, I just swap out my dress pants for skinny jeans. But generally, I‚Äôll have a blazer with a blouse or sweater on and loafers. If it‚Äôs a holiday or no one is in the office, I‚Äôll put on a button down that‚Äôs half tucked in with jeans and I‚Äôll wear ankle boots. I‚Äôve seen people show up in leather or suede jackets on Fridays, but they‚Äôre not wearing it the entire time indoors. Depending on your role, T-shirts under a blazer is fine.	episode_done:True
text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:When I worked in an office I would usually switch out dress pants for jeans and wear nice sneakers instead of boots.

I had a handful of really awesome Jcrew sweaters purchased 20 years ago.... I grew out of them when I hit menopause but they were still going strong and I imagine someone thrifted them and is still wearing them to this day.....   Overall, quality has gone way way down everywhere.  ETA: as I think fondly of these sweaters, they were classic styles (cable knit t-necks) but in super rich, bright and vibrant colors. I miss those sweaters. I have not found anything close in 2 decades to replace, but as a petite my options are usually limited to black, grey, and just one trendy color that sells out super fast.	episode_done:True

text:I'm a J. Crew loyalist, so I'm acknowledging my potential bias but I'm also a fan of Banana Republic and went through a hardcore BR phase. However, I've kind of forsaken Banana (my young professional wardrobe was full of it) and returned to even more J. Crew -- I've found that, in general, my pieces from J. Crew last longer and hold their shape/quality more than what I have bought from Banana. Also those 50% sales are usually goldmines for me! Just my experience!	labels:I loooove BR - they‚Äôre in my price range and their clothes just fit me well - but quality is absolutely hit or miss.

text:The wildest thing to me is that Madewell has really consistent sizing and I'm able to order online with confidence about what will fit. I have ordered a bunch of things and haven't needed to return or exchange a single one. By the end of last year, J. Crew was the most inconsistent sizing of any brand I think I've ever encountered. I could take 15 items of the same size into a dressing room and all 15 of them would fit like shit in totally different ways. It means online shopping is essentially unavailable to me - in this economy, no less. They've maintained those price points while spiraling out re: their supply chain.	labels:I feel like JCrew *used* to be more consistent. I used to have faith that a size 6 Perfect Shirt was, indeed, a perfect fit for me. I owned three of them in white alone. That hasn't been the case in recent years, and it's a shame.   Besides inconsistent fit, there's also just been some bizarre merchandizing decisions. Last March, right before all this (gestures at 2020) went down, I went into a JCrew looking for work pants. I did not find a *single pair of full length pants.* I mean, I can understand gearing up for spring, but ... no pants? at all? Some decisions just don't make sense.	episode_done:False
text:Yeah, I went in there looking for a classic, flattering suit a couple of years ago, which was something they used to do really well, and they didn‚Äôt have a single normal suit. They had some mess with an oversized double-breasted jacket and Capri-length pants, another with a ribbon on the jacket that you were supposed to tie into a bow instead of buttons. Like, why?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:A loose-fitting garment with the perfect drape does a lot of the same things a well-fitted garment does; it conceals what you don't want to see, enhances what you do want people to see, and leads their imagination to fill in the gaps with the best possible things.     My personal problem is that I've got a small, tidy waist paired with bulldozer hips and a substantial hip dip.  I find that wearing skirts that gain fullness just a few inches below the waist will help smooth out that hip dip so that all people see is that va-*voom* created by my waist-to-hip ratio.       I'm also a huge fan of knitted tops with batwing sleeves, since they almost never have any of the sleeve fitting problems that you often get in made-to-wear clothing, and that batwing... if it's  a cropped shirt, or it's tucked into a high-waisted skirt, trousers, or belt, creates a line pointing straight to my waist that I'm probably emphasizing anyway because it's my only good feature.     Also, gigantic, hideous sweaters.  Like just a huge pile of ugly with legs and a head poking out.  That is some real luxury right there.	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:I totally understand your mental block‚ÄîI‚Äôm in the same boat! I recently started following Amy Smilovic on Instagram (founder of Tibi). She talks a ton about how ‚Äúflattering‚Äù isn‚Äôt worth making your decisions on! I‚Äôve found her view really refreshing. You might enjoy it as well!	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:I love loose shapes, but particularly the ones that are a little rigid and architectural, rather than something that hangs. I think it‚Äôs nice to wear something where the garment is the focus, not the body underneath it.   For example, I have a boiled wool cape/poncho piece I wear a lot because it is SQUARE and the neck is a stiff funnel and the sleevey parts stick out at an angle from my arms and that is what you see when you look at it, this interesting shape. It‚Äôs impossible to tell what my body looks like at all and I find that comfortable and kind of freeing.   I also love wide-leg pants for the same reason. People see the shape of the pants, not the shape of my thighs and butt.   I have a pretty average-looking body and I just have never enjoyed people noticing it (and frankly, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very interesting, nor do I feel more attractive when it‚Äôs clearly visible.) I just don‚Äôt really  *care* if people think my waist isn‚Äôt small enough or my butt isn‚Äôt big enough or whatever. Especially if I think the piece of clothing I‚Äôm wearing is interesting even though it hides my boobs etc. I kind of prefer people to compliment my outfit over how I look in the outfit, idk.	episode_done:False
text:This makes a lot of sense. It reminds me of talking to a friend who sews all her own (very structurally rigorous) clothing. She says that she finds it more exciting to hide her body in interesting ways than to look conventionally attractive.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:There's something between form fitting and loose fitting and it's skimming the body. This looks more like that.   Skim fit can include looser fit items that aren't intended to be overly baggy but aren't intended to be skin tight. u/amelisha is describing this well, but also think about Audrey Hepburn and Jackie O and how their clothes fit them. They weren't skin tight. They were skim tight. Aka as "fitted."  We don't see that as often today with stretch being built into every fabric, and tailoring (beyond hemming) being rare.	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:Took me a while to appreciate that loose != ill fitting and form fitting != well fitting. For example, that jacket accentuates the model's waist, is a good length in the arms, flatters their neck, and has a lot of interesting structural details and textures. The idea for me isn't baggy for bagginess sake, but usually some interesting structure or contrast in tandem with a more fitted piece or the natural outline of my body.	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:I‚Äôve heard a lot of the rule that it helps to balance an oversized piece with a slimmer fitting piece. While the theory is good I think it helps to remember when you‚Äôre balancing, that the slimmer piece does not have to be skin tight. I feel weird and sausagey if I wear legging-tight pants with an oversized top - so I like to think of it as oversize top balanced with straighter, slouchy but not palazzo-wide pants. I think one super tight piece and one super oversize looks a bit dated and I find the in between to be more chic!  Also this is just a personal preference but as a curvy gal I like to show my ankles and wrists and it helps remind me that I am not actually a blob. I love ankle length pants and rolling my blouse sleeves just to show my wrist. I think it makes it look very easygoing and laid back :)	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:There are some clothes that look good when fitted at the right place and good when not fitted at the right place. It's all about the place. A flowly dress looks amazing when the fit is right around the tiniest part of your waist. Meanwhile, a bodycon is fitted all over the body and it really looks trashy in my opinion. And since it's fitted everywhere, you look wider around your waist and basically, you just look like an oversized banana. I am very critical of bodycon kinds of dresses.	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:I also stick with one loose item and a more tighter item to balance it out. I like wearing a blouse with loose sleeves, tucked in a high waist skirt or pant. I do the inverse too, wide leg/loose bottoms, with a tight shirt/blouse. I think I would get overwhelmed if everything was too tight or too loose.	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:I have always preferred dresses and skirts to wearing pants; however, I find that they can make a person look "overdressed" in a more casual setting. If I wear a loose-fitting or oversized dress then I look like I put some effort into my appearance without being too dressed up. I also love oversized/loose-fitting pieces with weird structural details or unique drapes. Sometimes these pieces are not necessarily "flattering" per se but I enjoy them because they are comfortable enough to get shit done in while still looking somewhat interesting. I agree with other commenters, sometimes you want to draw attention to your clothes rather than your body parts.	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:I‚Äôm pear shaped and wear tons of loose fitting blouses/sweaters- I balance them out by wearing skinny cut pants or by doing a French tuck. I prefer a looser silhouette along my midsection to hide and lumps, bulges, etc.	episode_done:True

text:To me a shrug is something you can literally shrug on/off. So often no arms and definitely not something you'd have to pull over your head. Searching for shrugs brings up a lot of evening wear (faux fur type things) and maybe some mini cardigan types that don't button closed.   A bolero would be a jacket or something that's more like a proper item. It closes properly and it's harder to put on/off.

I got an even split of C, D, and E answers with 2 B answers, which wasn't one of the options for the results. I looked over a couple of the closest ones and they didn't seem to fit me at all, so I dunno. Either I'm bad at judging myself or this quiz is a bunch of baloney...	episode_done:True
text:Kibbe System and Body Inclusivity	labels:I've taken this quiz a dozen times in different platforms and my largest gripe is still the same. I'm not white and I'm really not sure where to put myself in this system, especially regarding facial features.   The descriptions say "exotic" or "not too exotic" features. I feel they are referring to more striking features, perhaps something a high fashion runway model may have (exaggerated lip shape, dramatic cheek bones, aquiline nose) but what do I do as an east asian person? My nose and eyes are smaller than the reference photos so I am automatically labeled "delicate"?   The label names are pretentious (flamboyent natural?) but I think there's potential. It could be a fun tool to chat about fashion. It could help people understand themselves better. It can't be worse than our current terminology of fruits and objects. It just needs to be expanded and updated.	episode_done:True
text:Kibbe System and Body Inclusivity	labels:I got to the third question and couldn't answer it. My arms are very long and thin but my legs are short and thick so. That isn't an option I guess lol.  Like most body typing quizzes I think its pretty much BS. This one is just complex BS lol	episode_done:False
text:I felt the same thing! Like none of the answers felt right and all of the resulting body types were very idealized?	labels:They also, frankly, overuse the word flesh.	episode_done:False
text:Yes! Also ‚Äúlush,‚Äù like I‚Äôm not describing myself as ‚Äúlush and fleshy‚Äù ever	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Kibbe System and Body Inclusivity	labels:First of all, the Kibbe system is too dated to work - if you look at the suggestions for clothes to know what they are talking about, they usually involve dated styles. And the types I fell into the most - gamine and theatrical romantic - featured images of women who were heavily styled, whilst writing about those features as if though they hadn't been altered in any way. Didn't help that said women were from the 50's and most of the photos weren't even colored.  It is also sexist, but in a weird way. Like, if you look taller than you are or have long arms and legs with a short torso, then you are automatically 'masculine' - the opposite is also true, that stockier women are considered feminine (?). It's categorization is usually wrong.   I could go into the descriptions of the types I fell into, but I won't - they made me angry in their weird, smotheringly obsessive way, of describing traits, as if though you were a perfect fairy tale character in a book written by an incel.   This all combined with the fact that the people who take these tests are usually clueless about style, means that they will probably end up either confused or use a very limited way of expressing themselves. And so it appears with those who write about Kibbe in the first place - it's the blind leading the blind.   It's like those apple, pear, hourglass, thing yet again. They sound like all of them safe for hourglass, are freaks of nature, whose exaggerated proportion frighten everyone unless they are covered up. Only Kibbe takes the opposite position, where slight variation in how you are built, must be exaggerated hugely, yet again in the name of being harmonious.   It just doesn't work that way - almost nobody has this thing, where their face and body fit together in 'type', or at least I sure as hell don't.	episode_done:False

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items have all been high quality copies of items I have in low quality but wore out the wazoo.  For example, I knew I was ready to invest in some high end Chelsea boots when I found myself going through a cheap pair every year. Or to invest in a nice leather-looking jacket when I found myself grabbing mine 70% of the time I went out.  The expensive items were hard to wear at first, maybe on date nights or to a nicer event, but as I got more used to wearing them I wore them more often. I think it took me a hot year before I wore my Red Wings more than like once a month.   My recommendation is keep the items in your comfort zone (so no wild dresses or Colors at first) and to force yourself to wear it at a regular interval. These days, just wearing nice jeans while I go shopping seems to be my ‚Äúdate night‚Äù when I dress up!	episode_done:False

I‚Äôve had it for 3 years and it isn‚Äôt showing much wear yet.   My advice: get a small wallet on a chain type bag and a larger zip top leather tote.

text:What‚Äôs your everyday purse?	labels:I do a capsule wardrobe and typically keep these purse types out and ready for action, I just swap out which one based on the wardrobe's color scheme so I can spend time with all my bags :)   A black minimalist "hobo bag" for errand running or going to a friend's house. It's split into two sides with several small pockets. Holds a water bottle, my iPad, fidget toys, phone wallet keys or and some reusable grocery bags with room to spare. Could hold a laptop. This is the bag things can get lost in. I could use it for an overnight trip if I really needed to. It's the biggest purse I've owned in a long time, but I'm really loving it.   A mini backpack for bike riding days or hiking with friends. Has a mesh pocket inside and can hold phone wallet keys a sandwich and headphones. Athletic type material. I have this in black, beige and fuschia.   A canvas satchel/messenger bag for doctor's office type visits where I'll have to wait or errands that need less stuff brought along. Has a few compartments and can fit my iPad, kindle or an 8x5 book with phone wallet keys, lotion, probably some makeup if needed. I have this in brown, purple and charcoal because it's such a good bag.   A small black pleather half-moon crossbody with gold accents for quick stuff like the gas station, taking a walk or some type of event where I have to look nice.

text:What‚Äôs your everyday purse?	labels:I don't really have an every day purse as I like to switch purses depending on what I need for the day, what I'm doing, and also to add an additional stylish element to my outfits.   I really like clutches (think Clare V size and shape- preferably with a wrist strap) and have collected probably 30 of them over the years in a variety of colors, textures, patterns. Very simple way to add a touch of something to an outfit. They also travel easily as they essentially pack flat, so you can bring several and use them to change up your simple travel outfits.   But if I'm shopping or doing something where I need to be hands-free, then it's a cross body. I have a few of these but my most often used is the Lo&Sons Waverly. I do like this brand and also have their laptop bag with the interchangeable sleeves. I just noticed they have a new fanny pack style... hmmmmm... gotta check that out! My other favorite cross body, which is a bit more spacious and dressier and can act as a satchel, I think is a Coach but you wouldn't know it (I hate obvious branding).  If I need room for more stuff then I've got a choice between a white leather backpack and a black leather backpack.   I don't really like totes, shoulder bags, or satchels any more. There was a time when I had a lot of those, but these days I prefer a bag that's smaller and not too heavy to carry. Got tired of having shoulder pain or wrist pain, but I'm a grumpy old middle aged woman. Rock it while you can.	episode_done:True

text:Share the outfits you would wear if the world was normal!	labels:I already have my christmas outfit planned out, I want to dress up so bad. I'm liking green, red, yellow and glitter recently, and I want to wear a flowery green top with a short brown pencil leather skirt, tights and black leather Vagabond Dioon shoes (or perhaps some studded black cowboy ankle boots with a sharp tip for some drama would be nice, just have to buy those first). I already have the outfit, but I'm on a weight loss journey (steady throughout the past two months, 5 lbs left to lose) and I need to lose 3 lbs for the skirt not to look awkward with my slight tummy bulge when I'm eating huge meals.  I do, however, wear a lot of interesting clothes just for when I'm out shopping or even having to go to the doctor. I'm doing a lot of experimentation with style now that no people of any importance to me whatsoever are gonna see me, and I can try out shoes with different heels and clothes with different fit, wear it throughout the day, and then know if it works for my lifestyle or not. I realized that a glitter top is see-through in some kinds of lighting, and that the cleavage on my wrap top is getting looser throughout the day, revealing more than I would like, etc. Also buying heel buffers for shoes I have never worn because they give me blisters, and wearing new leather shoes around the house to break them in, etc.	episode_done:True

text:Has consulting a stylist really been a revelation to you?	labels:I had a workshop with a stylist a few years ago. It was really helpful. She taught us about warm and cold colors, about clothes that fit our body types, about different styles and we had this test with warm- and cold-colored fabrics where she told us which colors suited us best. I tried to stick to cold colors (which suit me best) for a while, but then I got bored, and now I wear warm as well.	episode_done:True
text:Has consulting a stylist really been a revelation to you?	labels:A few years ago i was feeling badly about myself following the end of a 4 year relationship. I decided to find a local personal shopper to go through my closet and help me decide what to keep/donate. She also provided me with ways to wear what i already had. From that, she created a list of things she thought i would need to add to my wardrobe according to my lifestyle and wants/needs. We then went to the mall a few days later and she brought in tons of things to try. The rule was that i had to show her everything, but i had the final say as to what i wanted to get. This was great because it also provided me with an opportunity to get more styling tips on items i don‚Äôt currently own but might consider moving forward.  Since then, i have felt so much more confident in how i dress and i constantly receive tons on compliments. I would 10/10 recommend this to anyone who wants to change their style or learn more about what looks best on them. I figured the $400 i spent on her was equivalent to how much money I‚Äôd spend on items i would never actually wear, and in the long run became an investment :).	episode_done:False

text:Has consulting a stylist really been a revelation to you?	labels:I did a consultation recently and a stylist wasn't for me.   I have a particular style that I wanted and she just styled me for general stuff. She was good but I realized I could do the leg work myself since she was buying mostly online.  I just mentally made it a project for myself, told myself there was no budget constraint and it has been working amazingly! I just had to put it in a different perspective. I realized I had a lot of shopping anxiety because of the parameters I put on myself such as clothing has to be on sale. I also have a lot of down time at work to get the project done.  I went from having too few clothing, those which I was very meh to a lot of clothes I can mix and match and love! It's taken me like 2 months but I'm like 80% done. Taking a little longer than I want because Covid is causing lag time. People at work have definitely notice (I work an essential, non public job).  I'm spending a lot less money than budgeted for the stylist to do a wardrobe overhaul. Ive been wanting to do this for many years. My husband and I budgeted $5k to $8k for the stylist and wardrobe. So far I have only spent less than $3k. I'm estimating ill spend $3.5k when I'm done.	episode_done:True

Great question, as we are having snow as we speak! Winter here (inter mountain west US) lasts til April when we might see the ground again, so warm, wind proof and dry are key attributes for clothing for keeping you alive and well. We like Sorel boots with the heavy felt liners for below zero outdoor activities. But since they‚Äôre lighter LLBean insulated boots for snowshoeing and general wear around town . Inside the house  the warmest footwear is Hafflinger felt clogs. Socks we use heavy wool blend Darn Tough. All of these items last a long time so worth the money. Since we‚Äôre both retired we don‚Äôt have to gussy up much so I only need one or two warm  long skirts for church. He likes Duluth work jeans and plaid flannel shirts and always a ball cap on his head. I have a couple of fleece jackets (Columbia) and 2 Orvis cashmere sweaters that were on sale 2 years ago. For me under the sweaters I like 3/4 or short sleeve t-shirts . Neither of us likes turtle neck shirts. Our outdoor coats are: his Columbia and mine Jack Wolfskin both with integrated hood. A surprisingly warm kind of gloves is Kinko work gloves. They come in mittens as well as regular gloves, but need to be waterproofed before shoveling snow. They are very reasonable in price and sturdy. If it‚Äôs below zero and blowing out a nice wool scarf to protect your face. We don‚Äôt need snow pants or long underwear for our daily walks, but probably would for snowshoeing. Let it sn‚ùÑÔ∏èw‚ÄºÔ∏è	episode_done:True

When my first real boyfriend and I broke up (mutual but messy) I put some gifts he gave me in my memory box and didn't touch it for years.

The relationship ended terribly but I liked the piece. I just had it remade. Any good jeweler can do this pretty easily (not always cheaply, though). I turned one necklace into two. The jeweler worked with me, as I came in eith general, vague ideas and they actually drew up plans and designs, which I picked from...It was cathartic in a way.

text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:Haha I definitely run into this same issue! I tend to associate items really strongly with the context in which I got them, and personally feel weird reselling gifts, so donations or trash bin it is for me.   I usually donate jewelry (depending on the piece) to organizations that specifically help people with interview/business-wear or prom outfits. I‚Äôve also donated gifted jewelry or suitcases to women‚Äôs shelters before.	episode_done:False

text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:My taste in jewellery has evolved over the years, and most boyfriend jewellery was small silver things, so I‚Äôve either donated them to op shops, or passed them on to other people.

Probably because I started high school in 2001 and it was like the hey day of bland tackiness and Paris Hilton and I'm too close to it, lived it a little too much, to find any novelty in it. SO vapid. I was slightly vapid and a little mean for a while around that time before I came into myself and I don't like the reminders.

text:Crazy theory here - but has anyone noticed that sometimes stores say the item is now sold out? I‚Äôve done this a few times only to come back and the item is gone. But when I sign out it magically is there. I feel like there are a few retailers that use this as a tactic to not ‚Äúwait too long.‚Äù	labels:The "almost gone! Only two left but three people have it in their cart! Sale ends in 01:03:29" types of messages are in fact just marketing. They're designed to create a sense of urgency and fear of missing out, which then triggers the impulse to buy without further evaluation.   Remember how you used to see furniture stores with "going out of business" sales that never seemed to actually go out of business? It's the same thing: people think they have a limited time to take advantage of a "deal" that might never return and are more likely to buy. That particular problem was so pervasive that U.S. law changed to ban that as a bait and switch/false advertising scam.  There are tons of ways that businesses use psychology to entice consumers. Everything from the color of the walls to the height of a shelf is done with a specific purpose. Same thing applies to websites.

text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:I hope you're not asking this because of rude comments from others - if so, it's worth learning to ignore those people.  That said, I've found lightening up the hairstyling and makeup is quite helpful if you want to look more relaxed.  I also have a personal rule about shoes and skirts: the higher the hemline, the less sexy the shoe. This keeps miniskirts looking relaxed, and prevents longer skirts from skewing frumpy. Obviously rules are meant to be broken, including this one, and it doesn't really apply in the evening.	episode_done:False

text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:The key is actually just learning how to create FABULOUS casual outfits rather than tryin to dull down a dressy outfit. Instead of starting from a place of Dressiness, start with Casual then work on making it the NICEST version of casual possible.    I like to wear jeans and loafers and then some gold earrings, a small scarf, a blazer and maybe a necklace. Where I live even that can be too fancy. So if I see its over the top, I just whip off the scarf and blazer, wipe the lipstick off a little and then I'm looking really cute casual in a t-shirt and jeans.     Overly styled hair and makeup is one thing I notice older women do that "ruins" a casual outfit. The hair is often too stiff and done and the makeup too "nice". So I think having a really pretty, casual go-to hair and makeup routine is important.	episode_done:True
text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:Was doing long distance for a long while and had a ton of "date dresses" (think body-con dresses, LBDs) that really don't really work day to day on their own. Eventually I got sick of them gathering dust so I'd wear them to class with thick long cardigans, and bright coloured tights or slouchy socks/boots. I also sometimes wear dresses as "skirts" by pulling a hoodie or crewneck over it.  I love blazers but like to wear them casually too. So I sometimes wear my fav blazer with jeans/leggings and a concert T to go run errands. Sometimes I top it with a wide-brimmed felt hat.	episode_done:True
text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:I like to add a casual element: sneakers, loafers, oxfords,  jean jacket, moto jacket, hoodie, or chunky cardigan. Shape matters as well, pairing a looser element to the outfit reads as more casual in most cases.  Depending on the jewelry - big jewelry or stones tend to look casual.	episode_done:True

I'm not wearing inappropriate for the situation clothes either. It's more like I'm the only one in heels to dinner because I like them.

text:This sounds crazyyyy! Not you, but people who comment negatively on you looking nice!? Now that you mentioned it, I remember that someone in my social circle does this. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a really fancy dress. Are you going anywhere else after here?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awfully nice looking for just a game night‚Äù. I usually respond to her with ‚ÄúYeah, I like dressing up‚Äù.

But something about being criticized for looking good really messes me up.   I've had a lot of really negative experiences with it. I don't see any of those people anymore but I've heard women talk about other women so much I know I'm being talked about too. And I'm basically friendless now so I've been actively trying to get new friends. I feel like I can't look too good or I'll just be judged as a snobby attention seeking homewrecker and no one will want to be friends with me. And I body build so I've got a less common shape that gets talked about too. I love my body and I'm so proud of it but I don't feel comfortable around people. Everyone just looks at me. I've had people move tables entirely when I've sat down. I end up going alone to a lot of conferences and events and that's a hard blow when I'm just trying to be friendly and I can't fit in.	episode_done:True

text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:I almost solely buy clothing from Poshmark, ThredUP and Depop. I like giving clothes a second life, and a lot of the time, when I find an item I like, the seller has more things so I bundle, save money, and I‚Äôm able to ship it all at once. I haven‚Äôt had many bad experiences with online secondhand sites and I‚Äôve used them for 6 years now.	episode_done:False
text:Yep, I'd say 90% of my stuff is from Poshmark now. I only buy from brands Im familiar with so I know the sizing.  But it has saved me so much money and most of the time the stuff is like new.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:So far, my experience with Poshmark has been good.  I have been able to sell some of my clothes that I no longer wanted and at the same time, I've bought a few nice pieces.  Right now I'm wearing a v-neck Merino wool sweater that I got from Poshmark.	episode_done:True
text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:I buy 90% of my clothes from Poshmark and ThredUp.    Poshmark: has a much larger inventory than ThredUp.  You can communicate with sellers and can often bundle items for discounts and ask for more pictures/measurements.  ThredUp: easier to search for a type of item (e.g. white cotton t-shirt) and save that search, which I find really helpful.  Much easier to find a specific fabric.  For example I love linen and there's no way to find linen clothes on Poshmark besides just searching "linen" and hoping the seller looked at the fabric.  Each item is shown on a mannequin, which is nice but sometimes it's difficult to see the details (hem, pattern, etc.).	episode_done:True
text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:I buy from The RealReal and sometimes Poshmark.   Poshmark has really good prices on some items, especially if I'm looking for something specific and not high-end, like a certain Express top I read about. (Ebay can be useful for this, too.) Prices on higher-end stuff aren't competitive IME, but I haven't looked for much in that range. Also be aware the shipping cost per item will add a good chunk to a cheap piece.  Prices on The RealReal are not cheap, but if you hang out a while you get a sense of what's decent, and sometimes you find something really neat for good deal. The best feature of TRR is measurements, something that's ruined me for other sites at that price point. It helps to be familiar with your own measurements and take into account materials and the shape of your body--I'm short, for example, so measurements are all well and good, but if my hips hit at the waist they don't mean much.   Caveats there: Be attentive to whether or not something is returnable; it's published on each listing. Bags usually aren't, as well as anything whose price has been marked down a lot. Also, shipping costs are $12 each way, so I eat the cost and buy several items in the same order, knowing I'll return half of them if they don't fit right. Shopping there successfully is a bit of a learning process, but I've really liked it overall.	episode_done:True
text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:I like Poshmark. They have a good selection of stuff and you can communicate with the seller.

Every time I see used designer on Poshmark I‚Äôm always worried it‚Äôs fake	episode_done:True
text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:Love poshmark! I got really nice clothes (like a cashmere sweater) for a very good price. If your style veers towards what's on style at the moment, you'll have a harder time finding it/pay a good price. But mine veers towards simple/trendless/hint of vintage-y things so it's perfect for me.	episode_done:True
text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:Poshmark and ebay tend to be my first stops when I'm looking for a specific item.  (People go through things so quickly these days that pre-covid I'd often try on something at a store and find it barely worn on poshmark in my size while I was still in the fitting room.)  I find them much easier to narrow things down to exactly what I want than other sites.    If I have a general idea of what I'm looking for but I'm not looking for a specific item, I also like thredup.  I haven't used curtsey enough to have a real opinion on it, as I prefer desktop but I don't like their website.	episode_done:False
text:This might be a stupid question but I‚Äôve never used eBay to buy clothes. Is there a certain way to do it? Lol I stopped using eBay years ago when I kept getting ripped off üôÑ	labels:Personally I only use ebay when I'm looking for something really specific, usually either an exact item that I know my size in or a specific type of vintage item.  That makes the search function much easier to use.  (You can also set alerts to tell you when something that fits your parameters is posted.)    Check measurements, look at the photos carefully (and make sure they're the seller's photos, not stock photos, with the possible exception of new overstock items), and read the condition description.  Ask questions if you need to.  I don't order anything without measurements unless it's a contemporary item and I already know my size in it.    In terms of getting ripped off, check the seller's feedback.  You want both positive feedback and a lot of feedback.  But ebay's changed a lot since the early days.  I've never not gotten what I thought I was getting.	episode_done:False

text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:For the most part, Poshmark is pretty reliable and the sellers give reasonable discounts and deals for their items. However, when it comes to Depop I would stay away. I‚Äôve caught multiple sellers listing items for triple the price and scamming individuals. It‚Äôs honestly hit or miss with these types of sites.

text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:I once got the tip to put everything in your closet with the open part of your hanger hook facing out. Then, when you wear something, turn that hanger the right side out (i.e. round side of the hook facing out). Set a time period that you want to revisit cleaning your closet (i.e. a season/year etc) and after that time period donate or throw out everything that still has the hook turned in. Similarly, pack all the things you aren't sure if you want to keep into a box and set a time frame. If you find yourself wanting to wear something in that box, take it out. At the end of the time-frame, donate what's still there (especially if you forgot that item existed).  Recently due to COVID, I moved across back the country so I had to fit my closet into suitcases. That involved donating a lot of things that are perfectly nice and wearable but what I had to admit to myself that 1)I actually never wore in the 3 years I lived there and 2) didn't miss in the few months that I was living without them (I was living out of a carry on when I got unexpectedly stuck back home).

text:Yep, this. I used to hesitate to donate "perfectly good" clothes (ones that weren't ill-fitted, out of fashion, or ill-suited for my lifestyle) because I was so afraid I'd regret it - like one day I'd find the "perfect outfit combination" for that item.   I've learned that 99% of the time, you won't even remember what you donated after a few weeks. But also... yeah, there are a few items I regret giving away. It happens, and it's okay: you'll have a day or two of "ah damn, I should have kept that", and then you move on. It's better to just make the decision to donate and feel less anxious about your wardrobe size overall.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:Konmari only worked a little for me, as I find joy having clothes to meet any occasion including weight going up or down. Also clothes are more like a hobby and also sentimental so doing them first never made sense to me.   What's worked best over the years is more of a "container" strategy. Let's take your socks for an example. I allot only so much room for socks in one section of a drawer. Those socks with holes are going right out, I don't have room for them and I'm not making room for holey socks. I would take the cue that these socks were so well loved they got holes, so I am fine with finding a similar replacement, then tossing the holey socks to make room for a similar pair I know I'm going to love and wear a lot.   Work stuff and COVID is so much more difficult. Pre-COVID I traveled a lot for work so needed to pretty much maintain a 4-season all weather occasion work wardrobe for all cultural possibilities and their nuances. That's long been 80% of my wardrobe.   But now here we are. And everything's been turned on its head, and that 80% wardrobe is just gathering dust, while the 20% is getting worn 80% of the time. Who am I kidding... more like 100% of the time!  But I'm not ready to declutter my work wear because when we have a vaccine and we're back to normal work schedules, it would be too costly to replace all of it. Especially if somewhere along the line I was laid off.  So for now I've basically SCRUNCHED all my work wardrobe into the smallest possible footprint to make more room for the stuff I'm actually wearing. And re-shuffled so the stuff I'm actually wearing is front and center and the other items are harder to access.   The cool thing is WFH means you can do laundry more often, so no, you do not need a month's worth of loungewear, tees, leggings. You just don't.	episode_done:True

text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:The last time I did a big closet cleanse, I made a list of reminders in BIG sharpie letters that I hung on my mirror in front of where my face would be. So, instead of looking at myself and judging myself and fantasizing about who I could be in those clothes... I saw my list and the clothes below it. It made things much easier from an emotional standpoint.  My list went something like this:  * You can only wear one pair of pants at a time. (Which applies to all garments but I like the groundedness of pants as the representative of all clothes.)  * You are a stylish and fashionable person no matter what you wear.  * You would rather have the money.  * You enjoy spending time on maintenance, but that does not include organizing your storage!  If I did this exercise again today, I would also include:  * If you don't want to wear it right now, you probably will never want to wear it. (Speaking to emotional reaction to clothes, not situational factors like working from home, etc.)  * If you don't want to mend it or alter it, that might be because you don't actually want to wear it.	episode_done:True

text:Yup. For the longest time I had black frames because they go with anything. Once I worked at an optical shop I got to play around a bit and try on different frame styles. Also got some tips given my prescription and face shape. I had 3 pairs that I rotated with, 2 round and one squarish-round (?) for a more professional look. And none of them were black. It was also the time I got the most compliments regarding my frames.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I typically wear contacts, and glasses when my eyes need a break. As you can surmise, the pandemic means a lot more glasses time. A couple of years ago I thought about how my glasses were much more boring than my outfits. So I started to mix in more fun and colorful frames. It also helped that my eyes have hardly changed over the last few years. So I started getting fun colors. I had a brown pair with neon trim as the first "weird" pair. Then a wood grain, which was the neutral, then a bright blue pair, and later yellow metal frames. Now a pink and black pair is leading....I can't seem to find the yellow! I am not sure what I'll get for this year.   Anyway for me, I realized I needed statement glasses to go with my love of pattern! I still mostly stick to solids and either cat eye or narrow rectangle shapes, but I find attention attracting glasses are a nice exclamation point on an outfit.	episode_done:True

text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I have at least 20 frames.  Some of them are no longer my prescription but I don‚Äôt want to get rid of them. I buy them from zenni but also wherelight and some other places. They are most definitely an accessory because sometimes I need them to stand out more or less depending on my outfit.   My eye doctor has me wearing progressive lenses now so the price has gone up significantly on my everyday glasses so I don‚Äôt have the same selection I used to. However, I can see just as well out of my $60 zennis as I can out of my $400 frames from the eye doctor.	episode_done:True
text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:Yes, absolutely. My glasses are an important part of my style because I have to wear them all day every day. I only have one pair, they suit me really well and they're very much part of my look~	episode_done:True
text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I haven't been able to buy any glasses online yet. Glasses feel like too much of a serious purchase to leave in my amateur hands. Also, if I already overthink which earrings to wear to work everyday, imagine if I had to pick out glasses too??? That being said, I wear the same glasses everyday for 2-3 years until I can't stand the sight of them and then go buy something totally different, then repeat. I try out different shapes and styles (I've had square hipster, cat's eye, tortoiseshell, thick arms, and currently big nearly-clear peachy ones which are my favourite because they show off my eye makeup and are less in-your-face. What I refuse to wear are colourful glasses, because I know I'll get sick of those quirky red frames super quickly!) People get so freaked out when I show up to work with a different hairstyle...can you imagine how many irritating comments I'd have to deal with if I switched up my glasses every day? "Something's different about you today..." "Did you get new glasses?" Etc. For my own personal sanity, I could never!   Anyway, if you're feeling in the mood for a switch up, I say go for it! These are something you wear everyday so you should love them!	episode_done:True
text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I‚Äôve got the basic frames that I wear most days, one black and one light colored pair. and a few fun/brightly colored once that I wear when they match my outfit etc zenni is so much cheaper than going to my regular eye dr that I‚Äôve got 7 pairs now.

text:Does anyone else hate literally everything they put on?	labels:What i wear in my private life i know suits me and even if it doesn't flatter me according to fashion "rules", it makes me feel invincible and powerful.  What i wear to work is just temporary cloth to cover my body.  I have basically no emotional attachment to any of it, and i know it is actively unflattering.  However, showing up at my science job in full goth/pagan gear would be....frowned upon.  So i have 2 separate wardrobes and rarely shall the twain meet.

text:Seconding this. After years of experimenting, I‚Äôve finally landed on a style that feels right to me and have a curated closet full of beautiful things I love, but I‚Äôm not wearing any of that right now. I mostly wear sweats and pajamas because I can‚Äôt bring myself to slip into a fabulous dress to bake bread or scrub my bathroom .... which are the sort of things I get dressed for right now.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:I moved back home earlier this year and as a result had a much reduced storage situation. I sorted my clothes into three categories,wear,don‚Äôt wear often (or at all) and doesn‚Äôt fit.  I donated the truly ill fitting items and my sister picked out some items she liked.  The last category I put in a drawer and wore each one throughout a month and noted what I was drawn to and what I liked especially the items I had purchased for ‚Äòfantasy me‚Äô.   Mixing them with familiar clothing helped make them more accessible and actually a usable part of my wardrobe.   Essentially I now feel like I have a new wardrobe. Plus the notes I made meant I know what I actually like to wear more and therefore purchase in the future and what should definitely stay a fantasy item that I only like on IG or something.	episode_done:True
text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:I slipped into the "easy casual lounge wear" early on in the shut down where I live. I almost immediately left crappy and sad. I realized for me, in a world where I have no control over anything, I do have control over what I wear. Even though I have been working from home, and have no where to go, I get dressed...every day.   After a while I realized that, no one sees me except maybe a waist up video call once a day, so why not wear things that I was excited about? Who cares if anyone else likes it. I have always been drawn to vintage pieces and even had a few in my closet. I rarely wore them because they didn't fit the classic business casual that was expected in my office. I wore those pieces almost every day. Then I started a Pinterest board with really specific criteria, earth tones (looks good with my skin tone), vintage cuts, texture, natural fibers. Boom. For the first time in my 30yrs I had a style that I loved!   I kept the few items I already had and loved, and slowly started collecting others that would match or compliment them. I went the thrifting route because 1. its cheaper, and 2. I could find good quality pieces in natural fibers more easily than if I had gone to the mall. I would visit a thrift store once every two weeks and get one or two items, always reminding myself of my criteria (natural fibres, classic/vintage cuts, earth tones). It narrowed down what I looked for and bought which made it easier.  Now, two months later, I have a cute little capsule wardrobe, and I LOVE every piece.  I guess that was a really long winded way to say, wear what you want and what inspires you in the morning. Especially now when no one is around to judge you while you are just "trying things out".	episode_done:True

text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:Do you know Daria Andronescu? She has a youtube channel and a blog that deals with what you are experiencing. A while ago she published a template that allows you to calculate how many outifts you need based on what you do every week. Say you work from home, exercise at home and you only go out twice per week - this means you need much more comfortable clothes than "going out clothes". Based on that, and seeing what your life looks like for an entire season you can adjust your wardrobe accordingly. If you like a romantic/feminine style, you can still have it by picking loungewear that suits that style, that way you are more truthful to yourself and don't have to only wear hoodies. I think if you don't experiment with it you will never now.  I have a very feminine style I hated wearing hoodies around the house because they are not very fitted and make me feel sloppy and unproductive. I now wear tight but comfortable loungewear that is similar to what I would go for in my pre-covid life and I feel much more like myself.	episode_done:True
text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:I struggle with what I like vs what looks good on me.

I use trunk club now and it‚Äôs been amazing for picking out things that look good on me with safe picks and ‚Äújust try it‚Äù picks. It‚Äôs helped me find what looks good on me so i have an easier time shopping and figuring out my style.	episode_done:True
text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:Maybe start off from experimenting within the casual chic and sport chix styles?

Take it step by step and take your time	episode_done:True
text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:I feel the same. My idealized self wears much more tailored and polished clothing (I really love Dearly Bethanys style). The reality is that I work as a social worker for former foster youth where I prefer to look relatable and not overly polished or ‚Äúadult.‚Äù Ive definitely gotten comments from my clients that my style is ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù or ‚Äúunique.‚Äù I live in a very rural and small community so fashion isn‚Äôt the highest priority here. I wear jeans and solid colored tee shirts, blouses or sweaters. I think I experiment with silhouettes to an extent- purchasing different denim styles like cropped wide leg, straight leg, mom jeans, etc. and shoes: I have a few pairs of mules, Veja sneakers, Nisolo boots... so things that are understated but I think still look more polished. I can‚Äôt really go too crazy with my footwear and outfits though...for example, last week I was in a home and an unrecognizable bug crawled up (and fell out) my pant leg. Sometimes that places I go into are not very clean and I just don‚Äôt know what I may be stepping in. I don‚Äôt really have any suggestions. Just wanted to say I relate. I‚Äôve almost quit buying clothes for my fantasy wardrobe - but sometimes an item just catches my eye and I can‚Äôt pass it up even if I don‚Äôt have many places to wear it.	episode_done:True
text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:Comfort is what will convince me to stick with something.  Dresses and comfy cardigans, flats, and ALL PANTS ARE STRETCHY - whether it's skinny or wide leg.  Also I have a lot of cute sweaters/sweatshirts because I lowkey go braless when wearing them.  Went crazy on walmart camis so I could wear them under button downs and also go braless.  Got a bunch of portofino/express button downs because the fabric is flexible, they are very wrinkle proof, and it's comfy.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys who like a formal/business look manage to not look the same all the time?	labels:Accessories?  I guess switching it up with statement necklaces or earrings.  And shoes, having some really powerful statement shoes can go a long way to draw attention away from the fact that it's the same blouse you always wear.  But I also subscribe to the capsule wardrobe theory, so in general I'm not particularly bothered about wearing the same 10 outfits because I set myself up for that on purpose.	episode_done:False

text:Tips for feeling confident when wearing stylish clothes around family?	labels:Ease into it slowly. Start with a few blouses that are more your new style preference, and wear them with jeans/leggings. It'll instantly add a bit of polish without looking too different. In the cool weather now, sweater dresses are sexy and stylish but also not too far off from a hoodie. long sweeping cardigans over sleeveless blouses/tops and leggings means that you can probably wear that same top when it gets warmer without the outer layer and people will already be used to it.     Also, Chances are there will still be days you want to wear that super comfy soft hoodie so keep some of your favs (take it from someone who found themselves owning zero sweat pants at the beginning of quarantine and had to walk live around in "dressy" pants for a few weeks). But also, there's nothing quite as comfy as a baggy hoodie on the weekend or if you just want to run out to do a quick errand without getting fully dressed up.	episode_done:True

text:Tucking in shirts	labels:I switched to tucking in my shirts a couple years ago and I've never looked back! What really helped me was to  1) Be strict about only tucking shirts in to high-waisted pants. That way, it shows off my waist, rather than my food baby from lunch. I was tempted to cheat with mid-rise jeans at first, but have felt so much better about myself since I stopped.  2) After you tuck your shirt in, raise your arms above your head to create a slight blousy look-- not being skin tight helps get rid of any insecurities.  Hope that helps! Oversize men's shirts tucked into high-waisted shorts are pretty much my uniform, so I never miss an opportunity to evangelize üòÑ	episode_done:False

Give it a try, maybe just for one day, to see how you feel, and if you like it you don‚Äôt have to do it again! But I bet it looks cute in addition to being comfy :)	episode_done:True
text:Tucking in shirts	labels:Belts! If you‚Äôre worried about your booty showing, a belt will help. Also hides the waistband. I vote just going for it tho!

text:Tucking in shirts	labels:When I was younger I probably thought it was too dorky. These days I care less and I also realize that it helps me look more proportional by visually shortening my torso and lengthening my legs, so I'd much rather do that. In many cases it's more flattering for me (and maybe for you) because it cinches in my waist a little. I'm short, so it can be tricky to look proportional.  For button-down shirts I normally tuck the front, like a french tuck. Tucking it in all around is usually too formal for me.	episode_done:True

I like how I look with makeup and my hair done so who cares if there's nobody there to appreciate it.   Now I'm back working a "regular" job in the lower 48.  I'm a pharmacist so I still have to go into work.  The only thing that's really changed is that I wear a headband with buttons on the side to save my ears.

I started an Ootd instagram I've hidden from all my family and friends to kind of... Keep track of what I'm actually wearing? Also my weight fluctuates A LOT. (Summer hiking and lots of walks, winter were snowed in....) So picking clothing now that changes with my weight and still feels... Pretty.

text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:Pretty much all my shoes are either black or white.

text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ?

I don‚Äôt own any bold colour shoes, but if I did and were to say wear a red shoe, I might try to wear something else red in my outfit to tie it in, like a shirt or a bag.

text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:My wardrobe is fairly neutral, I tend to wear mostly white blacks and greys so I love a good statement shoe for some more personality.   I have a pair of bright turquoise patterened mules which I wear with a neutral outfit. I also have a bright red/orange pair of heels which tie in perfectly with a pair of formal paperbag trousers which have the same colour running through. Personally I like to bring in colour from one accessory - whether that's a scarf, bag, shoe, or jewellery.  I like to play with juxtaposition and so if I wear a very feminine outfit I like to pair it with some tougher shoes like Doc martens.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:I try to think about my outfit as a balance beam. There has to be equal parts light and dark (unless it‚Äôs a special or formal event). If I wear a monotone outfit, I go with a contrasting or neutral color to support. if I‚Äôm wearing black slacks, I try to wear a top with pops of color in it. Then, I chose my shoes based on the color and complexity of the top. For casual wear I apply the same rule, but also take into consideration the style of bottom I‚Äôm wearing (I.e skinny jeans, yoga pants, boot cut, etc) and where I‚Äôm heading in the outfit. For example, a pair of yogas and a t could go with vans slip ons OR a pair of trainers. If I‚Äôm heading to grab lunch, I‚Äôll wear vans. If I‚Äôm heading to the store, I‚Äôm more likely to put on the trainers.	episode_done:True

text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ?

I have these burgundy/ purplish timberlands that will go great with the forest green coat I'm planning to buy (for example)   I'm not a fan of neutrals and black so my advice may be a bit niche!	episode_done:True
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:Love this question! After I‚Äôve determined my outfit, sometimes I have shoes already in mind if I want a specific silhouette, but if not I think about a purse and shoe combo to fit based on if I need to carry things or if I‚Äôll be walking a bit. Most of my shoes, purses, and belts are either cognac brown leather (my weakness) or black leather, and in the styles I wear most like oxfords I like to have a version in each color leather.  Now that I think about it, the only color among my footwear is a pair of red pumps. Even my more casual shoes like Supergas are tan or white. I‚Äôd love to add more color to my footwear but I opt for quality first, which is more expensive, which makes me more likely to choose a color thats versatile (like cognac brown, which is again, my absolute weakness).	episode_done:True
text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:The problematic sexism aside, I appreciate that she shared her experiences.   The fact (to her) that women were her harshest critics is quite sad and also a very contemporary issue.   Her unabashed enjoyment of men is something that, at the time, was still quite taboo and I applaud that she makes no bones about it.

text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:This is a place for discussion, so.. In my opinion, true womanhood is not tied to certain behaviors. What would those behaviors be, do you mean? How can you behave in a way that makes you less of a woman?  Being womanly isn't tied to wanting to doll up for men. Are you also saying that women that don't feel like they have to doll up in front of 10000 marines are lesser women because of it?   In my opinion, all of this is based on sexist views that once again, men are the true judges of what's sexy, what's a true woman, and what a woman should dress like and act like in order to be a real woman. You say this, but with different words, when you describe how men appreciate something that's more true than what women appreciate.  Can't we just appreciate fashion and clothes without having to *be* something?   Marilyn Monroe grew up in a man's world. 2020 is *supposed* to be 50/50.	episode_done:False

text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:Interesting article, definitely put Marilyn Monroe in a different light for me.  I think her point in the second paragraph about the need for a distinct relationship between the body and clothing is worth further discussion. Recently I have noticed that some of the more interesting pieces on the runway for me are the ones that move with the body or play on the different silhouettes/proportions of the model so it does seem like there‚Äôs some merit in atleast this point of her response though I don‚Äôt know if this is what she intended.  I don‚Äôt know if I currently incorporate this concept into my own wardrobe though, maybe subconsciously but I‚Äôm not sure how I would go intentionally thinking about it	episode_done:False
text:It‚Äôs so important to take into mind silhouettes and proportions.   Now that I‚Äôve gained weight bc of quarantine, a lot of things that i use to be able to wear when I had a thigh gap, no longer look good on me. Skinnies make my legs look like tree trunks now, and straight legs look more like slim legs. I wear exclusively very straight (almost wide) leg ‚Äúboy‚Äù jeans now and it makes my waist look smaller and balances out my top and bottom.   TLDR: I use to be more ruler prior to quarantine but I‚Äôm definitely a pear now and I have to be very careful that what I wear doesn‚Äôt make me look fatter.	labels:This reply made me sad. The idea that you have excluded an entire silhouette because of a recent body trend is depressing. I have never had a thigh gap nor will ever likely have one at a healthy weight. Your legs are not tree trunks, you do not need to hide them. They are carrying you through a very tumultuous and difficult period of life right now which is worth more than how slim they are. If you love straight fits now that is wonderful, but please don‚Äôt feel that you are now excluded from skinnies because of an Instagram trend.	episode_done:False
text:It definitely made me depressed for a while because I was unconsciously expecting to look like the models in the pictures... but once the clothes got here I never did.

It‚Äôs kind of sad in a way when you think about it.	episode_done:False
text:I think Marilyn was very conscious of what she was doing here. She carried a folksy persona, deliberately catering to working men and women, and had that "What do you mean by suspecting I'm dressing sexy by wearing dresses so tight they have to be sewn on, I can't help that I'm CURVY! It is those who think it's on purpose that are truly lewd!!"-vibe all the way through.   Basically, she tried to be as sexy as possible, but because that wasn't really allowed due to misogyny, she tried and mostly succeeded to pass it off as pure innocence.

Both sides feel like they‚Äôre rebelling against the other, when for the most part people tend to participate in both. Both being, dressing for oneself and an audience that appreciates style without finding it sexually appealing and then the other side of dressing in part to be found sexually appealing by the group that you wish to attract. I agree that a lot of similar feelings towards what is considered ‚Äúflattering‚Äù come up a lot here and it‚Äôs uncomfortable to try to get to the root of why that is.

text:I think Marilyn was very conscious of what she was doing here.

It is those who think it's on purpose that are truly lewd!!"-vibe all the way through.   Basically, she tried to be as sexy as possible, but because that wasn't really allowed due to misogyny, she tried and mostly succeeded to pass it off as pure innocence. Here she is saying "I just want to please you guys, it's only natural - why do you judge me for being feminine? Men like feminine women bla bla" in an attempt to make the media be less judgmental about her livelihood.

It doesn‚Äôt take a lot of brains to make it to the top like MM did, plenty of other pretty girls have done it before and after her. What takes brains is staying at the top and still staying relevant.	episode_done:False
text:I think we'll have to agree to disagree. My memory is hazy on this, but I think she did try to start a company of her own or something, because she was so spiteful of how the studio controlled her. She tried to get better deals, because she was at times the actress who made the studio the most money, but was paid very little in relation to that. And she was incredibly passive-aggressive in meeting the studio's demands. You may be right that she handled it in a very naive and not very business-savvy way - but I definitely remember that she did fight for her rights a lot, but was met with resistance time and time again, from people who were more powerful than her. So maybe you're right that she was dumb, but she wasn't passive or unaware.   I think most women who do "cool girl" in real life are definitely very often misgoynist in some way. However, actresses today have to play the same game, and I think they do know. Like how almost every single actress who is interviewed on the matter of body image and dieting, claims to eat fries and pizza and stuff and is just so Naturally Skinny, and therefore not like those Other Girls.   Famous women have to meet strict standards, but they have to pretend that they do so completely by accident. Otherwise, they are punished for being attention seeking or self absorbed. Women should be admired as beautiful objects, but they can't ever try to achieve that on their own - that would be too active, direct, greedy. They have to be completely passive. Approval is something to be granted by others, though no effort of their own.	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True

I recommend you try it too, get comfortable with yourself first and wearing it, even just around the house, and then slowly expose your new style to everyone around you and wearing it in the different environments (?) like wearing jeans and heels to the pub or out shopping/running errands	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:I don't think it's strange to feel that way! I tend to have a very eclectic style and enjoy trying out new unique/vintage charity shop finds, and this is something I've always struggled a little with.  This is one of these things where it just depends on whether you fit the occasion practically. For example, if you turn up to play a rugby game in stilettos, or go out into a snowstorm with just a cardigan, that's not a good idea. But is there any *practical* reason why you can't dress up a little more for drinks with friends?  With looks I'm less confidwnt on, I tend to go for practice runs first - that usually means just wearing it to the supermarket or to run errands where I'm not likely to see anyone I know, so I didn't have to worry about people's preconceptions. Sometimes I just try them on in my room and have a little dance party to some funky music, and that's still a way of getting used to seeing yourself in something!  There's always going to be someone who makes a comment about how you're 'very dressed up', or similar. These comments aren't usually even meant to be rude, but they often play into the little outfit insecurities that you already have! But the best part about this is that these kinds of comments get old pretty fast.  For every person who thinks you aren't standing out in a good way, there's going to be 10 people who admire your style and wished they could be as brave, even if they probably don't vocalise it. I can think of countless times where I saw an outfit I liked on a friend or stranger, but didn't actually say anything about it!	episode_done:True

Being ‚Äúoverdressed‚Äù is an absolute myth people have created to hate on other people who are doing what makes them feel great.  2. I‚Äôm currently going through this transition myself. What‚Äôs helped me is really just trying things on that I like but may not necessarily be in my comfort zone and pairing it with someone familiar. So maybe I wear a fancy, feminine top and pair it with some boyfriend jeans (something I wear every day) to help balance it out!	episode_done:True
text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:I think part of it is just being able to push through that feeling of embarrassment. One of the ways I've got over that in past is to wear something truly ridiculous out and about. It's embarrassing, but it's also very freeing. When I was in high school I wore my mom's wedding dress to class one day - and I think after handling a situation like that I realized that being a big weirdo is very freeing. After doing that, I'd be hard pressed to feel self-conscious about just wearing a regular dress, or heels, or whatever. In comparison those sorts of things become quite tame.   It is empowering to detach from that feeling of self-consciousness and recognize that everyone feels that way. And if you are able to relinquish yourself from that self-consciousness, you have a certain type of power and courage that a lot of people around you do not have. It's empowering to make choices that satisfy yourself, and then to stand up for those choices in front of other people.   You can be in charge of your own narrative. Maybe you're not over-dressed, maybe everyone else is under-dressed. Maybe people make comments - but at least that means that you are interesting enough to notice. Or it gives you a chance to be honest, and really connect with people - there's nothing stopping you from saying, "Yeah, I really want to have a different style and I'm trying to get over the hurdle of changing it!" Because that's something that a lot of people would understand and find relatable.   Convincing yourself is just a matter of internalizing these things.	episode_done:True
text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:I typically just start by wearing them to places like the grocery store first. By my logic, there have been several times where I have worn a cocktail dress and heels there just to pick something up and have not given myself a second thought about doing so, so why should a bright shoe, or another item of clothing I am self conscious about be any different? Likewise, I have also seen many people at the grocery store in some cool items, and will not be thinking about it for more than 5 seconds.   After that if I still wasn‚Äôt completely confident I would probably try to wear it to a small gathering with family or close friends.   I also just try to keep in mind that nobody cares about what I am wearing as much as I do. Honestly, most people are too obsessed with thinking about themselves and if others are noticing their insecurities to spend more than a few seconds, if that, on a stranger. As long as you like your item, be confident in it and others will notice your confidence much more than the item.	episode_done:True
text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:1. Don't think of compliments as criticism. There are a few bad bananas out there who will actually try to bring you down, but for the most part, people ask "Why are you dressed like that?" simply to make conversation (and it's really a compliment -- you look nice!).   2. Treat yourself like a friend. If a friend told you she wanted to change up her style but was nervous about getting comments, would you encourage her or tell her she's being weird? You'd encourage her! So stop discouraging yourself.	episode_done:True
text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:The beauty with fashion is that there are so many middle grounds! To venture out of your comfort zone, some ideas are:  - Wear kitten heels or pretty pumps instead of boots. Practically speaking, they'll also be more comfy than stilettos  - Try to incorporate one item of pattern or bold colour which you like into your wardrobe. Plan ahead and style it in different ways with your existing wardrobe, according to different  circumstances (e.g. casual lunch, work day, nice dinner out), and wear it when you get the chance  - Stop thinking too much about what others think and try to identify what looks and things you like instead.   - I prefer to dress for the occasion (e.g. it'd be silly to wear a little black dress with heels if I'm going for a countryside visit), but you can still look nice doing so for whatever event! In the countryside example, I would dig out some nice cable knit jumper paired with jeans, my Barbour and a lovely woollen scarf, plus chunky boots. Equally I could style that with a cute skirt instead of jeans if there's less climbing over stiles and more visits to village pubs and quaint coffee shops. (Not that there's any chance to do the above anytime soon. #bloodyCovid)	episode_done:True
text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:It can be hard.

Style-wise, you can pick between a work from home box or a work from office box, and you set separate top and bottom sizes. The items are non-returnable. (Can you tell I‚Äôm tempted? just wary of duplicates of what I already have, plus just bought some things elsewhere.) If anyone gets one please post - interested to know what you get. Not sure if this deal is just for the holiday season or what...  Old deal (ended Mon. Nov. 23): is doing a ‚Äúchoose what you give, up to 30%‚Äù where you can either take the discount or have that amount donated to charity. Cool idea.  Edit: Updated with new deal, kept note for old deal	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you search for and find clothes from pinterest?	labels:I think it just comes down to learning the vocab. You might search "pleated miniskirt" for the skirt, or "dark green tennis skirt," I think your problem might be that you're running into different types of pleated skirts. And for the top maybe "bib front blouse", "peter pan collar blouse", "tuxedo blouse" depending on which of those elements appeals to you (I'm not 100% sure what the blouse is though).	episode_done:True

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:It would depend on the skill and machinery of the sewist - I have definitely made clothes that I like and will likely keep wearing, but they‚Äôre not the most structurally beautiful garments and are not the same quality craftsmanship you‚Äôd get from a higher end brand. Part of it is equipment - I don‚Äôt have a serger which is used a lot in clothing making - and part of it is I‚Äôm not that concerned about the seams on the inside of a garment that only I will ever wear. That being said, if I had taken the time to do proper seams, there is no reason those garments wouldn‚Äôt last just as long as higher end garments.	episode_done:False
text:For sewn pieces the investment in equipment needed to approach commercial operations is feasible for an individual, but in knitwear or complicated embroidery there's just no competition. 3D and digital looms are $$$$ and what a consumer pays for good yarn is a multiple of a large operation.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:All the woollens that my mother made for us at home are still surviving 25 years of use. I think the self knit stuff is just made with better quality things  (might be a function of $), and they survive thousands of machine wash.  Same thing with cotton stuff I picked up. Survived 15 years and still going strong.	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:Many store-bought knits are made from cheap, synthetic blends that tend to pill faster. Manufacturers sometimes take short cuts and will simply cut pieces from knitted fabric whereas a handknitted item is knit to a particular shape with increases and decreases worked into the design. With mass production, knitted pieces that are sewn together will be more likely to have imperfections, like the arm seam and side seam not meeting up. There are details in hand knits that are too expensive to replicate on a mass-produced scale so you're probably less likely to see knits with intricate details.  For sewing, I tend to choose quality fabrics because I hate cheap synthetics and like my points for knitting, they can age poorly. I've seen RTW items with crooked stripes, missed stitching on binding, inconsistent sizing, etc. These are things that a sewist will likely take the time to avoid or correct.   Finer details are disappearing from a lot of RTW we see because it's too expensive or time-consuming, like blind hems, lining, etc. We're seeing more elastic waists, offset sleeves, stretchy fabrics, S/M/L sizes instead of numbered sizes and other details that make the fit more forgiving so it fits more customers. Something like those retro dresses with fitted bodices made from a woven fabric are rare for RTW because the fit would be so finicky. The majority of wedding dresses are strapless because it's a pain to have fitted sleeves, especially in a non-stretch fabric. You're able to satisfy a much wider customer base by eliminating details like those. If you sew your clothes, you can choose to do something with a more particular fit.	episode_done:True

text:Not to mention the quality of the fabric used. I sew and consider myself an average sewist. If I take the time and have a good pattern and quality fabric I feel my clothes are pretty decent. Probably not equal to very high end, but because I can adjust fit very early in the process they can look better than fast fashion with fit issues.  That being said not everything I make turns out like I hoped it would. But I have several items of clothing that I have been wearing for years and I will wear until they wear out because they fit, are completely my style, and I love them.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:My handknit sweaters look great and have lasted much longer than my store bought sweaters. They are typically made from better materials ( i.e. natural vs. acrylic yarn) and I do tend to baby them because they took me so long to produce, which may be a big part of it.	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:My husband sews and has hand-stitched several garments that he wears nearly daily. They are holding up fine, some of them after years. He doesn't do anything special to care for them, he throws them in the washer and dries them in the drier on warm. His interest is mainly in historical recreation, and as he points out, laundering clothes used to consist of beating the fuck out of them with a paddle. Our modern washers are *way* more gentle.	episode_done:False

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:I have a diploma in fashion design and worked in the industry off and on for 15 years, and have been a hobby knitter for about 20 years, I would say creating something that looks store bought takes far fewer hours of practice, and there's far less to know with knitting.  Knitting is just so much more rudimentary.  Once you learn the basic stitches and get a decent tension, you are pretty much on your way, if you are patient and can follow basic instructions like a recipe, you'll make something good.  Be thorough, swatch and block, and buy good yarn.  I think one if the biggest issues I see with home sewists is incorrect fabric choice, it makes a very big difference in a finished product, and is usually my first tip that something is homemade.  Notions are another big one, good quality, professional looking notions are a lot harder to find in retail stores.  Stitch choices, stitch quality, proper cutting, finishing methods are also all big giveaways that make stuff look unprofessional, and unless you have industrial machines and tools, some of that is out of your control.  But with enough practice you can get some pretty decent homemade products in a lot of clothing categories.  Stuff like jeans, leather, fur, swimwear, I think are always best left to professionals with specialized tools.  Reading up on fabrics and practicing high end finishing techniques is a good start.	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:Absolutely in terms of knitting, there's no reason why a knit wouldn't last just as long and be better quality. I can source local wool, hand dyed, etc., and that would be very hard to find in retail. I don't sew but I assume it would be the same, using all the proper techniques.	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:I knit but do not sew. My hand knit garments are, in my opinion, much nicer than anything I buy. I can customize the pattern to fit me perfectly and I use very high-quality materials. That said, I am also kinder to my hand knit garments than to my store bought ones. I was them by hand and only when needed. This could also be a factor.	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:I am a sewist with just over 1 year if experience, and my handmade clothes are without a doubt better quality than fast fashion store bought, comparable or better than mid-range (ie I always fully line things, I use French seams or bias bound seams and hand picked zippers rather than overlocker seam finishes as you get in almost all store bought clothes) and I wouldn't know about high end because I don't shop anywhere that fancy. The difference for me is I now spend the money on high quality fabric - organic cotton, 100% sandwashed linen, hemp and bull denim, tencel and lyocell blends etc. Often even mid to higher end clothes are not made with the highest quality natural fibers and it really makes a difference in wear and tear. I also use good quality thread which makes a big difference. Because I only sew for myself, I can take as long as I want doing beautiful seam finishes, fitting garments correctly, and more. My home sewn clothes get worn daily and I have to admit its really ruined shopping for me, even op shopping, because now my standards for fit, fabric and finish are quite high. I'm in no way a professional, simply someone who loves to sew and feels she deserves the clothes of her dreams. I do treat my clothing kindly though - I wash less, hang dry and repair or repurpose what I can.	episode_done:True

text:Somebody else loosing so much time to choose the right item to buy when looking for something? I feel it cost me more in time when I try to buy responsibly.	labels:Yup exactly. It's a combination of getting the item you want, made with the right ethics, and for the right price. I try for all three and manage about a third of the time (second hand item from an ethical producer that looks right and fits). For other things I give up on one, i.e. raincoat that fits the first two categories but is new and therefore ¬£¬£¬£, or underwear that doesn't fit great but is ethical and moderately priced.      On the plus side, in theory they'll last longer than an item made to a lower standard, so less time spent buying in the long run.     You don't need to be in love with the item for it to be the right one though. It's nice when that's the case, but for many things lowering the bar a bit to functional+ethical is probably more achievable.	episode_done:True
text:Somebody else loosing so much time to choose the right item to buy when looking for something? I feel it cost me more in time when I try to buy responsibly.	labels:A while back I was watching a YouTube video that mentioned the best way to learn about something is to make all of your passive entertainment geared towards that thing.  It was specifically talking about designer fashion, but I think it's something that can be applied to any kind of fashion.  Personally, I'm more of a shop local/thrift sort of person, but if I were to go out of my way to find a specific product, it would take a lot less time on my part because I follow people with a similar outlook.  The Youtubers I watch are concerned about buying ethically/in an environmentally conscious way.  Most people I follow on Instagram are about my height/size.  When I'm watching TV I'll open up Depop and to my lists when something catches my eye.  About half the work is done for me, and when I need something, I spend a lot less time actively searching.  I started a wardrobe overhaul last year so I do get how sometimes it can feel like you'll never find exactly what you're looking for, but maybe finding some people doing the same can help.	episode_done:True

text:Somebody else loosing so much time to choose the right item to buy when looking for something? I feel it cost me more in time when I try to buy responsibly.	labels:For me, it's not time-consuming. This might be because in a shopping year, I'm shopping at least one season ahead. I also pop into thrift shops regularly for 5-10 mins at a time with a strict list. The list doesn't just include clothes, so my successful trips tend to be high. I don't thrift shop online. The one time I took the risk, I regretted it. It's way more expensive and it's risky so I don't bother with it.	episode_done:True

I look to all kinds of designers I‚Äôd never afford or wear for inspiration. Heck, I get excited just to see what the mom on schitts creek wears.

text:Somebody else loosing so much time to choose the right item to buy when looking for something? I feel it cost me more in time when I try to buy responsibly.	labels:I feel the same way! I can be super picky when it comes to clothes. I know exactly what I want and what would look good on me but it's hard to find both in stores with a limited selection but it's also hard in the endless sea of clothes that is Poshmark/ThreadUp.   Sometimes online shopping makes it easier to filter things out but other times it makes things harder and not being able to try it on is a huge downside. I have so many things from Poshmark that I've just donated because I didn't like the fabric or the fit.   What don't you love about the clothes out there you're seeing right now?

I've found having a go to list of brands I've purchased from before is a good way to narrow down a search. For one-off more specialist purchases, I start looking early and just accept it's going to take a while before I buy what I need.	episode_done:False

text:yea, Im pretty sad they are so long. I am not into the crop look for winter but when I was looking at details I just saw regular and assumed they would be around 28 inches( didnt see the 30.5 inch measurment online at the time). As someone that's 5'5 I didnt expect a regular length to be to long. Im not sure if I want to pay the 8 dollar return fee again though to go for the crops since I'm having a hard time getting past other fit issues  I might try the rebel pants instead as its stated they are meant for curvier types. I do not like the fitted look though, I prefer the straight leg, I just think they bunch because they are to long	labels:Eh I think that it‚Äôs great piece for fall/winter bc you can wear big sweaters to hide the other fit issues. By the time summer comes, you definitely won‚Äôt be wearing them. But if it‚Äôs only $8 for something you might like better and actually wear, then I would bite the bullet. Better than these sitting in your closet and never wearing them, or taking a loss and selling them.	episode_done:True

text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:I really like short skirts ... autumnal and wintery tones like navy blue, burgundy, sienna, and dark green are favourites of mine. I like flared/skater/pleated skirts. **Fleece lined tights** are your friend here!! They keep you warm and covered. I absolutely despise long skirts though, so that's just me. Also, especially with a short skirt, don't underestimate the power of footwear when making or breaking an outfit.	episode_done:True
text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:Layers layers layers. I live in Canada and our winters get nasty. Long skirts are a must if you want to wear one. Any exposed skin is dangerous and will immediately make you lose warmth very quickly. Wools are fantastic in the winter. They naturally wick away dampness and hold in heat even if wet. Silks are next because they are similar, but they don't breath as well or hold in warmth as well. Avoid cottons like the plague. If they get wet they will sap heat away from you and this can be fatal. I avoid polyester whenever possible unless maybe as a waterproof outer layer. Leathers are a great outerlayer that is generally water resistant.  If I am going to be outside for a length of time in a skirt I wear merino wool leggings from icebreaker if it's cold enough under the skirt. You can also wear another skirt under the first one, or a third, go nuts. Also add boots that make it to around the end of the skirt, or a pair of socks over the tights to extend the coverage. Don't forget your toes, fingers and head. You can bundle up as much as possible but if you forget those you basically undid everything. Your core is much warmer than your extremities.  Also, don't make the layers too tight. You keep warm so long as the air around your body is warm, so you need loose ish styles to seal in not just you, but warm air.  This being said.

They are a little long on me.  I'm 5'4.  I also like the Mara ankle ones also from DL 1961 and The Mari high rise(almost the same name, very confusing) from AG.  I also just bought Jen7 by Seven --a straight ankle length & I really like them.  I buy most of my jeans at Nordstrom Rack or Bloomingdales on Sale.  I don't believe in every paying full price but I really think getting a good deal on premium denim is worth it!  Hope that helps!	episode_done:True
text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:My hair is bright purple now, and has been blue.  I do adjust what I wear with it- reds or oranges can look overwhelming- but still dress pretty brightly! I stick to cool colors + neutrals (white, black, grey) so nothing clashes overmuch with the hair, and try not to wear the *exact* shade of purple as a shirt or dress (then I look like a crayon).  Wearing just black and white tends to glam me up a bit, at which point the hair acts as a bold accessory.	episode_done:True

text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:My hair was a bright blue/purple for a while, and I definitely had to alter my wardrobe to accommodate it. The colors I'd been used to wearing clashed badly with my hair, so I shifted my wardrobe toward colors that suited it. I didn't necessarily plan my outfits to match it, but I wanted to be sure that nothing I wore clashed. When I eventually went back to my natural color, I had to once again get rid of some wardrobe pieces and replace them!	episode_done:True
text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:I've been pretty much every colour of the rainbow, hair wise.  Currently I'm rocking my natural colour (brunette) with fluorescent pink tips.  I typically wear a wardrobe of black/grey/white, so my many hair colours never really clashed.  These days, I've opened up myself to a few new colours (green and burgundy mostly), and I like the contrast they give with my tips.

text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:Not actually a crazy color, but I dyed my hair a natural-looking red for a while. But burgundy looked weird with it, so I dyed it back blonde because burgundy is my favorite color to wear.	episode_done:True

And people never ever shut up about how it was a selfish, childish 'fuck you' but never stop to think that it was THEIR project to do whatever they fuck they wanted with. People don't respect artistic and non-traditional business endeavors so they will never understand the issue with handing it over to someone else or compromising on the voice or vision of the project.

text:(Man) Repeller: A postmortem	labels:I started following manrepeller around when it started - it was around when I graduated college and fashion blogs were still big. I always liked Leandra' styling, and later the style pieces on manrepeller. it never bothered me that they often showed clothes that were expensive - I mean, have you ever read a fashion magazine? you expect that in well-curated fashion content people will be wearing things that you yourself can't afford. it's inspirational, not a how-to.  Anyway, I felt like the lifestyle content they were trying to expand to more and more was their weakest point. We expect our fashion magazines to show us $900 items, we don't necessarily want to see models flaunting generational wealth and writing a 1,000-word thinkpiece about it. And the more they pushed lifestyle pieces and less fashion, I worried that they wouldn't last too much longer.  But also, maybe Leandra's time just came? It's rare for a blog or website to stay trendy for 10-ish years. MR started as a sort of hipster-gossip girl hybrid and I feel like that era is just over. I think the events of 2020 made MR's demise faster, but it was probably coming.	episode_done:True

text:I think this is a bit of a disingenuous reading. Leandra voluntarily stepped back because her statements about Black Lives Matter in June were so off the mark, and the accusations of racism and her role in perpetuating an unsafe and unfair environment for POC employees spiraled from there. I don't know about the gossip, but to pull the plug without giving her employees the time to actually demonstrate their new vision, or even make preparations for being on the job market during a pandemic--maybe it's the behavior of a typical investor/owner, but it's not the "humble, always learning/growing" persona she has been putting out since the summer. I am a little tired of people getting away with cruel capitalist bullshit just because they are women. That's the whole "girlboss" conundrum and I'm glad it's dying out. I was excited to see what the staff did to turn the site around, but they weren't even given the chance. And this isn't corroborated, but if you tell your employees on Sunday the site is closing and less than a week later they get their severance and that's it, it seems to me like that is at least a potential indication of reactive, irrational and last minute decision making, if not a "tantrum."	labels:Yeah ngl, I am so completely disinterested in any form of feminism that's more aggrieved about one very wealthy woman being criticized with vaguely gendered language than it is about a whole bunch of financially precarious women on her staff having their livelihoods upended without warning in the middle of a pandemic winter. Who-owns-what-and-has-the-legal-right-to-lay-off-whom doesn't really factor into my moral reasoning either. If that makes me a crackpot, well, so are the people who actually wear these outfits in real life.	episode_done:False

text:Do you think that designer brands will no longer be as sought after in the future?	labels:Someone has to buy the designer firsthand for the secondhand market to have its inventory (and the brand itself to have cachet).

It‚Äôs easy to say that designer brands will no longer be as sought after in the future because of the current trend of buying secondhand, but, there are millions out there who are not doing that, and who are buying firsthand. Even buying designer secondhand is still making it desirable, so, no, I don‚Äôt think it will. I think that the sought after designers may change, but, I think designer items are always going to be super desirable.  Edit: a word.	episode_done:True
text:Do you think that designer brands will no longer be as sought after in the future?	labels:No. Like Borowitz said someone has to buy designer items in order for it to end up on the secondhand market.   There will always be a market for designer/luxury rtw, handbags, shoes & accessories as long as rich & wealthy people exist. The luxury market is not trying to appeal to everyone; they don't have to work hard to do so. I think that's reflected in FFA being repulsed by logos while not really being aware that for the most part LV, Balenciaga, & Gucci have been focusing on Asian markets and it worked.	episode_done:True
text:Do you think that designer brands will no longer be as sought after in the future?	labels:I don't get the logic.  Why would people be buying secondhand designer clothing if they didn't want designer clothing?  The pop in secondhand designer does not just *happen* to coincide with multiple major economic recessions and historically low relative wages for working class people.  At the same time we're in the shadow of a fast fashion industry that deliberately produces 'affordable' clothing of an extremely poor quality.  So, for a lot of us, the only way we can obtain good quality clothing is to buy it second-hand.  As for online platforms, I believe those only contribute to the popularity of designer clothing.  Since people can no longer handle clothing in person before we purchase it, we are even more reliant on brand reputation for a clue as to what the garment's quality might be.	episode_done:True

text:What‚Äôs your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:I‚Äôm from Minnesota and I can relate to the winter fashion struggle lol. I‚Äôm a huge bargain hunter because I‚Äôm on that college student budget but I find winter outerwear to be one area where you mostly get what you pay for, although there are deals to be had. Layers are your best friend.  A pair of straight leg or mom jeans will probably leave you enough space to wear a pair of fleece lined leggings underneath to keep you toasty. Wool or cashmere sweaters in tight knits as opposed to more open weaves, with a tight long sleeve tshirt or long underwear shirt underneath. Riding boots with enough calf space to wear long wool socks underneath if you prefer skinny jeans/pants or dresses/skirts. I thrift a lot of this stuff or buy it at outlet stores (Nordstrom Rack, Marshall‚Äôs, etc).  A high-quality wool coat in a neutral color is definitely a worthwhile investment if you don‚Äôt like the look of down parkas. I got mine from a local outlet for $80 (90% off!) and it stands up really well to cold weather. I have a really good sized collection of winter accessories (hats, gloves, etc.) and I buy some cheap stuff in trendy colors/styles from Marshall‚Äôs once a year. I‚Äôm keeping an eye out for some faux leather gloves in a fun color for this year! That said, I think decent quality leather/faux leather gloves lined with a wool or cashmere blend and a hat and scarf in wool or cashmere are also good to have. They definitely keep me warmer than the cheap stuff. I have good luck at Sierra Trading Post (same company as Marshall‚Äôs/TJMaxx but focused on outdoorsy stuff) for that kind of thing.	episode_done:True
text:What‚Äôs your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:Layering is essential! I swear by Uniqlo heattech as a base layer and then wool/cashmere sweaters. They aren't super bulky but keep you warm. Then a sleek wool coat (such as in camel, black, or grey) can make an outfit look put together along with a nice pair of boots (over the knee or knee high) and statement scarf!	episode_done:False
text:agreed! uniqlo heat tech is the move!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What‚Äôs your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:Mine is flannel so I might not be much help lol  But on a serious note - thin undershirts that are not cotton t shirts for when you don‚Äôt want to do the bulky layers thing. I have a silk weight ‚Äúcapilene‚Äù patagonia one for when it‚Äôs really super cold and I‚Äôll be outside and some similar ones that tbh were army issued, so I‚Äôm sure you could find the same sort of thing without going to patagonia levels of expense. It‚Äôs kinda shocking how much warmth you get from them.   If I‚Äôm not anticipating being outdoors much, I‚Äôve got an assortment of cuddlduds, thin modal tees off Amazon, and some bamboo ones. If I want to wear a lighter more fashionable blouse or thinner sweater or something I can put a layer underneath and still be warm without making my shirt too tight (and they are thinner/more snug/less spongy, as well as warmer, than a tee).  Edit - fixed and autocorrect that got by me	episode_done:True
text:What‚Äôs your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:I found a wool midi skirt for $10 at a thrift store, and I *love* it. I feel fancy in it with an off the shoulder cashmere sweater, or comfy if I tuck a t-shirt into it. I also love Oxford heels in place of booties for a daintier look. Black tights, especially ones with subtle polka dot or other whimsical patterns, bring rompers and shorter skirts into the season. I also splurged a bit on a tailored tweed winter coat that makes me feel very put together and feminine.  I wear fleece leggings under everything; other leggings, jeans, skirts, bodysuit, doesn't matter.	episode_done:True
text:What‚Äôs your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:Wool tights.   A good backpack that fits over your jacket or some other convenient bag that works well with your jacket open or closed. The bags I use the rest of the year usually end up being awkward during winter.   Substantial belts to cinch bulky dresses or long sweaters.   Slim-fitting turtlenecks. The right bra makes all the difference if you think turtlenecks don't work for you.	episode_done:True
text:What‚Äôs your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:Lace trimmed camisoles under V neck sweaters, warm tights, and realizing that if you arent using public transportation you arent usually outside and trying to look cute for more than 5 minutes at a time. I stopped doing a lot of layering and just got a couple of coats for the various weather to put over things I like to wear inside. Being sweaty inside your coat is the worst.   Dressing to wait for the bus/train is a different story.	episode_done:False

text:What‚Äôs your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:A couple crew neck sweaters in neutral colours I can jazz up with a fashionable scarf. That way if it's warm, I can take the scarf off. Under them I wear tank tops.  I match up my warm scarf with my jackets. I have 2 wool coats which help but if it's below -20C I like to wear my ski jacket(s).  I prefer earmuffs to toques because of my hair and I have a black pair, a brown pair, a white pair and a pair that goes great with my favourite ski jacket.  I have 3 styles of winter boots:   \-low, very fashionable (leather and fake fur) and good long term until about -10C .. these I am likely to wear to go to the mall or whatnot   \-tall, very fashionable (wool) and good long term until about -10C .. these I wear rarely even though I love them, they're a pain because they make my legs really warm indoors but my feet get too cold outdoors   \-mid rise, mildly fashionable and good till -35C .. these are my everyday boots, running errands, off to work, shoveling snow etc  Fleece-lined tights for more a more casual look.  If I'm going to be able to stow my stuff and it's really cold (like -30C or colder) I'll wear fleece pants over my nice pants and take them off at my destination.	episode_done:True

text:Edit: I happened to go to a local Goodwill shortly after I posted this, and picked up a full length camel hair and cashmere coat for $6!!!  My best deal yet! I also picked up a beautiful and soft black wool cable knit turtleneck, and a green plaid wool skirt. Total came to $11 for the three.   One tip... I go early in the season for cashmere. Wool lasts fall to spring, and there‚Äôs generally not a lot of competition.  Most thrift stores don‚Äôt spend time reading the micro labels for fabric content (but they do the brand) so it‚Äôs quite easy to get a high quality but lesser known brand of cashmere for the same cost as acrylic.   If you run your hand lightly down the row, you‚Äôll start to learn to ‚Äòread‚Äô the better fabrics by weight and thread count... it‚Äôs like Braille for me. I can tell silk from satin because natural fibers are slightly cooler than man made fabrics etc. Same with wool vs. acrylic, and leather vs vinyl. I run my hand down the rack and let the fabric and the temperature tell me what‚Äôs there. It‚Äôs even easier now with fast fashion because the thread count makes them a fraction of the weight of property made clothes, and they don‚Äôt have the same feel.

I‚Äôve found some really nice Eileen Fisher wool sweaters, cardigans, even a merino jersey dress on ebay and EF Renew that are in superb condition and I know will last.

text:Sock It To Me: Novelty Sock Appreciation Post	labels:My mom loved kooky socks! They always make me think of her. I love them aesthetically, but actually don't really enjoy wearing socks, so I only kept one pair of hers after she died. They're lime green with pink flamingos, and she bought them to wear while officiating my roller derby games (non-skating officials are affectionately called flamingos because they used to mostly wear pink.)  I also bought a pair while I was mourning immediately after her death. My husband made me go "hiking" at garden of the gods in Colorado springs and we stopped at a gift shop by one of the trailheads. They had these blue socks with sloths holding donuts with pink sprinkles. I fucking love sloths and pink sprinkle donuts and they're exactly the kind of thing she would have bought for me.  I have a few pairs of socks she gave me: baller sloths with gold chains. Otters holding hands. Sushi and sashimi. Silver glitter balloon animals. Some extremely tall ones covered in beer glasses.  I don't really like things touching my lower legs unless they're really soft or smooth. I guess the skin on my shins is super sensitive. So I mostly only wear ankle socks that don't really show, but I always make sure to buy cool ones. My favorites right now are pale pink with rhinos that say Party Animal. The rhino's horn is a party hat.	episode_done:True

text:WEEKLY DEALZ	labels:Re: Black Friday, I personally like having as much time as possible so I can research the item and sit on it before deciding to buy.

text:I also think the discounts will be big this year but don't retailers often sell lower quality products for Black Friday?	labels:Sometimes, but only for certain items and merchants (e.g., Levi‚Äôs sold at Walmart vs. Levi‚Äôs.com). It‚Äôs more common to see inflated MSRPs to think you‚Äôre getting a good deal. If everyone knew retailers sold inferior products during BF, no one would shop then. That said, outlets and factory stores do sell lower quality items year round that were made specifically for them.   Stock photos that change right before sales can be another indicator that they‚Äôre selling a different version of the same item. All the more reason to have extra time to research your purchases.	episode_done:False
text:I did not know this, so this is great advice. Are there more examples of retailers who do this?	labels:Electronics like TVs, computers, and appliances are known to have inferior BF counterparts. Cosmetics too, especially if they're sold in holiday kits. Not sure about clothing though; the Levi's were just an example I made up. I think it's more common among mass market/fast fashion retailers who have high turnover and can push out tons of product in a short amount of time. Think H&M, Forever 21, etc.  A good rule of thumb is that if it's too good to be true, it probably is. If you have to shop at all, go with stores that have generous return policies so you're not stuck with unwearable crap. A quick Google search pulls up lots of guides about what to avoid on BF, so that's a good place to start.	episode_done:False
text:Nordstrom's anniversary sale is notorious for this - most of the clothes and shoes they sell special for the sale are lower quality than they would be otherwise.	labels:That‚Äôs a bummer, seeing as I purchased quite a few things during this year‚Äôs sale. Is it just their in-house brands or does it extend to other name brands too?   I bought some Nike tights that were discounted more than I‚Äôve ever seen anywhere (including Nike‚Äôs website) so I suspect it‚Äôs the latter. They don‚Äôt feel too different than the ones I already own in other colors, but perhaps longevity will tell a different story.	episode_done:False
text:I think most of the lower quality items are the items made for Nordstrom, like their Madewell items made exclusively for Nordstrom. If your Nike leggings are the same leggings sold by Nike on their website and feel similar to the ones you own then they're probably fine.	labels:Cool, thanks for the heads up. I try to buy directly from the brand whenever possible, but it‚Äôs easy to miss when a good deal is distracting.	episode_done:True
text:People who work in the fashion industry - what do you wear?	labels:I worked as a household assistant for a fashion designer and I agree- most her team (and the household staff) wore neutrals and very understated outfits. We all put more detail into making sure that everything looked nice (was clean, ironed, no pet hair, rolled or tucked in) and a lot of my co-workers would have pieces tailored- especially things like pants to ensure that they looked put together.	episode_done:True
text:People who work in the fashion industry - what do you wear?	labels:I work in the fashion industry, but within the tech org of a fashion retailer, which tends to be more casual than the rest of the company.   That being said, for being on the west coast (PNW), our tech org dresses much better when compared to the large tech companies in our area. Worth noting that with COVID and working from home, most people I work with are wearing solely athleisure now.   My role has to interact with our buyers and merchants quite a bit, so before COVID I tended to dress in smart-casual attire (think loafers, slacks, and a sweater ‚Äî or nice jeans, a blazer to dress it up, and some booties).  Our merch org dresses all over the spectrum of ‚Äúalways fashionable‚Äù ‚Äî where the lower employees tend to lean more casual and trendy, high-street fashion with maybe a few designer splashes, while upper management tends to wear a more business-formal designer wardrobe (think St. John style). Designer or not, people who work in the Merch org always seem to own their look and create a signature with it.	episode_done:True
text:People who work in the fashion industry - what do you wear?	labels:Like previous commenters stated, good understated neutrals with clean lines will go a long way to keep you looking polished!

I'm also working in Toronto, albeit as a production seamstress and studio assistant to a designer right now. I probably have some idea of which factory you might be working at! Since I'm carrying bolts of fabric up stairs, Laying out and cutting markers, as well as working with machinery I just keep it to simple skirts/dresses/turtlenecks that allow for ease of movement. I'm assuming you will be doing a lot of running around and trying to ensure everything's on schedule and things are organized so I would say comfort comes first. Maybe you can keep dressier shoes at your desk so you can wear sneakers while on the factory floor and change out of them if you have to meet clients. My friends who work in corporate offices for Toe Flesh and Canadian Water Fowl are able to get more dressed up because there's less risk of ruining your clothes at the office.	episode_done:True

text:What designer bags and eras do you think will come back in fashion 2021-2022?	labels:In terms of fashion, I think colors and maximalism will come back, after an entire decade of minimalism.   I was watching Twin Peaks, and what amazed me about the 80s 90s fashion in that show is the vibrancy of colors and patterns. We are already immersed in 80s and 90s revival now, esp in terms of oversized and dramatic fits, and I think gradually crazier colors and patterns will become more mainstream.   Bags - I suppose the more dramatic the better, and we are already seeing crazy shapes and colors now. Celine might start with crazier designs as well, with Slimane at its helm.	episode_done:False
text:I think so too. The mom-jeans on trend is often more 80s then 90s. And I've seen shoulder pads, and shoulder "wings" comming in.  I hope for a V silhouette.

Small shoulder bags, Prada Nylon, the Fendi Baguette and the Dior Saddle won‚Äòt be going anywhere.

I had a dress covered in stars, did my hair up in an elaborate crown studded with crystal stars and moons, black knee-high boots, and -for the most dramatic "look" - I sewed three sets of blue and white string lights into a black cloak so that I wore a cape of stars. Also I covered myself in glitter! The battery pack made dancing difficult but it was so worth it haha. The party had a woodland-gods-and-mystical-creatures theme so there's a picture of me at some point sitting on a massive throne and it's probably the most regal I've ever felt in my life	episode_done:True

I only had to shop for the last two, buying a white necktie for Old Gregg and yellow shorts and shirt for Jake (because yellow is the ONE color I never wear).   I was looking forward to this Halloween for the last few years because it would finally be on a Saturday...

I also switch around based on quality, fit, and price.   I have a question, though... Your username is BlueWaistcoat. Do you actually have a blue waist coat? Is it a blazer or like a track jacket? How do you manage workwear? No job I've ever had would have allowed me to go to work in Adidas every day. Well, maybe one employer, but I don't think it would have conveyed the right level of professionalism. And what do you wear for special occasions, like weddings and funerals?  Is there a line of Adidas that I am overlooking? I am only familiar with their athletic and athleisure clothing.	episode_done:False
text:Hahaha so many questions ü§£ such few answers haha   I don't own a blue waistcoat but I have a tattoo of my cat wearing a blue waistcoat riding a bicycle like an English gentleman... So that's where my username comes from.  I did get in trouble with work when I first started wearing tracksuits to work... So I dug deeper into the employee handbook and found that they have a stupid policy whereby joggers aren't allowed but leggings are üôÑ so I just wear Adidas leggings with an Adidas hoodie/sweatshirt/t-shirt to work.  Although I've been working from home since March, and hopefully I'll never have to go back into the office and I can comfortably live the rest of my days wearing joggers.  I hate social gatherings, and have only ever attended one wedding in my entire life. I even missed my brother's wedding earlier this year. I've never attended a funeral, but if it comes to it then I have an all black Adidas tracksuit ready to go.  So yeah... I don't think wearing all Adidas would work for everyone.

text:How do you like that app?  I was considering it, but it seemed like a pretty sizable time commitment up front. Does it help you with new ideas?	labels:I really like it! 100 percent recommend.  You are correct in that it does take a lot of time. It took me a couple of days to take pictures (or find them online) and upload everything I owned. However I tracked everything including my belts, scarves etc so if you just want to do major pieces (dresses, pants, shirts, shoes) it will probably take less time. I also make sure I catalog new things as soon as I get them so I don't fall behind.  It has been very worth it! It even has a really cool feature that mixes up random outfits from your stuff and I have found a few combos I would never have thought of from that.

If your clothes will hold up to the ravages of time   I come from a family of hoarders. I have some hoarding tendencies of my own which I'm dealing with. I'm also in the midst of cleaning out my mum's home after she died almost 2 years ago. I go over every weekend and spend a few hours clearing out her stuff. I've been doing this for going on 18 months. I've spent hundreds of dollars trucking stuff to the dump. I learned the hard way that it's not worth holding onto stuff, *just in case*.  My mother held onto every piece of baby clothing and toddler and children's and a lot of teen clothing I wore. And all of her clothes. And all of my grandmother's clothes. And all of my brothers and sisters and father's clothes. And some of her sister's stuff, too. And you know what it looks like now? Most of it has disintegrated, some chewed up by mice, others damaged by moths, and a lot damaged by mold. Anything that hasn't been destroyed by time has gone to charity. I love my mother, and I have memories from my mother, I don't need her moth-eaten, moldy, brittle leather jacket from 50 years ago. And neither do your kids. Give your stuff away to charity to people who need it now, and don't leave behind boxes of crap for your kids to have to deal with after you're dead. Cleaning out my mother's home is teaching me to be a minimalist.    Put money aside, and use it to buy things your child actually wants. And donate your unwanted clothes to charity to people who need it now.   e: don't even get me started on toys, old school work, books, records, VHS tapes...    e: This is coming from a 41 year old who never had kids (even though she always thought she would).	episode_done:False

text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:My Mum saved some of her clothing for me. I really cherish the pieces she gave me. My favourite is a black velvet dress she wore a lot in her mid twenties. She also saved some of my nicest baby clothes, so I could use them with my future daughters.  Almost all the items that she saved were high quality velvet, lace and silk. They also were in solid colors.   In most instances it was items she didn't fit in anymore but had an emotional attachment to, so they stayed in the back of her closet until I hit my late teens. She made most of the items, a couple were purchased, and some were made for her. Since she has a talent for sewing and repair, all the items were kept in top condition. She didn't give me all the pieces at once. She would offer to lend me a dress for an event, and I'd try it on. Then she would tell me the story behind it, and say it was mine if I wanted it.   I have wool coats and leather jackets that I'm using currently, but will put away for future generations when they don't fit anymore or I change up my style. After an unfortunate pen in the laundry mishap I've also considered purchasing doubles of items I really enjoy. If something happens I'll have a spare. If nothing does I'll have a vintage-with-tags gift for future children ‚ò∫Ô∏è purchasing items specifically for future generations seems a bit high pressure though..  My Mum also saved shoes and boots for me but our shoe size is different so that didn't work out unfortunately.   My husband (at 30yo) is saving some clothes he felt he had grown out of for any future sons we may have. It's stored in the attic.   Solid pieces in quality materials that are cared for and stored properly are likely to be received well. I'm thankful my Mum saved her best clothing over the years for me. Obviously saving every ragged Walmart t shirt is going to become a case of hoarding like other posters mentioned. But if it's a reasonable amount of high quality pieces and you have storage space then why not? It's family heirlooms and history.	episode_done:True
text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:I'm in a similar situation as yourself. The way I think of it,  I save the clothes that I absolutely love in a small box. That way, regardless of if I have kids or not, I will have a curated box of my favorite pieces that I can look back on in time and think, "wow, I'm so happy I saved this." It's a little tedious, seeing as you will be hauling around a box for years, but if you take the approach of a museum curator, the old pieces can resemble pictures in a photo album, as opposed to clothing to be worn.	episode_done:False
text:I do this too! I have a two small storage boxes I call ‚Äúthe archives‚Äù filled with pieces I wouldn‚Äôt wear now but remain special to me. Everything from a striped Ella Moss dress like Carrie wore on Sex and the City to a pair of vintage corduroy bell bottoms my dad wore in his youth I had altered back in the day. I had a boy first and it still didn‚Äôt change my personal preference of wanting to hold onto a few memorable pieces at all. Maybe someone someday will love them but ten/fifteen years later there are pieces in there I‚Äôm super glad to have hung on to.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:My mom did save her wedding dress like "oh you or your sister can wear it when you get married!"  Now that I'm getting married in the next two years she took me aside and was like "that dress is fugly if you wear it you will look terrible, pls do not".  So, probably never.	episode_done:False

text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:I‚Äôve never considered this.   I love fashion and I have A LOT of clothing. I also routinely sell my clothes on Poshmark when they no longer ‚Äúbring me joy‚Äù. So aside from a number of my favourite pieces and basics, my wardrobe is always changing. My mom was quite interested in fashion as well, and she routinely tells me my thrift store finds look like pieces she owned in the 90‚Äôs. We moved across the country when I was young so holding on to them wasn‚Äôt really an option. I do have some pieces I don‚Äôt ever plan on selling and just holding on to as a time capsule or memory; a few political/ charity sweaters, my first Chanel earrings, the Marc Jacobs sneakers I spent 6 years looking for, a pair of bell bottoms from the 70‚Äôs with Coca Cola logos all over them.... I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever have kids or if they‚Äôll be interested in fashion but i can imagine myself as an old lady going through a box of my old favourite things and reminiscing.	episode_done:True
text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:My mum actually kept MY clothes which I now dress my daughters in. My 4yo is obsessed with my early 90s party dress, poofy sleeves, lace trim and everything. The grandmas at the shop go nuts for it, haha. I will probably keep one or two of their special items for their kids.    Kids love to dress up and its a way of passing something down, minus the preasure to actually wear and enjoy it as an adult.	episode_done:True
text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:I have a few higher end bags and unique jewelry but unless I get a timeless piece like a higher end leather jacket or a Burberry trench I don‚Äôt think I would hold onto it.

text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:In the Before Times I would host one or two per year--I would make a facebook event and invite maybe 20 people (and just text friends who didn't have social media) and I'd usually get around 10 folks that showed up. I usually served mimosas and encouraged people to bring hors d'oeuvres so that it was also a little brunch gathering too. Some of the pieces I got from those have given me the most mileage over the years, and often they're items I never would have thought to look for!   I don't know if I'd do the digital ones, feels more like thrifting given the shipping cost and these days I prefer to buy secondhand via poshmark and whatnot since I am better able to find exactly what I'm looking for. Personally I'd be comfortable right now with an in person swap that takes place entirely outside (with mask required to use the bathroom) with a very small group of people I know, but I don't want to put pressure to do that on anyone else so I've just donated my clean-out clothes. Plus half the fun is trying something on and having your friends help you decide to keep it or leave it, and I don't know how I'd make that work outdoors. God I miss pre-2020...	episode_done:False

text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:I‚Äôm using swopped (UK version of Swap Society) and it‚Äôs good if you can‚Äôt sell your clothing or you don‚Äôt want to donate to charity (as it may end up in land fill). The items you send in gets assessed to see whether it‚Äôs in fit condition to swap. I‚Äôve tried to do direct swapping on Depop but it‚Äôs hard to just find people who have similar tastes to your style or just the imbalance value of clothing offered. It‚Äôs a great way to get new clothes if you don‚Äôt want to spend money neither.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:I actually went to a swap last weekend! We did it outside in a yard.  The host had hung up clothes lines between a bunch of trees and when we arrived, we put our stuff on the lines.  That way everything could be displayed, but we could also wander around while maintaining some distance.  Where I'm from, at the end of the swap, the host donates the left over clothes to a women's shelter.  I've gotten some hits and misses from swaps, but overall it's fun.   It helps if the host invites people who are similar sizes or makes sure to invite lots of people with a variety of body types so no one is really left out.	episode_done:False
text:I really like that outdoor format.  Did you bring anything home?	labels:Yeah! A Hawaiian shirt, pajama bottoms, a hat with a marmot on it, a fleece, a t shirt from the arizona sonoran desert museum, and an REI shirt for my man.  It wasn't a very "high fashion" swap haha	episode_done:False
text:Nice!  With the exception of the Eileen Fisher sweater my scores haven't been high end either but several have been workhorses.   I remember I got 2 pairs of pretty decent skinny jeans, a workout tank, an olive H&M blouse that was work appropriate when I needed more, and a pair of black cropped pajama pants covered in tacky martini glasses that I adore.  I also got some guitar tab books and several novels, and a work mug.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:Pre-Covid, I went to several clothing swaps hosted by a friend of a friend. The clothing swap would be at a bar in the area, you could get drinks (friend of friend is a bar tender) and go through the clothing on the tables. You could choose to drop off clothes and take nothing, you could choose to give away nothing and take stuff and anything else in-between. Most people came with stuff and left with different items. Everything left over at the end of the night was donated.   I LOVED going to these swaps. I got so many awesome things and it was a great way to give away things that I was no longer interested in wearing.	episode_done:False
text:I've been to usually smaller swaps where everyone had to bring something to take, and bigger swaps where you you didnt have to.  I'm usually almost more grateful for the opportunity to get rid of stuff constructively than I am for taking stuff, though the taking is the fun part.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:I used to do clothing swaps in college and in the first years post-college when lots of my friends lived nearby. We always had tons of fun! We were all roughly similar sizes but many different heights, styles, and budgets. Whatever wasn‚Äôt claimed at the end of the party was donated. It was always exciting when something fit someone else better than the original owner. I still have several pieces from those swaps.   Now that we‚Äôve scattered across the country, I haven‚Äôt done a big swap in a while but when I‚Äôm cleaning out my closet, I do occasionally set aside an item or two that I know a friend would love or look great in. I know a few things have even been handed down to friends of friends - especially a lot of first office job clothes I bought at H&M that have made their way through 3 or 4 people now.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:Since I‚Äôm in college, pre-pandemic I would go to swaps put on by the sierra club or the fashion magazine.

I think it would have been more difficult for people outside of straight sizes though.	episode_done:True

text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:I have participated in one.  It was a long time ago but I remember it being super helpful.  There were clothes for everyone there, not just women, so I stocked up on mostly kids' clothes.  I did, however, bring home a fantastic vintage houndstooth wool dress coat that I still wear.  It's one of my favorite pieces in my wardrobe.    I would love to do another one but right now doesn't feel very safe for something like that.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:I went to a swap earlier this year and it was great! They would divide clothes between high street (eg. H&M, Zara etc.) and high end (designer, high quality vintage) and each garment awarded you a token for the category it was sorted in. I paid ¬£5 entry and came away with a Temperley skirt with a boat print that I am planning on getting tailored (waist is a smidge too big).  ETA. This was organised by a sewing cooperative so was more formal than just having friends over.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style grown/changed since before quarantine?	labels:I have been able to really hone in on my style! It‚Äôs not that it has changed, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve been able to buy things that are more in-line with it. Actually, the trends this year of ruffles, bows and puffy peeves are my actual style, so, I‚Äôm advantage of having all of my favorite things being readily accessible.	episode_done:True

text:How has your style grown/changed since before quarantine?	labels:I've discovered the world of online thrifting/secondhand shopping during quarantine and it's proved to be both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because I get to lean into my vintage-inspired aesthetics a lot more and have more fun with my style, and a curse because my wallet and my storage are suffering!

text:How has your style grown/changed since before quarantine?	labels:I‚Äôve been through so many different phases. In the beginning, I was used to dressing business casual for work and had very little loungewear since I usually just sleep in a big t-shirt or fleece pajamas. For the first few months, I still did a full face of makeup everyday and wore a dress or a skirt just to work remotely. I also was obsessed with The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel during this time lol so I was always dressed in feminine florals, bouncy curls, and bright red lipstick.   However, since then I‚Äôve somehow become more of a pants person? I used to exclusively wear dresses and skirts every day but now I find comfort in a good paperbag pant or soft lived in jeans. I also have gradually dulled my previously pastel color scheme into a few neutral pieces that all go together. My wardrobe has definitely become more practical and comfortable and honestly it‚Äôs hard to see myself going back to my old ways.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style grown/changed since before quarantine?	labels:Months of not being seen by anyone has helped me become more confident in whatever I want to wear - regardless of what anyone thinks. I stopped thinking "what will so-and-so be wearing" or "will I look too dressed \[up/down\]" and started wearing what I actually felt like. That has spilled over into the "not lockdown" part of my life and I feel amazing, because I broke a bad cycle of caring what anyone thinks. Because of this, I feel like I've finally figured out what my style is.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style grown/changed since before quarantine?	labels:I used to have a very professional business casual + academic style pre covid (i'm a college student in a big city, for ref.). That means, a lot of low heels, blazers, suit-like pants, editorial look. Now, I'm actually dressing more my age as opposed to for a future career: oversize, bright & colorful pieces, interesting necklines and clashing prints. Honestly, it's been a big 180\` and I kinda love it tbh. What's more fun is on days when i feel like dressing up, I combine the two styles and look very ManRepeller circa 2018, or Kdrama fashion. It's amazing!	episode_done:False

Our higher-ups and clients are based in bigger cities and don‚Äôt come to see us anymore. üòä It has allowed me to wear some of my more casual pieces more often, to work. My favourite new ‚Äúwork appropriate‚Äù pieces are leather leggings, dark jeans, and my corduroy miniskirt (with tights). Most bottoms.	episode_done:True

They've been on the chopping block for years, though. Not at all surprising they've collapsed now.  The number of different pieces they produced always seemed crazy to me.

text:Help needed for buying jeans online! All advice is welcome!	labels:1. check the material content. If you're looking for the thicker, heavy duty jean with no stretch look, always look at "materials and care" to check fabric content. You want it to be 100% cotton. Cheap options: Zara, H&M, Banana Republic (on sale) and more pricey: Levi's & everlane 2. For skinny jeans you probably want some with some stretch I think 90-95% cotton? (same retailers as above) 3. ALWAYS check to see what shipping/return policy is by digging around the website. Most retailers will offer free shipping over $50 which you can easily hit when buying jeans. ALWAYS!!! check what the return options are. Some will say "free returns" but the fine print will read "but return shipping will be deducted from your refund" If you don't hit the free shipping requirement just buy something you know you're going to return.  4. don't be afraid to buy sizes below and above your normal size!

text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:I honestly wouldn‚Äôt worry about it that much. I remember trying the whole ‚Äúhipster glasses/ugly christmas sweater‚Äù aesthetic when I was in middle school and being paranoid that I would look like a grandma‚Äî but when I look back at those photos I just look like a typical baby-faced teen.   If you‚Äôre that worried about it, I would maybe throw some trendier pieces like doc martens or dark academia-esque plaid tennis skirts in the mix, since those tend to read young and seem very ‚Äúin‚Äù right now.	episode_done:True
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:Just dropping in to say that I find it funny that a 14 year old is afraid of looking older than their actual age. When I was 14, all I wanted to do was to look like a college freshman. People look down their noses at teenagers, (especially teenage girls) and so I tried to fake maturity and experience, because I thought it would be beneficial to me. But then again! I only enjoyed my early twenties for a few blissful years, after which I discovered that I should apparently be grateful for stuff like getting carded (ohmygawd you guys, I'm so happy this stranger thinks I look too young to be legally drinking!!). So I actually get that someone would panic at 14 years of age, if they were aware of the small window of time in which women are allowed to feel satisfied with their looks.   However, there's no way someone is going to mistake you for being in your 20's just because you're dressing "old". You could dress like a truly old woman complete with all the muted/pastel colors, curly short hair, and kitten heels you desire - people would just think you have alternative style.   The reason some people worry about dressing old, is because once you hit your mid-20's, people start aging at much different rates than they did before. So, 35 year old woman could be mistaken as someone in their early 40's who just looks good for their age, because of styling alone. But you are way too young to be worrying about this.   And dark academia isn't even an old-ish style - it reads as slightly naive (mostly in a good way) to most people who actually went to university. In fact this look has more to do with private schools than uni.	episode_done:True
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:Don't worry! You're most likely not going to look any older. Clothes do much less for your age than you think. Just imagine a middle aged lady that dresses like a teenager. She's not fooling anyone. If dressing like another age worked to look another age, we would all do it üòÇ just enjoy clothes and experiment with fun looks, it's easy to pull most things off while young.	episode_done:True
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:Dark academia actually has a lot of youthful styles from it's boarding school influences. You'll see a lot of school uniform looks, plaid skirts, blazers, jumpers, mary janes, blouses and pinafores. You can get inspiration from children and teens in movies set in the early 1900's.	episode_done:False
text:[INVALID]	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:I think everyone looks back on their teenage years as being super cringy... not because of our style but because the fashion itself from 10, 15 or 20 years ago *can seem* really awful when we look back. 20 years ago, I was 15. I look at what teenagers wear today and I'm like "damn.... I wish I'd had that sense of style." But I did, just in my time. We wore what we wore back then because it was a great way to help us explore, create, and share our identities in the sense of a larger concept of style. But those styles change, evolve, come back around, and disappear again over time. I think I looked ridiculous when I was 15, but back then, I was cool as hell!  Honor your own sense of style and what makes you feel comfortable, happy, and the most authentic expression of who you are. Those may all change over time, but enjoy the moment you're in.  I also had a big vintage clothing phase when I was around your age and perhaps my favorite thing was hitting the local thrift store and altering my finds to fit my size and style. My senior prom dress was actually 3 vintage gowns that I'd found and spliced together. Even today I would say that about a third of my wardrobe is vintage and thrift. The best way to wear vintage and thrift I would say is to learn how to make little alterations like hemming, changing buttons, adding or removing darts, or dyeing. I loved making things my own in simple, little ways.	episode_done:True
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:Screw whatever everyone thinks and just roll with it. I wish that I learned this when I was 14, but I guess 16 isn‚Äôt too late either.

text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:I looove this aesthetic, it's my actual workwear, and funnily enough I dress this way because it does make me look older.  To stay age appropriate, the key is accessories. Socks that fit the aesthetic but are more playful, bows are great, and fun jewelry. There are so many looks, like plaid skirts, that I like but would never wear because they're better for a younger look. Also, if you don't already look older than your age it's probably not going to be a problem. If it does have that effect, it's not in an inappropriate way so it really doesn't matter.	episode_done:True

text:Where do you get good quality, legit wool sweaters that won't rip/shrink after washing?	labels:Here in NZ we have fine spun Merino wool jerseys (as we call them) that can be machine washed without shrinking. Reason being that the wool is pre- shrunk at the plant before they knit them up.  I went on a tour of a plant some years ago and it was super interesting.   anyway having said that i always hand wash my wool jerseys.   The thing that shrinks them in the machine, or if washed wrong is not the hot water but the agitation . This stretches the fibres out and then they bounce back even tighter, if that makes sense.   So even when hand washing you don't want to agitate or rough them up much, just soak, then squeeze gently.

text:Where do you get good quality, legit wool sweaters that won't rip/shrink after washing?	labels:My woolllies are Benetton's. Most of them came from Italy and they are 100% wool, sometimes mixed (a bit of cashmere, angora). I have a couple from NZ - these are 100% merino and not Benetton's. I also have a few handamde so they don't count here.  They are old, though - or vintage.  Apart from my Kiwi jumpers, as said here alteady, which can be machine washed (but in cold water, delicate cycle and inside a mesh bag), you cannot wash them in the washing machine. They may not rip if inside a laundry bag, but they will certainly felt. Somebody told me the spin cycle is what destroys them, but my machine spins while rinsing as well, so it's a no-no anyway.   Using Woolite is enough to make them last for many years. Good quality wool jumpers will last a very long time if well cared for.  Having said that, I must confess I absolutely loathe washing anything by hand. So my woollies don't get worn a lot anymore....  They are > 10 yrs old btw  Good luck!!	episode_done:True

text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:It‚Äôs different for me now that I‚Äôm in my 30s and working full time. I‚Äôd guess around 10% of my salary (after taxes) averaged out... like some months I spend a lot more, others I don‚Äôt buy anything.   Back when I was in college, I did a lot of thrifting and shopping clearance racks! I still like second hand shopping and getting a good deal,  but now saving up for high quality items feels a lot more feasible.  Back in college when I really could only expect tiny amounts of money left over from my income after I paid my bills, it was much more fun to buy a pair of crazy leggings for $5 off the target clearance rack then to try to save up for something nice.  I also feel like I thought of shopping as a fun activity! It was much cheaper to go to the thrift store with my BFFs and get a fun/weird new outfit than to go for dinner and a movie.	episode_done:True
text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:I probably spend on average $150-$200 a month on clothes (that includes workout stuff, loungewear lately, undergarments, etc.). That‚Äôs maybe 2-3% of my take home income. I‚Äôm probably a bit older than you though.   Honestly in college/post college I almost never shopped because I was so broke, which lead me to going a bit crazy once I did have disposable income.   I kind of think of clothes shopping in terms of ‚Äúneeds‚Äù and ‚Äúwants,‚Äù but it sounds like new clothes aren‚Äôt really either for you right now. If that‚Äôs the case, don‚Äôt buy just to buy - keep spending your money on the things that make you happy.	episode_done:True
text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:This... is not actually a problem.  You should have a certain amount of your what you make set aside for fun stuff (which should depend on your lifestyle and financial situation) and if you prioritize social activities and saving over clothing, there's nothing wrong with that.  Chances are that your friends are finding good deals because some of their leisure time is dedicated that, whether in person are online, so if that's not something you enjoy, you do you.  With the way things are going, in a few months time, you'll probably be thankful to have some money saved up.  Personally, I live in an area where, if you enjoy cooking and don't drink, shopping constitutes as going out, which means my discretionary income is mainly going to clothes.  I've been rebuilding my closet and the *most* I've spent in a month is $90 which... actually equated to a horrifying amount of, mostly thrifted, stuff (which was fortunate, since I axed most my spring/summer wardrobe and went for it about a week before lockdown.)  I do have years where I don't really buy clothes and that money will instead go to games, or uncommon ingredients, or art supplies, or going out.	episode_done:True
text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:I spend about 3-4% (~$250/month) of my take home income on clothes. It would probably be around 7-8% if handbags and shoes were included.   I‚Äôm in my late 20s and fortune enough to be making a pretty good income. It‚Äôs totally normal to be spending a lot less when you‚Äôre in college! Some students have parental help with finances or spend their money from part time work on clothes. Don‚Äôt feel pressured to spend money on clothes when you have other priorities that come first (like school, rent, food, savings).	episode_done:True
text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:I'm probably somewhere in $300-$400 per month territory once it's averaged out. I tend to mostly shop during the end of season sales so my spending is heavily weighted in January and June. I'm in my 30's though, so don't feel bad about barely buying clothes, at your age I think experiences are a much better spend. Were I not in the financial position I'm in, clothing would be a fairly low priority item.	episode_done:True
text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:When I was a student, I did buy quite a lot of fast fashion (e.g. Primark) and high street items, particularly when there was a good sale on. I enjoyed it and was exploring my style, and it was all balanced by not spending as much on nights out, drinking and takeaways.  Once I started working, I divided up my money into buckets: monthly fun money (¬£100) that can roll up, monthly luxury savings money (¬£100) that would accumulate until I could afford the ¬£¬£¬£ item I wanted, monthly travel/experience money budget that would also accumulate, general bills and the rest into savings. Ultimately these numbers are arbitrary and was the way that allowed me to splurge sensibly whilst saving, guilt free.   Remember that you can always earn more money so don't be too hard on yourself, but also learn how to be fiscally responsible! It's a balance and learning experience for sure, and will change as life happens (*cough* Covid *cough*).	episode_done:True
text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:If you live in a city- go thrifting! I used to think of thrift stores as places to find like weird old vintage looks, but that‚Äôs not true. I go all the time and get things like Equipment, Anthropologie, Paige Jeans, Vince, etc. I even found a pair of excellent condition Rothys the other day! All for like $3-$10. You can have a rotating wardrobe fairly affordably. Also, utilize places like Clothes Mentor and Plato‚Äôs Closet if you can, not only to buy from them but to sell as well. I buy stuff at the thrift store for a few dollars, wear it a few times or a season, then resell it to ClothesM or PlatosC. You end up wearing it for free basically.   I also use Rent The Runway. For $89 a month you get to rent 4 items. They carry a huge selection of designer clothing; it‚Äôs a fun way to try statement pieces and things you otherwise couldn‚Äôt afford. For example, I currently on my rental this month have a $745 Derek Lam coat, a $325 pair of Rag & Bone wool pants, a $395 Current/Elliot cardigan, and a $250 Equipment sweater.	episode_done:True
text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:On a good month I have ¬£120. This is to be split on everything that's not groceries & basic household consumables, healthcare, rent or bills. So it's spent on going out, clothes, skincare, stuff for the house that's not consumables, presents, etc. I would spend ¬£100-¬£200 on a new item of clothing, less on second-hand. So as you might guess, I don't buy a lot of clothes! What I buy I wear until THE END.   Edit: I should mention that I work part-time so I would spend less than an average person. It's a trade off - more time, less golds.	episode_done:True

text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I think they‚Äôre like jewelry accessories. They range from wild to professional. If you style a very plain item in a wild way, it‚Äôs no longer a plain item. Like hair colored bobby pins used to sculpt your hair into a helicopter. I think scrunchies can be great with a sleek bun or a lovely scarf as a head wrap and still look professional. A headband with horns may not fit in all offices, but maybe that‚Äôs a vibe of an office that works.	episode_done:True
text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I think hair accessories in the workplace are fine as long as they're deployed thoughtfully. Nice scrunchies and those slightly high profile headbands can work pretty well when combined with a polished outfit and subtle jewelry (or more creative outfits and jewelry if your office is more casual). I work for a nonprofit that straddles a few different different fields (economic and business dev, higher ed, entrepreneurship, etc) so I interact with a wide range of dress codes and dress code interpretations.   I'd love to wear more headbands but I'm a whiner with a huge head and they pinch too badly to get through a work day; I love the look of the almost turban-styled headbands though and don't think they're automatically off limits for a biz caz office. But then I've worn a black scarf scrunchie to work on a sleek ponytail with a sleek turtleneck and skirt outfit, and I semi-regularly deploy interesting clips (geometric, tortoiseshell, or single jewel bobby pins).	episode_done:True
text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I have no problem if it‚Äôs a neutral colored hair accessory.  Scrunchies feel more casual, but barrettes, thin hair ties, and headbands could be worn tastefully.  Color, if used, should be limited and not too distracting.    Example:    Red headband and the rest of the outfit is neutral. ‚Äî> sounds fine  Red headband, red lipstick, red necklace, orange shirt, zebra pants‚Äî> too much	episode_done:True

text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I struggle with this because I have a wavy bob and some days my waves need some reigning in.

text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:There‚Äôs a woman in my office who wears her hair in a head wrap almost exclusively and she always looks so stunning and put together. I‚Äôve noticed many of us have been wearing headbands more now working from home, but mostly in stripes or animal print. I have a tie dyed one that I only wear on weekends. I will say, in my office hair accessories seem to be well-received. I‚Äôve done barrettes and a velvet ribbon previously and gotten many compliments. I‚Äôm also over 35, if it matters to you to know that context.	episode_done:True
text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I think they can work as long as you consider how they fit with your outfit and the colour palette.  A coworker wore a lovely green scarf tied loosely around her ponytail once and the rest of her outfit was grey/black and simple. It looked great. Had she worn a bright blue dress and bright red lipstick with it, maybe not, at least in a professional environment.  Some women get away with dressing a bit eccentric, but I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre almost always in a senior role, near retiring or very young. I say ‚Äòget away with‚Äô because we technically have no dress code, aside from something really inappropriate.  Intend to stick to neutrals and darker colours. I have a few plain tops in bright colours, but I always pair them with very simple and plain items. It‚Äôs not that dislike them, but they require more thought!	episode_done:True
text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:My hair has been white for a long time, and I worked as an educator. I wore and still wear all kinds of fun scrunchies, pony tail holders, barrettes, clips etc, in complimentary colors (but not matching ) to my outfits. Students always enjoy comparing notes! In a corporate setting hair accessories probably need to be used more sparingly, depending on the job.	episode_done:True
text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:Depends on the work environment and the type of accessory.    I work in a super casual work environment (WFH).  Even I wouldn't wear my cat ear headband unless I didn't have any video calls that day.    Now if I were in a BigLaw firm, things would be different.  Maybe I'd wear my hair half up using a plain silver clip but that's about it.   Or I'd use a tortishell claw.	episode_done:True

Different athletic gear as I've started running since I cant play volleyball for fitness.

I'm not buying any biz caz stuff as it's indefinite work from home at the moment.	episode_done:True
text:Have your clothing purchases dramatically dropped now that we can't go anywhere?	labels:I've been buying more than ever before.

text:Have your clothing purchases dramatically dropped now that we can't go anywhere?	labels:I  never worried about or felt I understood anything about fashion before. I grew up in a family of so many girls who all feel like we don't know fashion. I always wanted to but it felt unobtainable. Well I went through some family stuff where I no longer need to be spending my free time and money taking care of some family members so I have been updating my wardrobe like crazy. I watched and learned about a ton of fashion for a month first with all the free time from covid. I have never spent this much on myself ever. Don't get me wrong everything was thrift store finds or clearence but I was still wearing almost only things from highschool before and I'm 25.. I extra splurged yesterday and was able to score a brand new pair of vegan doc marten oxfords for $45!!	episode_done:True

text:PSA: Revive by Rent the Runway via Thredup	labels:I'm a frequent thredup buyer and seller but I do so with lots of caveats.   &#x200B;  1) I don't buy higher end goods from them because a) I don't trust the authenticity and b) they charge wayyyyyy more for more mid-level and up 'designer' or higher end brands. I'll just use Coach as an example. Vintage full leather Coach bags on thredup will sell for 50% or way way more than that same item on eBay from a random seller.   2) The level of use of their garments can really vary and the quality control is lacking. I've ordered items that were supposed to only be gently worn (they shouldn't really be selling anything that's more obviously worn), and gotten those items only to see that they are covered in animal hair and have obvious odors. But again, this isn't a constant issue and I don't buy final sale items from them so I can just return them.   &#x200B;  All of that having been said, I won't buy RTR items from thredup. I don't trust that their pricing will be reasonable secondhand market value nor do I trust the quality of the items.	episode_done:True

Mind you RTR is designer and not so much fast fashion options. I currently have a Temperley London dress from RTR that retails at $1195.

text:Coveteur: An Ode to the Striped Shirt	labels:I have...entirely too many striped shirts.   I am a sucker for them. I was always told to wear vertical stripes because it would make me look slim. Growing up, I was a beanpole. no boobs, no hips, just enormous feet. So I started dabbling in horizontal stripes to make me look a little less scrawny.   then in my 20's I got my boobs done. those horizontal stripes now made the new boobs look absolutely vulgar and *I loved it*. I still do.  wide horizontal stripes are great for toning them down, thinner horizontal stripes really bring out the wow factor.

It is a blocky horizontal stripe with matte black/off-white and has a nice slouchy drape for being kind of a stiff cottony material.

Even when you get into the whole brand markup.

You can feel the difference in person but online how can you tell except a real mark-down?  I‚Äôm super interested in this topic OP.

text:'Silk and Steel' NPR Article Discussion	labels:Interesting article. US urbanite perspective here, as I feel that‚Äôs important to state.   ‚ÄúClothing is the barometer of change‚Äù   It‚Äôs interesting to think about the roots of what we now consider ‚Äúclassic pieces‚Äù, only coming from the last century. It makes me think about what changes we will see moving forward, and how classics may shift with shifting norms.   When I think about French fashion as a whole, as diverse as it it, the dominant idea is that of the Parisian bobo woman, a bit undone but thoroughly classic. Neutral colors (described as dye shortage, and also mourning),pops of color (described as identifying with a political allegiance) trench coats (wartime utilitarian piece) a nice wrist watch (wartime utilitarian piece). Clear connections. The roots are there. It makes sense. And practical! Don‚Äôt pull out your phone on the metro if you don‚Äôt have to, check your watch instead. Protect yourself from the urban grime and constant wet with blacks and greys and throw on a trench.   Import that idea and it‚Äôs further diluted. Current urban dressing has been reduced and simplified and given a new context. Along with increased production and lower quality, it feels so disconnected to me. Think about a flimsy fashion trench coat, or a thin pair of combat boots. Hollow, right? Think about a robust trench coat or thick, protective combat boots. A little excessive for hopping on a train or an uber to dinner, no?   I‚Äôm longing for clothing that aligns with my utilitarian needs again.

text:Yeah, the extra stress of maintaining the purchase would get old. That's one of the reason I avoid clothing rentals.

With the extremely few exceptions like Birkins and limited edition Chanel bags or stuff like that, it's not a thing.   Clothes will not retain their value and it's naive to think that you can buy something and expect to recoup more than half your money after *5 years* of wearing it. Especially since it's probably already a few years old when you buy it.  Pret a porter does not do as well as bags on the resale market. No one gives a shit that your old cardigan is designer because in another 5 years it will not only be worn out, it will be really outdated. If someone is paying hundreds for one single item, they're not buying worn from a collection 10 years ago AND still be willing to pay half the original price.	episode_done:False

text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:Going through a place like TRR to resell a luxury item will likely yield a smaller return than expected. From what I call tell their commission rate is 30-50% and unless the garment is in near pristine condition after a few years it will likely retain less of the value than anticipated. Maybe TRR would try selling it for $300 then, but you would probably net half. Most items I see going for a premium are either very desirable brands or items that are virtually unworn.   Beyond all of that it‚Äôs difficult to predict where things would end up in a few years - what‚Äôs a desirable brand on the resale market now may not be in 3-5 years. Some designers will lose value more quickly.   It‚Äôs just really not a strategy I would account for when planning a clothing budget in the long run. You can readjust as you go based on money than comes in from returning items to the resale market - but I would fully expect that in all cases you will likely loose over half the original purchase price (especially if you are not selling it directly to another consumer).	episode_done:False
text:This is an absolutely valid comment. I've bought and sold a lot of my mid-range brand pieces (stuff that costs ~200 - 600 USD new) in the last couple of years. Unless something is super popular, it can take MONTHS to find a buyer, and usually to a heavily discounted price.   And keep in mind, there are a lot of jerks. You'll end up arguing with a buyer sooner or later that you can't take returns because it didn't fit them, that the condition was indeed as described etc. Oddly enough, my most hassle-free things to sell were used branded jewelry.   Buying new and hoping for a high re-sale is a lost cause for most things. 2nd hand shops in my country will pay about 0-10% of the original price when you send/bring them your stuff. And that's for a good condition and no obvious signs of wear.   Even popular brands don't yield much. I've sent in a new with attached tags & packaging Tatras coat (costs ~900 usd here) and they offered me 240 USD. This was the most popular model of this brand.  For 2nd hand, you'll mostly win by buying second hand what you hopefully enjoy yourself. Buying something at 20-30% of the original value, use it for as long as you like, then donate/sell it for anywhere between 0-10%	labels:I totally hear you on the pains of resale. I agree that the situation is a little more hopeful if you buy secondhand to begin with, but from your and other's posts, there are still too many other variables that can make it difficult to "re-resale" so to speak.	episode_done:True
text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:I think it doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense to think of resale value for an object that gets worn and is subject to a lot of wear and tear with usage. How would you feel if you stain or rip or stretch out some garment you plan to resell later? It doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense to me!  But the clothes you like and wear them.

text:The only way to make it work is to sell items directly, preferably ones you‚Äôve bought at bargain basement prices. eBay, Grailed, Vestiaire etc will absolutely destroy your margin with their cut. This means building an Instagram following, finding your way into niche communities, and spending hours photographing, pricing, and listing items. If having thirsty dudes slide into your DMs is worth an extra $100 to you, it can go a long way towards making you profitable.   Even then, if you‚Äôre not buying things with an eye towards flipping, it‚Äôs going to be slow and potentially not worth the time investment. I‚Äôm a big Rick collector, and what I buy for myself has little overlap with what has significant resale value. I make most of my extra money on arbitrage between markets and reselling unisex pieces to the significantly larger male audience. If I wanted to make a significant dent in my clothing budget with resale, it‚Äôd turn into a 15-20hr/wk endeavour.

text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:I used to buy a lot of high end stuff, mostly bags and shoes, with occasional clothing pieces in there. It was definitely easier to spend more knowing I could recoup something.   The problem was that I was never really honest with myself about what I could realistically sell things for, because it started to become justification if that makes sense at all. I never bought things with the intention of reselling them later, but it made it easier. It was always like ‚Äú$1000 is a lot for this bag, but I can sell for 800, so it‚Äôs not that expensive.‚Äù In reality, it would sell for more like 500, and it would take a long time to sell. And then occasionally, I‚Äôd end up with something that I like, but that no one else really did, and it‚Äôs hard to sell something for pennies when you handed over hundreds. It‚Äôs a lot of psychological warfare with yourself, or at least it was for me. It also doesn‚Äôt help that selling high end designer pieces is much harder than selling mall stuff ‚Äî a lot of fraud, a lot of entitled buyers *and* sellers, and just a lot of headache overall.   These days, I don‚Äôt buy nearly as much luxury stuff, and I try to buy mostly secondhand. I still resell some stuff, but I try to buy more classic things that I‚Äôll keep for awhile. Resale factor does come into play, but if I‚Äôm honest, I have a list of things I need to sell, but haven‚Äôt taken the time to do.	episode_done:True
text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:I‚Äôve tried to resell my previously second-hand clothes that are higher end, i.e. Ferragamo, Dolce and Gabbanna, and Ralph Lauren Black Label. I‚Äôve only made 1 sale out of all the clothes that I‚Äôve listed on Poshmark. Although I did recoup most of my money on that sale, it was more work than it‚Äôs worth. As some people said below with the luxury market sometimes you get a fraction of the price that you bought it for, even if you bought it used prior. You will probably have more luck with luxury handbags than clothing. I wouldn‚Äôt use the value I could probably resell the clothing item for as justification to buy.  If you like the item and have the money just spring for it.	episode_done:True

text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:I think this system may work if you flip things quickly - almost like ‚Äúrenting‚Äù clothes - but would be an extreme amount of work. However, if you plan to buy luxury items and get a lot of wear out of them, they depreciate rapidly. I would never spend $300 on cashmere that someone wore for years - it‚Äôs just not worth it. Also, as someone who adores eBay shopping and Posh, it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúbuyer‚Äôs market‚Äù - I just scored new-in-box Aquatalia and La Canedienne boots, each for less than 1/4 of original price, and these are styles that are still being sold full-price online.   The only area I really see this working out is luxury bags - bags get less wear and tear, and Chanel will always have great resale value. But for an entire wardrobe, it just doesn‚Äôt seem viable (or worth the time).	episode_done:True

text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I think it‚Äôs important to buy things that you really LOVE. A lot of the time we feel the need to shop because we‚Äôre bored of our closets and feel like something is missing.  I love leather jackets and used to buy a lot of them in every color and finish. They were all nice and cute, but was never really in love with any of them. Maybe the leather was kind of thin. Maybe they didn‚Äôt have zippers in every place I wanted. Maybe they didn‚Äôt fit me quite perfectly. So I decided to treat myself to an expensive designer jacket and that I was OBSESSED with. And I haven‚Äôt felt the need to buy another leather jacket since.  I‚Äôm not saying you have to buy designer or anything like that, but buying more peices you love and are obsessed with will help you ‚Äúshop your closet‚Äù every day and help curb some of your need to spend.	episode_done:True
text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:The problem is that doing a no-buy for a year is a HUGE undertaking that you are destined to fail. Not just you, people, in general. I think 3 months is a great start, and I think it's easier if you start with smaller, more attainable goals. It's like with a project at school or work - you break it up into smaller increments.  Once you get the hang of it, it'll be WAY easier to extend another month and another month. Looking at a year of no-buy is daunting. 3 months? More manageable.   The other thing is - you can't go cold turkey, because that is also unrealistic and sets you up for failure. I'd start with a low-buy, a circumstantial buy, a no-buy with a number of exceptions, etc. That enables you to form better habits.  The less strict you are being with yourself, the better your chances of success, overall, and long-term. If you go hard (one full year no-buy, no exceptions, fuck yeah!!!), it'll be super easy to break down and lose your progress, because the minute you give in, you've "failed" and what's the point of continuing. This is an endurance run.  Eventually, you get excited at your progress and want to see it through till the end. This is what helped me start saving money. I wanted to save for a deposit, but man, setting aside that first $1000 was hard. But once I saw my bank account growing and growing as months went by, it became easier. It became thrilling. How much could I save? How much closer to my goal could I get?   It's satisfying to see the progress, and it's harder to give up once you've made a "dent" in your ultimate goal.	episode_done:False
text:Ohh thank you for your advice! I love this idea- I think that yeah, I don't really want to go without buying a dress for a special occasion from time to time.

text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I try to do no buys but fashion is my number one hobby and now that I have a little disposable income I buy things that I love. Whenever no-buys happen they're not on purpose, I just happened to not have bought anything.   So, for me, approaching this less from an environmental impact and more from a "personal ethos" standpoint helps my spending habits. Do I admire the construction, the fabric, the style? Even if I don't wear this a lot will I be happy with it in my closet? When it's time to part with my clothes I sell them online and hope someone will buy it before taking it to goodwill because I want the garment to continue it's life (lol). I think by developing your own thoughts around spending and what you want, the sustainability and mindfulness will come naturally.   ALSO if you like Zara secondhand is the time to buy! I haven't shopped their in years but I do have some stuff that's really held up and looks good from them.

text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I would recommend, first of all, assessing your goals and trying to make rules that are fair to you, and which can be adapted into life long habits.   Flexibility is important, especially when it comes to something you will eventually *need* to do, like purchasing clothing.  Not buying a single thread of clothing for an entire year was a failure waiting to happen (because, y'know, shit happens,) and it isn't even that helpful if it just results in binge periods before and after.      What works best for me is keeping a system of criteria for shopping.  If you actually *need* something, buy it guilt-free, and then budget out the things you don't need.  *Always* assess potential purchases critically: Ask yourself it it suits your wardrobe, if it's practical, if it fits well, it it's well-made and if it's something you are likely to wear a lot.   If helps, reserve nonessential purchases for use as a reward when you complete major tasks.  Try to avoid shopping altogether if you know you're not supposed to be buying stuff.  If you feel like you can't stop shopping, there's almost definitely *something* else you can be doing that scratches the same psychological itch.	episode_done:False

text:From Runway to reddit: Ready-to-Wear Purchasing and the Fashion Calendar Explained	labels:Excellent, excellent write up, thank you so much for sharing and breaking down the process in a way that is easy to understand.   >  If you're cruising to Cabo over Thanksgiving, wintering in the Mediterranean after Christmas, and enjoying late season skiing in Aspen in May, you must have a wardrobe to match. What designers were delivering and retailers stocking was out of step with consumers' buying habits.  This was a great way to explain how the precollections help fill in the gaps, but it will be interesting to see brands cutting down on resort or cruise collections. I normally enjoy precollections cause I find that they tend to be more fun and leave room for more creativity by the designers.  > At the high end, fashion is a relationship business. Sales associates at brand flagships and independent boutiques keep up with clients via phone, text, and e-mail. Rather than making orders through a website, you reach out to your SA and ask "do you have x in?" or they contact you as new stock comes in and try and sell you on whatever bizarre runway item people with both money and sense üëèwillüëènotüëèbuyüëè.  It‚Äôs a transactional relationship and a lot of clients are addicted to the exclusivity of it all (Herm√®s anyone?). It‚Äôs almost a bragging right to have a relationship with a SA who can give you early access to collections or decide you‚Äôre worthy of being offered a particular handbag or watch.	episode_done:True

I was able to attend a few runway shows in Paris early this year and was whisked away right after the show to the showroom. Was very cool seeing one of my all time favorite celebrity (model really) in the showroom on the wall. I was a bit starstruck.   The person I was with ordered a jacket from this brand at the showroom at the beginning of the year and it was only made ready in the past 2 weeks.	episode_done:True

text:From Runway to reddit: Ready-to-Wear Purchasing and the Fashion Calendar Explained	labels:This is great and very well done! I've been working in fashion for about 15(!!) years now, first as a designer, currently a key costumer for tv/film.  I worked in mass market (from very fast fashion to mid range 'women's better' lol) and our calendar is even stupider- the first place I worked churned out a brand new delivery every single month.    What's your thoughts on how the pandemic will affect trends? I have two theories: one, that because nobody is going anywhere, trends will 'freeze' and little will change in terms of new silos or exciting ideas. My other theory is that since fashion is a swinging pendulum, we'll all be so sick of sweatpants and t-shirts that very elaborate, bold choices will be favored even by less adventurous markets. Take the bestselling 'strawberry dress' everyone bought without anywhere to go.   Anyway! Thanks again for a great writeup!	episode_done:False

Same goes for makeup. Unlike the ashy pastel makeup from the bling bling era, I'm thinking deeper shades and shimmers, multichromes for eyeshadows. Glossy lips too since masks are gone and liquid lipsticks have been around for a long time, but with colours not clear like old times.	episode_done:True

Maybe a pants is slightly too long, or a blouse is too loose - now you can hem up the pants and take in the blouse. Don‚Äôt cut cloth until you‚Äôre comfortable!! Sewing is the opposite of cooking - you can subtract but never add, while cooking you can always add but not subtract.

Literally all of my cashmere is either thrifted or bought on clearance, so the max I would have paid for a sweater is around $35, with the low end around $12.

text:How do you feel about vegan/faux leather?	labels:I‚Äôm not a fan tbh. My experience which faux leather is that it does look nice... but not for long because it cracks/peels. Also it‚Äôs not very sustainable because it‚Äôs made of plastics and has a short lifespan (depending on how regularly it is worn). Real leather on the other hand can have a super long lifespan with proper care, and too me it just looks way nicer because real leather items (like boots and bags) are usually made with more care because it‚Äôs a more expensive material. I‚Äôve thrifted all of my leather items too, which is also more sustainable for the environment (and my wallet!)	episode_done:True

text:How do you feel about vegan/faux leather?	labels:There is no such thing as vegan leather.  There's leather, and then there's plastic that has been manipulated to immitate leather grain.  The latter has its uses--it's cheap, it can be made in literally any shape,  it can be made waterproof and insulating, and it certainly isn't *ugly*\--but it's certainly not leather.  Personally, I try to avoid it.  My reason are as follows:   1) It doesn't have the durability I need--it  loses its shape easily, it hardens and cracks easily, and unlike leather it is almost impossible to repair once damaged.   2) It doesn't have the sustainability I want--sure you spare an animal's hide, but you could wear out ten pairs of PVC shoes in the time it takes to wear out one well-made pair of leather shoes.  Now you have ten pairs of PVC shoes floating in the ocean killing sea turtles and the cow ends up on a plate regardless.  3) Aesthetically... it is cheap plastic.  And it looks like cheap plastic.  There are some styles that can accommodate or even luxuriate on cheap plastic items, but mine is not one such style.  There is simply no replacement for the depth of color and texture given by leather.     4) Chafing oh god chafing     That said, I've seen some folks look really good in PVC.  I used to look really good in PVC too, back when I was more wild and reckless.  But now that I've become the sort of person who gets her materialist thrills out of vintage copper cookware and exotic tea blends, I find I am also someone who really loves the beauty and comfort of leather.  You can call it an Old Fart Thing if you like.	episode_done:True

text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I've been working on construction sites for for years, and I've found that my work wear influences my fashion sense more than my fashion sense influences my workwear  I'd say the only influence fashion has on my workwear is cut. I wear skinny carpenter's jeans and make sure that my shirts, jackets, and high viz vest are all fitted at the waist. This is mostly so I don't look like a child, though, and less about fashion  I wear quality boots to work every day, so now I tend to buy my fun shoes from places prioritize comfort, weatherproofing, and sole grip. Less ASOS, more Sorel  I love Dovetail jeans, which have taught me the joys of a pocket for every tool. Now, my favorite purse is a crossbody wallet from Duluth because it has slots for all my cards and cash and two pockets that are perfect for my phone and my facemask.  Basically, construction has taught me to prioritize dressing practically so I can live my best life without digging for shit deep in a massive purse while dying in uncomfortable shoes.

I‚Äôve got spill resistant boots from Red Wing that I change into when I go into the lab but I generally wear flats and booties if I‚Äôm just doing office work that day.  I usually wear pearl earrings and light makeup to look more put together but nothing too fancy.	episode_done:True

text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I need to wear a uniform in my lab job and keep my hair tied back, but I love using cute hair accessories in my ponytails and different hair clips and scrunchies.

text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I work in a physics research lab and I'm often the only woman in my workplace. For safety I always wear closed shoes and long pants, and for practicality I like pants with lots of pockets. Duluth Trading Company has the best women's pants I've found - I like the Flexpedition style the best but I have a bunch of them. You can get them for \~$40 when there's a sale and the pockets are huge! I also have some coveralls from them that I love because they come in an XS and actually fit me. I have to have my work special order things like gloves and safety goggles because the mens sized ones we had don't fit me. For shoes I like boots or sneakers and wear oxfords when I want to be fancy.  Most of the men just wear sneakers, jeans, and a t-shirt or flannel, so that's typically what I wear so I don't stand out too much. I also don't wear a lab coat at work, so my shirts often get dirty so I don't like to wear nicer clothes at work anyway. I'm comfortable with my androgynous style and don't feel pressure to dress up more. I just wear my nice sweaters and such on the weekend. I don't wear much jewelry anyway, and I actually got a pixie cut last year because I was tired of putting my hair up. Cute and practical!  The best work clothes tip I have is to keep a second set of clothes at work. A cardigan is especially important if you office is cold, and it can help dress up an outfit if you have a surprise meeting. I walk to work so I'm wearing snow boots in the winter and shorts in the summer, and then I just change into my work clothes and shoes when I get there.	episode_done:True
text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:Omg when I worked in a lab/office (tissue bank) I used to take a photo of my outfit everyday before I left the house!

Imagur?	episode_done:True
text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I‚Äôve had internships in both a manufacturing capacity and R&D and I‚Äôm back in mostly R&D now (but working from home haha). In manufacturing I wore a combo of jeans, corduroys, and some more casual leaning dress pants with sweaters most of the time and switched between my trusted Chelsea boots and safety shoes depending on what area I was working in that day. For R&D I was able to dress more ‚Äúfashionable‚Äù based on whether or not I was working in the lab. Lab days mostly focused on sweaters and casual dress shirts with sleeves I could easily roll up/down, jeans or dress pants and a variety of closed toed shoes (Chelseas, heeled black booties, in the summer I could get away with sperrys). Non lab days I liked to wear dresses, long skirts, and my nicer dress pants.   Looking ahead I‚Äôve been trying to combine my work wardrobe with every day/weekend pieces. I focus a lot on getting sweaters that I actually enjoy as opposed to ones that are designated for work (love a good turtleneck and actually cute cardigans). I‚Äôve also been looking into more natural fibers but getting them secondhand so the price isn‚Äôt so crazy (also so I don‚Äôt feel too too bad if they get messy at work)! I also try and avoid ‚Äúonly work shoes‚Äù so my dressy shoes are ones I could wear to an interview/presentation but also out to a nice dinner. There were definitely a few times at work in the past where I felt more dressed up than my colleagues but I don‚Äôt think it was ever looked down on. I think dressing to your personal style is a great way to express yourself at work as long as it‚Äôs appropriate for the sitch and safe for you and your colleagues in a lab/technical setting!	episode_done:True

text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:Both my mother and I grew up in relative scarcity. My mom‚Äôs way of dealing with that is to hoard clothes. If she seems something cheap that can be gifted later to someone or worn for herself or her family she will buy it, because it‚Äôs always better to have too much than too little.   My way of dealing with scarcity was to learn to sew. I purchase clothes that are good quality wherever I can find them for a decent price and I fix them to last longer and/or fit me. So whereas when I was little and would shop with my mom she would buy however much she could, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever bought more than 3 pieces at a time since I started shopping alone.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:I'm in my early thirties and live a comfortable life. In my early twenties I loved shopping for secondhand clothing and had a regular loop of my local thrift stores, Clothes Mentors, and consignment shops. I was always on the hunt for a good deal and was really developing my personal style (with a lot of experimentation and questionable choices.)  A few things that I've been reflecting on recently:  1. I no longer find shopping (specifically browsing) fun. Now I would much rather seek out a specific item on Poshmark and only shop to replace needed items or fill legitimate gaps.  2. Related to the above, I have a short list of brands that I buy and it's based on quality, warranty (I have a lot of outdoor/athletic gear), and environmental impact. Right now, I'm looking for a Patagonia Houdini for at least 50% off retail. I'm not in a rush to buy it but I'm also not aimlessly shopping for "a windbreaker" and then come home with three t-shirts. 3. Fabric/fit snobbery. I don't care if the cutest top I've ever seen is on clearance for $3... if it's 100% polyester it's just not coming home with me. Same with "I really like it, but if only it..." I have far more clothing than I need so there's never a moment where buying a pair of leggings is the difference between owning pants and going to work naked. I can wait till I find the perfect item.  4. Lifestyle creep is real! Across all my spending (groceries, clothing, hobbies) I just don't pay attention to the cost as much. I still have an upper threshold that gives me pause, but I don't have any month-to-month "oh, I can't afford that right now." Which, I really should be saying far more often!   All together, it takes most of the fun out of shopping because I am so picky and can usually say, "okay, I really don't need/want this."	episode_done:False
text:Mid 30s, and this all rang so true for me. It was a sad day when I was finally honest with myself and realized I just don‚Äôt like ‚Äúgoing shopping‚Äù anymore.  I used to be able to spend hours combing through the racks at Last Call or Off 5th looking for an amazing deal or whatever struck my fancy.   Now I know what I want, I want to price check a few other sites to make sure I‚Äôm getting a decent price, and I want to be done with it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:I‚Äôm way more environmentally cautious now that I‚Äôm in my late 20s. As a teenager, I was into fast fashion because, hey, it‚Äôs cheap! But now if I buy new, I look for quality clothing that will last for a long time (perhaps decades). I also have a goal of  not buying more than 3 new items per year. My ‚Äúnew‚Äù clothes are generally bought second hand or obtained through Bunz (trading app) or my local ‚ÄúBuy Nothing‚Äù Facebook group.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:Kind of. As I‚Äôve gotten older I don‚Äôt mind spending more on a good quality piece that‚Äôll last. I want good quality, timeless pieces now.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:I'm definitely more into quality and classic design Vs something cheap, cheerful and trendy now.   Perhaps it is a result of being able to afford it more, but I think it's mostly due to being more aware of good quality fabric which lasts, look better and ultimately tired of fast fashion which I'd wear for a few weeks/months and then relegate to the back of the closet.   Looking back, the cheap polyester tops, skirts etc did nothing favourable for my body and just did not look as good as I thought it did at the time.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:I‚Äôve never really enjoyed shopping that much but now that I‚Äôm older and much heavier I have a really hard time with the limited options that come with being a size 18.   My style is way less trendy these days and now that I‚Äôm almost 30 I don‚Äôt really care about staying on top of all of that. I like more classic designs that don‚Äôt go out of style. I work a business casual desk job full time so I usually stick to skinny black pants, cute black flats/boots/loafers and a fun blouse or sweater. I‚Äôve come to really appreciate a good statement earring so I have a nice little collection going now.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:I grew up in a larger family without a lot of money, so I got really good at maximizing the number of pieces that I could buy on a tiny budget. The down side of that was that I got into a bad habit of buying pieces that weren't quite me because my selection was limited to what I could find in my size on sale racks. And then with limited access to laundry in college/early career, I'd prioritize quantity over quality so that I could make fewer laundry trips.  Now that I'm more financially secure and have a washer-dryer in my apartment, I am a lot more picky about what pieces I buy. I want the fits, styles, fabrics, and colors to be things that I truly love, rather than what's good enough and cheap. I can wait longer to find a piece that I truly love, and spend a little more on that piece, rather than buying the cheapest thing that I can find that will serve a particular need. I also don't feel the need to buy things just in case I need them, because if a need does pop up, I can afford to buy something to fill that need. And that's something that I think a lot of people who grow up with money don't realize--when you don't have a lot, any unplanned expense can be an emergency, and so you end up keeping a lot of things you don't use often because you know you can't afford to replace them. Downsizing the amount you own is much easier mentally when you know you can afford to replace a stained sweater, so you don't need to keep that one that doesn't quite fit right but is presentable enough.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:As a recent college grad I had 3 prs of shoes and I thought a polo-style shirt and khakis were all I needed for work. Shopping wasn‚Äôt a big thing.  I was just trying to live independently and pay my bills.  Making outfits was challenging because I didn‚Äôt have the items to make a cohesive wardrobe that could last a work week without re-washing something. I did have a few items for going out that I swapped with friends. Who know where those things ended up.  Mid-career (and middle-aged), I think more about my personal style than trends. I enjoy creating styles that don‚Äôt appear over planned, yet are well put together. I‚Äôve built what I consider a personal fashion archive over the years that I can pull from.  The stores I buy from have changed...or least the % of my wardrobe from certain stores has changed.  I‚Äôm more aware of quality and fabrication, though I sometimes compromise fabric preference for style. Conversely, I will drop some coin on high-quality items made from natural fibers, good shoes, coats,and an occasional luxury handbag (or two).	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:Significantly. I lived in jeans, old t-shirts from running races, and worn out running shoes all through college and grad school. That was almost my entire wardrobe. I really didn't care much about fashion and couldn't afford anything even if I did.    After I got a job, I had the money but still no inspiration.   Then I realized I was trans and that my lack of interest was only in men's fashion.  Now I actually care about putting together looks and take joy in shopping for and trying on clothes.   It's been a wild ride	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:When I was in my early 20's, my first priority was to look "cute" or "hot". 5 inch heels were just what I did. I had no money obviously, so it ended up being most anything I could find on clearance.   I'm in my mid-30's now and I simply don't wear it if it isn't comfortable. Not to say I live in sweatpants (well, pre-pandemic anyway), but I prioritize my comfort, looking relatively pulled together, and not tragically out of style but still not necessarily trendy. I don't wear heels.   I don't shop clearance anymore. If it's a well made item that I want and I've taken the time to think about it, I buy it. Otherwise, I do a lot of thrifting and wear what I like of that and sell the rest.	episode_done:True

text:Cyberpunks Not Dead - Inspo Album	labels:Digging this! I just finished a month-long cyberpunk roleplay/cosplay/lifestyle and the elements that I was looking for in my fashion choices were sharp edges, black or neon, things that light up, face coverings or face paint to confuse facial recognition software, straps, heavy black eye makeup, bright hair, metallics (although that's just because I have metallics-- I think iridescence is more on-brand). We modified it to tie in some vaporwave/outrun aesthetic as well, so pastel pinks were on the table as well as anything that looks glitchy. I'm loving seeing the overlap and non-overlap between the looks we went with and this album!   Favorite cyber-looks are the wide-brim hat with the blue veil, the Calvin Lou look with the spiked hair, the Emporio Armani look with the black translucent fabric and the tiny 90s shades, the Each Other "free hugs" photo, and the Rocostru silver straps.  I love the veil because I think facial masking is a part of what I imagine a cyberpunk future to be about and I think the color scheme is right on-point. The Calvin Lou and Emporio Armani looks both just nail a Matrix-era vibe to me. I love the way both looks play with showing skin and I love the hair styling for both... both read very cyberpunk to me. The Each other look is great partly because I love turning the storm trooper "free hugs" guy into a nostalgic cyber-icon but mostly because the 3D glasses are super on-brand-- both colorful and technological-- and the outfit is also super functional. And, loving the silver straps in general.  I wish I'd had the idea and courage to go more nipple-forward in my costuming for last month... digging that part of this album and loving the implication that our future is more down with women's nipples.	episode_done:False

I save things I like within my price range (including things that are currently too expensive, as they could go on sale). I save things I come across elsewhere that I like to Pinterest.

Actual impulse buys are now either really practical pieces with prints or loud colour (i.e. my bright purple turtleneck,) or things that feel nice with weird cuts.  I don't shop online much, since I get either overwhelmed by choice or frustrated that I can't find exactly what I'm looking for, and most my enjoyment comes from touching all the things, which is now bad, so I've been using Depop since quarantine started mainly because if feels...more casual or something.

text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:This style is surprisingly attainable for me after several years of hardcore minimalism. Once I got to a place where my basics are both on point and super pragmatic, then I have been able to incorporate a few Tibi and Tibi-like statement pieces into my rotation. I‚Äôm no longer a minimalist in terms of style - I like buying a couple ‚Äúbig impact‚Äù things every year to jazz up my clothes, especially oversized  or dramatic drape or ‚Äúorigami structure‚Äù on tops and coats. A single piece really changes an outfit and you don‚Äôt need many pieces in rotation to suddenly change your style. Amy Smilovic appears to do a similar thing - keep several things ‚Äúbasic‚Äù (neutral color, solid/no pattern, uniform texture, unadorned (no bling or fringes etc) and the play with one thing (her thing seems to be oversized fit and pleats).  The only reason I bring up minimalism is because I cannot emphasize more how much the basics being ‚Äújust right‚Äù makes my dramatic pieces work. Especially with oversized, it‚Äôs a thin line between slob and stylish. Those big pleated dad pants Amy Smilovic wears? The rest of the outfit should be sharp or you look like you simply don‚Äôt know how clothes should fit. Not everyone needs to first develop an ‚Äúunfashionable‚Äù base before reaching for both fashionable and pragmatic, but I did.   As for Tibi, I know them most for silks and for their origami shapes. GoSilk is a great option for patterned silk and Roksanda has the shapes. Ganni and Comme Les Garcons has some of the quirkinesses and oversized looks. But none of them are cheap either unless you score a good sale. If you can identify exactly what you like about Tibi, we can make more recommendations.	episode_done:False
text:Thank you for this thoughtful and helpful answer! I come from the opposite end, full closet, constantly shifting from boho to grunge and then to sporty again until I was fed up with the whole "I don't know what to wear" thing - I never understood what exactly I liked about a clothing piece or style.  I ended up with some good quality basic pieces, not boring, functional, versatile and now I try to build from there. What I am really looking for are clothing pieces, in which an idea, a thought was invested - meaning there is something deliberate about it, interesting cut, texture, print. But I also want them to work together with other things I own.   Thank you for recommending Gianni and Comme des Garcons, I have some things from them and they are more affordable for me. I also like COS for good fabrics and robustness, but then again it is quite popular where I live and many people shop there too. Arket is even cheaper, but it is a little bland for me. There are also some european brands like Closed or Baum und Pferdgarten, Essentiel Antwerp, however it always depends on a particular season/trend whether I find something there or not.	labels:> Baum und Pferdgarten  Ohhh I love them, my local boutique has finally started carrying this and it‚Äôs so fun!	episode_done:True
text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:I love their (Amy, Dione, and the Tibi brand) style but sometimes their pretentiousness irks me. They go like oh you can wear whatever you like but then they come up with 1000 rules about what should not be worn together. Anyway, if you like that style and also like to DIY things you can totally adjust regular items to look like Tibi ones. For instance, the asymmetrical shirt that closes a bit on the diagonal, the buttons that are used to pull up the sleeves, the ankle bands on some of their pants, etc. can all be recreated relatively easily and you don't need to spend 100s of $ on their "affordable" items (Amy's words, I always crack up when she boasts about how affordable Tibi clothes are).	episode_done:False

text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:I have to say, I had never heard of Amy Smilovic before, but I am glad to have been introduced!  Her style and the Tibi style are really not anything that I would wear, and yet I find a lot of her advice really useful.  In particular, I watched her 'closet cleanout' story, and her "blocks" as ways of categorizing clothes make a lot more sense to me than the basics/statements dichotomy. She divides it into WOFs (WithOut Fails), I&Os (Ins & Outs), and HTHs (Had To Haves).  In this way, an item can be bold and colourful and still be a staple in my closet (a without fail), or it could be very simple and basic, and still fall into the In & Out or Had to Have category.  I guess in my mind, basics are usually black or a neutral colour, but statements are colourful, but that's not really how my style works. A head-to-toe black outfit isn't necessarily made of basics, and one that is full of colours isn't going to be garish if it's done right.  As long as a Had to Have is paired with many Without Fails, it will still look cohesive and "you".  I also love how Dione describes something that's matchy-matchy as being "lady" haha.

text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:This style is surprisingly attainable for me after several years of hardcore minimalism. Once I got to a place where my basics are both on point and super pragmatic, then I have been able to incorporate a few Tibi and Tibi-like statement pieces into my rotation. I‚Äôm no longer a minimalist in terms of style - I like buying a couple ‚Äúbig impact‚Äù things every year to jazz up my clothes, especially oversized  or dramatic drape or ‚Äúorigami structure‚Äù on tops and coats. A single piece really changes an outfit and you don‚Äôt need many pieces in rotation to suddenly change your style. Amy Smilovic appears to do a similar thing - keep several things ‚Äúbasic‚Äù (neutral color, solid/no pattern, uniform texture, unadorned (no bling or fringes etc) and the play with one thing (her thing seems to be oversized fit and pleats).  The only reason I bring up minimalism is because I cannot emphasize more how much the basics being ‚Äújust right‚Äù makes my dramatic pieces work. Especially with oversized, it‚Äôs a thin line between slob and stylish. Those big pleated dad pants Amy Smilovic wears? The rest of the outfit should be sharp or you look like you simply don‚Äôt know how clothes should fit. Not everyone needs to first develop an ‚Äúunfashionable‚Äù base before reaching for both fashionable and pragmatic, but I did.   As for Tibi, I know them most for silks and for their origami shapes. GoSilk is a great option for patterned silk and Roksanda has the shapes. Ganni and Comme Les Garcons has some of the quirkinesses and oversized looks. But none of them are cheap either unless you score a good sale. If you can identify exactly what you like about Tibi, we can make more recommendations.	episode_done:False
text:Can you please elaborate more on your "just right" basics?  I have been attempting to minimize my wardrobe and find that balance between creative expression and pragmatism for probably the last decade.  I love fashion, but live an active and semi-nomadic lifestyle that really demands a simplified and wearable wardrobe. Five or more years ago, this meant structuring my wardrobe around black leggings and a black stretchy h&m t-shirt dress. It worked for me then, but nowadays it feels both outdated and for someone younger than me.  I'm really trying to nail down the basics to make my \[often thrifted\] statement pieces look more elevated.  The other thing is that wearing tight bottoms and a loose or flowy top used to be fashionable, and it was ridiculously easy to style, at least for my body type.  Nowadays the silhouette has flipped (volume on the bottom) and I'm a little lost as to how to work that into a pared-down wardrobe.	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True

text:They regularly do, from different nations, famous people and those who wrote them or ask for advice. I don't know many of them, but if one follows their stories, Amy often shows looks by other people.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:I follow her too and am interested in the answers. I love the way she styles herself because she looks effortlessly cool to my eyes. The clothes mostly wouldn‚Äòt work for me because I‚Äòm only 5‚Äò1, so lots of things are too big. Anything ‚Äöoversized‚Äò just makes me look a little childish. I still try to incorporate some of her tips. There are brands like COS that do similar things with cool shapes and ‚Äödifferent‚Äò basics.  ETA: Do you like the pieces themselves or her style philosophy? Because occasionally I think the clothes she presents are.. pretty ugly, tbh	episode_done:False
text:I am whole 5'4 but I love oversize, especially now having workliveexisted at home for so many months, I cannot bother with uncomfortable clothes. I even started to look into men's section for interesting prints and roomy clothes. I love Amy's tips on how to look comfortable on different occasions but still put together, not sloppy.   Now when you asked, I think I really love the philosophy even more than clothes themselves. I love the suits, the knits, some of the tops. However I absolutely cannot wear the shoes, neither a sandal nor an "ironic" furry shoe because of practicality, dress code, weather. So yes, I think I am really looking for brands who share similar philosophy of creative basics.	labels:I agree, her tips on looking put together but still stylish and chic are great!   Haha, agree on the shoes! I wasn‚Äòt trying to diss the clothes, btw. Just amazed at how she and the brand stylist Dione manage to look amazing in weird items.	episode_done:True
text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:I love their (Amy, Dione, and the Tibi brand) style but sometimes their pretentiousness irks me. They go like oh you can wear whatever you like but then they come up with 1000 rules about what should not be worn together. Anyway, if you like that style and also like to DIY things you can totally adjust regular items to look like Tibi ones. For instance, the asymmetrical shirt that closes a bit on the diagonal, the buttons that are used to pull up the sleeves, the ankle bands on some of their pants, etc. can all be recreated relatively easily and you don't need to spend 100s of $ on their "affordable" items (Amy's words, I always crack up when she boasts about how affordable Tibi clothes are).	episode_done:False
text:I have to say I don't see them as hard rules, but more like principles of how to understand what looks good and what looks tired/tried-too-hard. For example, the rule of having only one white thing or not wearing necklaces and earrings or similar. I think it is a way of simplifying a formula of how to dress well, rules are easy to remember. At least it is my perception of what they are saying.  Yeah, concerning affordable items... It is above my reasonable clothes budget. I don't have to look expensive for my job and I would rather splurge for a good trip, books or a course. This is pragamtism for me.	labels:I know they say they that they are not hard rules and that nobody needs to follow them, but sometimes they sound condescending when talking about things that don't work for them and that's what I don't like.	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite outfits to wear with white booties?	labels:I love to pair them with monochromatic looks -- black pants, black turtleneck, light colored outer layer like a coat or cardi, and then the white boots. I also have a rust-colored corduroy jumpsuit that they look great with for full 70s vibes.  Also just bought a periwinkle blue suiting set and am dying to wear it with white boots and a white blouse, but it seems a crime to debut the outfit during work from home :(	episode_done:True

text:What are your favorite outfits to wear with white booties?	labels:White boots go well with patterned dresses! Modcloth has a few short 60s style patterned dresses, but a dress from any retailer could work. Because white is neutral, it could technically go with anything, but a pattern with white in it would help the boots stand out.   But yeah, I don't think anybody listens to the no white pants/shoes/whatever after Labor Day any more, lol.	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite outfits to wear with white booties?	labels:I think you can wear white booties with a lot of different outfits!

text:Ellen McArthur Circular Economy Report: by 2029 Resale is expected to be bigger than Fast Fashion	labels:Psyched to hear it. I'm a huge fan of physical and online consignment stores.   Thrift stores are great and I sometimes have the energy to dig through the esoteric offerings they have, but a well-curated consignment shop, especially an independent one is great for the community, great for sellers, great for the environment and great for me. So long as store owners are conscientious when examining the pieces they accept in-store, and are reasonable when they do the pricing, I think consignment shopping is the ideal shopping experience for me. I can find excellent condition, unique pieces from a variety of brands, at different price points - at price points far below what it would cost retail.	episode_done:True
text:Ellen McArthur Circular Economy Report: by 2029 Resale is expected to be bigger than Fast Fashion	labels:I'm all about this right now in an effort to be more environmentally conscious.

text:Ellen McArthur Circular Economy Report: by 2029 Resale is expected to be bigger than Fast Fashion	labels:Eh, I'm pretty skeptical about claims that fast fashion will die down any time soon. Especially this claim that resale will overtake it. How will that happen? Resale depends on new items being purchased. If people aren't buying as many new items, the stock at resale will drop. And if a ton of people are buying resale, the prices on the good stuff will continue to go up and result in a lot of people buying fast fashion because it's cheaper.  Fast fashion may not be high quality or eco-friendly, but it's inexpensive and offers a lot of variety, and that's always going to be in demand. Fast fashion won't die out unless a lot of governments put in strict regulations on labor and pollution and whatnot.	episode_done:True

RtR has a discount shop for the clothes they don't rent out anymore but it seems like they had even more inventory lying around and they handed it over to ThredUp to sell even steeper.  Add to that the great stuff happening on Postmark, Depop, Etsy, and TheRealReal, and it's awesome to be a thrifter right now. I'm glad its all expanding.  I've been doing slow fashion for a few years and a lot of my closet is now second hand which makes me happy. Idk what the trigger was for other people but when I found out that fashion is one of the biggest polluting industries in the world, it changed my whole perspective.

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:If you have the space to store your current wardrobe, then my advice to you is simply not to pressure yourself into getting rid of clothing that you're not comfortable getting rid of.  Minimalistic wardrobes are not for everybody, and you certainly wouldn't be helping anything if you were to throw away those clothes only to end up  buying replacements later.     Take the clothes that you don't think you need and set them aside, maybe in a box or the very back of your closet, and keep only your 'minimalist wardrobe' in the easily accessible location.  If, after a year, you find that you didn't really miss anything from the old collection of clothes, you won't feel as hesitant about getting rid of them.  If you have to dig a few things out of your stash, just keep them.  If you find that you've completely ransacked your stash over the course of a year, and ended up wearing everything you didn't think you needed, then, well... maybe minimalism isn't for you.	episode_done:True

What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping!

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:I very recently purged my wardrobe majorly. I ended up getting rid of lots of items that I loved in college, but they simply don‚Äôt suit me any longer as I‚Äôm finishing law school and beginning a professional career.   I kept asking myself, as I went through piece by piece, ‚Äúdoes this have a place in my future? When I envision myself as I wish to be perceived, does this article of clothing suit that version of myself?‚Äù I don‚Äôt mean it to sound super deep lol but that helped me a lot as I navigated trying to nail down a personal style.   I got rid of SO much, and I feel great. My closet looks so nice and less cramped and chaotic. I have been slowly incorporating some versatile basics, but before I make any new purchase I make myself think out three to five different ways I could style the piece with what I already have on hand.

text:That's actually really helpful! How do you suggest finding my style? I feel like I have such a wide style that I wear (minimal, to punk, to cutesy, etc). I feel like I love all of my clothes but some go months without being worn.	labels:A more direct answer to your question, and something that may help you cull your closet, is through a lot of self reflection and analysis.   Personal style exists at the intersection of life function and self expression. Clothing is the way you define yourself to the world, but is also integral in how well you function in that world. What purposes do you need your clothing to fulfill‚Äî do you need to have good pockets? Easy movement? Hypoallergenic fabrics? Do you have a work uniform? What do you want your clothing to say about yourself to others?   Of the things in your closet right now, what do you love? Why do you love it? Is it the texture of the fabric? The construction? Certain stylistic elements? The way it fits you? Get really specific, put it on and think about the fact that you‚Äôre wearing it as you‚Äôre going about your day and how you feel in it and why.    Keep going: What do you wear all the time? Why do you wear it all the time over other things? What do you hate? Why do you hate it? What do you never wear? Why not? What clothing do you hate but wear all the time or love but never wear and why? Spend a lot of time on these questions because they‚Äôll help you put the language to your needs and wants. When you have some answers, then you can start searching for trends amongst the things you love and the things you hate, and learning the details of clothing and construction that will best help you hone in on what you like. Review fabric composition; find your color trends; learn the names of structural elements that you see in several garments you love or hate; this will all help you seek out or avoid those better in the future.   Once you have some of those answers you can pointedly look for pieces to replace those that you hate but wear all the time with ones you love that align better with your needs or preferences, and you can cull accordingly.   Developing personal style is a journey and one in which there are no wrong answers. Your clothing should serve your wants and your needs.	episode_done:True

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:Hi! As a stylist I get this question ALOT. For starters don't get rid of too much before buying replacements. What ends up happening is we get rid of everything without establishing what pieces we actually need.   Start with establishing your personal style. What do your want your closet/style to be? What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping! Now that you have a moodboard and list of things you need you can shop to fin in the gaps and more importantly you can shop with intention!   &#x200B;  I hope that wasn't too much and was helpful haha. I'm always happy to help.	episode_done:False

Minimalism isn't a virtue and it's only valuable in so much as it matches your lifestyle, needs, and desires. You don't have to aim for minimalism for the sake of minimalism, or just because it‚Äôs in style. It's ok to own things that make you happy. It's ok to only wear something once every couple of months (or less often). You don't have to get rid of things just because you are not living up to some arbitrary standard of use.	episode_done:False

I know it's not wrong to have a big closet, I just want to have less. I enjoy donating clothes that I no longer have purpose for but I somehow still have a hard time getting rid of things.

text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:I did a patch with a pair of jeans I noticed wearing down a lot. Took some spare fabric (two pieces a bit larger than the palm of my hand, larger than the area that was wearing out) and sewed it on the inside around the area wearing out. Then set the sewing machine to a zigzag stitch with blue thread (a bit too light, but that‚Äôs what I had on hand) and just went to town going back and forth over the entire area. It‚Äôs worked well for more wears than any other patch methods I‚Äôve tried	episode_done:True

text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:I haven't worn jeans in over a decade, but i still do wear trousers.  When i buy them, i have to cut about 4" off the leg and hem them, so they aren't ludicrously long.  I save that fabric, and when the inner thighs get worn down i patch them from the inside.  The trousers i buy are already 2 layers on the seat and inner thigh, so once i'm down making the patch i carefully cut away the outer fabric layer that is fraying, exposing the 2nd layer with the patch all the way on the inside.    It's not perfect, but it gives me a couple years extra out of my work trousers.  The pair i have on now needs the patch installed, and i recall buying these 5 years ago.	episode_done:True

text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:I used to wear black jeans daily for work for about 8 years. A lot of that time I was broke af and spending $35 every 6 months or so on jeans was a really big purchase. I‚Äôd usually only have 1-2 pairs of work jeans at a time and wore them every day for 8-12 hours. When they ripped in the thighs I would hand sew them together very very poorly lol. I don‚Äôt know why I never looked up a tutorial or anything but the sewing would usually buy me 3-4 days until I could buy new ones.   Now that I‚Äôm more financially stable and I don‚Äôt have to wear black jeans to work, my pants tend to last a lot longer. When they wear out in the thighs/crotch I just toss them now. I no longer have to save jeans just in case I can‚Äôt fix the next pair and it‚Äôs very freeing.	episode_done:True

text:BOF Op-Ed: How Luxury Became Fast Fashion	labels:Luxury used to be expensive materials and construction.   But it's much more lucrative to sell "looks", "styles", and "trends". When they can't even sew on the buttons without threads sticking out of every hole, some too tight that I have to re-do myself.  I do believe that you can have luxury synthetics, but also that few brands use them. Even brands that go "ethical" and "timeless" in marketing avoid "quality" now. Because it's easy to prove quality. Using unprotected fluff-words and reputations made decades ago is much safer and can be used to inflate prices.  H&M collabs used to be amazing. I regret I didn't buy a wool jacket 5 years ago. It was a bit too expensive and heavy for me then. But the quality for price was GREAT. It did make me realize how shitty midrange clothing is.   Picking the right stuff from H&M will be better then brands that costs 5-10 times as much. It's really only the label that is different. And if H&M can't pay their worker much for that price, more expensive brands just doesn't. Why would they?  Does Amazon pay their workers more, or take out a larger profit? No one with the means of starting up international brands actually wants to offer a great product, made fairly, they want max profit. Greenwashing is great for profit, no need to prove anything, and keep selling shit that needs to be replaced after a few uses for premium prices.	episode_done:True

text:BOF Op-Ed: How Luxury Became Fast Fashion	labels:I agree with the article in the most of what added to the ‚Äòexclusivity‚Äô (besides the price point) if luxury brands has disappeared. I think it‚Äôs all still in the process of imploding though. These large fashion houses are all leveraging their names, which were built in times of higher exclusivity, to see diffusion lines, collaborations and perfume.   Between that and more and more designers trying to use the same trendy ideas, I‚Äôm not sure if the name recognition they have will last for much longer. I think we all know that luxury designers are shifting away from selling only luxury clothing/bags. But like if I‚Äôm going to get fast fashion quality, I‚Äôm gonna pay fast fashion prices.	episode_done:False

If I use them, I try to only go for designers not super popular for replicas because they've consistently been lax about checking for authenticity and if I want better replicas I might as well go on Taobao or WeChat.	labels:Wow I did not know that about their authentication system.

text:Less likely for Stella in particular - they are (or were till at least 2019) an official reseller of those products so they were getting a lot of their inventory directly from Stella McCartney.   My gut is that there are certain products (Hermes/Gucci logo belts, Chanel quilted bags, a Burberry scarf) that are more likely to be dupes initially and it would be better to stay away from TRR and try to find it elsewhere.   TRR is currently facing several lawsuits about how they misled investors in how their authenticators are trained, Chanel also alleges that they filed off serial numbers as a practice.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Are LBD‚Äôs really a MUST?	labels:I'd say it's not a must. It all depends on your life and your own style. I don't have an LBD, but I do have a navy dress that I could wear to work and go out and even to weddings - with the right accessories, of course. I think that's the whole point of the LBD - it's supposed to be a "blank canvas" type of clothes that goes with everything and you can accessorize it to fit the occasion. However, if you already have enough clothes for every occasion in your life, then it's definitely not necessary to go out and buy an LBD just because it's on some list of must-haves.	episode_done:False

text:Are LBD‚Äôs really a MUST?	labels:I think it is a must as much as the trench or the white button down - it does not necessarily work for all of us, either our lifestyles or bodies.  Trench coats were invented when people wore hats, hence no hood, and they are IMO impractical for rain compared to hooded raincoats and can drown a lot of women's bodies particularly if they are not tall. Or if they bike, or whatever.   Little black dresses were probably a fantastic idea in the 60s, where women would dress formally for the office, or go to cocktail parties afterward. Right now I think the LBD probably is good for one thing, the specific cocktail or aperos or dunno a party given by your inlaws or something. I think it is something work having - but buy it cheap and/or in sale because likely you will not wear it lots... And focus on fitting (not too tight, not too short), if you find an affordable one which fits great and you have the budget/space, worth having. But do not go all check-list getting.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD‚Äôs really a MUST?	labels:I think it‚Äôs a must but I don‚Äôt think it has to technically be a ‚ÄúLBD‚Äù. As long as the color is a dark neutral like navy, burgundy, or charcoal it‚Äôs fine and a very subtle pattern or texture is okay too, like an obvious woven or tweed. As for the dress part, it could be a non-little dress or even a jumpsuit. For me, I think it‚Äôs a relief to have a go to outfit for certain situations. Here are some imaginary ones for someone your age: your boyfriend/girlfriend‚Äôs conservative parents decide to surprise visit them at school and they want to take you both to a nice restaurant for dinner tonight; you need to attend a wake for someone who passed away suddenly; you get a call that there‚Äôs a new spot open for a highly competitive summer internship and interviews are only a couple days away. In each of these scenarios, it‚Äôs so much easier to know that you have a go-to look that is always appropriate especially since some of these can be stressful without worrying about your outfit.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD‚Äôs really a MUST?	labels:Don't be too worried about looking like everyone else, clothes aren't always about standing out. I think it's good to have a classy black dress just in case you get invited somewhere you have to dress nice. Like maybe you need to do a poster presentation for your thesis, or your org has a formal. They're easy to dress up or down depending on accessories.    Honestly, if you can't think of an occasion where you'd wear one, then you don't need one! I just like the simplicity of a black dress sometimes, esp if you have accessories that you want to emphasize.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD‚Äôs really a MUST?	labels:Nothing is a fashion must if you‚Äôre not going to wear it. I will say I‚Äôve found the perfect black dress for me: it has long sleeves and a subtle shimmer, and I get a lot of use out of it.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD‚Äôs really a MUST?	labels:Black and white are too harsh on my skin so a LBD and a white blouse are pointless in my wardrobe. I have a grey linen sheath dress, an olive green a line linen dress and a navy dress with white flowers in a sateen fabric. All three of these dresses are from Target and are my go to dresses for events. The sheath dress and the navy dress have been worn to weddings, Christmas dinners,  interviews and school pictures. My green dress is my go to when I don't know what to wear and want to feel good. If you already have an interview outfit then I would consider getting a cocktail dress in a fabric and print/colour that you love. I had a coral pink lace dress that took me to weddings, graduations, fancy lunches and theatre performances until I grew out of it. I changed up the accessories and nobody commented even though it was memorable. How many dress up events happen at this point in your life? Dress for the life you have now. Also, the best time to pick up a cocktail dress seems to be around horse racing carnivals.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD‚Äôs really a MUST?	labels:Nope.  If there‚Äôs a funeral or school- or work-related event I MUST go to, I already have a plain black suit I wear to interviews, and I can just use that. It‚Äôs serious enough.  If I‚Äôm going somewhere nice because I WANT to, I‚Äôm going to wear something I WANT to wear. I am a color fanatic, and a black dress is not on the list of things I like wearing. Black doesn‚Äôt even look good on me, anyway.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD‚Äôs really a MUST?	labels:Nah. I bought into that, and bought the dress. And honestly never used it.  The idea of having one dress forever is ridiculous. Styles change, bodies change, tastes change.   I‚Äôm not saying buy a dress that only fits one occasion but if you buy a dress you actually like regardless of colour or style/occasion you‚Äôll probably get more use out of it.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD‚Äôs really a MUST?	labels:Nothing is a must.  As someone who has travelled, I can attest why such pieces that are considered "musts" exist. The LBD is a considered a "must" because it's a simple piece you can take from day to night, style up or down with accessories.  If you don't need a quick or versatile piece in your wardrobe, a LBD isn't a must because you don't need it. If dresses aren't your thing, then an LBD isn't a must because you'll never reach for it. If black is actually a colour that looks bad on you, then the LBD isn't a must either. ETC.  You have to evaluate your own needs to see if you need an LBD. In general, I'd say most women wouldn't mind wearing a dress, so an LBD (it can be another colour) is something that can get a lot of use. A simple white dress in summer is the best candidate to understand it.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD‚Äôs really a MUST?	labels:Not a must in my opinion.  I had some black dresses a couple  of years ago and I never wore them.   What works for someone else might not be for you. Don't feel pressured to buy stuff you dislike just because someone else says you (and all other women) should.	episode_done:True

text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:Skiing is a strenuous sport, often done in a dangerous alpine climate. I wear technical gear: bright loose waterproof jacket and pants for visibility and mobility, wicking warm base layers, balaclavas and goggles to protect my eyes and skin, a helmet, and a backpack or fanny pack with an emergency kit.   After skiing, I strip off the outer layers and walk around in uggs, tights, and turtleneck.   You know what? I 100% blend in. I don't look better or worse than the hundreds of other people who have just come down from the mountain. This is why people specifically wear bright colors. Your party will be able to identify you at a distance from the specific colors you're wearing.   I think ski/apres ski style is to skiing what cottage core is to farming/homesteading. It's an aesthetic for people who don't actually do it.   If you like the look and aren't interested in skiing, then look into some New England heritage preppy looks. The bean boots, scandi wool sweaters, thick stretchy stirrup pants, fluffy trimmed accessories, and parkas may appeal to you. Uniqlo has some cute stuff in their recent collab that has that cozy lux vibe. Moncler and Gorsuch are some OG European ski fashion wear companies. You could look into those for inspiration.   But definitely don't try to go skiing without a waterproof pant and jacket combo. You will have a terrible time, given how much you will likely fall.

It's an aesthetic for people who don't actually do it.  I can agree with this.  I live 20 miles from Breck, and any person you see who has been out on the slopes are wearing fearing athletic and technical looking gear.  For most restaurants, people aren't dressed in furs or look glam at all.  It's mostly basic bitch type winter garb - knit hats with a fur pom pom, long puffer jackets, skinny jeans.    If you go to Aspen though that's a bit of a different story.  More money over there so you'll see "fancier" people.	labels:20 miles is 32.19 km	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels: Top Apres ski pic is Aspen, isn't it? Unless every resort town has those sidewalks.  Honestly, if really unsure here, I'd look at hashtags and gallery pics from local bars to see what people are wearing.  Denim is COLD in these climates and unpleasant if you're going to be outside a lot.   I feel as if Gorsuch and Alp-n-Rock do these looks well, but yeah, expensively. I would probably look for similar on Asos and maybe Tommy Hilfiger for "sporty but make it sweaters."	episode_done:True

text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:Personally, I try to avoid the thinking of what I'm going to wear when I'm going somewhere, other than for functionality of course.  I feel like we expect our personalities and our lives to suddenly become glamorous and completely different once we get there, but that rarely happens in reality.  Same with vacation to a tropical paradise. Or a new job. Or a move unto the city. If I'm not a person that's likely to look glam, polished and picture perfect in everyday life, I won't have the energy to do so on vacation either. Plus, it's vacation, a time for me to feel relaxed and do fun stuff, not a time to focus on changing oneself to someone I'm not!  That's my thoughts! I feel like social media, selling and marketing is especially targeting in this way. When we see a product we want it, not just because it's appealing for the eye but also because we expect these things to change what we don't like about ourselves. Things we don't really want or have the energy to change ourselves, so we expect stuff to do it for us if we just buy them.	episode_done:False

It is a nostalgic viewpoint that largely ignores the social and political structures tied to it. There are a lot of reasons people don't dress up on a daily basis anymore, including:  * women aren't relegated to being homemakers anymore * a woman's value is no longer solely attributed to her appearance * people's lives are a lot more complicated and multifaceted than they were before * people move around a lot more than they did before * people face greater economic pressures that before * lifestyles and social values, in general, have changed  While there will always be social/cultural expectations that dictate what is appropriate to wear in a given situation, it is generally a good thing that we now have more freedom of choice in what to wear on a daily basis.	episode_done:False

Obviously being rich isn‚Äôt a bad thing, but pushing it in people‚Äôs faces is.  At my last office when I wore nice heels and cardigans I‚Äôd get attitude from other women basically saying they were more evolved or had more important things to do in their lives so they didn‚Äôt bother with heels, or implying that I was anti feminist. Some people made comments about my ‚Äúnot understanding challenges, etc‚Äù. I‚Äôd also get extra attention from men which is great, but not at work. To be clear I‚Äôm not even talking about my usual over the top style. I‚Äôm talking about office friendly Zara and Uniqlo with the pieces put together in a thought out way. It was a toxic office but, some just are.  A lot of people paint dressing down as something you do for comfort because you‚Äôre practical, hardworking, have important things to do, more than your appearance, modern, not shallow, etc so sometimes the criticism is that you‚Äôre not those things if you like to dress up and that can be really damaging.  In college I dressed nicely to class for a few semesters. It was a small school and when I had difficulty in a subject, it was heavily implied that I was having trouble because I was too focused on my appearances (I wasn‚Äôt. I just was thoughtful in my purchases and find dresses more comfy). Started wearing leggings and jeans and T-shirt‚Äôs and was taken more seriously when I said I was working hard.  When I went to the doctor dressed up they wouldn‚Äôt take my symptoms as seriously as when I dressed down.  It‚Äôs stupid and judgey and goes to show how many people don‚Äôt know anything about clothes. (Ie. It takes no effort to dress well if you‚Äôre thoughtful in buying them) but it‚Äôs a sentiment that exists in some places and it‚Äôs challenging to deal with.	episode_done:False

In my opinion, a LOT of products could use more/better designers, including fashion.   Maybe it‚Äôs the ‚Äúhard times‚Äù mentality of my generation (millennial), buy the fundamental question of design (full disclosure, I do not work in design) is ‚ÄúWhat is the problem I‚Äôm solving?‚Äù In my opinion, a lot of clothing fails to meet the basic expectations of utility.

Bad takes of runway shows or industry inside baseball are easy enough to gloss over, but poor critique actively inhibits people's learning.   If anything, "You do you"-type comments are _even worse_ for people who are only involved out of a sense of obligation; clothing is non-verbal communication, and if you're attempting to portray a certain image you want to make sure it's perceived properly. I frequently interview people who show up in outfits that don't convey an appropriate message (e.g. wearing a suit when it's explicitly called out to not do so in our interviewing materials).  > I‚Äôve been an off and on follower of FFA for a few years and I feel like it‚Äôs definitely dominated by the ‚Äúpeople who wear clothes‚Äù group and unfortunately it limits the amount of critique that is acceptable to give.

I agree, I think this sub is made up of people who enjoy looking at clothes or just want to know how to dress appropriately for work & school. There's a few subjects *related* to the industry as a whole that people are passionate about, like sustainability & ethics, but I don't think this sub is able to appreciate fashion as a form of art.   I agree that a *you do you* isn't very helpful. If someone specifically asks for constructive criticism, they want feedback from people with an eye for detail. If it looks like their blazer or pants need to be tailored a bit, then let them know if they're seeking constructive criticism.	labels:	episode_done:True

(If you do order one of their long sleeve tops, size up...My first order I got my usual size and wow that was a mistake! Lol) they don't have a great amount of colors unfortunately...  NAADAM is also a great place to get cashmere. They're ethical/sustainable and pretty reasonably priced for cashmere items. I have about 5 of their $75 cashmere sweaters and one that is $125. Totally cute, warm, and comfortable! Lots of colors to choose from as well!

text:What are your go-to basic fall tops? I‚Äôm talking long sleeve tees, sweatshirts, turtlenecks etc!	labels:Uniqlo heattech under shirts! They allow me to actually wear my lighter flannels and other "spring" items like trench coats without freezing. My style tends towards more "tailored" than "cozy" so these are super helpful, but they go great under sweatshirts as well!  Nowadays with the pandemic, I have ended up wearing lounge wear way more often than I normally would have and it's surprised me how different they can feel with longer-term wear! In the past I just kind of thought that a sweatshirt is a sweatshirt, they're so baggy anyway so what does it matter. But now I have a very clear preference. My favourite sweatshirts are definitely Roots, they retain that "coziness" for much longer than my other ones. My Forever 21 ones turned stiff pretty quickly, which wasn't surprising. My H&M ones also turned stiff and kept getting skinnier and skinnier, and I swear it wasn't me gaining weight lol. My Nike ones also got skinnier, but it didn't turn stiff or lose colour, and the zipper kept its shape well.   My favourite tee shirts are actually my old American Apparel ones, they somehow managed to get more cozy with every wash without going ratty, although the screen-print is fading. Although I'm aware that the management of AA (or Los Angeles Apparel now) have justifiably raised questions around ethics and bigotry, so it's up to the individual whether you're comfortable with their products.	episode_done:True

text:Tips for easily looking more modern/in style?	labels:I've heard the advice to buy 5 low-cost pieces of clothing that is in fashion per season to keep up with trends. Obviously if you see something more expensive that you love then feel free to go for it but my main point being that it doesn't have to be an entire new wardrobe of high priced clothing, it can literally be ¬£50-100 at H&M 4 times a year buying pieces that slot into your existing wardrobe (e.g. a top or a coat or a pair of shoes). If a certain style becomes precious to you then you can always upgrade that piece.  Like for example skinny jeans are not quite the fashion of the moment but you'd still look pretty current if you paired them with a puff sleeve top. Sleek white trainers are not as on trend as some of the chunkier clunky dad styles in white but they'd still look OK with your slightly frumpy prairie dress.	episode_done:True
text:Tips for easily looking more modern/in style?	labels:I would recommend updating your "fashion basics" like plain t-shirts and jeans first because then more unique pieces will just look unique, not outdated. For instance, consider a black t-shirt with jeans. Ten ish years ago you might have a vneck tshirt and boot cut mid wash jeans, five years ago probably skinny jeans in a darker wash and a slim crew neck, and now maybe a square neck bodysuit with light wash straight jeans. But on the other hand if you have some kind of, I don't know, cool bomber jacket, it doesn't really look out of date especially because thrifting is in right now.	episode_done:True
text:Tips for easily looking more modern/in style?	labels:Depends on what you have, what you like. Assuming you have basics you like, the easiest and quickest way to "modernize" is to get one top or bottom in the shape or color of the season, and a pair of shoes.  Right now loafers are having a moment, extra modern is ones with chunkier soles. Chunky knit tops are having a moment, particularly cardigans. So you can get a chunky knit cardigan, chunky loafers, and pair with jeans and you are more "current."   Or you can swap your normal jeans with a straight legged faux leather trouser and those same loafers.   I like to follow sites like Coveteur, Who What Wear, or the Zoe Report and read their trend roundups and adopt accordingly (for me that means after I have vetted it is the sort of trend I would like.)	episode_done:True

text:Tips for easily looking more modern/in style?	labels:Hi,  I think you have to consider what is modern in your country/area/city if your goal is to appear modern. Eg tight leather pants and overknee boots were quite modern where I live 1-2 years ago but they would seem outdated now, but I still see them on instagram in other countries.  But generally, for a vibe, I would look at early seasons of friends (monika!) and fashionable movies and music videos (eg don't speak!) from the early to mid 90s for silhouettes, trouser cuts and articles of clothing you can add to your wardrobe. Other posters already got more detailed so I'll skip that.  Also I think looking at the websites of fashion forward brands like Zara and Monki help with finding out whats modern in terms of silhouettes, combinations and color stories without having to necessarily buy from them.	episode_done:False

text:ModCloth Returns to ‚ÄúIndependent‚Äù Ownership	labels:I always want to want to love ModCloth but they‚Äôre so expensive and so *inconsistent*. You knew how things were going to fit or what the quality was. I know things came from all over designer wise so it‚Äôs hard to really control for size that way but it was still frustrating as the consumer. Post Walmart acquisition the quality absolutely went down and their pieces really lost that kinda retro funk they were known for. I still pop by once in awhile, maybe things will turn around for them again	episode_done:True
text:ModCloth Returns to ‚ÄúIndependent‚Äù Ownership	labels:I still buy a lot of ModCloth stuff for work, it's not all cutesy. I have a lot of really good wardrobe staples and so many work dresses from there. Basically, anytime I'm buying new, I go to ModCloth, but that's only once or twice a year. Everything else I thrift	episode_done:True
text:ModCloth Returns to ‚ÄúIndependent‚Äù Ownership	labels:Reading through the comments it really seems like Modcloth's problem has been consistency of quality all along, and not just since the Walmart takeover. I personally used to shop the website a lot, (especially for quirky jewelry and accessories!) and while I have a soft spot for many of those pieces (especially the blazer I mentioned under another comment) now that I'm really sitting here thinking about it there were def others that didn't last well or look as good in person. I also started thinking about how at that age pretty much all my income was disposable (living at home, no kids) so I guess it didn't bother me as badly if something wasn't worth what I paid for it, especially if it was cute enough to make an outfit with once or twice. So maybe the real issue with the site is its failure to adapt to its customer base's changing needs. Or, alternatively, to attract new and younger customers by staying on trend. I think there's probably a market for quirky but still trendy pieces , but a "vintage" aesthetic is a hard sell when thrifting is much more common now (not to mention cheaper and more responsible).	episode_done:True
text:ModCloth Returns to ‚ÄúIndependent‚Äù Ownership	labels:1. I'm ambivalent. Tbh, I've been ambivalent about the ownership both pre and post WalMart. I have a lot of friends and family in the Pittsburgh area, which was one of the places where ModCloth is based, and there was a big trend of hiring young grads then mass layoffs. I don't love that in a company.  2. I love the old Modcloth aesthetic. I feel like in the past couple years its lost its vision of what it is or who its customer is. I'm having flashbacks to the awkward 80s officewear that was in all the ads a season or two ago. \*shudders\* But my older Modcloth clothes were all decent quality, with pockets in dresses, and the fit and flare dress aesthetic is very flattering on my body type. I still have quite a few ModCloth pieces, even after changing sizes since my ModCloth heyday, and they are still some of my favorite items that I own. 3. I hope so. But to survive, they're going to have to take a hard look at who their target customer is, and build a vision for themselves as a brand that fits that. And they should be better to their employees, because if you want to build a quirky and fun brand, you want to have all the institutional knowledge you can get to help your business grow. 4. ModCloth in its early days was so good at appealing to quirky but classy customers. People who wanted clothes that were good quality, had a unique aesthetic, had pockets, and were size-inclusive. I think that if ModCloth could embrace the "quirky but high quality" niche that it would grow and retain loyal customers. Brands lose customers when they hit that point where the quality goes downhill but the prices stay the same. And it would be even better if there would also be a focus on ethical and sustainable clothing that still fits the ModCloth vibe, kind of like Madewell but make it vintage.	episode_done:True
text:ModCloth Returns to ‚ÄúIndependent‚Äù Ownership	labels:ModCloth is so sentimental for me lol. I was in high school when the twee fashion craze was really in its peak, and as a wannabe blogger I was all about ModCloth‚Äôs dresses and jewelry. I still love quirky pieces so I check their stuff out from time to time, but the quality seems like it‚Äôs really gone down since I was getting dresses for Christmas as a teenager.	episode_done:True
text:ModCloth Returns to ‚ÄúIndependent‚Äù Ownership	labels:I loved Modcloth, I bought most of my clothes from there. After the Walmart take over I ordered two dresses to test the waters. The zippers were made out of plastic and broke right away, the stitching was off and both dresses were really underwhelming in person.  I was tempted and ordered a sweatshirt on sale a few months ago and it was made out of the worst and cheapest feeling fabric I've ever encountered. In their defense, they refunded me for all three of the items. I just don't think they're worth another shot.	episode_done:True

text:Are our ideas about what looks ‚Äúdated‚Äù on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:I think there might be some correlation. First of all the older we get the less likely we are to try new things and I am sure that affects clothing too. But that does not mean that 40 year olds can't wear trends just because some of their age group don't.   I remember my mother sometimes saying that certain things have a grandma vibe for her or look dated. But for me it was something completely different, because I was not around when those styles were popular the first time (or I was a litle kid) so they don't remind me of that. And it's also obvious that I could not have bought it at that time and just never threw it out, because I am too young. So I guess some pices might look dated on a 40 year old, but not on a 20 year old.  On the other hand, I have no problem with older clothes if they are paired with other pieces that are more trendy. There is no reason to throw away your favorite sweater just because it's older than 5 years. Some pieces are classics.	episode_done:True

text:Are our ideas about what looks ‚Äúdated‚Äù on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:For me (almost 34), I think it's the progression of time seems to have sped up. It's like, I buy a pair of designer jeans (an investment!) and get a good season out of them. I love them. Then I get pregnant and have to do maternity clothes for almost a year (barf). Then post partum changes your body and I just miss my old clothes. I can't fit in them so miss another season. By the time you lose the weight and can fit in your favorite jeans, it's summer. Okay, I'll wait for fall. Fall comes and apparently the waist height is dated? That's bullshit, you JUST bought them.. 3 years ago. That doesn't feel like that long ago.  It was the same with some over the knee boots I bought 5yrs ago. Beautiful leather. I wore them one season, then pregnancy changed my shoe size. Then the post partum phase I was always bending over and on the floor, things over the knee boots did not do well. I needed slip ons. Okay. The next 3 years and two more kids, can't wait till I'm back in the life phase where I can wear my boots! Except now they're 'dated'. Again, total bullshit. Shoes should be fashionable for that period of time. Ugh, I'm wearing them anyway.   Just my theory. I'm currently super frustrated by t shirt lengths. I can't keep my jeans and buy new t-shirts. I now need to update all my jeans or show an awkward amount of stomach. I'll do it, but I'm going to be old and grumpy while I do it.	episode_done:True
text:Are our ideas about what looks ‚Äúdated‚Äù on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:I think that as we age, we have more responsibilities crowding in that can push out time for staying current with fashion, unless we make intentional choices to carve out that time.  I also think that our fashion circles change as we age - it‚Äôs not natural to be surrounded by whatever is trendy for people in their teens - early 20s. I‚Äôm 33 and work in academia - the students I teach have a very different perception of what is trendy/cool than I do, and I would assume that a lot of that has to do with the influencers and social media we consume.  There was a discussion here a few weeks ago about Gen Z vs Millennial fashion, and I was cracking up - I am pretty fashionable in my same-age friend set, but a lot of the comments from the Gen Z participants described items that look ‚Äúold‚Äù to them that I still wear regularly.   I think the other piece of this is pairing. Most items that cycle back around in style may be older items, but they have to be styled differently than they were the first time to look fresh (*cough Doc Martens cough*). If someone styles a currently trendy item the same way they did 10-20 years ago, it will probably look dated even if the item itself is trendy.   Finally, as we age, I think we stop thinking of fashion as one of the only ways we can communicate who we are to the world. When I was 22, I cared a lot more about what my clothes said about me because I didn‚Äôt yet have many professional/personal accomplishments. Now, I care a lot less. Style is a enjoyable hobby for me so I still think about my clothes, but more as a way to have fun - at this point, I‚Äôve built somewhat of a professional reputation for myself and my clothes don‚Äôt need to have such a prominent voice to others.	episode_done:True
text:Are our ideas about what looks ‚Äúdated‚Äù on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:>Do you think there‚Äôs an age where the concept of what looks ‚Äúdated‚Äù changes? This has been on my mind a lot and a comment in the ‚Äúwhat will be obsolete‚Äù thread played into it - someone said that skinny jeans will vanish... except on women around or over 40.  Some women kind of freeze their style in their 30s or even 20s. I am not sure why though. But I have friends who are like fussy children eating, they want just this or that precise cut. I think it is fun to try stuff just to try it out but no they want precise duplicates or very similar items to what they had. I think a lot of women can kind of research "flattering" for their body type or coloring (that horrible season theory...) and then it is like they graduated it, no more thinking about it, they stick to the rules they know. With a friend of mine it is massive list. I try to not push things at people, but once it was fun to see her revelation that OK, yes, horizontal stripes do look good on her (and she bought it and wore it lots) just because she thought she knew she was too heavy to wear stripes (no.... depends width, cut but it can look very nice).  I think datedness is a thing in general for every item, everything kind of is in an environment and we can not even see details which seem so obvious and only right way to do something but which will change in a few years. But unless something is too extreme, often there is ways to wear different waist lines, different pant width or hemlines, different things more timelessly. It helps though if the whole outfit is blended, if the shoes or bag or other pieces are more modern...  Getting a piece in a new trend, and combining it with older pieces can produce a lot of very different "new" right-now outfits.	episode_done:True

My idea of what is flattering isn‚Äôt going to change.

So I‚Äôm sure there are a lot of factors but i can only speak for the ones i feel influenced by. I have an image of what is flattering in my mind as molded by my time and place in the world. I have an image for what qualifies as ‚Äúclassic‚Äù and ‚Äútimeless‚Äù built from the same culture. The youths are and will always come up in different times and places and they will eventually recognize me as the aged and tired woman that i am and that‚Äôs fine. May they speak kindly of my hair and makeup choices always as they will someday be gawked at and mocked as well.    I‚Äôd love to know what we elder millennials and x-gen‚Äôers would list as ‚Äúdated‚Äù that wouldn‚Äôt come to mind for late teens and early twenty-somethings! I think of outfits that are too matchy-matchy (belt, purse, and shoes look like they were sold as a set; eyeshadow and lipstick both match the blouse; earrings and necklace have the same charm), heels that are blocky and /or white, hairspray, visible and neutral socks, and bulky/shapeless knits (shoulder pads; scratchy looking yarn; stiff and puffy shapes).   But am i so old that i don‚Äôt realize the younger people haven‚Äôt even witnessed these things in the wild or in the movies? Do they think side-swept bangs are our shoulder pads? Someone please bridge this gap in the convo because I‚Äôm fascinated.	episode_done:True
