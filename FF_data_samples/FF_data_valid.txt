text:Places like American Eagle usually have size xs in shirts and 28 inseam in pants.  Peter Manning Is a brand made for short people with small inseams, but is fairly expensive.  You can also always get something longer and have it hemmed.  If you want a more mature style, I would focus on limiting logoed clothing or graphic t-shirts, leather footwear, navy or sand chinos, and casual button downs.  Good easy way to come across as mature but not stuffy.  Also just because you are skinny doesn't mean everything needs to fit skinny.  I also find some layering can help.  One of my go to layered outfits would be brown boots, khaki chinos, light blue button down, grey crewneck, navy barbour jacket	labels:	episode_done:True

So jeans, a transparent black jumper, and a long floofy cardigan. Nothing matches, the jeans are a bit tight around the waist, but at least it's a bralette underneath my jumper. Imagine an eternity with underwires! Maybe that's why so many of the female ghosts from the corseted ages are wailing all the time - they're bloody uncomfortable!   I died slipping on my driveway cleaning up the Halloween decorations.  I guess I'd be called the Candid Wanderer, given that I'm an immigrant and died searching for what I'm supposed to do in life. And that I'd be brutally, brutally honest with those I'm haunting: pretty much any rich entitled white man I happen to come across. I'll constantly whisper truths about how he got the life he got.

Spare clothes, diaper changing station, toys, sippy cup, rags, wipes, oRgAnIc snacks, baby sunglasses, hat, sunscreen, homeopathic bug spray, first aid kit, inflatable bouncy house, tricycle, ukelele, puppet show... I show other moms I'm the best by being the most prepared mom on the playground.

text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:Brown, knee length boots, that fit my long legs and thick ankles. I found one pair, once, and wore them almost everyday for 2 years until I wore holes in the soles. I should have weatherized those bad boys.  It has been 3 years, and I have not found a suitable replacement.   Since the issue is that I can't quite get the boot on, sales people often suggest I special order the wide calf. However, since I am sooooo close, or can fit more relaxed/slouchy styles, I really don't want to make a nonrefundable special order without making sure my relatively "normal" upper calf doesn't look ridiculous.   I once ordered custom boots, but they were supposed to take 6 weeks and I canceled the order after week 14. Given how hard it was to get my money back, I'm now terrified of dropping that kind of dough again.	episode_done:True

The custom size costs only $9 on top of the garment price which is super affordable!
text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:When washing, zip, button, and tie absolutely everything; turn each piece inside out (and while you're doing that, clip any loose threads); put shirts, sweaters, underwear, and anything else you care about in their own lingerie bags (the ones branded Tide are great); separate by color *and* weight; never use hot water; use minimal soap and/or run an extra rinse cycle with a cup of white vinegar in it to get rid of soap residue; only use the dryer for linens and towels and then only on low; avoid dryer sheets. Oh, and dab a bit of clear nail polish on the thread of each button when you first take the tags off a garment -- your buttons will stay on much longer.

I'm anything between a 29 inch & 31/32 inside leg, depending on what type of trouser I'm going for. Does opting for slim fir, or trousers with stretch, make it better or worse?

And I won't find any like minded guys at work. I'm in STEM college administration. The dean of the college was talking about how he had gotten a new suit (from Lands' End) and he and one of the associate deans talked about how both of them think it's perfectly fine to *staple* a leg hem that comes undone or use a marker on your skin underneath a small hole in a suit.  So I'm think I'm sticking here for the foreseeable future.	labels:> The dean of the college was talking about how he had gotten a new suit (from Lands' End)  This dean deaned hard.   >one of the associate deans talked about  Yesss ass. dean doing ass. dean things!

It is that we are generally in a classic menswear renaissance.

I would also say that the state of the economy really depends on your locale. Here in rural east Texas, people seem to be doing okay.

Three items I regularly use during the year when used together are way better than just a single winter coat IMO (used a Canada Goose to go skiing once ... personally found it really uncomfortable and harder to move in).  Have fun!	episode_done:True
text:Walmart fashion a “new” thing as seen on IG bloggers?	labels:It's a trend but also most influencers are getting pretty cheap clothing from places like Fashion Nova, Shein and Pretty Little Thing so I'm sure the quality isn't too different.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 26, 2020	labels:Been thinking about using some Christmas money on sewing patterns and books to fuck around to try to make my own unstructured sack jackets, high rise trousers, and outerwear. The catalyst has been wanting the Beams+ corduroy patchwork balmacaan, but not willing to pay for it, and just getting frustrated that I can't find any sack jackets (vintage or new) or pants in the fabrics I want for a price I'm willing to pay.  Am I crazy to think that's a reasonable endeavor? I'm concerned I've got some hubris about it since my mom was a family and consumer ed teacher and I've made quilts and shit with her in the past.

Random thrift store men's Umbro sweatpants with velcro side pockets.   ALL the oversized sweatshirts.   Patagonia synchilla fleece.	episode_done:True

text:What was your first 'expensive' fashion purchase?	labels:I think mine was like a Triple 5 Soul hoodie that I bought from Aritzia waaaay back when I was 20. At that time most of my wardrobe was from American Eagle, so spending $100+ on a hoodie was a pretty big deal for me.	episode_done:True

text:That isn't my experience with them, I've had my pair of Scouts for three years in regular rotation (2-3 times/week) and they're fine?

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 01	labels:I am looking for some comfortable casual shoes I can wear both with chinos/jeans and with scrubs (in the hospital). I've been wearing allbirds, but they get worn out so fast that it seems like I need to buy a new pair constantly. They also aren't as comfortable as I had hoped they would be. I've seen people mention the EQT Support 93/17 shoes, though I don't think they make those anymore, and the only ones I can find are the red ones which are a little too colorful for working in a professional setting.
text:I really like Eddie Bauer's Superior Down Parka, almost always available on sale for a fraction of the the regular price.  Keep in mind that Down works best when you're active in the cold, its properties are diminished if your outdoor activities are limited to waiting for buses on your commutes.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Plants and Fashion: A Marriage of Obsessions	labels:I am in LOVE with the plant aesthetic going on now. In college many of my friends made fun of me for my grandma/plant aesthetic (this was in 2009-2013  in FL where going out everything was boho festival/tribal print or LMFAO party rock neon rave shit with sprinklings of bodycon wear). I had my plants, my floral dresses/blankets, and I started knitting because I loved the look of chunky homemade knits with witchy floral prints. Those same people who called me grandma now dig my floral prints. I feel very vindicated. XD	episode_done:True

text:What niche do you feel is missing from the fashion blogging/YouTube world?	labels:even though i'm not in this demographic myself, i would like to see more younger mid/plus size creators that have a more trendy style but still not "basic" if you know what i mean because i feel like a lot of plus size teens feel like they can't dress how they want to because of their size :(	episode_done:True
text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:TikTok, Instagram, Twitter... buy multiple (online) magazines... But in my honest opinion; do not follow trends, trends come and go like seasons but only style remains. Just follow your heart, it's not 2008 anymore... Everyone is on Instagram and Twitter these days and there are just toooo many trends all over the world to keep up with it. But if your heart says follow trends, well... Then get lots of subscriptions to magazines and follow blogs which weirdly enough, is still a thing in 2020 ;)	episode_done:True
text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:My fashion sense leans more streetwear and I don't know how I lived before owning plain white sneakers. They go with everything in my closet and make even the most casual outfit look intentional.	episode_done:True
text:Covid Dilemna - Finding my style	labels:This isn't a perfect solution, but you could gather photos taken of you in the past, and all the clothes you currently own, and do a combination of analyzing what clothing in your outfit photos works/what doesn't, and try on different clothes for specific things like neckline, hemline, color, pattern, etc.
text:What’s something you wish you could tell clothing manufacturers to do differently?	labels:Jeans of different colors but same size should fit the same. I shouldn't be two different sizes in jeans from the same brand, same style just because its a different color.	episode_done:True
text:Best and Worst Purchase of 2020	labels:Best:  three flannels.  Took a notion that I wanted a few more shirts to add to my winter rotation of four denim and a cord.  Kept looking in the charity shops and eventually found them, and they fitted fine when I got them tried on at home.  Another one had turned out too small, it may go to a smaller friend.  Worst: not fashion or even clothes but a real disappointment.  Ordered a pizza to have with my friend for my birthday (he is my bubble-person so legit).  It was "ok" but not worth the difference in price to a supermarket one.  No lovely "pizza smell" for a start (UK here, even ordered pizzas don't have whatever herb/seasoning gives the smell!).	episode_done:True
text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process? What would you prioritize?	labels:Several solid pieces from a mid brand and then a few special, high quality pieces. An amazing trench, a beautiful bag, etc. Reserving $2k for one or two splurges, $3k still gets a lot of really good stuff. Fifteen $200ish pieces? Ugh. A dream.	episode_done:True
text:Green Queens: An Inspo Album	labels:Does anyone know the name for the shade of green in photos 22, 40, and 48? It's not very popular and I think I'd have an easier time finding it if I knew what to call it!

text:In inches or new era	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What pieces would you love "backups" of?	labels:An old suede Reformation Jacket that I got second hand. It's from their 2014 or 2015 collection, and I remember it took me over 2 years to find it second hand. I would 100% buy another one if I see someone selling it but unfortunately I always find a listing when it's already over.      Funny you mentioned this OP - I was literally just googling for the jacket this morning for the first time in months.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:Am I the only one that doesn't see how the Teddy jacket would give off peaked in high school lettermen jacket vibes like all the lurkers that were clearly bullied by jocks are claiming?  Obviously it's inspired by letterman jackets, but removing the contrasting leather sleeves and not having a TGI Friday's wall's worth of shit stitched onto it completely changes the vibe. I don't know, maybe I just associate it more with rockstar because it's an SLP piece and Alex Turner was the first celebrity I saw a photo of wearing it.
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:I remember really wanting skinny jeans in around 2005 but had a hard time finding them cause A&F was all about the boot leg / flair bottoms. Skinny fit was only available with higher end shops like Fornarina and Diesel. But within the next few of years skinny jeans slowly became the norm. Maybe it was already at Hot Topic but I didn't know much about the "alt fashion" mall brands back then.  Around 2007 2008 was when AA became a big trend and I loved it. But in my school AA didn't seem to have been a big thing and everyone just wore Hollister and A&F sweats.	episode_done:True

text:There is something about Rick which is so alluring in a dystopian sort of way. Its like a Lovecraft horror story. His stuff is both elegant and decrepit. All the dangly stuff, the dragging on the ground, wacky proportions.... The extra neck holes remind me of some infectious sores. But also glamorous (look at those briefs, lmao).   I'm not going to be sporting any of these looks, but its such a strong aesthetic to consider. Good stuff!	labels:Yeah, it's like a fistula. I usually ignore the "high fashion" stuff on this subreddit, but these images made me genuinely kind of lonely and sad. It's nice to get a new appreciation for an unfamiliar angle of fashion.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:Just received two sweaters from Bosie. I ordered them less than a week ago and selected Royal Mail shipping to save money...estimated shipping time was 3-4 weeks.   Not only did they arrive SUPER quick...but not a single cent of duty. And because it was Canada Post who delivered it...they even knocked to let me know it was outside. DHL rarely knocks, always hits me for duty and won't ship to my PO box. So frustrating.
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 22, 2020	labels:Why are hooded garments almost never modeled with the hood up?   I  keep my head shaved (bald) and prefer hoods to hats. Part of my problem  is a lot of hoods don't land far enough forward on my head so I want to  see them modeled with the hood up. Most of my problem is that when I'm  shopping online about 90% of hooded garments are not modeled with the  hood up. It seems intentional, anyone know why?  Admittedly I want my hood to fall farther forward than most might, like to my  eyebrows, but most of what I order and see online, when they are  modeled, land with the edge behind the top of the forehead. I get that  this is consistent with the hat trend of wearing the edge behind the  hairline, for whatever reason, but I'm looking for function over style.	episode_done:True

text:What are novelty leather keyrings/keychains for?

text:What are novelty leather keyrings/keychains for? How do you use them?	labels:Just a PSA for anyone who keeps them on the same key ring as your car key.   My locksmith gather told me that heavy key rings or chains or lots and lots of keys attached to a key you put in your car ignition causes the ignition to wear out quicker and require replacement.  Not a problem in the push button cars these days but something to think about if you regularly drive a car that isn't.	episode_done:True
text:I used to work in startups and it was not great when candidates showed up in full suits. Candidates were told that it was a laid back environment and to wear business casual at most for interviews. I felt awkward interviewing people who were much more dressed up than me, not to mention that their clothes suggested that they wouldn't be a good culture fit.  I also showed up to an interview once wearing heels that were totally appropriate for walking around an office, not realizing that my interview was going to involve about 2 miles of walking across a huge corporate campus. In this case recruiting told me to "wear whatever I felt comfortable in" so I went with a skirt, cardigan, and knee-high boots, thinking that it would be a cute, put-together look without looking too formal. At one point my interviewer looked at my feet and said, "those aren't really great shoes for this interview and you're way overdressed. Didn't recruiting tell you that we're a casual workplace?" Needless to say, I didn't get the job.	labels:That sucks! I would probably have reached into my tote bag and pulled out a pair of sneakers and said I was ready for the 2-mile tour!  But seriously some of these "casual" workplaces-- in tech at least -- they all very much have a uniform. Dark wash jeans. Company logo tee. Maybe a blazer over it if the job requires public speaking. Really nice leather loafers OR trendy sneakers, and an expensive belt. When you think about it, it's all very uniform and just a different version of a suit which everyone wears. It's also pretty boring.	episode_done:True

Every MTM suit shop I've been at, and every online service I've looked through. lets you pick SB/DB, lapel style, buttons, pleats, side adjusters... That's the low end, and that's a lot of styling details. And a lot of MTM shops *will* do Ghurkas, if you ask nicely.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Do you have a childhood fashion icon? If so, does their influence show up in your wardrobe today?	labels:Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century was my absolute jam. Wild colors, tight silhouettes, crazy layers, metal accessories, crazy hairstyles... all of it. I was always doing weird shit to my hair as a tween and I owned way too much pleather for living in DALLAS jeez I was crazy.  I don't think Zenon really fits in my current wardrobe except that it's basically the opposite of bohemian and I don't think I own a single item that could be called bohemian. I prefer clean lines, cool neutral colors like black and gray, little to no jewelry... I do still wear my clothes pretty tight, though and I keep my look from being boring by having fun and colorful (metallic!) shoes and bags. My most recent shoe purchase was a pair of rose gold metallic classic Reebok high-tops and a pair of dark purple oil-slick Doc Marten boots. I also had shaved sides until I realized that quarantine would probably be a good time to grow it out.	episode_done:True

text:The contemporary fit is made with 5" of ease around the body, which is par for the course right now and in line with brands such as Kamakura (New York Fit), Ledbury and Gitman. We used to have a "Classic Fit" which was larger but was discontinued due to poor sales.   Granted, the contemporary is not as full as some BB, J.Press or Mercer cuts, but that's not what our customers wanted at the time. That said, we are also seeing the trend to looser cuts and we are working on possibly reviving the classic fit.   As for shrinkage in the OCBD, when was the last time you tried one. That issue was from almost 2 years ago and has been rectified. Shrinkage is controlled to <3% now in the warp/lenth.	labels:Thanks for the reply. I would definitely try them again in a fuller fit. Unfortunately as I've gotten older I've become about a drop 4 now even though I'm still a 42/16.5 otherwise. As such the kind of slim fitting shirts that are popular on MFA don't work for me.

text:Dress Sneakers Are Alarmingly Popular	labels:Dress sneakers are great and I'm not sure i understand the hate. Sure don't wear the with a full suit, but, pairing them with the right thing makes a casual-formal look feel purposeful.

text:What are your tips for dressing a big chest!	labels:Some tips I've found works for me over the years are:  \- Patterns and prints can minimize the size of your boobs. Also, stripes generally emphasize the size of your boobs especially horizontal ones.  \- Necklines, boat and scoop necklines look the best on me. Square and v necklines tend to be not work appropriate but look awesome. I can usually put a nice camisole under a v neckline and achieve a nice look. Crew, turtleneck and mock neck tend to emphasize the boobs.  \- Necklaces, I find long necklaces draw attention away from my cleavage. Either pendant or beaded seem to work the best for me. If you live in a cold place a nice scarf will also minimize things.  \- Button up shirts are usually a no go unless I buy a size up and have it tailored in the waist and sleeves.  \- Flare skirts. I started wearing flare skirts with a tailored boat/scoop neck top and it draws attention to the skirt and away from my chest. Also like if I wear a solid color for a top and a patterned skirt it will have the same effect.	episode_done:True

Typically this is for the very practical reason that the fabric is thicker, tougher etc. So you want room for comfort.

I'm 21, and over the past couple months I've started getting more into fashion and taking care of myself. Buying new clothes and shoes, taking care of myself, etc etc.  However, the area I'm completely lost in is my hair. I've never used shampoo or hair products any more than just a generic bottle of cheap shampoo. My hair is currently just down to my shoulders, and it's kind of a mess. There's a lot of split ends, and it's messy - but not in the 'intentionally done to look good' type of messy.  I want to start taking better care of my hair, so how would I go about doing that? First priority would be taking care of the split ends, shampoo recomendations (I don't even really know the difference between shampoo and conditioner tbh), things like that.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!

That Atlantic article tells me a lot, and I also did some research that basically reiterated what was in that article. I assume most clothing stores are stocking what they think they will sell the most - shapeless (for the most part) tops that most people can wear and won't encounter fit issues (the irony though...) in mostly neutral colors that will go with just about any jacket/skirt/pants whatever. So that definitely makes sense. Just very frustrated as autumn is my most favorite season to shop for new clothes and I look forward to it every year, and I'm massively disappointed. I'll try some thrift shops if I have to, I've had some luck with consignment in the past.	episode_done:True

Some of my orders have hung in limbo for ages until I cancel them myself, even though the items show as in stock.

I would grab the leather jacket I bought in Florence, and probably all of the dresses on the left side of the closet. All the underwear and bras I own. I own nothing "vintage" or anything even remotely expensive aside from my wedding dress and that leather jacket. I live mostly in dresses/skirts (or at least I did before the pandemic happened and I've lived in sweatpants and tshirts since), and I would make sure that those (they're all from Amazon/eshakti/Target/Lulus) would come with me, because I have few enough that they will all fit in one suitcase. I may grab a few sentimental shirts, and probably my favorite pair or two of jeans, but I'd prioritize the jacket and the wedding dress before anything else.	episode_done:True

text:I think the most obvious alternative - albeit $$$ - would be cashmere. There's quite a few options that have the same basic rib design as OP's wool version. I think the challenge with cashmere is that if what you want is a super-chunky look, your options become more limited since cashmere tends to be finer and thus the sweaters don't always have the same heft. That said, if you're willing to invest in a 4-ply or higher cashmere SCC, you might be able to attain that nice chunky look.   Personally, when I'm working from home, I have a knockabout 2-ply cashmere SCC that I'll wear when I just want a warm layer; it's really nothing special and doesn't look anywhere as substantial as my Northern Watters-made lambswool SCC but it's kind of perfect for a home sweater.   The other common option would be cotton or linen or blends of both but then you lose out on warmth/insulation. That said, I had a cotton SCC for years that was a go-to "lemme just throw on a layer" option in temperate months.   Do you have the same reaction to merino?	labels:	episode_done:True

Both sustainable! I also like Levi's which have been making a big effort to conserve water as well. I think jeans are a great clothing item to invest in sustainable pieces because it's something you will wear forever and want to be able to get through being washed often  \-black midi skirt   \-possibly a shorter black skirt for going out if you like to do that   \-If you want something trendy, brown is super in.

text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:I identify as goth/industrial, though my actual favorite way to dress up is best described as "cannibal viking" with battle makeup and fake blood.  (I only get to use that 3-4 times a year, at least in The Before Times.  I can do goth every weekend.)  At work? Yeahno.  Other than the fact that i wear all black and whatever neon color my hair tends to be, i don't incorporate hardly any of my actual personal style at work.  It's not safe, obviously, since we're required to wear ankle length trousers, no makeup, hair tied back, etc.  Plus, it's a lot of work, and the harsh environment of organic solvents and strong acids and bases would melt away my good dancing clothes.  But i don't hide my tattoos  either.	episode_done:True
text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I actually love my pre-covid wardrobe. My issue now is that I've been working from home for 9 months in sweats so the weight creep came on without me noticing much. A lot of my clothes no longer fit.   My goal for 2021 is to shed 2020's emotional eating. Once I'm where I want to be on that I'll re-assess my wardrobe, but am thinking that I will just need to prune it  somewhat.  I lived in jumpsuits, wrap dresses, comfy linen pants, with silk shirts and boots or leather slip-ons. I'm pretty satisfied to age into that approach, with a few trendier items rotated in if they actually suit me and are comfortable.	episode_done:True

text:Serious Answer: Fashion is art made from textiles. Most artists have a specific vision for their works display. Like galleries are for tangible art for purchase and display, fashion shows are the same. They are where fashion buyers, press, celebrities, and marketers attend a show to place orders and review the artist's work. The catwalk is designed to show the movement of the fabric, it also showcases the scenery and styling the artist envisioned for their collection. Fashion without fashion shows would devoid the artist of their full vision and the buyers a chance to sample the collection, project demand for trends, seasonal color pallets, etc before stockists could get their hands on it. Without fashion shows, buyers would lose a lot of money for ill forecasts of demand, and clothing would cost more to mitigate those risks.      TLDR: Fashion shows are necessary because its the artists vision realized, and a buyers dream.	labels:	episode_done:True

By deliberate choice I mean things like a character wearing obviously different clothes to most of the rest of the cast to show they're old fashioned, or quirky and so on.

I tried oils and stuff but if I use them more than like 2 days in a row I start to break out so now I only use beard oil after I trim as part of a little regimen I have so that I don't bother my SO's sensitive skin with newly sharpened bread hair ends.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What fashion trend/s have you been obsessed with lately?	labels:Unisex clothes. I have a very feminine face but I love dressing androgynous.   On the other hand, I love chunky silhouettes and a slight streetwear style too!	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else wear one brand only?	labels:I realized recently when I put all my clothes in an app (called StyleBook) and looked at statistics that a disproportionate amount of my things are J. Crew. I didn't try, it just... happened. There's basically a J. Crew item in every outfit I wear. But my style is preppy and classic, lots of interchangeable basics too, and J. Crew fits that idea perfectly so it isn't too surprising!
text:If you could describe your style in 3 words, what would it be?	labels:Edgy, minimalist, modern	episode_done:True
text:The Terribly High Cost of Cheap Goods	labels:Doing my best to buy British, just buying less. I was disappointed to see an Arcteryx Gore tex I own was made in china considering how much it cost me. Won't be making that mistake again.
text:White T-Shirt Tier List - Penguinz0	labels:As much as I am aware of his channel and his rising fame, I just honestly can't really like his content. I feel like it's jsut too lazy and memey to really enjoy his vids.

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:That it's exhausting and sometimes drives me to a weird point of obsession to be determined to find the perfect _______ (whatever item I'm after). It's both a money thing and an ethical thing. Money thing because if I'm dropping $$ on something better made, from a more reputable brand, better features etc. then I need to rationalise dropping said $$ on it on a student budget. Ethically, if I'm trying to limit or eliminate my fast fashion footprint, it doesn't make sense to then buy multiple versions of investment pieces in the hope of finding the ideal one. So the amount of research and time I'll spend on my fashion choices is often tiring AF and makes me ironically feel more consumerist and materialistic (despite it representing the opposite) because of how much mental space these things will take up.	episode_done:True
text:What were the fashion finds that made you cry of happiness?	labels:Mine was a pair of SW heels that I drooled over about 15 years ago, but could never afford, and found on Poshmark a few months ago for 95% off.

text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:I always felt that ModCloth was really hit or miss (things would fall apart, quality, etc.), and the sizing was not great for me personally (everything was way too big). I still bought a lot of pieces from them, but most of it I would have to return. I haven't shopped there in years.  I also think their style is not as widespread "in" anymore, so I don't even consider them when I am shoppng.	episode_done:True

I want it to have a classic shape and not too many colors. I like dark colors, so mainly black or dark gray. For example, I like the classic shape of the Asics Gel Venture 7 but I don't really like the color schemes available in my country. (I already checked Reebok, Nike, Asics, New Balance. So I'd like to check lesser known companies)  Any suggestion is appreciated.  Thank you

text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:Security here.   My non-work wardrobe is extensive and colourful and very 1950s.  I don't like wearing my security uniform into work unless it's freezing cold and I can hide it under a winter coat, because it's made by the same uniform supplier as our local PD.   So I end up wearing most of my clothes anyways, because I don't want to be mistaken for something I'm not.      Plus i've had incidents where people threaten to wait outside for me after I get off work (because I've kicked them out, or caught them stealing) and I've walked right by them and they have NO IDEA because I look so different in my regular clothes.   So it's a safety thing too.	episode_done:True
text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:I always get tiny holes at the bottom of my shirts, roughly around the belly button. It can't be from my trouser button, because sometimes its over to the side a bit. It looks like I've just poke holes through them.  Also all my white/light shirts get yellow pit stains in them. I hate it so much.  Edited to add content.	episode_done:True
text:Work From Home Outfits I Should Wear More Often	labels:What is this trash. This isn't advice. "At work I like to wear one of four options, a shirt, or a shirt and tie, or a shirt, tie, and blazer, or get ready for it, a polo with some patagucci to signal that I'm not just the average business degree holding male at this company. Sometimes I step outside." Wow this is just the prime content I signed up for. I am so gracious that some could share their wisdom of wearing the quintessential basic business casual 101 that is probably already outlined in your company handbook.
text:Double breasted is generally pretty formal and if you aren't wearing it with a suit or at least slacks, you run a pretty strong risk of having the same vibe as fedora and T-shirt. That's my two cents anyways, if you really like it then wear it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Bolero album because it's here whether you like it or not	labels:I always liked these when I was in high school because they made my waist look smaller (when paired with stupidly low rise jeans and a thick belt...shudder).

text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:You can never be overdressed. If someone calls me overdressed I just say I'm going somewhere better later. I guess if your work is impeded by the outfit (such as wearing a tuxedo to do construction work then refusing to do the work ... But honestly I can't think of a realistic situation where you can be overdressed. Inappropriately dressed, sure. But when I go to events where most ppl are in a cocktail dress and someone is dressed formal, I notice how pretty they look. I don't think they're rude or anything. One group I'm part of, there's a girl who always wears way nicer stuff. Like she wears floor length glittering gowns where the rest of us wear LBDs and most of us are excited to see what she is wearing, not put off by it.	episode_done:True
text:What are some unexpected surprises you've found with certain clothing brands that are known for other things?	labels:I was surprised that Abercrombie wasn't just mall crap for teenagers anymore. It's not the heritage company it once was either, it's just a lower-end mall brand now with a lot of solid basics.

text:Outside the last 3 images(and I think the one with Ethan is a costume) none of these are actually star wars inspired directly, this is just a collection of darkwave/avant-garde/experimental fashion utilizing elements that OP personally found reminiscent of the character design from star qars	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:It sounds like you're getting good wear out of the things you buy (well done), but if your concern is avoiding wastefulness, then you might want to consider how people built wardrobes before the 60s destroyed fashion: far fewer items, much better quality, that you keep for a long time.  It will probably mean saving up money before you buy a blazer or a pair of pants, but you'll get something that you can keep for a long time and that you know wasn't made with child labor.  Yes this means that you repeat your outfits a lot, but that's the point of accessorizing with scarves and different shirts and stuff.	episode_done:True

Any recommendations/places to look?
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:I was a teen in the early 2000s. I remember a time of layering an impossible number of different-length camis  under a polo shirt. Also...boleros and shrugs...so many shrugs.

text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:I highly recommend dressing up for work as normal - it is great for the soul.  I've been missing clothes a bit this last few weeks but mostly because it's summer and hot and I am not a fan. I'm going to iron some of my summer things in a bit so I can wear them tomorrow and the rest of the week. I fitted new blinds in my office and it now stays quite cool so wearing more than minimal clothing is OK.	episode_done:True

text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I still have to wear at least a reasonable shirt for work, and a combination of zoom and terrible lighting in my apartment means I'm wearing more makeup than ever before to avoid looking like either a pale ghost or a zombified skull, depending on the angle of the sun.  But you know what I miss? SHOES. We don't wear shoes inside the house, so I rarely even put them on anymore. And there was a big part of being dressed down to my shoes and like... the stompy feeling of boots, and the clack of heels that made me feel like I was ready to take on the world -- definitely a contributor to good mental health.   I miss shoes. :(

text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:I don't know why people think they can't find 100% cotton and other natural fibers in fast fashion stores. Zara, H&M, sometimes Mango and others all carry these items.   I avoid polyester in a lot of item categories and have never had issues shopping at these stores. I don't find that there are differences in price or quality. In fact, the men's clothes are sometimes more expensive, because there's more fabric that goes into it.  I have plenty of cotton sweaters, they weren't more than $30. Sturdy 100% cotton jeans are super easy to find anywhere. Tons of 'basics' like t-shirts are cotton. In the summer, a lot of the stuff is cotton and linen - dresses, shorts, shirts, etc. All my winter coats are 50%-75% wool - all from fast fashion stores.   All this stuff also lasts for years, you just have to take care of it just like more expensive clothes and not treat it like shit just because it was cheap.
text:Also, the shoes are so damn gorgeous! The colour is beautiful.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:How warm and how cold are we talking? I moved from Quebec to Tanzania and back, and they were pretty much entirely different wardrobes.
text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:Shorts + tights for me! I never see it anymore, not in winter, not in spring, not in autumn and definitely not in summer. Except when I look in the mirror or that one time I saw someone else with the exact same combo I was wearing in the grocery store.  But you will pry this look from my cold, dead hands.
text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:YES! My dream wardrobe is (comfortable) A-line dresses, but my work dress code is casual, aka jeans and t-shirts. Now that I'm working from home, I've decided to just say F that noise and buy and wear dresses that I like. Life is too short to not wear clothes that you like and feel good in.   I've also recently been exposed to the vintage community. Watching YouTube videos of people dressed in vintage and/or vintage inspired dresses and gowns is a confidence boost to do it too, especially when they go out in public wearing a full Edwardian gown.	episode_done:True

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:When I was still first-dating, I had one go-to outfit that always got compliments, from the dates and the people around me as well!   It was this sleeveless, tie-dye maxi dress (it was black and white dye, and didn't feel gaudy or dated, but YMMV) with a cropped dark denim jacket. I almost always wear open-toed sandals with my outfits, and a flat pair would work for a lunch date, while some platform espadrilles worked for tapas or dinner.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever found a designer, maker or collection that makes you seriously think, "Everything they make is so beautiful and I want to own/collect everything they make?"

I WFH, with central air, and my baby is 7 months and not crawling. I'm scared when I actually break a sweat.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 16, 2021	labels:Do you guys find oversized clothing actually comfortable? Of course loose is more comfortable than tight, but I feel at a certain point the extra fabric and longer sleeves become more and more annoying. Also don't people worry at all about their sleeves when eating?   I've been going for looser stuff lately but I just can't seem to make it work practically and appearance wise. I feel like the only person who's oversized fits I like is Scott Disick wearing hoodies, and I've been trying to go for the same fit. I know a lot of his stuff is from John Elliott, but even the models don't look as good IMO.

Something cozy enough to set up shop on your couch in, that won't break on the first scoot, actually keep your arms warm.   In loungewear there's apparently four types with no middle ground: For mothers-formerly-known-as-women,  for girls, for seduction purposes only, and Jeff Lebowski.

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I can relate to having so many clothes and feeling like I can't put an outfit together with anything. Especially in my early 20's. I stated focusing more on neutral layering pieces when I went shopping.   I prefer to have clothes in solid colors for this reason. If any thing was my uniform it would be leggings and sweater wraps/shrugs and cardigans. These items have been  super helpful for me to wear all of my clothes. I will buy pops of color(pink, red, maroon, green, teal) as well as shapes that are easy to wear with other colors like black, white, ivory, navy blue.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 15, 2020	labels:I feel that the hoodie is one of the most unfashionable pieces of clothing ever conceived.

Or maybe it's just me because almost everybody from every age group wear them.
text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:A comfortable pair of completely waterproof boots. I bought my first pair of Timberland waterproof boots about 10 years ago when I started university and they were one of the best purchases I've ever made. I've always walked to class / for commute and waterproof footwear is a game changer. Honestly I think soggy feet should be banned, no one should have to suffer that!   Nowadays I have a pair of office appropriate waterproof boots and a pair of semi-hiking boots and my toes never have to feel the horror that is wet socks.

text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:I think there is a lot to be said for culture in this.    I went to a family wedding once, where the groom was from my family.  The groom's family all turned up smartly dressed for church, men in suits and ties and shiny shoes,  ladies in dresses or trouser suits, older/married ladies in hats.  We all pretty much wore the same colours (though it wasn't coordinated in any way, and this is a large extended family.  I am the groom's third cousin) and hit the same formality level.  Summer daytime wedding, sort of like if you went to the races.  The bride's family all looked like they were going to a football match or a barbecue.  Men in short sleeved gingham shirts or football tops, jeans, trainers.  Women in what I would consider clubwear.   Ultimately it didn't matter.  It was a good wedding.  No one could have upstaged the bride, she wore the most enormous sparkling tuille thing.

text:My theory on why Harry is this: playing with gender in fashion isn't new as you pointed out, eternal icons like Grace Jones have been there and done that. However, Harry's instance is unique because we have seen in a highly publicized way the evolution of how he sees his gender. He started as a (sorry fans) generic white musician with bland style and has since sort of aggressively redone his look. I'm sure he's been called "brave" in numerous articles documenting his steps towards this moment. Similar pretty boys like Ansel Elgort and even people like Post Malone have played with gender, but none in an as aggressively pursued and marketed way as Harry did. I also think people see that he has an X-factor because of his sexual identity. Billy Porter being a publicly queer person is sort of expected to do these things. Yeah his gown moment was highly publicized but it certainly didn't "break the internet" and spawn discussion like this did.  edit: also exactly what u/Anthraxistaken said	labels:I was thinking that too about how it was all because we've seen his growth and I couldn't have summed it up better.	episode_done:True

I could get behind some of the comfy, colorful 2000s trends. Ugg boots never really disappeared in my mind (I live in a cold climate and these are a comfy winter staple for me). Also a big fan of loose fitting pants so I can get on board with gauchos/culottes coming back in.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: Clay Jewelry?	labels:I have seen some really cool clay things, and I recently got a pair of earrings.

The amount of times you have to go over something with it, you might as well have ironed it.  Are there things like heat/steam presses where you can just stick the whole/most of the garment in, close it and bam, nice and smooth?

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:For me as long as their logos aren't visible (as this is still promotion for them) then it's probably fine and keeps you from buying something new. I have no idea how the second hand market value would effect their desirability and prominence...and that might be nigh on impossible to work out.   Personally, however I now feel really gross about wearing stuff from the very unethical brands. It constantly reminds me about the people that processed the cotton possibly against their will, to store employees that probably got treated like crap. That stops me being able to enjoy the garment itself.	episode_done:True

She has a mix of high end, classic pieces and then her California-hippie-yoga clothes. She's also pretty brutal about getting rid of things, which I try to channel because I hold on to things for way too long and just have too much stuff.

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:> So where does that leave the consumer who has a closet full of items purchased at fast fashion retailers, but rarely makes new purchases and many of their current pieces have remained in their closet for years?   If you already have a closet full of fast fashion, taking good care of it and using it for as long as possible is the most ethical choice.  I'm in the same boat.  I'm doing a year of no new clothes/shoes purchases (only thrifted/poshmark) and I'm trying to only get things that are high quality and will last, even if they are used.    Most of these online clothing boutiques (at least the ones I see on Poshmark/Facebook/Instagram are not sourcing ethically produced items.  I'm sure there are some that are, but they all seem to have the same stuff and you can tell just from the photos that it's cheaply made.  Again, I haven't seen every online boutique there is so I'm sure there are some out there that are fine.	episode_done:True

text:Do you have any pieces that "should not" work with your body that just seems to work?	labels:Honestly I find that I might not like the style of something once, but I need to try it on again maybe a few months or years later. Peasant tops are a good example, the cut popular a few years ago DID NOT look good on me. But now a bunch have sweetheart necks and they're pretty damn cute.

I can't wear it today" anxiety is to own one (1) horrible outfit that i hate that will never, ever make me think "wow I wish I'd washed that so I could wear it today"	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:I tailor the waist and hem of some of my clothes because those are the only issues I have. It helps that I don't own any fancy or embellished clothes.  I'm basically an amateur so working with slippery fabrics(like silk or satin), super stretchy fabrics, sheer fabrics, embroidered fabrics or with beading on it is challenging. I think I would only get high quality clothes tailored by an expert. If it's fast fashion, I wouldn't bother, unless it's a quality find.	episode_done:True

text:What are some stores/brands that have surprised you?	labels:Talbots.  I used to go there when I was a kid because it's where my mom bought all her work clothes.  Felt like it was all boxy dresses in black and red and "carpet suits."  Turns out they actually have some really nice stuff that doesn't make me look 30 years older than I am.  There's a Talbots outlet in my city that has ridiculously good prices and sales.  I get a ton of my work clothes there, including some really unique pieces that I never would've guessed in a million years would be from Talbots.

text:Righto. That's actually intriguing. Never thought about it that way, how if you are attracted to the same sex as what you dress in, do you dress differently to the type of clothing that attracts you sexually?	labels:Eh, yes and no. Being hawt is not very high on my list of priorities when I get dressed, but I do like it when a designer has an interesting perspective on male beauty or sexuality (Isabel Benenato, Rick Owens, Ludovic de Saint Sernin), and I might wear them for that reason.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 08	labels:I recently got into biker leather jackets, but I read that you gotta drop at least $400 on a decent real leather jacket. I wouldn't be opposed to it, but my two main concerns are that:  1. The biker jacket aesthetic may not stick with me in the long run (even though I think they're super cool since a few months ago) 2. I'm currently at 160lbs and plan on bulking to 170lbs. I'm concerned that the jacket will be too tight in the shoulders, arms, and chest and I can no longer wear it.  I also understand that faux leather jackets are of inferior quality compared to real leather jackets, but it's also at a lower price point. Those things considered, is it worth buying a faux leather jacket over a real leather jacket? If not, what things should I consider while shopping for second-hand leather jackets?

text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I fell into the trap of buying only secondhand and got addicted too! I have to remind myself that even though they're so much cheaper, they still cost money,. I haven't gone over budget, but storage is getting to be a real problem for me (I don't have a closet, and both of my dressers are stuffed to the brim.)   I can't do no-buy because I know I'm going to fail badly (I've never done well with going cold turkey), so I try to be more thoughtful about my purchase. I write down a list of things I'm eyeing to buy, how much they cost, what holes they fill (or not) in my wardrobe, and force myself to wait at least a few days before making a purchase (if at all). I also document my purchases, how I was feeling when I bought the thing and whether it was worth the price or not. I'm still struggling with it, but all this seems to help.

I mean, sure, I could wear the fabulous cocktail dress to the grocery store, but I'm not actually going to have all that much fun wearing it to the grocery store. I have learned during the pandemic that I do not actually enjoy getting dressed up for a night at home, because when I get dressed up for a night out, I do not have to worry about my cats ripping the lace on my fabulous dress, or shedding on it, or whatnot.   However, if I have nowhere I would like to wear it *now* but I can see myself enjoying wearing it when it is safe and prudent for me to leave the house to do things I like... I get the thing.

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:Get xl size lingerie bags (I got mine on amazon), wash everything delicate in them with cold water and hang/lay flat to dry. I wash silk, cashmere, and wool like this regularly and never dry clean anything. My washer doesn't even have a delicate setting and this works great.   Don't buy rayon, it shrinks in water. Spot cleaning and hanging in an airy place to air items out, especially outerwear/wool, helps go longer between cleanings. If you have to wear full suits everyday this is probably not as applicable though, so ymmv!

You could do the no-show sock here, and if she didn't think to say "are you wearing no-show socks" before insulting you, she's being an asshole on this one.

Such as $100 jeans instead of $10 jeggings off the rack at discount stores like cRoss or sMarshalls (first thing that comes to mind).   Right now I'm in a constant state of needing new clothes.

text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers. Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:Got my first ever wool sweater from aran sweater market. It's been an absolute game changer and the first thing that's kept me genuinely warm, rather than just "not freezing" during winter. The pilling is the only downside.  Layered with a trench coat, I'm all set for the Seattle 8 month coldish season.
text:Have your clothing purchases dramatically dropped now that we can't go anywhere?	labels:For me, yeah. I have no reason to get out of the house other than to get food, and I have enough clarity of mind to notice when I want to buy stuff out of boredom or anxiety.  The other day I was looking at this red leather dress on a dodgy discount site thinking "ugh I WAAANT IIIT". Nevermind the pandemic, that dress wouldn't get worn even if we were all locked up in hour homes. But I still wanted it badly for about 15 minutes.  Shopping has gone from wardrobe curation to weird ass mind games for me and I'm a bit tired of it.	episode_done:True
text:What's the greatest length you've gone to obtain a much coveted fashion item?	labels:Had a pair of shoes delivered to my cousin's house because they didn't ship them to my country.

text:Is Chanel going to be better off without Karl?	labels:I dont really have an answer go your question, but all I have to say is that the latest Chanel show (couture) was really weird and not in a good way.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 15, 2020	labels:Hey all, I am getting ready to take my first plunge into buying some used dress shoes. The way I see it, I have two choices... a) Purchase a pair of barely used shoes that haven't had their cork insoles "broken in" yet, and therefore have a better chance of forming to my feet better, or b) purchase a pair of cheaper shoes (\~$50) with the plan to send them to AE for recrafting which ensures that I get a fresh cork insole, along with a completely recrafted shoe.  Thoughts?  If I go with route (b), my final cost will be around $200. So I guess I need to see if I can find some barely used shoes for less than that. If not, the recrafting option may be just as good?

text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process? What would you prioritize?	labels:Did they reboot the What Not To Wear series? I don't think it aged well but it's probably one of the better style/beauty reality TV series. I don't think I'd willingly trade in my wardrobe for $5000 to restyle.   If my loved ones staged an intervention and had me redo it, it depends on the lifestyle. I think I'd put a few basics like a suit, button shirt and a nice pair of loafers, and then address the casual look... but secretly, I just want to have a stash of tea dresses like *Picnic at Hanging Rock*.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:I went on r/ffacj and realised that "classics" and "timeless pieces" are a trend themselves. I started thinking more critically about what "timeless" meant in the early 2000s, the 70s and realised that I could not wear what was timeless then, and fit neatly into timeless classic trends now.	episode_done:True

text:Topman is now a part of ASOS	labels:I just received an email myself from ASOS stating that the Topman brand is being brought under their website. I also had a couple of Topman items I had my eye on, and their website has been replaced with the "part of ASOS" message.  Generally not a problem for me; I only made an order with Topman once and it was because I had some vouchers to heavily reduce the price. I only considered Topman items when they were in the sale anyways.  Since I shop semi-regularly at ASOS, this change won't affect me too much. I'm not concerned about the uality of ASOS products either; they seem fine enough for what I need. I'd rather have a good quality item at a sensible price, than an excellent quality item at a much higher price than what I could possibly afford.	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:I pretty much only wear loose-fitting clothing that's either floppier or structured because *~*fAsHiOn sweaty*~* and I'm happy that that's in style right now. I appreciate a move away from women *having* to wear "flattering clothing" (aka, usually conventionally attractive to straight men) to be considered looking good. But I'm also small-breasted and built up and down like a beanpole, so I've never had that issue of feeling bigger than I'd like in my clothing.	episode_done:True

text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:I mostly use depop, and have found a few key ways to make it work for me:  * only buy from brands where I know my sizing * filter by brand and size, sort by most recent * only go searching if I know what I want/need (e.g. striped tshirt as opposed to just tshirt), this will help you narrow it down * OR I search simply by brand and my size for brands where I know I like a lot of their items (e.g. whistles) * Don't be afraid to message and ask questions. If they are not interested in answering then I won't buy from them, easy as that * Pay attention to shipping costs (it adds up quickly!) * always ask for material composition  It definitely takes a bit of practice and luck. I've massively scored, but also had things that didn't quite work out and then have to sell again or donate (and then I learned to only buy brands where I knew my sizing or ask measurements).	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts on jumpsuits?	labels:I just think how Im gonna go to the toilet and pull everything down to pee. Plus, most of the jumpsuits are so ill fitting - they are usually for tall women with proportions. On me, either the lengs are too long, waist doesn't sit right and basically makes me look like a 12 yo farmer girl.   I steer clear away from jumpsuits.	episode_done:True
text:What female TV characters do you think are well-styled and worthy of imitation?	labels:There's a Mexican dramedy called La Casa de las Flores (The House of Flowers) and one character, Paulina de la Mora, has a style that is tailored and kinda androgynous but also uses a feminine, floral colour palette that I adore. Definitely older than early 20's tho.	episode_done:True

text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:What exactly is your workplace's dress code.  It wouldn't make sense to purchase a suit if everyone shows up in jeans/t-shirts.   Also in the day and age of Covid, is your workplace even open?  Short term and long term?  Many companies (including mine) are transitioning to permanent WFH so it doesn't really matter what people wear as long as they're presentable on Zoom (I have a male colleague that does a button down with basketball shorts).    Honestly in terms of splurging (and I know myself pretty well now), I'd (personally) rather splurge on a good eyeshadow palette than on high-end fashion.  Most of the 'classic' high end 'investment' pieces are nowhere near my style and things that I would not wear.  (I also Marie Kondoed all of my bags in 2016 and don't miss them).  I also have wide feet so I wear through a pair of shoes rather fast.

text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism? I love it, but how do you do it?	labels:I'm a maximalist with a lower case m. I love prints, colors, textures, and patterns! I don't push the envelope as much compared to these photographs. Maybe one day? These are gold medal swimmers, I'm still at the doggie paddle stage. But I also love having a lot of options, I'm the exact opposite of a capsule wardrobe.	episode_done:True
text:Tucking in shirts	labels:I definitely deal with this too. My best advice, like many others here, is to tuck with high-waisted pants.  I also highly recommend tucking your shirt into your underwear and pulling your pants over them; it creates a smoother look!	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 12, 2021	labels:does anyone think that for some reason men are obsessed with the technical details of a fit than women are? I usually don't generalize things around gender like this but with this I have found it to be hilariously common and wondered if other people have found it similar.  It's all anecdotal but my dude friends IRL or the reddit/sf dudes all seem to care deeply about sizing of an item, how certain things should be (e.g. where pants should stack, how to cuff pants, where jacket sleeve should fall compared to your hand, I could go on) and take the longest time comparing pit to pit, sleeve, rise dimensions between different sizes and items before pulling the trigger.  On the other hand, from my limited dealings with women who are interested in fashion, I've hardly ever seen them asking for measurements from sites and these technical details don't seem to be high up in their list of priorities when they're deciding to purchase or deciding on their fit.

text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:I live in Omaha and I walk outside every day that is above 0 or below 90.  I wear a lot of wool.  Wool socks, wool sweaters.  I knit and I have a lot of hats, scarves, shawls and cowls.  I have wide feet and ridiculously high arches, so my shoe and boot choices are distinctly not cute.  When it's very cold, I wear leggings under my jeans.  I would like to find some fleece leggings that are low compression. I also want to find a mid thigh length coat that has some sort of reflective detailing on it.	episode_done:True

text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:Wear what inspires you! Even if you're overdressed and you love your outfit, you'll feel good because you're wearing what you want to.      Gossip Girl honestly inspired so much of my fashion choices in high school and middle school. I couldn't get the designer items but got a lot of things from H&M and Forever 21 and a little thrifting. Pretty Little Liars had an impact and American Horror Story.      I love the style from the Politician and that has been influencing my fashion choices.

text:I wish I could stress to people how much I think this. So many fresh faces join this industry (naturally, as it's usually their first job and people come in with a genuine love for fashion) and so many leave disheartened.  Like you, I know so many people who have left fashion retail, to move onto non-fashion (e.g. homewares, food, FMCG) because, IMO and their opinion, there is just far too many negatives to the fashion retail industry and you get to a point where you feel like it'll never change. So you want out.  I'm moving back home to Australia in a few months and know I won't be going back to fashion retail. I don't regret having worked in it as the lessons learnt about the harm of fashion retail is invaluable and eye-opening, but mentally, it's time to move on.	labels:Curious whether people feel this way about thrift or consignment retailers as well?

text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:A little different but I own several saris and a couple of lehengas, some of which were my mum's and some from my grandma on my dad's side.  With my mum's, I like to style them as she wore them which is pretty traditional and really lean into the 80s style with fluffy hair and major winged eyeliner but I normally add a statement piece of jewellery to make it mine.  My grandma's I tend to mix up with different styles of blouses, different scarves and wear as more of a mishmash to fit in with the trends at the moment. One of the saris she gave, I've had made into a lehenga with two different blouses and the skirt into a ruffled, almost flamenco kind of skirt because the material really suits that kind of thing.

text:Support Small Businesses This Holiday Season	labels:I would love to support small businesses right now, smaller than Amazon and Walmart anyway, but the businesses I go to aren't letting anyone use the dressing rooms. I'll do anything right now to not use Amazon, but I'm not buying anything that doesn't fit so my clothing purchases have been almost zero.
text:Sorry you feel that way. When I wrote it, I tried to convey that I didn't put much thought into what I wore. Perhaps I could have said pajama bottoms with RRL cardigans. I don't have a perfect description for it, but I do think that the style Andrew is wearing there is a lot more coherent. I think there are ways to do that style thoughtfully, and not randomly. I didn't write this with the intention of making people feel unhappy with their current wardrobe.

text:I just don't get fashion. I joined this sub to learn how to dress or get ideas but none of the stuff I see looks comfortable or nice, imo. Like just get baggy pants that stop at your ankles in OD green, old man slippers with no socks, a red heavy cotton beanie, and an oversized 1980s coat. But is this stuff just designers having fun or do people REALLY expect men to dress like that?	labels:I mean if people just dressed the way people were expected to dress literally nothing would change in clothing, like we'd all still be wearing early 20th century tailoring or 19th century frocks. The whole point of fashion is to engage in artistic or personal expression in clothing. If you just want to look like whatever the average man looks like but somehow intangibly better without personally engaging in fashion there is no problem with that but the paradox is that kind of advice isn't exactly interesting to the group of people who are actually interested enough in fashion to give it :)	episode_done:True

text:I handwash all the time--the salad spinner is a great idea!  Most of the clothes that I handwash call for cold water only though, so I never use any warm water.  As for detergent, I use Woolite.  Threads are more delicate when wet, so I avoid any rough wringing--I roll them up in towels to get most of the water out.  With knit sweaters etc, I let them dry laying down, put back in their shape, as they get very heavy with water and hanging could cause them to lose their shape.  Since I already have many pieces that I handwash, I just end up doing that with all of the pieces I care about/really want to last and it works great albeit a bit time consuming!	labels:	episode_done:True

Beanie is a good call, but I live in pretty warm climate so it might get to hot in the sun. And a cap doesn't cover enough I think, my burn is on the side by my temples as well.  Right now Im leaning towards some simple felt flat brimmed hat. But kind of need something I can wear while still wearing pretty casual clothes sometimes. Chinos/jeans + tshirt or shirt.

Went to the store though, and they had everything. I was in love with the oversized parka from pictures but once I actually tried it on, I got a bit disappointed with it. It was too long IMO and overall had that same slightly childish/adolescent look that I also think the original Uniqlo hybrid parka has. I think pairing the oversized silhouette with a slightly cropped length could have made all the difference and made it s sweet piece. But it honestly is not that different from the original.

I am currently looking to buy a well-made simple black leather boot (think, RW Beckman, Thursday Captain, Meermin  101527) that has a removable in-sole to make space for my orthotics. Sadly, non of those have that option. The only one I found (including resultless trips to specialised stores) was a the SB1 by Oliver Cabell, however, that brand has gotten mixed reviews here and since I live in Europe, shipping is an issue.

text:The Business of Markups on Logo T-Shirts. Why You Shouldn't Drop $600 on a Gucci Tee	labels:Hold up a minute, people regurlarly pay six hundred dollars American on a t-shirt?    Fools and their money are soon parted.    For comparison, 600 bucks can get you:   Get a top of the line off-the-rack suit new, and some lower end bespoke suits.   A full casual wardrobe, untailored.    Upper Midline TV    A midline, but by no means lackluster, AR-15 or most pistols   Two to three months of bougie groceries with a few times eating out for a single person, depends on where you live.   The list could go on, but you get the point, and I have better things to do. Point is: six hundred dollars is incredibly high for something that will wear out in less than a year, is used in a professional setting as chest underwear, and doesn't complement body builds outside rectangle or trapezoid body builds.
text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:When I found myself in a similar rut, I signed up for Trunk Club and Stitch Fix.

It definitely helped me discover new brands and styles I hadn't given serious consideration to.	episode_done:True

I usually don't generalize things around gender like this but with this I have found it to be hilariously common and wondered if other people have found it similar.  It's all anecdotal but my dude friends IRL or the reddit/sf dudes all seem to care deeply about sizing of an item, how certain things should be (e.g. where pants should stack, how to cuff pants, where jacket sleeve should fall compared to your hand, I could go on) and take the longest time comparing pit to pit, sleeve, rise dimensions between different sizes and items before pulling the trigger.  On the other hand, from my limited dealings with women who are interested in fashion, I've hardly ever seen them asking for measurements from sites and these technical details don't seem to be high up in their list of priorities when they're deciding to purchase or deciding on their fit.

Perfectly tailored items, luxe fabrics, and generally styling yourself to look polished (hair, makeup, jewelry, whatever your thing is) really helps avoid looking or feeling sloppy.  I really enjoy loose tops, and find if they have a nice drape it helps. I'm short, so I try to offset the volume up top by wearing something slim on the bottom.	episode_done:True

You said sth important too - the purchase comes first. Now it makes sense to me why this type of commerce is so popular for sellers. Purchase beforehand.

Maybe Yeossal or their Safari jackets, drawstring pants, one piece polos, and cool shoes, and a lot of that available in MTM options.

text:advice on how to stop buying clothes I don't need?	labels:My temptation with shopping comes more from the mythical concept of a "perfect" wardrobe than social media temptation.  But my approach is: unsubscribe from every brand email list, bookmark a thing I'm interested in so it's saved and I don't mentally dwell on it, and using a Chrome extension (I use "StayFocusd") where you add sites you want to block and a time limit (kinda snaps you out of sleepwalk shopping when you run out of time).

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.
text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:I'm a full fledged Maxxnista but I haven't had much luck with clothing there.

Then you can build up a catalogue of the ways retailers fit. This helps when you look back in six months and are tempted to reorder that thing you've been eying because you can't remember why you sent it back.	episode_done:True

I would not display on a hanger or a dressform, because it will gather dust, and hangers in particular put a lot of stress on the shoulders and possibly also the skirt seam, heavy trims, etc.	episode_done:True
text:black dress shirts tend to look not-so-great, T-shirts are fine since the rules of formality don't really apply that much to casual stuff. I'd focus more on the pants when talking about shoes personally. In formal contexts, black shoes are more formal than brown. You'll need to be more specific for me to help out in a reasonable amount of words.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process? What would you prioritize?	labels:I would 100% create a high-quality capsule wardrobe and then take every single thing to a tailor and have them fitted.

I was looking online for a replacement and I can only find them with 2% elastine.  Did  this variant get discontinued?  If so I am bummed out.  It was very  nice owning a pair of smart chinos that could stretch almost like some  athletic pants.

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:Find a boutique or store you can't look away from. I have one and it gives me much inspiration to look at the selected outfits as a whole. Also has made me become obsessed with the overall style the boutique gives and therefore I have found a love for pants in a way I hadn't completely had before. Just knowing I will love pretty much everything on the store's site makes me excitedly look at the Bottoms tab, instead of typically just gravitating toward tops.	episode_done:True

text:So if you study fashion, you're aware that cottagecore is already a ripoff of mori kei, right? Mori kei put through a Beatrix Potter filter and recycled into ~the latest queer aesthetic~?	labels:yep, wgsn actually lists mori kei as the source behind cottagecore. unfortunately, i think most queer people who go for cottagecore don't. and if you mean Beatrix Potter filter as in making it very white and skinny focused yeah I get what you mean. the only reason why I addressed cottagecore as a queer trend itself is because wgsn directly listed it as an upcoming trend.
text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:Shorts + tights for me! I never see it anymore, not in winter, not in spring, not in autumn and definitely not in summer. Except when I look in the mirror or that one time I saw someone else with the exact same combo I was wearing in the grocery store.  But you will pry this look from my cold, dead hands.
text:I'm a 36" chest or so, and for slim fit stuff will normally wear around 19"-19.5" p2p, but for more relaxed stuff and layering I'll wear a 21-22" p2p.  It's likely to be big, but if it's cut to be loose it won't be a problem. If it's not cut to be loose it's going to look too big.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:I have used a sewing machine to alter my clothes for a pretty long time. I take things in, let them out, and occasionally make my own clothes. I saw my mom doing this from a young age, and at like 5 or 6 she let me help her out, so I have been doing it a long time, but there are some good tutorials on YouTube for when I am altering something new like a bathing suit.	episode_done:True
text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:i personally disagree that there are no aesthetic reasons for y2k fashion to come back. there definitely are, or else it wouldn't be as huge as it is!! i personally love a lot of aspects of y2k fashion. :) but you're right that nostalgia is a huge part of it. nostalgia as a whole is so trendy these days. for example my whole tiktok is full of people talking about shows from their childhood, or toys, or disney channel stars from our childhood. "1999, 2004, 2008" picture day tiktoks are also a huge trend right now. i've even seen tons of people talking about 2011-2014 nostalgia which wasn't even that long ago!! it's insane how it's such a big thing. i'm honestly more interested in analyzing why everyone's so nostalgic in general these days haha

I have the Uniqlo long johns and while they're extremely comfy and warm on their own, wearing skinny pants (which aren't skintight) on top of them makes it nearly impossible to sit down without feeling like I'm going to rip my pants at the knees - the friction between the two layers prevents me from really being able to pull my pants up that small amount to sit down. Does anyone know what sort of fabric/synthetic I should be looking for that would still keep me decently warm?

If I'm not mistaken, Alejandro is also mexican and is doing work based on his heritage. Small businesses like these don't make 90% profit because it takes time, money and effort to create a small amount of clothing.   As for myself, I'm not 100% sure on mexican traditional clothing and how much they cost but I know that their western style clothing is worth the price. It's a different style of clothing that you don't really see and something special like this is worth the price at times.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What’s your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:As a baby of the 80s/90s, I'm here for it! This is my first cycle of fashion "coming back," and it's pretty fun to see a new generation reinterpret the style I saved my allowance to buy from Limited Too. That being said, as a 30-something, I'm not diving in too deep, as this aesthetic feels a bit young and maximalist for my style.  The trend seems to be permeating home decor too... I'm mentoring a high schooler through a women in STEM program, and we had a Zoom date the other night. Her bedroom looked like the set of Clarissa Explains It All and it was strangely comforting.

text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:For boots, I found Keen's women's work boots to be the most comfortable. I especially liked the Seattle line with an aluminum toe for my job but they have a ton of different styles with varying levels of safety ratings.   I've worked ina variety of mining and industrial settings and jeans were the norm for a normal work day, but that'll probably depend on your specific workplace. Many women wore skinny jeans or bootcut jeans.   I often just paired my jeans and boots with a sweater or closer cut blouse and cardigan. Occasionally I'd wear the polo my company gave me with a north face zip up.

Focusing on one or two designers (monobrand4lyfe) and learning the market well enough to flip items and pay for your retail purchase of what you _actually_ want is almost more reliable than hoping you find what fourteen seasons past item in your size in good condition.	episode_done:True

Within that there's also the goal to finally iron and photograph and sell the 4+ bags of clothing scattered between the living room floor and the back of my car, to create a wardrobe tracker because #datalife, and focus more on building outfits with the clothes I have vs. obsessing over curating the 'perfect' wardrobe by just finding that one last piece (which is never the last piece).	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:So recently I've been realizing that I kinda *get* what I want my personal aesthetic to be/ what it is. Like before I got the general idea, but now it's less feeling like I'm wearing a costume and more like this is who I want to be and this who is I ant to look like. It's no surprise that this is coming alongside my approaching year anniversary (10 months sober today). I guess it's just nice to feel comfortable in myself for the most part. I mean nothing really goes away, but it's nice that they're not as consuming as they once we're.  In that same vein, I've done several purges of my wardrobe, and am about to get rid of something like 3- 6 pairs of sneakers ranging from a little worn to holey. I'm realizing that I don't want to end up as one of those black brown or white sneaker guys, but at the same time would it really be the worst thing? I dunno, thats the internal conflict I'm dealing with atm.

text:Do you think fashion or style has age restrictions?	labels:I have a sneaky suspicion most here will just say, "YOU GO GIRL, WEAR WHAT YOU WANT!"  But if you're starting to feel uncomfortable in those things, I think maybe it's a sign?  Basically, if you think you don't look your best in certain clothing, it's fine to start thinking about what different pieces make you look and feel better and represent who you are now. I'm 34 and would wear crop tops and high waisted jeans, but honestly that is partially to do with the fact that I have not really embraced my thirties or feel like I have moved on to the next stage of life. In a post-pandemic world (where I am is in lockdown), I might re-evaluate.	episode_done:True

It really doesn't matter what others think of your fashion sense either way.    Had a grandpa laugh at me on the street. At least I made him happy. :D

text:This is a huge one that bothers me. Was looking at a shirt on Mr. P the other day where the model was very similar to my measurements and was described as:  - Item fits true to size, take your normal size. - This item is intended for a relaxed cut. - Model is wearing a size M. - Model has taken a size up from his normal size in order to achieve a relaxed fit.  There is absolutely no way that I am normally a size S, so I already don't trust this description. Is it a relaxed fit and I should take my normal size, or do I need to size up to get a relaxed fit? What is "true to size" in terms of S/M/L anyway?  So I check the measurements and of course they don't have a chest measurement from the product.  If they had a bunch of different models wearing different sizes I could at least see how the sizes look / fit and compare between those.	labels:	episode_done:True

It was too large, but I bought it. I'm thinking I'll alter it so it fits better.	episode_done:True

text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:IMO, the fit is more important than anything else when it comes to style. I think anyone can look incredible in $50 trousers if they fit well. Personally, I'd rather spend $75 on a pair of selvedge denim jeans from the GAP and have them tailored to fit my body perfectly than spend $500 on a HC brand.  I don't care much for labels, more for design and vibe.  I think if money were no object, I would still follow that principle. I love clothing that fits me like a glove. I look and feel like a million bucks in tailored clothes and having a garment made for you and only you are so satisfying.  Plus, I love supporting independents who are artists and masters at what they do. They put love into their work, which you don't get from mass manufacturing.  Just one man's opinion. :)	episode_done:True
text:Painting with a pretty broad brush but I guess you could say that about some fits.  It's just an extension of things like normcore and Dadcore... people who are interested in fashion as a hobby sometimes like the challenge of trying to make interesting outfits out of items considered unfashionable (like baggy pants and chunky dad sneakers). Get enough people who are considered fashion-forward experimenting with the same things and those things actually start to become trendy.  Same thing happened a decade ago with the guys who wore women's jeans to achieve a skinny fit and gave birth to the "slim fit" movement or the city kids working in tech jobs who wore workwear to appear ironic.	labels:	episode_done:True

Just buy the things that you like, it's fine if you like trends and your style changes over time.  The idea that you become and adult and you must ditch trends is an internet myth, if you look at actual people (adults) that have some interest in style/fashion - they are following trends.

text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I really miss putting together outfits for work! My office was pretty casual and I tended to be on the fancier side of things (the ongoing joke with my coworkers was that I didn't know what a casual outfit was, even when wearing jeans) and I found a lot of joy in getting to wear that stuff. When we return to office in the future I might cut down on the amount of heels I own, but even when I am putting on real clothes while working from home I miss having shoes be an integral part of feeling put together.   On the other hand, I am wearing my summer clothes a little more than I normally do because I'm not bound by the freezing A/C of the office and it's nice getting to wear things like "that top that can be a bit risque when bending down for something in the office" because calls are just video.   Tl;dr - I am excited to put back on my fancy tops!

text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:Haven't tried on the $xxxx designer clothing, but the difference between $20 shoes and quality leather shoes is so huge. I wore cheap plastic ballet flats all the time as a teenager, and one day my grandmother just took me to a store to get shoes. The shoes were all $200-$300 range, which was astronomical to me then (still kinda is), but they were so plush to the touch and made of real leather. This was ~7 years ago and the sandals I got then have still held up well.

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:i have sewn for 8 years, knitted for 10. i can't buy clothes or accessories that have the attention to detail that i can achieve with making them myself. i have control over all of the seam finishes, linings, trims, length, etc. i am extremely picky about materials, and its very hard to find quality ones today for a price i can afford. when i wear something that i've made so often that it needs to be repaired, because i made it i care more about it and will spend the time to fix it.   it did take me years and years to become good enough to be really happy with what i made, but at this point it is really hard for me to buy clothes. I don't love sewing knits, so i do buy underwear and stuff like tshirts.	episode_done:True

Their sizing it funny for me (I size down to a small for a not-too fitted tee but am often a size 14 to give you an idea), but the quality I've seen so far is excellent.

text:I like the concept, but knowing MFA and the subjectivity around whether someone considers themselves to have a certain ambiguous body characteristic or how they prefer things to fit, I guarantee it would devolve into arguments about whether or not an item belongs based on how it fits them personally.	labels:I mean there's some stuff that's not ambiguous. Shoes under size 8 and over size 13 are hard to find unless you're looking for sneakers.   I have narrow shoulders and a wide waist. I can't find a lot of stuff that fits me well.

I mean if something works for you it just works for you. It does not need to fit into these rules. it just needs to look good on you, make you feel comfortable and confident.  I own a halter neck dress in the stupidest shade of green but when i put it on it just works like it was meant for my weird shoulders.  my point is, the rules are there to help you, to guide you. but they are not your end game. what you really love on your body, that is real end game.   love, the\_weekend\_girl	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 19, 2021	labels:I came upon a really gorgeous quilt recently, gave it a wash outside and it's drying in the garage. The thing is, it's really damaged on all the edges, fully blasted apart, and with a big stain on bottom side (the side that touches you when you use it as a blanket, i guess the "wrong" side of the quilt)  I sort of want to unpick it, and re-use all the panels and the cotton batting (it's old! Vintage raw cotton batting! I see thread scraps in here too used as filling.) To use for.... Something? Back patch for jacket? A pair of quilt pants? Heavy picnic blanket?  A lot of people are telling me to preserve it. Patch and fill the holes with my visible mending skills and keep it as a quilt for living with. It just seems so fragile, though?  I'll show pics later but i dont want that to influence anyone, i guess. I'm wondering what i should do.

text:Normally if an apparel group is stuck with excess fabric they can still make money off of it by selling it to Mood or something.

Fashion students aren't the most downtrodden group of people ever but hey, they have to buy most of their supplies out of pocket.	labels:I can't sympathize with people whose job it is to tweak an Armani shirt so an absurd amount of money can be charged for the newest thing and plays a role in men and women having body issues for no reason.It just shows how sick our culture is.

text:Runways have been sending out 2000s vibes. Anyone onboard?	labels:I'm just going to lay it out there: I hate it. I hate the return of the Mean Girls/bitchy rich white girl/fucking velour Juicy tracksuit look. Probably because I started high school in 2001 and it was like the hey day of bland tackiness and Paris Hilton and I'm too close to it, lived it a little too much, to find any novelty in it. SO vapid. I was slightly vapid and a little mean for a while around that time before I came into myself and I don't like the reminders.  What I do like about the looks above though, is that I see the 60s and 90s Spice Girls influences and I can get into that.  Edit: also, on occasion, I wear low rise pants, but I like looking at trends for inspiration and new ideas, not dictating what I can or can't wear. If you like low rise jeans and hipster minis, rock em. If not, fuck em forever, who cares.

text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:Madewell - I ordered a plain black t shirt during covid just for lounging and the thing literally had a hole already in the front when it arrived.  Aritzia - I've been shopping there for well over a decade and while you really can't compare fabric from so long ago (it's incomparable imo) even just the stitching is becoming obviously bad. Last winter I saw a blazer, still on the rack in store, with threads already sticking out at the shoulder seam. Absolutely ridiculous. However, I will say their peacoats have turned around a bit - not what they used to be but a couple years ago they looked like they were made out of felt and definitely have gotten better since then.  American Eagle - I really like the new curvy fit of their jeans, 10/10, and I feel like the aerie underwear quality has gotten better, the last couple of years the material had gone downhill.

Weight gain is nothing to be ashamed of, but I commend you for trying to be healthier - that shit isn't easy!!  As for the "wanting to look professional but wanting to look / feel like myself", I think a LOT of people struggle with this. I feel like for the emo look, wearing all black can still be seen as very professional, I think the issue more would be the cuts of the clothes. It also depends on your profession / workplace - obviously some places are much more lenient and you can get away with a lot more skin. Maybe wearing jewelry that is more alternative can also be a good way to look professional but feel like yourself.	episode_done:True
text:but I didn't pay it when I bought it. Maybe it's factored in into the price of the goods. But it's still way cheaper	labels:You wouldn't pay it then, because you're not paying the company you buy it from. If there are import taxes, the government/courier will charge you (you'll get an email, most likely) and will keep the item/s until you pay it. At least, that's what happened to me. The taxes ended up being almost as much as the purchase itself, so I just had it sent back. Hope you don't get got like that!	episode_done:True
text:I did miss that it was silk. :( I was picturing a cotton jersey.  Still a simple cut in a washable silk is not that great of a difference. Try to find a pattern on line or IRL (eventually) that is similar to what you are looking for. Take it to your dry-cleaner and ask the person who does alterations. If the Dry Cleaner sends their  repairs out, ask for that number to cut out the middle man. I've been doing this for 30 years. They usually like to do something besides sew on new buttons. They will generally do thrifted up-cycling as well. Bring pictures with you.	labels:	episode_done:True

Blue and green do not!! go together!!   2. Better to size up or opt for the fuller coverage rather than tug at your clothes and feel self-conscious 3. Franco Sarto will not let you down 4. Ditto for vintage Coach 5. Always keep a church/funeral/interview-appropriate outfit that fits(!) at the back of your closet  I definitely feel like I dress a little "old" because of my mom, and I have a whole host of body image/modesty issues, AND I am a certified Fashion Coward, but... hmm... I'll never be underdressed, at least.	episode_done:True
text:I think a tunic is kinda like a very long shirt. There are women's tunics too so it's referring to a kind of cut.

text:In the past I've typed up multiple comments about this exact thing, but deleted them all for fear of weird misogyny vibes cause I don't exactly excel in expressing myself in English.        All I'm gonna say is that I think it def is a thing, although mainly on the Internet and even then not *that* big of a thing and that I think it's because fashion is EXPECTED from women so there are far more women not intensely invested in it but who still participate because of social pressure, where as men are expected to NOT be interested in fashion, so the people very invested in it who are interested in things like details and cuts self-select to be the majority of male fashion people due to the not-so-interesteds dropping out due to social pressure.	labels:yea I definitely hesitated a little before saying this for the same reason but felt it was a mildly funny and interesting observation from my personal life haha.	episode_done:True
text:Custom clothes maker here.  Depending on what it's made of (I'm assuming cashmere, or at least high end wool, with a silk lining), just the fabric for Michelle's coat was probably approaching $70-$100 a yard,  and for a coat like that, I'd be buying at least 7 yards of the wool and 6 of the silk.  So, $1300 just in fabric, just for the coat.  A wool coat like that takes a fair amount of work.  For my time, I charge 2.5 x fabric costs, or more if my client cheaped out on the materials, and I would imagine that they'd charge more still.  So, bare minimum of $3250.  Plus you're paying for the name, plus you're paying for all of the people who had hands on it: at least the designer, fitter, cutter, presser, tailor, sewist.  Now, they're going to have industrial machines, so it'll go faster than it would on my machines, but that coat, between fitting, adjustments, cutting, tailoring, and sewing, I'd guess a coat like that is gonna take at least 30 manhours.     I'd bet that coat is at least $7000.  Probably more like $10k.	labels:7 yards is 6.4 meters

text:Have your clothing purchases dramatically dropped now that we can't go anywhere?	labels:I've been looking to fashion as a form of escapism during this time, plus I have way more disposable income since I'm not spending it on going out to bars/restaurants like I used to, so no--been buying much more. But, I've wanted to revamp my wardrobe into something less "quiet" for a long time, and this has felt like the perfect opportunity to prioritize that since I don't have much else going on. Biggest caveat is I'm trying to avoid pieces that will likely be horribly out of style in a year or so, since that's when I'll likely be able to actually wear most of it out in the world.   Honestly I'm pretty pleased with my progress so far and I have no regrets!

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.

It also made it easier for me to wear these clothes when I went out with someone I knew and felt comfortable being myself with. Now I wear what I want when I want and I just got comfortable with it. I tried to slowly make it apart of my look and it just feels natural now to wear it.  Also, who cares what people think.

I have this past year lost a lot of weight and so a lot of my clothes need to be replaced and as a broke ass grad student I do a lot of second hand shopping.   My tips for second hand shopping for clothes. Go often and I do mean as often as you can, the good stuff goes out quick in most places, take your time going through the clothes, know the brands you like and overall good brand names, check for any holes or rips and assess if they are worth fixing. Outside that it's just a numbers game on finding stuff you like so the more often you can go the more likely you are to find what you like and for the love of god wash them before wearing them.

You probably have everything else you could want for layering under it. - a nice shirt, undershirt and maybe a jumper.   Sizing wise stick with your usual size, as winter jackets are typically designed to be worn over something. You wont need to invest in something too extreme as you'll be walking the streets of Paris, not an expedition on the Artic.   Do spend a little more on the scarf though, as it can be a nice statement piece and you want it to last as well as feel nice.	episode_done:True

I've bought... 67 items this year, including clothes, shoes, and accessories. The latter of which is an unexpected 3rd. (Turns out drastically changing your style and your hair warrants new accessories?)  I think the weirdest thing was that, near the end of March I bought 20 items, most of it in once go, which I almost immediately regretted (I mainly thrift so all of it was non-returnable.) Turns out it was a really good decision, since I culled my spring wardrobe so enthusiastically I had to resort to compulsory pattern mixing since I had NO SOLID COLOURS, and we went into lockdown not long after.  Also, all my impulse buys ended up being boring, practical loungewear-y stuff...which I've never bought before in my life.	episode_done:True

text:Chukkas are pretty much just the mental image of the word "shoe".   Like, if you had to open a dictionary and go to the word "Shoe", the picture next to it would be a chukka (though they all reach above the ankle in height, and are more short boots than true "shoes"). They're certainly not THE most formal, or THE most comfortable, or THE most rugged, but what they lack in any one category/trait, they make up for in versatility. Suede ones hit a good balance between formal and casual, and can be worn with just about any pant except sweats and still good look. Glossy or satin leather ones are a bit more formal still, and could easily be worn on a date.   As for ergonomics, chukkas can easily accommodate custom orthotics, if you have (which you should absolutely have, if you can get them on insurance.)	labels:	episode_done:True

So much fun fashion. What I wouldn't do for an entire day in Myeongdong just unloading all my cash. Something I've noticed is that a lot of trends that were popular over a decade ago have stuck around in some iteration -- pastels never seem to get old there, even if they're used in different ways. Oversized clothes were a staple then as now. Unabashed logos. I still try to incorporate facets of Korean fashion into how I dress over a decade later.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 08, 2021	labels:I am wondering if anyone else had a poor experience shopping with Aime Leon Dore?  I've thought some of their pieces were interesting but the price point was a bit high so I've never purchased anything from them, until this winter sale where that had some 15% off or something and decided I could try something. I neglected to read the fine print where Aime says that any purchase made during a seasonal sale is final. Yes, that's correct, that accidental purchase of too small jeans or too large shirt is now non refundable.  Prices at Aime typically range from $150 and up so this was a bit disappointing to say the least. Either way I hope someone else sees this and it will dissuade them from shopping at Aime or at least be cautious, don't buy anything online from them and if you must don't purchase anything on sale if you think you might have to return it.  Their pants run small btw

text:They definitely should not fit like that. Two no-go situations for me are toes coming in contact with the tips, and pinkie toes being squeezed. The outline of the foot bed of the shoe should comfortably fit the shape of your foot--including natural toe spread while standing/walking. Other than perhaps being a little stiff, when taking a few steps, walking should feel natural.        A couple things could be going on here: you may have been mis-sized (and may want a second opinion) or your heel-to-ball measurement is different than your full foot. Brannock is just a starting point/reference point. The lasts (wooden forms the shoes are shaped on) can vary from model to model, and fit may not conform to your measured size. For instance, on AE's most popular dress shoe last (65), I have to half-size up (and some folks have to width up instead). Edit: And some lasts simply don't work for some people, no matter the size.	labels:	episode_done:True

I actually use Pintrest for most of my fashion finding needs and I've been in the habit of reworking my algorithm often. As soon as I start getting recommended a bunch of things I don't like I start unfollowing boards and abusing the hide button like crazy. I also went through and organized all my boards with the new subcategory option to combine a lot of my boards together.   Another note that might help people is if you can't figure out why your still getting recommended out of date pins, go back into your boards that your feed recommends from and delete the older pins that you no longer like. I went back into all my fashion boards and went to the pins I'd pinned when I first got into Pintrest (in like 2012) that were definitely no longer my style. Once those were no longer there to draw from my feed changed pretty dramatically.	episode_done:True

I only wore black and grey or obsessively used an app for color matching because I was so scared of looking like a fool. That was about 5 years ago. I don't use the app anymore, I put things together based on how they look to me. Shapes and textures really, I said screw trying to color match because it's just never going to work for me haha.

But my darling husband split up with her anyway and we were immediately rewarded with a beautiful healthy daughter. So anyway, the other day she finally died and out of respect (yes, nothing but respect) my hubby and I decided to wear yellow, which is a mourning colour in her native country Spain. But it's also a colour of celebration here in England and now some people are calling me an asshole for celebrating that the old hag died and no one can contest the legitimacy of my children anymore. Anyway, AITA for being respectful?

I clocked that skinny jeans were out just by walking down the street.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - October 27	labels:I ordered some fatigues from an online milsurp store and they ended up being fucking Stan Rays. I decided to just get custom fatigues from Proper Cloth. I think my pants are gonna have to be all custom from now on. I can get away with some normal shirts, but some of my favorite brands (Corridor, Freenote, RRL) don't fit me. At least I fit into most outerwear?

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 09, 2020	labels:Hello all! I'm a woman shopping for my husband! He loves short sleeved button up shirts, and I want to buy him more. He has broad shoulders, and carries weight in his stomach, so sometimes it's a challenge finding a fit. He fluctuates between Large and XL, and is 5'7".  If anyone has any brands to recommend or just general advice on shopping for this male body type, I'd love to hear!

text:Knee-high boots, classy heels, or trendy sneakers?	labels:I tried *so hard* to be a heel person in my early 20s, as I love the look.   I'm tinyshort with size 33-34 feet so a 3 inch heel is basically 3/4 of my entire foot, so I've now accepted that the highest heel I can actually physically wear is 2 inches or a bit less.   I do own 1 pair of over the knee leather boots but I feel the style (flat, almond-ish toe, leather rigid front half with neoprene-stretch back half) is getting very dated.  In reality my shoe closet is mostly Birkenstocks, chelsea boots, combat boots/docs, statement sneakers (the uglier the better), statement ankle boots (western inspired, studded allover, neon, tabi toes, etc) and like two pairs of ballet flats.  So I'm definitely a trendy sneakers person.
text:Which higher end brands do you find to be "worth it" and for what?	labels:1. All Saints leather jackets: I tried on a ton of styles from lots of different brands and liked the design, fit, and feel of the ones I have from All Saints best 2. Globetrotter luggage: definitely a luxury product with a luxury price point, but I love the quality and the design, and I love that it has locks on it. I also like that it doesn't scream "rich girl" like a Louis Vuitton suitcase does (no shade to anyone that has their luggage, this is just why I decided against it). As a bonus, it's easy to recognize my checked bag when it comes out 3. Sorel snow boots: they're made in Canada and designed for Canadian winters. 'nough said 4. Chanel leather products: I'm not a fan of their classic flap or boy handbags, but I love the wallet on chain styles and other small leather goods. 5. Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk foundation: very expensive but it has a nice natural glow finish and it's one of very foundations that don't make me feel like I'm covered in goo	episode_done:True

text:+1 I'm not super sensitive to scents but I think it should only be smelled inside of someone's personal bubble.

I realized recently that i never see people older than young-adults wearing their button up shirts untucked. I'm nearing my mid-30's and I actually have been moving away from button up shirts to wearing sweaters just because I feel I don't look great with a shirt tucked in, and I'm getting to that age where I'm afraid I've grown out of the look.  Is this something that I'm over-thinking? Or is the untucked button-up shirt best left to the kids?  (Btw I'm talking strictly casual, going to the bar with friends, going shopping sort of attire)

text:“I'm all locked down with nowhere to go – but that hasn't killed my lust for fashion”	labels:I have one suggestion, get dressed and take pictures. It doesn't have to be for Instagram/facebook. It can be for just yourself. If you really like an outfit, remember it with a picture. You can take it in a park, or at a location that is memorable for you, with your SO, or with your cat. You should at least get a few good pictures with you pet in the 10+ years they reside with you.  It's actually a fun learning experience, on how to use the cameras. I am interested in photography and usually use a dslr, but for selfies, dslrs are not as good. With an iphone, I think it's an entirely different genre of photography. You have to use completely different lighting system, etc., to use it to its full potential.

text:Craig Green Spring 2021 Menswear Collection	labels:Call me crazy, but Craig Green has never done anything for me.  Sure, stuff like 1, 4, 6, 11 looks good, but is ultimately fairly ordinary (and I just don't think making stuff padded is all that innovative).  Fashion-as-art-onto-itself stuff like 10, 17, 22 also looks good (and I guess it earns him his avantgarde cred), but doesn't filter down to the stores.  So there is this gap between fairly ordinary stuff and out-there artworks that he can't seem to fill. But in that gap lives the stuff I'd like to wear.
text:General Discussion - February 17, 2021	labels:Had applied for a couple of dream jobs a while back. Just received an interview offer for one of them.

Still, first proper bite since early 2020, so it feels validating.  Edit: Really appreciate the goodwill, guys. Rough market out there for pretty much everyone, so I'll pass on the goodwill to anyone else job-hunting!
text:Idk man. This kinda sounds like "people are enjoying the things I enjoy but *they're doing it wrong!!*", which is a pretty snobby attitude, imo.	labels:I suppose that's one way to take it and probably a piece of it, if I'm being honest.  You discredit the inauthenticity that plagues a lot of it in the process though. Maybe it's just what I experienced living in Brooklyn and observing kids who fetishized being fashiony and "poor" then finding out their parents are cutting their rent checks. Same as in the techno/dance music scene as well. Shows got absolutely ruined thanks to overexposure.

text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:If the rip is not to high I cut them into shorts! Gives me longer shorts than what they sale for the most part, since everything that's not a hot pant and that fits around the waist is hard to find for me.	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:Instead of tights, I usually wear leggings. I have a black pair and a navy blue pair, and imo they look like opaque tights (especially sice i always pair them with boots that cover the bottom of the leggings at the ankle, so you can't tell the leggings don't have feet). I find leggings way more comfortable and warmer than tights, plus more durable.

I have a few leather, and they are uncomfortable (for me). They all hold up for many years. I have faves that I switch out. I have one, only one that I have completely worn out.  Oh!

Worst: a crappy fast fashion cropped cardi that I bought on impulse thinking it might be a dark summer green but it is autumn. I have only worn it once out of a sense of duty...	episode_done:True

text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:This is all assuming normal wear (ie I don't spill a plate of spaghetti on myself).  * Underwear/socks, face masks-- 1 and done * Bras-- 3-4 wears * Tops-- 3-4 wears * Sweaters/sweatshirts (always worn with something under them) as needed * Pants-- 4-5 wears * PJs-- 4 wears or whenever I wash my sheets (I have this thing where if I have fresh sheets on my bed, I need fresh PJs) * Gym clothes (when that's a thing again)-- 1 and done.  I'm predisposed to sweat heavily.  But for me it is not how often I wash clothes but HOW I wash clothes.  I was exclusively on cold water with a tiny amount of (free and clear) detergent.  I am allergic to dryer sheets, so I avoid the dryer completely (communal facility, a lot of residue).  I use a drying rack to dry.  ETA-- Hand washing is my line in the sand.  NO WAY!   Also with jeans, I wash inside out. I use mesh bags as needed.
text:I just... I can't bell bottom... I just can't....  (This might also have to do with the fact that I live in the LEAST fashionable part of the US and people would likely have no idea bell bottoms are cool now unless you're strictly in a college bar...)	labels:What region are you in? The regional uniform here is: skinny jeans tucked into boots, plaid shirt, down vest, maybe a scarf, gloves and a hat.   College student girls on the other hand...several inches of snow on the ground last week and I see a girl walking down the street...in short shorts.	episode_done:True
text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:I watch a lot of fashion for women in Pinterest. I follow a stylist that I really like, (he combines clothes in a way I would never and I love it). I think I am getting better but I cannot get ideas on my own without inspiration.
text:What niche do you feel is missing from the fashion blogging/YouTube world?	labels:Women 5' and under. I wouldn't mind if they were 25+ and doing more professional-ish wear, but definitely would like to see more from the really short end of the spectrum.
text:Inspiration Has to Come From Somewhere: FireFighters	labels:FAQ:  * "Why did you make this album?" Because 65% of mens fashion is derived from military garments, why can't designers look to other occupations?   * "i dont want to look like a firefighter". cool, im not saying to dress like one. this is showing designers' interpretations of bunker gear  * is this new? no, not at all. most of these runway shots are from several years ago. GQ even wrote 2 articles in 2018 about this idea  * "blue collar stolen valour". no one is mistaking you on the street in a calvin klein 205w39nyc jacket to ask you to go save a kitten from a burning building  * which brands are these? Dries Van Noten FW15, Raf at Calvin Klein, Undercover, and i think a couple others

text:advice on how to stop buying clothes I don't need?	labels:Be aware that social media algorithms "learn" you, and the more you respond to ads the better they get at predicting what they might be able to sell to you.  This goes for how long you even linger on a post.  As soon as you see an ad with clothing coming up skip over it.  Don't even let it get into your mind no matter how cute it is.  The algorithm will take this that you are not interested and will stop trying to convince you you need this particular thing.	episode_done:True

text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:I manage a farmers market and can wind up doing tons of different things throughout the day. I normally wear sneakers but I always have a pair of timberland hiking boots with me incase I need to go in the fields. I usually wear two different outfit styles- black skinny jeans with black Nike airmax, loose graphic/solid tee, with an open flannel or oversized denim jacket. Other style is dirty-white converse, loose vintage mom jeans, tight solid colored top and either no jacket or a cropped hoodie. I keep my nails neat and painted and wear a thin gold necklace and diamond studs, so this helps me look a little nicer. Obviously my styles don't have to be as formal as yours but I'm also a manager so I usually look more put together than my coworkers who often wear leggings/athletic clothes.	episode_done:True

I've noticed more wide legged jeans or trousers online and I must say they can look good but on me they look like trash because I'm short with wide hips, I hope skinny jeans will never go out of fashion.

text:Shitpost Saturday: Ghost Outfit	labels:Well thank God I died on the weekend instead of on a workday in my Branded Company Polo!  My eternity outift is now a sustainable tencel orange patterned wrap dress (with pockets), no shoes (unshod is the new barefoot shoe), my comfiest sports bra and wool boyshorts. The backwards fallen dregs of the civilization of the future will be terrified of my gen 3 hand-me-down Apple watch and spooky skeleton earrings. My now forever haircut is thankfully decent second day curls at shoulder length so I can still feel good post-mortem.   I died while on the side of the highway while waiting for AAA to recharge my dead electric vehicle after a man with a hook slashed my pale delicate throat. I spend my afterlife haunting anyone with evil karma.   Ghost names are received, not given.

text:What fashion trend/s have you been obsessed with lately?	labels:Never gave up wearing corduroy. It's been a wardrobe staple for me in fall/winter. I have cord pants in multiple colors and a rust colored trench coat. Can't get enough if it.  My obsessions have been extra squishy lounge cardigans (I talked myself out of a pair of extra squishy pants) and knit fingerless gloves.	episode_done:True
text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:I love their (Amy, Dione, and the Tibi brand) style but sometimes their pretentiousness irks me. They go like oh you can wear whatever you like but then they come up with 1000 rules about what should not be worn together. Anyway, if you like that style and also like to DIY things you can totally adjust regular items to look like Tibi ones. For instance, the asymmetrical shirt that closes a bit on the diagonal, the buttons that are used to pull up the sleeves, the ankle bands on some of their pants, etc. can all be recreated relatively easily and you don't need to spend 100s of $ on their "affordable" items (Amy's words, I always crack up when she boasts about how affordable Tibi clothes are).

text:Now I need to find a super femme tailored tweed blazer with elbow patches. Except I don't because I'm moving to a tropical climate and have too many blazers.

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:Never. Bags are utilitarian, go everywhere, get dirty, get more wear than anything else I own.   I want functional, long lasting, and unobtrusive. I also want it affordable enough ($100) to be able to replace it easily when it starts to show wear.	episode_done:True
text:Is black tie comfort fashion a thing?	labels:Yes I call it formal pajamas. Brands like Johnny Was, Citron Santa Monica, and Eileen Fisher (her silk, velvet, and silk georgette). Plus the $$$ designer versions of these. A draped  band collar top in a brocade, and matching loose pants isn't quite black tie but it is formal!   For absolute black tie, I'd say maybe...Donna Karan Urban Zen + major jewelry. something like that. Like a full length avant guarde kaftan in shockingly expensive silk with shibori tie dye or something.  However perfectly fitted vintage clothing + sensitive skin likely isn't happening.   But you can translate aspects of that to your style---like for example you can get a full length ruched parachute silk skirt with granny boots and a draped lace top + a "mourning coat" for a funky "Magnolia Pearl" lagenlook formal style.	episode_done:True
text:The Pajama Spectrum	labels:I live in the tropics AND run hot, and have found that linen PJs and linen bedding are a sweaty girl's best friend	episode_done:True
text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:I think you can easily improve on what you have. For example, a dark wash or black pair of jeans will instantly look "dressier" than a light wash one. So you could start by getting the same jeans you already have in darker colours. One very easy way to instantly dress up jeans and a t-shirt is by adding a blazer, just a basic black or grey one will go with everything. Also, wearing flats or loafers instead of trainers also instantly ups the look while still being "jeans and a t-shirt". I think these changes would be a good place to start!	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 23, 2020	labels:I always have trouble finding pants that fit. Knowing this, I ordered two pairs of Levi's Xx Standard Taper Stretch Chinos. One in a 40 waist, the other in a 38 waist. The 40W arrived first and is definitely too big in the waist. I figured the 38W would be a good fit, but they arrived today and are too tight in the crotch, too constricting, too much bulge and too much VPL. This is always a problem, I guess because of the shape of my body. Can you recommend a brand that would work for me?
text:Does anyone take their “power color” really seriously? Basing a whole wardrobe around one color - not just choosing an accent color for a neutral capsule?	labels:You should just buy a couple tops and bottoms in all 4 colors so you can switch it up depending on your mood, the season etc. I feel like if you stick to only one colour, you may look like they're wearing the same thing everyday	episode_done:True

I'm very anti spending a premium on plain t-shirts solely because, in my mind, "t shirts are meant to get beat up."  Life is full of oil stains and mud, sharp corners, and pets with claws.

Not a perfect system but better than buying new and I definitely value the clothing more as a result of the effort. At this point I have bought two new items - a rain coat and some new work shoes, both necessary. My loophole is quite extreme but proof I think that humans will always find a way around an ultimatum!
text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:I have a fairly varied wardrobe.

I might have to change my strategy, though, because I moved to a place with almost no thrift stores, which is how I always maintained my big eclectic wardrobe :/

A good winter coat, better to invest more in something stylish and long lasting than to have several that are not great quality.

text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:The perfect camel or warm brown wool cocoon coat.
text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:I go directly to the exact item i'm shopping for, used to be formal dresses but i don't wear them anymore, so now it's just running shoes.  Try on everything in my size, if something fits, then i hit the housewares real quick, at least glance at the novelty socks, and take a quick perusal of men's pajama pants (they fit me better than women's).

text:Good quality men's jeans?	labels:Just wanted to reply that I'm a raw denim guy, but a lot of people are going to throw out raw denim recommendations to you.  One thing to be wary of.  Raw denim is unforgiving, so in the slimmer cuts I have found them **MORE** likely to have crotch blowouts than other jeans.    I've never had issues with crotch blowouts in your standard levis/gap/j. crew brands.  My first 2 pairs of raw denim had crotch blowouts, because I wore slim fits, and the point of tension is in the crotch.  My 21.5 oz and 16 oz raws had holes forming within 6 months.  I've since bought a pair of Samurai's in a straight cut and they seem as if they will last forever, but they are NOT slim.
text:do you have OCBDs from some other brands you can compare it to? I've heard good things about their product and own one sweater from them.	labels:If you don't care about ethics, Kamakura is solid and hovers around that price point. I don't wear that one anymore.  If you have more to spend, Drake's OCBDs are nicer from my experience.  For more casual shirts, Portuguese Flannel is great and is around Norse Projects' price point.	episode_done:True

text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:I purge about once a season. Lately my purge thought process has been: "when was the last time I wore this?" "will I wear it again in the foreseeable future?" "do I like how this looks on me/fits me?" and "does it make me happy?" There are some items I've kept, simply because they make me happy to look at. But those are few. Most of the clothes I've been keeping are clothes that both fit me well and make me feel good. I've found that by sticking to that mindset, I've not only been more picky about my clothing purchases, but also my purges have been getting smaller as my closet has become more staple pieces than on trend.  I do a combination of selling and donating my clothes. I sell to a local consignment shop and also to places like ThredUp and Buffalo Exchange. Both have a mail-in program that is incredibly helpful. I donate whatever is leftover.	episode_done:True

text:Why 14k vs 22k?	labels:Some reasons could be:   Gold is a soft metal. 22k gold will become damaged easier. Usually more important factor for rings that are worn everyday. In some countries, jewelry is made 14 or 10k gold. Some people prefer the color of 14k to 22k. The color difference is the other metals added to the jewelry.	episode_done:True
text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:I feel like in 2021 the trends move SO FAST you could wear anything and it would be in style. I like to read whowhatwear and in the same article stylists will contradict each other on what's in or out. Also there is probably a popular subniche where the item is trendy.  So if there's something I love but feel or looks a little off, I just save it in storage. In a year or so, my feelings on it could be renewed and it could be the next big thing.

It still cost a lot but the effort was so appreciated - I love him for these efforts he makes dearly.	episode_done:True

I'm happy to just deliver the item and receive cash, but I'm not sure if Grailed would be happy with that since they don't receive any commission for listing my item, plus there won't be any feedback on the transaction.   So then I figured I should just do it through the platform and have them pay via paypal, but I want to make sure the money will be in my account cause usually the system holds it until theres tracking.	episode_done:True

Lazer hair removal isn't a financial priority. So. Skirts and dresses are very much a miss. And don't even get me started on high heels.

I died in a fatal laboratory accident while attempting to give myself superpowers.

I'm not sure whether I'm going to haunt my new house because I love it and I'm sad I only got to live in it for 6 months before I died, or whether I'm going to haunt my old job and make all their experiments go wrong.

Like too perfect, I can wear just a tee underneath and it looks reasonably slim cut yet I can fit a whole hoodie underneath. This is my first chore so I'm interested in a comparison with another brand's, because in usual Drake's fashion it was eye wateringly expensive, and I'm already itching to buy more from the collection.

text:Bigger, Longer Coats	labels:I got a long coat in college that's not quite floor length but hits me about mid-calf, and in recent years I've gotten a bit self-conscious about wearing it but honestly for comfort and warmth, it's one of my all-time best purchases. It can't be understated how much extra warmth you get from having your legs protected from from wind, particularly in the bitterest days of winter where you might have 3-4 layers above your waist (undershirt, shirt, sweater, blazer) even before putting a coat on but your legs are probably just trousers unless you're going hardcore with long-underwear leggings.  For what it's worth, I also got more compliments on it than any other single garment I've ever owned. Not many men wear long coats anymore, if at all, but people seem to love the look when someone is willing to try it out.

But I like what I like, so... *shrug*	labels:They can pry my swing dresses and circle skirts from my cold dead fingers. I don't care that I'm pushing middle-aged and out of trends, twirling makes me happy.
text:lol its cuz they can always see your dick outline in Grey sweats Go ahead try on any grey sweats	labels:do you not use underwear when wearing them?

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 21, 2020	labels: Can anybody help me find an appropriate overcoat? I have a decades-old wool topcoat I inherited from my father. It's a deep navy blue double-breasted coat with a notched lapel that comes just past the bottom of my calf. After years of repairs and cleaning, it's finally giving up the ghost, looking more appropriate for a Dickensian pickpocket.  It seems to me that most topcoats these days are knee-length at best. Perhaps the fashion of coat I'm looking for is no longer in favor? I have found similar coats from very high-end retailers I've never heard of, but in pure cashmere and costing thousands of dollars. I'm willing to spend between $500 and $800, but anything beyond that is out of reach for me. Am I looking for a unicorn here? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:I highly recommend Blondo for classic waterproof leather/suede boots and booties.

As a bonus they are comfortable and reasonably priced.

text:tbh dude cropped pants and cuffs have been in style for 10+ years, and have been around for decades prior to that. Breaks are coming back around, but crops and cuffs aren't going anywhere. idk why people have such a harsh reaction to it	labels:I know theyre fashionable, but I dont think everything thats fashionable looks good.  I think people have a harsh reaction because they look so incredibly bad much of the time.  Sure, a little short can look clean, but too short and you start looking like a leprechaun.  Its unbalanced.  You dont need a break in your pants to look good.  Just need the pants to reach the top of the shoes, imo.
text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:I'm 34 and still haven't figured it out. I wear jeans, tees and boots. I find layering looks good but in the summer, it's hot and I can't do layers. A few ladies have recommended dresses since it's one piece and easy to wear but I'm unsure about shoes. I don't like heels.
text:Let me just look out my window... nope still old russians and athleisure in Weho.

There was even an older man I saw a couple weeks ago in a guernsey and big cords... iconic  Don't get me wrong though, vast majority of people over age 25 are in various forms of bizcaz purgatory or mall stasis.

text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:Gonna buck the trend a bit and say I miss jeans. And I haven't really been a jeans person since my early 20s...I had a varied collection of trousers. Then skinnies achieved near total dominance, I put weight on so had to say goodbye ro all my old trousers and I kinda got in a rut? Jeans were just functional, slightly uncomfortable basics. I find high waisted stuff very uncomfortable and unflattering so shopping for trousers has been a bit difficult and very limiting for most of the last decade.   Now I'm bloody sick of black leggings and skinny jeans, I'm ready to get a couple of new pairs of trousers in different styles.  I also slightly miss makeup? I don't wear it anymore usually because busy/lazy/dirty job but I've had more free time. I don't even do zoom calls so it seems like a bit of a waste to just...Have it on.	episode_done:True
text:How do we feel about see-through totes?	labels:Personally, they make me feel like I'm participating in some kind of bullshit high school security theater exercise.  Plus no one needs to see the worn out hair tie, forgotten emergency tampon, fifty-seven cents, and squashed stick of gum in a flavor I don't even like that are going to instantaneously accumulate at the bottom of the bag as soon as I buy it.

Didn't even look through it. Probably the most expensive gift was worth around $100, but being done felt good. Hope who ever found it enjoys it!
text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:You are not a dirty girl! I wash undershirts/tanks, bras, underwear, socks and leggings after one wear, everything else is inspected for stains and gets a smell test first  Edit - all my bras are either sports bras or bralettes, which wash better, but I don't like re-wearing them. I don't wear real bras anymore.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone take their “power color” really seriously? Basing a whole wardrobe around one color - not just choosing an accent color for a neutral capsule?	labels:My power color is pink, I like more of a dark fuchsia as the ideal on. I have always used it as an accent via a cardigan and via color blocking. This year I am working on my separates, and I have grabbed more pink solids. Hot pink satin joggers, fuchsia tee shirt dress, and a great hot pink peplum. I am not very good at monochrome, but I like color blocking and I do not mind mixing bold colors. It sounds fine to me. I have even added some pink purses, and I have blush pink sneakers.  If I ever find the right separates, I will go for a multi tone pink outfit, with neutral shoes.	episode_done:True

I have to stop myself from falling for it every three years or so.

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:Black jeans make stuff more dressy. Grey jeans match well with pastel colours or with black tops. I would start with those since you are a jeans lover!  Real pants can be more difficult to find a nice cut and length, but if you find a check or pattern you like then those are always the pants I reach for first- it is nice if you have a check with a tiny bit of colour in it cause then it pairs well with plain tops in that colour.
text:Has anyone just said screw it and focused more on fit than color scheme for your outfits? What's an unlikely color combination that you ended up loving?	labels:I never thought black and navy went together, then I was in a hurry one day and paired navy pants with a black shirt. I've never looked back.	episode_done:True

text:BoF: J. Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:It does feel like a cruel irony that after 7 years in the workforce I finally have the kind of job where people dress up for work coupled with a salary that would allow me to splurge on the green speckled tweed blazer I've always wanted from J Crew, that I am now FT WFH and also J. Crew has completely disappeared from Canada, maybe forever. Ugh.  It's weird because I truly hate half of their inventory but the other half I'm like goddamn yes gimme those high-rise tapered pants in purple herringbone. Except I can't take a risk that they will look atrocious on my pear-shaped frame when it's $250 minimum for shipping and god knows what the return policy is like.

text:Yeah this era was the look of hyper consumerism and I am done with that BS. People have struggled to define this era but I would say its very much about having the mass-produced fashion style. Fast fashion was a new thing and tons of synthetic materials / blends popped up on the scene. I thought we agreed that natural fibers are better and fast fashion was destroying the planet? I'll stick to buying second hand quality items from the 80s and 90s.	labels:The defining behavior of the early aughts was going into the Forever 21 that had just opened in your suburban mall and buying a *stupid* amount of cheap clothes, like 9 shirts and 4 pairs of pants, and then going down the escalator to Hollister and doing the exact same thing there, too.

So far I've tie-bleached and tie-dyed a couple of t-shirts, neither of which I liked anymore. Now I love them! I also bought some iron-on letters to add sayings or quotes to a couple of other plain tees. Remaking the two t-shirts was very fun and was even more of an adrenaline kick than shopping, I think because it was a creative outlet.	episode_done:True

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:The only thing that puts me off buying certain fast fashion brands second-hand is the quality. Most of it falls apart within a few washes.  Some brands hold their RRP "value" on places like eBay (I'm seeing Zara and & Other Stories being sold at near retail prices!) and it's just not worth it.  There's nothing wrong with buying second-hand fast fashion though!  If you're going to buy something, it's better to buy what's already been made and is being resold.  You're not supporting unethical businesses or increasing demand, and you're reducing waste.	episode_done:True

text:Somebody else loosing so much time to choose the right item to buy when looking for something? I feel it cost me more in time when I try to buy responsibly.	labels:I feel the same way! I can be super picky when it comes to clothes. I know exactly what I want and what would look good on me but it's hard to find both in stores with a limited selection but it's also hard in the endless sea of clothes that is Poshmark/ThreadUp.   Sometimes online shopping makes it easier to filter things out but other times it makes things harder and not being able to try it on is a huge downside. I have so many things from Poshmark that I've just donated because I didn't like the fabric or the fit.   What don't you love about the clothes out there you're seeing right now? Is it the style, fit, color, etc.?	episode_done:True
text:Do you have a childhood fashion icon? If so, does their influence show up in your wardrobe today?	labels:Indiana Jones. My actual clothes range from faithfully vintage-butch to more femme, but for as long as I've been into purses, the unspoken rule is that all purses have to be something that he would plausibly carry. Consequently, I have a small hoard of vintage leather Coach flap bags in various browns, although Indy's little man purse is actually a canvas army surplus bag, I think.	episode_done:True

text:Villanelle's Killer Wardrobe, Once Again	labels:Well there goes any inspiration I had to clear out my closet and refine my style down to a singular aesthetic... seriously though, great post. I appreciate seeing pieces I recognize (Ann boots!) in a totally different arrangement than the usual (head to toe Antwerp). I haven't seen the show but I find this style aspirational - millennial, ADHD, switching moods at the drop of a hat, playing with gender, the textures, the silhouettes - in a way that I usually don't. So I'm inspired to watch it now.

text:Agreed. RRL has changed and isn't what it used to be. I've at least seen that with their jeans. I'd much rather pay less and pick up a lightly used pair from a decade ago rather than something new. I'm not familiar with their recent leather products, though.	labels:Interesting, I always hear RRL as the grail brand

The downside if of course the insane cost, but if you can splurge, they're gorgeous! I've been personally really loving my loungewear from Mate the Label, particularly the thermal wide leg pants/matching long sleeve. I have two sets now and I feel so much more put together even when I wear loungewear the entire day (which is often now...). I also bought their tencel sleep set recently and they're super comfy. They're not cheap either, but I like that they are made in the USA and from clean/sustainable fabric!	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 29, 2020	labels:So super specific question, and I'm probably gonna see if there's a leatherwork in my area to really fact check anywho, but I recently purchased a woman's shearling sheepskin jacket. Found it while thrifting and I just love the texture so much. Anyway, the only issue I can forsee (if it stretches enough to fit my shoulders) is I can't imagine it won't handle being wet very well as the outside is suede (I don't know the exact wording for it but the shearling is a single piece). So I was wondering if anyone has any ideas on waxing it to make it a little more.... Utilitarian.

text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:I think a lot of people here that say their clothing falls apart quickly aren't properly caring for their clothes. Growing up I learned to wash everything together on cold. As an adult I had to read articles and watch YouTube videos on how to care for my clothing. I recommend everyone learn how to properly launder their clothing.
text:What was your first 'expensive' fashion purchase?	labels:I was the first person I knew to own 7 for all mankind jeans back when they had only one or two washes.  The year was 1999 and I was school shopping with my mom for my first day of HS and I HAD to have them.   I also had like 10 pairs of the same pocketless, ultra low rise Diesel jeans in every color imaginable in HS.  I don't think I will ever love a pair of pants the way I loved them - the seam across the back was so sick and completely made pulling up your pants 10,000 times a day worth it.	episode_done:True

text:Gorpcore: How Arc’teryx Parkas and Salomon Hiking Boots Became High Fashion	labels:This is going to sound strange but hear me out and it'll make more sense.   The young and soon approaching middle age peoples prefer to live in the city. People are shifting towards walkable cities, or at least are trying.  People approaching their thirties, unlike in year's past, are not moving to the suburbs.   Living in the city, means that you would mostly not have a car. Using public transport, or walking/biking around means that you would be exposed to the elements much more than someone that lives in the suburbs and commutes everywhere by car. Being in a city also exposes people to hazards such as being sprayed by a car/bike driving past a huge puddle, wind tunnels, etc. Outdoor apparel, while a little overkill, handles these niggles much better than "fashion" apparel.   This is why I feel that they are getting more and more popular.

text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:As someone who dresses like an absolute nut job I have learned that generally speaking as long as your outfit is overall appropriate for the situation, you can get away with murder. Like I wouldn't wear a sequined micro mini or ballgown to my office job, but I would absolutely wear a velvet suit and a bunch of brooches. I have also noticed that when I wear pieces that I love, my confidence increases throughout the day. Sometimes I have moments in the day where I look down and think "dang, this outfit is cool and I feel cool!" Those moments just give me a boost of confidence all on their own. The last thing is that people are generally too busy with their own lives to notice what you're wearing. They're doing them, so do you and have fun with it!   edit-words

I can't walk well in them, and I live in an area where I need to do a lot of walking/use public transit/etc. I need shoes that I can actually do things in!  I do hate ankle pants because I am an odd height and they don't look good on me with normal shoes. Aside from that I don't feel super constrained.

text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:I know I'll get alot of hate for this, but leggings are NOT pants. Sure, its cute with an oversized sweater that covers your booty and some nice boots or if you wanna workout or lounge around at home. But I always thought it was weird when adults where leggings like they're pants. I know they're comfortable but I don't think they should be considered "fashionable" imo.   Leggings look cute on toddlers tho.

I don't have a super-great grasp on what the formality levels are going to be at work yet, but I'm definitely hoping to get some great all-weather boots, some super warm leggings for non-work or work from home wear. The new job comes with a promotion so I'm going to need a few suits and some wool dress slacks for work (for those days when it's just too cold for anything else!).  I'm thinking a lot about velvet and knit and texture, trying to do longer (and warmer!) skirts than my usual pencil skirt without looking girlish or dowdy... and trying not to splurge on every coat known to man (four wool coats and a cape isn't too-too much, right?)

text:I (M/39) just bought some bright yellow, women's, terry loungepants from August November. What wonderful "non-female" fashion items have you purchased recently? Do you ever dip into the men's section?	labels:I have a lot of luck with men's sweaters when I'm thrifting, and also at stores like H&M, where I can get cotton or merino sweaters for the same price as acrylic garbage in the women's departments.  I usually go for sweaters with raglan sleeves so that shoulder fit is less of an issue, because I'm quite small, set sleeves on menswear don't really work for me.

I've spent so much money on them and have bought cropped jackets, shirts, tube tops, etc, to match.  However I don't like wearing them anymore because they squeeze my fucking organs. I literally get stomach pain/cramps and am miserable.  But I continue wearing them when I have to go somewhere that I know I'll be at for a short amount of time (i.e. grocery store). I wear them out of guilt and don't want to think I threw my money away.
text:FAQ: What are the different use cases of boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes, and loafers?	labels:Spending one of my lurker tokens: *there is no good use case for any of these types of shoes.*  Come at me guys!  ^(More nuance: I can see the case for loafers in ivy/prep adjacent wardrobes, and for mocs of various flavours - but boat shoes and driving shoes are something I don't have any positive associations for.)

I don't crowd for new bins even pre-COVID and when everyone's in the new bins, it gives you a lot of space to peruse literally every other bin in there.	labels:Thanks for the reply!

text:General Discussion - December 26, 2020	labels:I just realized I am having a shoe identity crisis. Not all outfits work with boots, but my trousers selection has shifted a lot and no longer works with sneakers (or maybe I just don't like sneakers anymore). At least most of the time I end up changing my pants because I don't know what shoes to wear. And it's holding me back. I've never been a huge fan of derbies, especially black derbies because I associate them with school uniform shoes, and I'm forbidden to wear sandals. So now I don't know what to do. More types of boots? Buy nice derbies and see if I like them? Accept that all outfits go with boots? shrug
text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:Flared jeans :( They exist, but never just how I want them!
text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:I still own a few dressy blazers that I used to wear on first dates (both winter and summer). A woman in a blood red or striped jacked puts out quite and intimidating vibe. So once I would feel comfortable enough, I'd simply take it off to reveal a simple casual yet flattering dress. I would only do it if I found the guy interesting/attractive and it would instantly make me more chill and fun.  Always worked like a charm.  If you like the guy, it gives him a sense of relief as soon as you take the blazer off and relax. And if you don't like him.. well.. just don't take it off. Never been bothered after keeping it on.

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:I always keep dates 1-2 fairly casual and do drinks or drinks and dinner since I wouldn't want to be trapped on an elaborate date if we're not vibing.   Summer: Sundress, denim jacket, white canvas sneakers if very casual place, sandals if slightly nicer.  Winter: Dark or black skinny jeans, cute top/sweater OR satin cami if I am feeling good about the date, booties. Coat depends on the weather. I try to keep it cute but sometimes giant puffy coat is the only reasonable option.

Pricier, tighter ones tend to have less stretch, which makes them slide down or even have a flash point.

text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:There's no pressure? Buy what you want, wear what you want. That's what I do, and I've been an adult for a few decades now. A wardrobe that contains (also, or mostly, or some, depending on your preference) timeless pieces, is something that builds over time. You don't just go shopping one day and get it all a-la-Pretty-Woman.	episode_done:True

text:Thanks for sharing!   Items I'm looking for:  \- White sneakers - preferably leather   \- Jeans - Slim/skinny light blue, navy, black   \- Jackets - from bomber jackets to other non-bomber kinds  \- Sweaters or sweatshirts I can layer under my jacket  \- Long sleeve shirts/henleys  \- boots   If you've come across any of these on amazon that you think may be decent purchase I'd love to check it out	labels:Amazon has pretty decent t-shirts and sweatshirts (not knit sweaters!) that you can get for a good price. You can also buy some decent quality sneakers from Amazon too, just make sure it's from a reputable seller and from a recognized shoe brand (Adidas/New Balance/etc.).  &#x200B;  However, for stuff like jeans, jackets, boots, and knitwear, I'd look elsewhere. I've bought jeans from Amazon in the past that came with low-quality buttons and ripped after 2 months of wear, so I don't think the quality is quite there. My recommendation would be to search on places like Uniqlo/Carhartt/Champion or even thrift stores to get better quality jeans/jackets/knitwear that can last you a lot longer than whatever you'd find on Amazon for a comparable price.
text:So fashionable is not the same to everyone, but here are some zero drop/wide toe box shoe brands that I think make shoes that are at least somewhat fashionable that haven't already been mentioned: Zaqq, Crupon, Groundies, Shapen, Peerko  More expensive: Cydwoq (have to choose custom options to get flat/wide toe box), Shandals, Gaucho Ninja, DaVinci Footwear	labels:I just wanted to add to your list Lems (mostly boots, super cute) and low drop Suaves.

Depending on your personal style, you can try a patterned, or colorful top paired with a dark coloured/neutral bottom, or vice versa. Or try monochromatic pairing, or some kind of color theme to the separates. Starting with neutrals is easier, and then maybe venturing into other color palettes, textures and patterns, depending on what you like.	episode_done:True

text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:I'm also nearing 40.  I have stuff that is unquestionably dated . . . BUT I don't really care because I feel like I've seen all the fashions now "in fashion" be horribly out of fashion in the past.  Most of today's "in-fashion" choices would have been laughable as horribly outdated during the time I went to high school in the early 2000s.   When I see teenagers wearing high waisted mom-jeans, I still think "wow, that looks a little dorky, they look like my super un-cool mom did in 1997."  I do have a pair on mom jeans, but I can't help  but think I look like Jerry Seinfeld circa 1993 whenever I wear them.	episode_done:True
text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:besides cleaning and storage it is very important to handle the items with ease. for example when you are taking off a pair of shoes or heels do not use your other feet to pull it out. use your hands to untie and remove your shoe properly. similar goes for zips and buttons.   avoid dropping them to the floor when you are done with your shoes or bags once back home. take the extra effort of putting them in their place then and there.   if you sweat a lot leave your jewelry outside for a bit before you place then in a closed box. this way it retains its shine and coating for longer.  give shoes and Demin a day break between your wears. this would give them time to breath and stay in shape longer.   watch out where you sit down and stand, this is basic.	episode_done:True

text:Low cuts usually end near the ankle, no show is exactly how it sounds - they're designed not to show at all.   No show socks are for people who dont want their socks to be visible when they are wearing shoes. They're usually used for warm weather shoes where it can be acceptable to go sockless, such as loafers, boat shoes, and sneakers/trainers.  Low cut socks are for when you don't mind a bit of sock, or you're wearing higher ankles shoes (i.e. hightop converse) where no-shows are not needed.   I personally enjoy my light cushioned Icebreaker socks during the summer. I also have some basic Puma ankle socks that work well on a budget. For no shows, I like Uniqlo and Stance.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I agree with you, as I aged and had other responsibilities I realised I did not care to follow trends.  Though I enjoy following fashion and learning what is going on. It is interesting to look at it as an expression of culture, social and public mood, technology advances, and as an artistic expression.  It's also interesting to see how fashion percolate (the famous Devil Wears Prada scene on the jumper).  On that same note, as fashion changes, it is difficult not to follow it. Trends come into most clothes we buy no matter what we trie to do.	labels:>Trends come into most clothes we buy no matter what we trie to do.  Exactly. And it's also really difficult to predict what will culturally "stick" as a more longterm trend that may even end up being a "classic." I remember when skinny jeans were becoming a thing and people decried they they'd be a passing trend, when they've gone really strong only until very recently (and even though they're no longer super fashionable, they're still a common "basic" at this point.)   I was recently watching an old episode of "What Not To Wear" and Clinton was aghast at the trend of people wearing white sneakers/trainers to the grocery store and anywhere other than the gym. That reaction seems so weird now that athleisure has become so ubiquitous.

They're accusing him of treating the leather with something that changed its colour, so they aren't accepting a return on that basis.  Most credit cards have built-in consumer protection so if you call your credit card company they'll typically refund you and go after the retailer.

text:Your whole list is basically of the opinion that anything beyond the bare minimum in price is not worth buying.	labels:The question was point of diminishing returns, these are the minimum price points for quality construction, so anything more you are paying isn't going to add as much value. That is what diminishing returns means
text:the general consensus is that he is divisive. YS has been always pretty hit or miss on a popular and critical level, his sneakers are obviously popular but lots of people hate them, etc. i think his music is way better than his fashion and i generally like his fashion.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your go-to basic fall tops? I’m talking long sleeve tees, sweatshirts, turtlenecks etc!	labels:Simons Twik basic turtlenecks. Theyre super soft! I find that the shoulders are a little bit wide but they still look sleek and polished.	episode_done:True

text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:It was fun for about a month. Yay, I don't have to get up & worry about getting ready for work. Now, we're almost 6 months in, and it's actually starting to affect my self-esteem. I've started to see myself as frumpy & lazy, even though I'm not. I've also got this great new wardrobe, and can only wear any of it on the weekends. It's getting old & I'm very much ready to go back to into work so I can get back to my routine.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 20, 2020	labels:So glad that my yjp pickups actually fit me lol
text:What are you most comfortable clothing items (cute or not)?	labels:I've been wearing black jeggings 75% of the time. Pajama-wise I just wear old tank tops for bed and cover them up with a soft thin jersey knit  robe when I'm around the house.	episode_done:True
text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:Found a great Missoni button down at SF Wasteland for $60 bucks. My friends thought I was crazy for spending that much at a thrift store, but I knew better!	episode_done:True
text:What are your predictions for 2021 suit style?	labels:Either a progressive movement towards "casualisation", because the need for comfort at work could become a real trend. Otherwise, something stricter in a conservative "party is over" reaction. Maybe cohabitation of both following the industry...	episode_done:True
text:Where do you get good quality, legit wool sweaters that won't rip/shrink after washing?	labels:Here in NZ we have fine spun Merino wool jerseys (as we call them) that can be machine washed without shrinking. Reason being that the wool is pre- shrunk at the plant before they knit them up.  I went on a tour of a plant some years ago and it was super interesting.   anyway having said that i always hand wash my wool jerseys.   The thing that shrinks them in the machine, or if washed wrong is not the hot water but the agitation . This stretches the fibres out and then they bounce back even tighter, if that makes sense.   So even when hand washing you don't want to agitate or rough them up much, just soak, then squeeze gently.  No spin drying natch.    i did find a merino fine wool jumper on ASOS a while ago, it was mens but a pretty coral pink.	episode_done:True

Just be aware depending on how busy Barbour is, it can take 3-8 weeks to get your jacket back.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:Black jeans. All my outfits revolve around black jeans. I have 5 pairs that I cycle through. I wear different pants only when I'm exercising or wearing a suit. Funny enough, I also have one pair of dark blue jeans that I wear to nice restaurants that pair with a black blazer (black blazer + black jeans may be too much).  Also trucker jackets. I have three suede trucker jackets and two denim jackets. I get complimented pretty often (pre-COVID) when I wear these jackets. They're incredibly comfortable, durable, and stylish.

text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:Back in college I thrifted a washable silk top with a beautiful cut -like a relaxed peplum, just short enough to wear with a pencil skirt and not obscure the waist line but just long enough to wear with trousers without being a crop top. I lost it in a move somehow and have been looking for it's equal for almost a decade but no luck. I still get sad sometimes just thinking of how much I miss it.
text:20 Sweaters for Less Than $150, So You Can Achieve Peak Coziness - Esquire.com	labels:In my experience, sweaters are one of the few garments where there's a noticeable increase in quality as you spend more money.  Cheaper sweaters are noticeably thinner (both the threads and the sweater itself), which don't keep you as warm and don't last as long.   The good news is that there are some great options for getting high quality sweaters at low prices if you're willing to shop secondhand. For $150 you can find a gently used sweaters from Ines Meain and IMO that's a much better purchase than most of the cotton and fine merino wool sweaters listed in this article.
text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:I had to spend 20 years collecting pictures of what was 'me' before I could figure it out.

text:I've taken 566 outfit photos over 4 years (my style from mid-20s to 30)	labels:Re:working in fashion I completely agree. If you love a brand, don't ever go work for them. You end up becoming extremely disillusioned and see too many dark undersides. You learn these people don't actually have passion for the brand or the "vision" or the art, just passion for beating sales targets and convincing the mass population to buy more, more often. Those who try to steer the group in the right way, most times than not, get ignored and like all thing corporate assholes always win.  I left fashion retail and joined an outdoors retailer recently. I was so nervous I didn't know anything about bike parts or camping gear but all that didn't matter when it came to doing my job well. Now I can focus on doing my job well (and have fun doing it) and focus on really loving fashion the way I did before I started in the working world.

text:Shitpost Saturday: Let's talk about Fall!!!	labels:I really like flannel chaps with suspenders.  What you wear underneath is how you can spice it up day to day.
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:Ha, almost everything in 2000s was basically awful for me as a short waisted person with long legs and a large chest, so I pretty much ignored all the trends, never wore a camisole or layered tissue t shirts. In high school, I wore Pac Sun screenprinted hoodies, and midrise jeans with elaborate embroidery on the pockets. (High waisted was not common, sadly.) I already was onto Etsy and Modcloth before it was really popular because I was a loner in high school, so I already moved onto ponte knit leggings and colorful trenchcoats and more twee clothing by 2008-2009. I also wore sequins during the day, but I always enjoyed that.	episode_done:True
text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:Costco's Nicole Miller Original leggings (though it's been a few years since I bought them and I heard that maybe they changed? I really hope not, as I need a different size.)  They came in a three pack, were super inexpensive, full-length, wide waistband, and the fabric quality is nice and high. They're the only leggings I've ever had where I could get multiple wears without them bagging out at the knees. I've had much more expensive leggings that don't even get through a whole day.	episode_done:True
text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I think they'd see an uptick in at least buying activity in existing users, if not an outright increase in new users who are there to buy, if they implement "search alerts" like they have on ebay/other auction sites (and many job search sites lmao), so if an item is listed that fits my search string, I will get an email about it instantly. Even a "saved search" function like they recently implemented on etsy would be better than the whole lotta nothing they have right now. I feel like so many people who are on secondhand shop sites have a specific item or brand they're looking for, and making it easier for them to find it can only be a positive.

text:Which pieces make you feel like you’re really cool?	labels:Corsets man, like for real.

Like, in a vacuum they could be the platonic ideal of yellow and gray, so I can kind of appreciate how they are both true mid-tones, but I don't like them together (for some reason it's giving me flashbacks to the chevrons and turquoise of 2010 decor) and I don't find them particularly inspiring right off the bat.  Or it could be that as a warm-toned olive I know they will both look terrible on me, lol.

I also have dense breast tissue so they look like small Ziploc bags filled with sand lol. I don't care though. I've always hated underwire bras because if it fits the big one, the small one just bounces inside the cup all day. It drives me crazy.

text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:I wouldn't say I inherently hate the brand but I think Champion is an example of a brand that exploded a few years back/to now basically all because some celebrities or whoever wore it- and everyone who wears it now is most likely a ding dong hypebeast type or the VSCO type girl or whatever. Like I'm old enough to remember it being bottom tier Wal Mart level shit you'd get borderline made fun of for wearing- but now all of the sudden it's enjoying this moment. So it's just that perceived inauthenticity and collective pivot in peoples' minds to a fashion name to people rather than just athletic apparel that irks me somehow.  However though, the Todd Snyder Champion stuff is PHENOMENAL- it's not the mainline stuff. You don't see any of those assholes rocking that.

I used to do it on google sheets, but Airtable is much nicer.  These spreadsheets help me be intentional about what will actually add to my wardrobe. Do I really need another solid color t-shirt? Having items sit in the wishlist also helps me make sure I don't want it on a whim. I did not really, truly want an Autodromo watch. Time with an idea as well as a system really helps regulate behavior.	episode_done:True

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:Honestly, I learned that the "investment" pieces of today are of quality that is way lower than it should be at those price points. Cashmere, silk, etc today are worse than they were 20 years ago and there is a large quality spectrum in these fabrics. Stitching and durability is also a major problem. For me, investment pieces are clothes that have a forgiving return policy so that I can buy, take home and try out of the day, perhaps dry clean or wash a few times before I make a decision on keeping that item. If they have a repair or replacement guarantee that lasts a few years, even better. I don't mind paying the big bucks if it means my piece of clothing is not going to be next to disposable after a year.

A few others of mine are: "Double agent posing as a Fox News Anchor," "Vogue Photo Assistant who is Always Fighting with her Boyfriend on the Phone," and "I'm Lost in this JoAnns Fabrics."

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:I've found big variation between different stores. Our local one isn't huge but has a lot of the things I love. The enormous TKMaxx in Birmingham (UK) which I was really excited about was nothing like as good for me - weird.  I have gotten pretty good as checking every single item fast in the shirts, jeans etc areas. Going frequently and enjoying the hunt is the secret.	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:In my experience, style is more about HOW you wear your clothes than it is about the clothes themselves. My advice is to start with items you can wear every day like accessories, footwear, outerwear, hair/cosmetics that fit your style so you can mix those with your current wardrobe instead of having to buy a ton of new stuff all at once again.	episode_done:True

Can anyone recommend some cheaper tapered cargo pants and hardshells/jackets for a beginner to try out the look?

text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:Our options here feel limited and I don't love any of them.  Value Village how's the biggest selection and I've had the most good finds there, but often their stuff is extremely expensive for a thrift store (some pieces get priced more than new retail.) I also don't like that they're a for-profit company but they market themselves in a way that it's easy to get confused and think that there are charity. I do appreciate that things are reasonably well organized by category and size, which makes shopping a large inventory a lot more productive.  I found some pretty good stuff at Salvation Army as well, and their prices tend to be much better, though I don't love supporting them because of the church's many bigoted positions.   We have a Goodwill, Plato's Closet, and a number of smaller independent thrift stores but I'm not sure I've found a single piece of clothing I want at any of them.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 01, 2020	labels:Does anyone recommend any oxford shirts with a slightly softer collar?   I haven't had to get a new OCBD in a while and the few that I have must have softened up over the years. In the last month or so, I've managed to rip two of them and spilled coffee on a third which won't wash off. So I bought three from three different companies and my god, the collars are just too damn stiff. I got a headache about 45 minutes into wearing the first one because of how stiff it was. I felt like I couldn't move my head around properly.  Have OCBDs gotten stiffer over the years since I haven't had to buy one or are there some softer ones out there?

text:Thanks for bringing this up! People like to push that super outdated advice that "you can never be overdressed for an interview!!!!" and that a suit is ALWAYS appropriate and that's honestly just a huge mistake. FFA is really guilty of pushing this as well.   There are more and more casual industries where showing up in a suit will reflect just as poorly on you as if you showed up in jeans to interview for a law firm. It makes you look outdated, out of place, inflexible, and clueless. You're likely to be discounted as "not a culture fit".   I've personally been in situations, back when I was young and stupid and believed the "dress formal/can't be overdressed" advice, where I was overdressed in my dumb blazer and shirt while the person interviewing me was in like, track shorts with a sweater with holes in it, even for corporate jobs. On some of those occasions, the interviewers were visibly amused.   Always research or ask about the culture/dress code.	labels:I'm a manager for a tech company where we are all since COVID working from home. Interviewed someone recently who showed up on Zoom in a full on suit and tie. It was so shocking to me. Ha. I can't really see much of the candidates on Zoom, but the collar, tie, suit jacket yes I can see that. I didn't know what to think, really.   Candidate was not hired, for other reasons; person who was hired -- I honestly don't remember at all what that candidate wore, it didn't really register one way or the other, over Zoom.	episode_done:True

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I have similar connotations as you about them being kind of cheap or tacky looking, but would add one other angle to it. While I'm 100% against the use of real fur/exotic hides, I think part of the cheapness animal prints comes from taking something that in its natural state exists on fur and copy-pasting it onto all different kinds of fabrics. Real cheetahs look beautiful and elegant. A poorly rendered cheetah print on thin polyester leggings just looks like a terrible imitation. There isn't this mental comparison going on with other patterns, like stripes or polka dots, because there's no "real" standard to compare to. They're just decorative patterns.  Even if you attempt to create a faux fur that more closely imitates a real animal hide, it's going to look cheap and fake (to me) unless it is really well done.
text:Shitpost Saturday: Pockets in Women's Clothing	labels:One giant pocket over each boob!

I have my own style and don't think it's attached to trends so much, unless the trends match up with stuff I like anyway.

Amazon's Halo was looking like a winner, but it doesn't have a display, GPS, or wifi connectivity, so it leaves a lot to be desired, but the look of it (basically just a cotton strap) I liked.  using for tracking steps/walking, biking, and sleep tracking mostly, has to work with android.  budget: 200, preferably under $130. in the US.
text:advice on how to stop buying clothes I don't need?	labels:Make a list of the things you need and only shop from that list.  Also, make a list of things you want/are eyeing to buy. Note down the price of each piece, and the pros and cons (does it fill any hole in your closet or can you make do with similar items? What do you like about it? Does it go with other things in your closet, like your rules about "5 outfits"? Can you commit to enough wear so that cost-per-wear is down to a certain amount of dollar, like $1/wear?) Then wait a few days, preferably longer. I usually find that by then, the urge to buy is gone.  "Shop" your closet is also helpful - make an inventory of things you already have and find new ways to style them.  And if all else fails, maybe take a break from social media.	episode_done:True

text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers. Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:I revamped last year since I was mid overhaul, so there were a few things I hadn't gotten a chance to try.  I did an excellent job with sweaters, which makes sense since I was really good about defining what I was looking for and sticking to it. I also thrifted a ton of coats, since I had been living in just one, with less luck.  I wasn't as specific in this area, and mainly just went for things I liked the look or quality of, and about half of which have worked out.  The older stuff I had been keeping around has been completely outgrown, and I've had no luck with the newer stuff, so I'm gonna be needing a good dressy wool overcoat.  Stand out is definitely the Land's End long green puffer which was fantastic on blustery snow days.  Last couple of winters have been pretty mild but it's more than worth the $20 I paid for it.	episode_done:True

The collection looks good; I like the silhouettes, the patterns, colours, next to the trousers and jackets (even the rolled-up sleeves; love it!). I do agree with BuscapefromCCD about the onesies/long johns; don't care for them as well.

Picked up an extra one from each of their clearance sales for the spring, but would really like to find something similar in a winter weight fabric.  Worst: everything I bought in February for my new job, but haven't really been able to wear as I started working from home in early March and don't anticipate being back on site until June at the earliest. (Bought some new dress pants, a couple of ponte tunics and a new leather tote bag).	episode_done:True

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:She was mentally ill and both neglected and abused me. I was routinely sent home from school due to having flees and lice, for example. She has problems taking care of herself  and constantly suffered painful dental infections due to poor dental hygiene. As a result, her teeth were mostly rotted by her fifties. But she taught me the most important thing: take care of myself, because no one else will. The memory of her pitiful teeth motivates me to always brush and floss after meals. The memory of the taunting and teasing and discomfort I endured keeps me a careful curator of my appearance from head to toe. The memory of the discomfort of poor hygiene motivates me to always be clean and well groomed.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: Why/ when/ how do you cuff jeans?	labels:**Why:** to make the hemline higher, to provide a visual break between your pants and your shoes (useful if they're a similar colour), or because they are raw denim that will bleed on your shoes excessively if you don't. I suppose some people also cuff in order to flex the selvedge ID, but why condemn yourself to a life of fruitlessly hoping that somebody will notice your selvedge ID?  **How:** idk, you just kind of roll them up. Usually a width of about an inch looks good, but experiment with wider or narrower cuffs as well as with the height of the hem and see what looks good.

text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:Being slightly more formal than average is rarely a bad position. It's easy to critique someone who's too casual but too formal is a little harder to criticize. It's also harder to criticize someone who's very obviously put together and making an effort than it is to criticize someone who looks sloppy.  Which means my strategy is usually to adapt my preferred wardrobe to be slightly more formal than most people and very obviously intentional and put together. Nobody actually cares that much that my dress is bright purple and silver when it's also more formal and nicer than their jeans and t-shirt. I don't want to look so much more formal than everyone else that I look really out of place but a slight formality let's me get away with more out there choices. Also helps that my wardrobe is pretty darn conservative about showing skin most of the time. You can get away with a lot more crazy when your knees, midriff, cleavage and arms are all covered.	episode_done:True

text:Is anyone into MBTI? Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels: I'm  an infp, when it comes to colours I mostly wear greens/ orange/ dusty pink,  and cream/ black neutrals. I like florals, colourful stripes and polka dots. I also wear other patterns if they are in a smaller scale. I prefer fitted/ cropped tops, with looser bottoms. So a typical outfit would be a cute top, mom jeans/ paperbag shorts and sneakers. In winter I'd also wear a cropped sweater/ wrap sweater (it's not cold where I live). Sometimes I wear dresses/ skirts, but it needs to be both comfortable and flattering. I only wear sneakers in every day situations, and when dressing up it's wedge sandals/ thick heeled booties. I walk uncomfortably in other types of shoes so I avoid them. Overall I might align with it? I wear cute things but nothing too crazy	episode_done:True
text:They are supposed to fit very snug to the body, so closing them would be borderline most of the time.	labels:They are not supposed to fit snug, they were originally designed to be worked in, and you can't really do that if you can't even close it.

My sister, for example, buys the same size leggings as I do despite her hips and waist being 5-6 inches larger than mine, and then complains about them being see through. I have strong suspicions that this is the reason people find thongs horrifically uncomfortable as well.	labels:And i buy a size larger leggings than i should because, guess what, if you buy larger leggings they are never see through, panty lines don't show, you don't ooze out the top, and they don't try to creep off of your body. And when they aren't skin tight i feel better about wearing them like pants. For reference, i'm a US 6-8 in denim and i wear size large leggings (except for workout gear i go medium for compression)
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:this point is also really relevant nowadays not just in fashion but in general queer 'trends', you see people picking up queer slang, particularly POC slang, or choosing to present on social media as queer-biguous yet get strangely defensive when people ask if they're actually queer. just look at people jumping on the girl in red / hey mamas / I cuff my jeans! trends on TikTok and other social media

text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:Took me a while to appreciate that loose != ill fitting and form fitting != well fitting. For example, that jacket accentuates the model's waist, is a good length in the arms, flatters their neck, and has a lot of interesting structural details and textures. The idea for me isn't baggy for bagginess sake, but usually some interesting structure or contrast in tandem with a more fitted piece or the natural outline of my body.	episode_done:True

It's awkward to ask for refunds on bad stuff, they dont open 7 days a week, poor/niche selection, dress rooms are mostly closed for obvious reasons.

text:What about the fact that Trump loses the election in a new way every day? A month's worth of "Trump loses" headlines are annoying, but they're not bad.	labels:That has been pretty nice, but I am a bit scared about the delusion I see from Trump supporters. Even though Biden has won, the fact that \~40% of people have had their brains so fried by fake news that they think Brian Kemp is conspiring with Hugo Chavez (dead), Fidel Castro (dead), and communist China to install Biden is crazy. I worry that we don't have much of a path forward as a country.
text:Oooh! What's the brand, you gotta dish	labels:It's a target brand, called "a new day".  I went and found it and then asked a person who worked there if they had more. No, this was the only one they had in the entire store, but!! I could go online and type in the number that was on the tag to buy more. So I went home and bought 13 more lol

An errand like the grocery store or pharmacy, nbd.  If I'm unsure I usually bring extra shoes, jackets or accessories so I can dress something up or down on the spot.

text:They're OK. You have to be realistic and expect 1-2 remakes if it's your first time with them. In the long-run if you need/want to order lots of shirts or trousers they're a good idea. If you just want a one-off purchase I'd be wary since remakes put the cost up.   Measuring is hard and you have to remember than you're taking 2D flat measurements while in fact your body is 3D. It's the same thing with people trying to get sizing advice online: 2D measurements on lasts or shoes are never going to account 100% for a person's 3D foot shape.	labels:I guess I've just gotten pretty lucky in terms of getting the fit right early on. The only time I had a problem is when I ordered a couple of shirts that I went way too slim on as an experiment, and that was entirely my fault.	episode_done:True
text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I've decided to fuck it and wear what I want to wear. I have literally no one to impress so my clothing purchases of late have been....questionable?  I've said hello to a halloween 50's dress with crinoline, a tree printed cowl neck dress, a faux fur lined hooded dress that is thin enough for Texas winters, and I have a 50's dress with skulls on it on the way.  I wore a witch hat, a raven and feather headband, black unicorn ears headband, and a 50's pillbox with veil pretty much every day from September to November.   I am quite enjoying my fashion of late. It's ridiculous and I love it. I even roped my bestie in (who is a nurse and goes to work every day) to buying matching dinosaur dresses with me. First I bought matching dresses for myself and my daughters, then her daughter saw them and asked for one and she bought it for her. Next thing I know she bought one for herself. We went exploring one day and found some cool murals and my husband took a photo of all of us in them and I've just hung it in my house because I love it	episode_done:True

text:I Dyed My Jeans With $6 Dye and Here Are The Results	labels:Ooh, this was pretty interesting.

These results make me think it's actually a perfect project to start, since I'm really more concerned with making it darker overall.	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:The funerals in my husband's family, in Texas, are very casual. The first one I went to, I wore a black knee length skirt and a black blouse. I felt very out of place, as no one else was wearing black, and I was dressed more formally than everyone else. But other funerals I've been to, all in Texas, people wore nice church clothes. Men in the family wore ties, but not necessarily a jacket, etc. Clothes weren't always dark, but usually very conservative.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 30	labels:Kinda asked about this the other day, but...  If you had to choose, when you got thrifted Alpha M65 or a Barbour?   Looking for fall/early winter obviously. Already have a heavier parka for colder, snowy days.

text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:A slouchy cardigan in a muted pattern.  Not mine, but I got it for my dad: Sunspel Riviera - they have some really nice yet understated colours in this superb mesh fabric. The aubergine is such a comforting colour - dark and easy on the eye, yet discernably saturated with purple. Some duller purples verge on brown tbh.  If you are lucky enough to find a good one in a reasonable price range - a bespoke or at least MTM shirtmaker. I was on holiday in Naples, spent basically Gitman money on bespoke shirts that are infinitely more special. Absolutely no regrets, it just conforms to my shoulder slope perfectly without any adjustment, and the armhole is so well-cut it doesn't dig into my armpits and yet gives me freedom of movement without snagging or tugging on the body of the shirt as I move. It made wearing a shirt become a pleasure, from a chore.
text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:I have a pretty good variety of stuff but I also tend to buy/wear a lot of black, too!  Pros: Black is sleek and slimming. I work in NYC where wearing black/dark hues is extremely common so I fit right into the vibe. A full on black outfit with black boots, jeans/slacks, a top and a cardigan can be accessorized really easily, like wearing a nice set of bright gold earrings, a statement necklace and a bangle.  Cons: Realizing each black is slightly different! D: especially for black clothes that have faded in the was over the years. It can be pretty jarring to really examine my outfit, realize I'm basically sporting 3 different versions of black, and hoping no one notices.	episode_done:True
text:It was rough as someone with hips back then! Muffin top no matter how small I was, and I was actually skinny way back when.   My adult body has filled out...all over honestly, I didn't realize how small I was in high-school, but especially in my lower half. I refuse to try to put this body into low rise jeans again. I refuse to be uncomfortable again lol.  I do want to add though that I know a lot of people hate the high rise trend! So long as we can keep both options available for sale, I'm happy to be untrendy so our low-rise-loving cohort can have a moment after almost a decade.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I wear an easy to wash layer under it and then wash it very infrequently, and dry on a rack	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:This was a few years ago. I switched from teaching to an office job and needed a more professional wardrobe. I'd also recently given birth so I was changing sizes rapidly and didn't have much time to shop. I got a pair of slacks that seemed to fit well in the store. First day I wore them to work I got out of my car and proceeded on the five minute walk from the car to the office. I got all the way to the office and someone pulled me aside and told me I'd split my pants in the butt. I was wearing a thong. I wanted to crawl into a hole I was so embarrassed!	episode_done:True
text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:Wool socks (dress and thick ones for the winter)  3 in 1 parkas with removable shell and inner layers  An array of cardigans from chunky to thin (looks much better than a hoodie when its a little cold) Thick quality knitwear (Cashmere, yak, camel hair, wool (shetland or merino))	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:What i have found really fun is to go on etsy and have vendors make clothing custom to your size. A more affordable option is Eshakti where you can input your measurements and adjust the garment to fit you perfectly.  They have many cute options and you know it will fit because its made for you! The custom size costs only $9 on top of the garment price which is super affordable!
text:Do you have a favorite brand or site for these? I would love some skin tone tights but get a bit overwhelmed when googling!	labels:Just like other people commented, Capezio is a really popular brand and I find has more skin tone choices.  Bloch or Mondor is also good. I just get whats on sale from my local dance wear supply store to be honest.    If you're a person of colour, there are some black owned/produced dance tights like Aurora Tights. But I've never bought directly from them so I can't vouch. I'm mixed so sometimes the more mainstream brands make them just dark enough for me.	episode_done:True

text:Big Coats	labels:This reminds me of one of my greatest fashion follies. A few years ago I bought a wool overcoat from J. Crew - not crazy expensive, but expensive for me. I got it just big enough to fit over my suit jacket, because I wanted it to be a somewhat slim fit.  Cut to today, where not only are fashionable fits roomier, but I've also gained about 10lbs (I was pretty skinny before, more average now). I tried it on the other day and it still works unbuttoned I guess :/	episode_done:True

I went to a new store, completely confused and stressed about finding the right one. Picked one of the rack to try on, not really looking at it, just liking the general vibe. Tried it on, couldn't stop smiling. Turns out, it's a sample, the last one in the store, and almost exactly my size! The woman at the store said she probably wouldn't have even picked it out for me to try because if it hadn't been in my size range I would have just been disappointed. But it fits! And somehow it's the perfect combination of my first two choices. **And** because it was a sample, I got it for $500 off! I'm so excited to wear it next year :) :)	episode_done:True

text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:I loved Modcloth, I bought most of my clothes from there. After the Walmart take over I ordered two dresses to test the waters. The zippers were made out of plastic and broke right away, the stitching was off and both dresses were really underwhelming in person.  I was tempted and ordered a sweatshirt on sale a few months ago and it was made out of the worst and cheapest feeling fabric I've ever encountered. In their defense, they refunded me for all three of the items. I just don't think they're worth another shot.	episode_done:True

Also a tight very cropped cardiagan buttoned up over bulky pants is my fave style so. Im here for that for sure. Kim Possible vibes pls.  Edit im thinking more and more about these and honestly this is one of the trends recently that has excited me most. Its just so dumb and silly and fun and I think thats really important in a lot of ways right now.

text:Can we talk sleepwear?	labels:When I prepared to give birth to my first child, I splurged on beautiful long sleeping gown / bathrobe set in white cotton.   It was comfy / flexible enough to accommodate my post-pregnancy recovery. But it was also luxurious and pretty - something that new mothers don't feel. (Also, my FIL was visiting & would often wander around with his camcorder! So I couldn't just walk around in my maternity undies).  I wore that set for more than 5 years.  I also have PJs that are button-down tops with matching little shorts. What makes the difference is high-quality cotton, good tailoring and detailing .  One set is black with white piping. Another is lavender. The guy I've been talking to (mostly via video) loves the black set, even though it's not overtly sexual like lingerie.  I don't wear anything silky to bed because it bunches up & also feels OTT.   Confession: I also "steal" hotel slippers because they are so comfy.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 21, 2020	labels: Can anybody help me find an appropriate overcoat? I have a decades-old wool topcoat I inherited from my father. It's a deep navy blue double-breasted coat with a notched lapel that comes just past the bottom of my calf. After years of repairs and cleaning, it's finally giving up the ghost, looking more appropriate for a Dickensian pickpocket.  It seems to me that most topcoats these days are knee-length at best. Perhaps the fashion of coat I'm looking for is no longer in favor? I have found similar coats from very high-end retailers I've never heard of, but in pure cashmere and costing thousands of dollars. I'm willing to spend between $500 and $800, but anything beyond that is out of reach for me. Am I looking for a unicorn here? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
text:Shitpost Saturday: Advice on Learning How to Hate Fashion	labels:My journey into hating fashion began when I received a compliment about a sweater. A *man* had the audacity to tell me he liked it. As in, he thought he could comment on a piece of fabric touching my *body.* Like most Americans, I feel uncomfortable with praise and needed to reject the compliment. I responded reasonably by taking things way too far and felt wounded and violated for weeks after the sweater comment incident. I resolved thereafter to hate all fashion, jewelry, and beauty. It may seem extreme to some of you, but I say there are no extremes when it comes to protecting ourselves from feeling slightly uncomfortable by other people's politeness.

text:Stockings vs Tights vs Leggings	labels:I wear fleece tights with knee high heat tech socks over them to help combat wind. This year I'm going to try thigh high socks over them to see if it will be warm enough for mini skirts. If you can get a maxi skirt that has cold proof materials in it like wool, then that will help too. Bonus points if it has a lining, if it doesn't then you can buy a separate one to wear underneath. It helps keep heat in and prevents your tights from pilling.	episode_done:True

text:My job sometimes requires me to drive to many different checkpoints in one day. Often as many as 15 or 20 different locations.

text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I see business casual as an opportunity to express yourself a bit more. My casual Friday go-to is jeans (because I don't normally wear those M-TH) and a trendy sweater or blazer w/ men's type shirt under-- coordinating belt and accessories are a must for me no matter what day. Pair this with casual flats or boots. My Friday looks are less stuffy than my M-TH attire. I work in higher ed; it's not suits level attire M-TH, but managers on up shouldn't be wearing jeans during the week at my place of work. Friday is where I show a bit more of my personality. I never knew I had so much to say about casual Friday attire. lol	episode_done:True

text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:Whoa... I am an adult woman with ADHD and I never thought about this somehow. I have MAJOR issues with restrictive clothing. Winter coats feel like a straitjacket, turtlenecks \*literally\* made me vomit when I was younger, and anything that's even slightly itchy or makes a weird noise (like a swishy windbreaker) drives me insane. I can't wear bracelets or watches because the sound of them clicking on my desk grates against my soul.  I usually live in American Eagle jeggings (soft joggers as soon as I get home), comfortable shirts, soft and loose sweaters/cardigans, comfortable ankle boots/Converse, and sometimes a well-fitting skirt with tights.  Interestingly, I have no issue with wearing tights, which I know a lot of women find uncomfortable. I don't mind wearing a bra, either.

text:advice on how to stop buying clothes I don't need?	labels:I've been watching YouTube videos of fashionistas showing their latest purchases, trying the new thing on with other things, sewing their own clothes, purging their closets, etc. It's like vicarious fashion. Right now I don't have the money or anyplace to wear new clothes (or old ones), so it's nice to watch others shop and spend that money and get the thrill of something new. Then I watch them trying to make the decision to let go of things that don't work for them, but often, even when it's obvious, they have a hard time letting go and that clutter just goes back in their closet.

text:Jil Sander has been a fairly reliable, respectable name in minimalist fashion for much of the 00s and there was some hype around her in particular when Prada invested in her label. Her collab with Uniqlo makes a lot of sense in the way that Uniqlo proposes itself as a sometimes minimalist take on basics. Recently she's also picked up some renewed hype because in 2017 she took on Luke & Lucie Meier as her creative directors. The Meiers are a creative power couple in fashion, Luke was creative director of Supreme from 2001 to 2009 when the brand was really exploding into serious prominence as "the brand to know" and now has his own label, OAMC. Lucie worked at Louis Vuitton and Balenciaga before she was appointed as interim creative director of Christian Dior with Serge Ruffieux between the tenures of Raf Simons and Maria Grazia Chiuri.  They're not exactly cult iconic celebrities in the way that some designers are, but they have enough credentials that they pull some weight.	labels:Definitely a good bit of info though I'd make it clear that her name and eponymous brand have picked up hype, and that her brand took on those creative directors in 2017, not her. She's no longer affiliated with her own brand's direction, though obviously, her design methodology has largely been inherited, and the performance of her eponymous brand also adds cachet and hype to her name, despite her disaffiliation.  They are inextricably connected but they are separate and distinct.

Let's just say that dressing like a relatively presentable 40 year old mom when you're in middle school doesn't exactly get you a ton of style points.	episode_done:True
text:Is it disgusting to not wear socks with shoes?	labels:It really depends on the quality/style of the shoe and the season imo.

It really made me come up with different combos and broadened my style a lot! You could give something like that a try.

text:What is something you've heard as fashion advice that isn't worth following?	labels:Probably the advice that anything I wear as a fat person has to be slimming or flattering. Yes I wear a lot of black, but just because it's easy not because it makes me look thinner. My size isn't a big secret or anything.   Also this is taking a really broad view but the fashion culture of planned obsolescence, declaring certain things "out" and other things "in," is super classist and unsustainable, so even though I enjoy reading about new trends I don't really care to follow them.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 08	labels:I recently got into biker leather jackets, but I read that you gotta drop at least $400 on a decent real leather jacket. I wouldn't be opposed to it, but my two main concerns are that:  1. The biker jacket aesthetic may not stick with me in the long run (even though I think they're super cool since a few months ago) 2. I'm currently at 160lbs and plan on bulking to 170lbs. I'm concerned that the jacket will be too tight in the shoulders, arms, and chest and I can no longer wear it.  I also understand that faux leather jackets are of inferior quality compared to real leather jackets, but it's also at a lower price point. Those things considered, is it worth buying a faux leather jacket over a real leather jacket? If not, what things should I consider while shopping for second-hand leather jackets?

As a professional woman in my late 20s, I've found her hands down the most stylish, yet professional "influencer." She's actually a professional stylist (Katie Holmes is a big client of hers!). She does virtual styling appointments for regular nobodies (like me) where she helps you figure out how to wear pieces in your wardrobe and sends you a bunch of pieces she thinks would really add versatility. She's all about maximizing the wear out of a few pieces. Finding her this year has dramatically changed how I approach clothes!

(stretch or elastic waist or joggers with a drawstring)    Wear some fun eyeshadow and mascara and a cute mask. Your personal style isn't limited to the neck down.
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 24, 2020	labels:Is the brand "Corbani" is any good?

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 21, 2020	labels:Hello. First time poster!  I was thinking about getting  a pair of raw denim/selvedge denim as my go to pants when I barista. As someone who has never gone down that route and currently wears skinny jeans as my go to pants, what are the communities suggestions on what I should get?  I did a little research on raw denim and the concept is very interesting to me. Something wearing over time, forming to your body and wearing down how you move sounds very cool and interesting for a work/fashion pant.   As a reference I wear a size 38 Jean, athletic ish legs for my size and usually wear a belt.   Thank you in advance!

text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:Back in college I thrifted a washable silk top with a beautiful cut -like a relaxed peplum, just short enough to wear with a pencil skirt and not obscure the waist line but just long enough to wear with trousers without being a crop top. I lost it in a move somehow and have been looking for it's equal for almost a decade but no luck. I still get sad sometimes just thinking of how much I miss it.

text:Harry Styles wears a Gucci gown as Vogue’s first solo male cover star	labels:I only found this and posted it because some bigot on twitter who needs not be named started bitching about it.
text:Yeah, I was thinking similarly. I guess it would have helped to define what one would consider a hit or a miss and our definitions might be different, but I feel like a hit would be something I found myself actually incorporating into my wardrobe in a meaningful way (read: something I wear regularly)	labels:I think I could've been more clear in my write-up. I have a vision of how I want to dress and things I bought in previous years didn't always reflect my "ideal" style. The pieces I bought this year, in my opinion, fit into my Pinterest Inspo board more than any ever year. I guess to call something a "hit" I asked myself, 1) do I like this piece of clothing and feel confident in it 2) If someone took a photo of me in this piece would it fit in with my Pinterest board and 3) Next year (when I expect to get out more) will I wear this piece of clothing a lot
text:I wear capes all the time. I say just do it! Nothing wrong with getting stared at (most people probably just think you are classy/have great taste/into fashion). I wear this black fur ysl Cape so often and have received nothing but compliments on it.	labels:	episode_done:True

And didn't even think about it in context with the growing resurgence of back to y2k fashion trend! It all makes sense and shows I'm not that special hahaha.    But truly I love the matchy matchy looks that still look playful. Brings life back into fashion that has been so minimal and neutral for a while tbh.	episode_done:True
text:What are your go-to, everyday shoes?	labels:My no-brainers have been:  - (casual) runners. They're blue and they match most of my outfits. Mine are Ekko, cuz comfy, but they have a similar look to Vans. (incidentally they replaced a pair of Vans)  - (work, corporate but also casual) ankle boots with heels - I had a pair in black and then later got a pair in white. They go with pre much everything.  - (work, corporate, also casual) tan, strappy wedges. The shape of my foot means that a strappy design that doesn't rub against my heel ended up being more comfy than something like ballet flats. I do own some flats but they're more grin n bear it kinda shoes.  I find that when matching shoes to outfits having the combination of tan/black/white/accent colour was awesome - not too many to choose from, but enough to mix it up.	episode_done:True
text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:When I started shopping for function, I started to enjoy fashion a lot more. Uniqlo was a big part of the beginning for me, I really like their airsim and heattech lines. How can my clothes work for me? I really took on a evolutionarily perspective lmao, like I need Shelter from Rain, Insulation in Cold, Sweat Wicking in Sun. It got me to pay attention to fabric choices more, which meant I was pickier, which meant I was buying more expensive items... so then I started to care about the quality of stitching and longevity of the piece.  I had IBS for a year and there were some clothes I could really NOT wear with that, so I had to learn to make adjustments too. I like high-rise bottoms, but I can't have an elastic cutting off my intestines all day, so I get something with a zipper instead.	episode_done:True

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:Using proxy to get stuff in from japan can find you some gems for great prices on yjp, mercari, rakuten etc  Also, it's good if you can find cheap basics that are of high quality, but from my experience those have been hard to come by. Just did a closet clear out yesterday and donated about 20 items from zara and other cheap brands that seemed to be good initially but quickly fell off after a few wears.  Lastly if there's an item I covet and it's either sold out or too expensive for me, I try ebay, Grailed, brand's subreddit, brands sf thread, yjp and usually would be able to locate most items for a discount within a month.	episode_done:True
