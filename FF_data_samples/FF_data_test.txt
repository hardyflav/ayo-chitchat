text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 18, 2021	labels:Say you have a charcoal grey pea coat. And you want to wear a polo shirt and slacks. What are some relatively safe color options for the polo shirt and slacks underneath the charcoal grey pea coat?   I have alot of grey pants, I'm afraid it will look weird w/ the grey pea coat (like a failed suit attempt)
text:No one will mistake a peacoat for a suit jacket. This is not something I think it's worth worrying about. Outerwear is functional, for keeping you warm/dry. You'll take it off when you get where you're going, too. Grey pants are fine with your coat.	labels:Grey pants are fine with a grey pea coat, really? Won't look to monotone?
text:It might but most people don't have the expectation that every guy has so many coats they can perfectly coordinate every outfit.   As long as the pants and peacoat aren't the **exact** same shade and texture, its not worth worrying about.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:Inspiration boards are great for identifying overall style types and outfit ideas, but everyone ultimately naturally gravitates towards and wears what they like to wear/feels comfortable in. This is usually where what we like visually isn't what we'd gravitate towards in our everyday style. Even with a closet full of the items in a look/style, most will still pick the items that they're comfortable in/like to wear. The way to work around this is to create the look with the type of items you like to wear/feel comfortable in. Is it all pants that you do not like to wear, or just jeans and trousers? If yes, explore other pant styles like leggings in structured, heavier weight fabrics, etc. which will give the more tailored, classic look you like, etc. Most style types and overall looks can be achieved with any items, it's just a matter of what the items are and how they are worn. How to do so is look closely at the elements that are creating the look. Then, work through how that can be achieved with items you like to wear.   If you want to share your Pinterest of inspiration, we may all be able to help with more specific ideas!
text:This is my very general style board (I literally just made it a couple days ago when I decided I wanted to pay more attention to the things I am wearing!)	labels:That's great! As you look at it, note any specific elements to the overall vibe of the looks you like, and see if/how you can capture it and create it with items you love to wear.	episode_done:True

My kid is 2 now, and it's taken me a while to accept that my body no later anger has a defined waistline and has the general shape of a squishy "brick," like you said. My weight went back to pre-pregnancy weight, but there's nothing you can do about a stretched out abdomen.  I've been transitioning to stretchy pants like BetaBrand and Old Navy's Stevie pants.

text:How many pairs of jeans and pairs of shoes should you own?	labels:14 pairs of shoes all-included doesn't seem like a ton for me if you live somewhere with weather, once you add in snow boots and rain boots and mud shoes and something for the pool/beach/showers and a pair of athletic shoes, you're creeping up on half way there.   I totally get the idea that we regularly wear only 60% of our shoes, though. I have a very formal pair of heels that I wear twice a year... but when I need them, I NEED them. Same with the Sorrel snow boots I've been lugging around forever. I don't need them on a day to day basis, but when I'm heading home for the holidays (you know, when that was a thing we could do...) and there's 4 feet of snow on the ground I'm damn happy to have them. Shoes are utilitarian is what I'm saying.
text:Yeah, it's not like all shoes are interchangeable (like white t-shirts or something). The 8% of people who own 4 or less pairs of shoes in total probably live in a climate without seasons. I can see someone in a beach town being able to get away with flip flops, sneakers, a pair of nice shoes and some light rain shoes, but for someone in the Northeast you'll probably need separate boots for fall *and* winter. And that's just bare necessities that don't take any interest in fashion into account.	labels:> The 8% of people who own 4 or less pairs of shoes in total probably live in a climate without seasons.

text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:I have an excellent tip for this! Get a large salad spinner and some gentle lingerie soap, put your really delicate stuff in with some warm water and detergent, spin a hand-full of times and let it soak for 5 mins, drain the water out and fill it with cold water, let it soak for 5, then spin, drain, refill, spin drain repeat till it comes out clear. Takes maybe 15 mins total and you don't destroy your clothing. You can even spin it again once the water is out to speed up drying if you let it air dry.
text:I handwash all the time--the salad spinner is a great idea!  Most of the clothes that I handwash call for cold water only though, so I never use any warm water.  As for detergent, I use Woolite.  Threads are more delicate when wet, so I avoid any rough wringing--I roll them up in towels to get most of the water out.  With knit sweaters etc, I let them dry laying down, put back in their shape, as they get very heavy with water and hanging could cause them to lose their shape.  Since I already have many pieces that I handwash, I just end up doing that with all of the pieces I care about/really want to last and it works great albeit a bit time consuming!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is something you've heard as fashion advice that isn't worth following?	labels:Probably the advice that anything I wear as a fat person has to be slimming or flattering. Yes I wear a lot of black, but just because it's easy not because it makes me look thinner. My size isn't a big secret or anything.   Also this is taking a really broad view but the fashion culture of planned obsolescence, declaring certain things "out" and other things "in," is super classist and unsustainable, so even though I enjoy reading about new trends I don't really care to follow them.
text:I agree with you, as I aged and had other responsibilities I realised I did not care to follow trends.  Though I enjoy following fashion and learning what is going on. It is interesting to look at it as an expression of culture, social and public mood, technology advances, and as an artistic expression.  It's also interesting to see how fashion percolate (the famous Devil Wears Prada scene on the jumper).  On that same note, as fashion changes, it is difficult not to follow it. Trends come into most clothes we buy no matter what we trie to do.	labels:I love that scene! It explains very simply how designers affect our clothing, even at the least expensive level.   Off topic but yesterday I went to Office Depot and waited forever for this person to vacate their parking spot. I thought "by all means, move at a glacial pace, you know how that thrills me"

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:Instead of tights, I usually wear leggings. I have a black pair and a navy blue pair, and imo they look like opaque tights (especially sice i always pair them with boots that cover the bottom of the leggings at the ankle, so you can't tell the leggings don't have feet). I find leggings way more comfortable and warmer than tights, plus more durable.

text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:I feel like in 2021 the trends move SO FAST you could wear anything and it would be in style. I like to read whowhatwear and in the same article stylists will contradict each other on what's in or out. Also there is probably a popular subniche where the item is trendy.  So if there's something I love but feel or looks a little off, I just save it in storage. In a year or so, my feelings on it could be renewed and it could be the next big thing.
text:Believe it or not it's actually less fast as it was a decade ago. Trends hang around FOREVER especially with Instagram, bloggers, etc. -- ripped jeans have literally been in style for over 12 years. 12!!! Same with moto jackets. It used to not be this way, where every year you were updating stuff to keep current. Now, it's like you can wear ripped jeans and a moto jacket and everyone thinks it's chic and cool. Because retailers want to sell, they don't experiment as much because the mainstream fashion consumer like most on IG, etc. are not as willing to move to trends as quickly as people were in the past. No complaints, but I find trends take forever to move now than compared to before.	labels:I think there are a bunch of small, fast trend fluctuations that happen so fast a lot of things never really go out. Like, there will be a year where ripped jeans are supposedly on their way out but then they are back a year later.	episode_done:True

text:Anyone like wearing traditional clothing from you culture?	labels:Dirndl for the win. These garments make all women look so much better. That extra ten (or 20) pounds actually looks bomb in a Dirndl. I'd love to wear Dirndl-like dresses every day (but alas, the real world...).
text:Yeah! But you get get annoyed when its costumized?	labels:It's odd in Munich during Oktoberfest. There are the local families, dressed up in 'real' Trachten, and then you see the American tourists in the cheap costumey ones from around the train station.   Real Trachten is very expensive, and there is a strong resale market for quality pieces. And then there are the 'designer' Trachten stores, which can be eye wateringly expensive. I always dreamed that when I had a 'real' job I would do more shopping at Stassny in Salzburg. Well, even with a 'real' job, the prices are a challenge.  But it's all such good quality, and very unique designs.

I do not like this fit or style. You are now engaging in ad hominem attacks instead of saying you disagree. We can disagree, it's ok.
text:>I explicitly stated this it was a personal, subjective opinion  No you didn't  What you said was "It's more a testament to how awful many of these clothing lines are"  "These clothing lines are awful" isn't a statement of subjective opinion, it's an objective declaration. If you had said instead "I'm not a personal fan of these, could someone explain to me what you like about them?" I would have engaged with good faith. Instead you made an incredibly cliche movie reference, called things objectively bad, and then said people disagreeing with you were "getting butthurt over appropriate criticism."

I received his Ralph Lauren sweatshirt today and when I held it up it looked HUGE! Was this a mistake, should I have gotten him mediums instead? Or will they fit him when he tries them on? I was hoping to get this figured out before Christmas so we don't have to go through the hassle of returning them for the right size:)
text:We can't know this without knowing his measurement. 6'2 and skinny could be all sorts of things.  I'm 6'2 and skinny and I normally wear a small and rarely a medium, but it depends mostly on his chest measurement.

text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:I have found people overwhelmingly wear clothes a size too small (like speaking to friends and whatnot). My sister, for example, buys the same size leggings as I do despite her hips and waist being 5-6 inches larger than mine, and then complains about them being see through. I have strong suspicions that this is the reason people find thongs horrifically uncomfortable as well.	labels:I think this is probably true for many people.  In my case though, I buy the right jean size (the jean is lightly fitted, not tight) but it has simply become a sensory thing.  I've realized I much prefer the loose, soft feeling of skirts or dresses over the fitted feeling of jeans.  Also with my body type, I carry a little bit of weight in my stomach, so I don't like the slightly squished feeling of sitting in jeans.
text:Okay so this question is a lil hard for me to ask but...  Does no one else just get, like, sweaty inner thighs? I want to love skirts but then it's 113 degrees out and I can feel rivulets of sweat just pourin' on down and I feel like it's possibly just me. :(	labels:As the other person said, anti-chafing shorts works well for that.  I'm quite a sweaty person and I find I sweat less in skirts/dresses since there's air flow (vs something fitted that heats up my body).  It does also help though that I live in Vancouver where the one day a year it reaches 35 celcius is news worthy (summers are a consistent 25c here).

text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:I realized this during black friday sales a few years ago.  I think all retailers do it.  Brands create special products for "X Retailer Only" with a discounted price which is really just a lower quality item but passed off to the customer as if it's a great deal.  I'm done with big sales.

text:FAQ: What are the different use cases of boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes, and loafers?	labels:Get yourself a nice pair of driving shoes and leave it in your trunk.   &#x200B;  In my experience, trying to drive with a chunky boot or a stiff shoe just sucks, especially if you drive a manual or a car with a tight toe box.
text:Driving with stiff shoes is actually way better imo. Like, my favorite shoes to drive in are, of all things, my squat shoes. Far less tiring.	labels:IIRC actual professional race car drivers wear stiff soled shoes.

A couple of extraneous pieces here (don't know how look 3 meets anything else) and I object to the suit 20 because I think the jacket and pants don't match cut-wise, but that seems personal.

text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I still have to wear at least a reasonable shirt for work, and a combination of zoom and terrible lighting in my apartment means I'm wearing more makeup than ever before to avoid looking like either a pale ghost or a zombified skull, depending on the angle of the sun.  But you know what I miss? SHOES. We don't wear shoes inside the house, so I rarely even put them on anymore. And there was a big part of being dressed down to my shoes and like... the stompy feeling of boots, and the clack of heels that made me feel like I was ready to take on the world -- definitely a contributor to good mental health.   I miss shoes. :(
text:Just a thought. If you wanna put a lamp in front of you. It helps me look better on my zoom call.	labels:Thanks, that's good advice. I have one, but wonder if I need to get a better lightbulb for it -- the problem is that I've got a window on one side of me, and very bright sunlight, so it's hard for the inside light to compete. It either washes me out completely or makes me look like a skull, depending on the angle of the sun. (I also should maybe upgrade my lousy webcam, but that means a new computer...)
text:I see. I have the same problem. I put up a complete light blocking curtain. Then use a lamp as a light source. Or at least get one of those cheap thin white fabric to make the sun less harsh. And do not get a better webcam. Less HD the better lol	labels:	episode_done:True

I learned hand Washing in university when our washing machine broke and the landlord didn't fix it for 3 months.

text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers.

For context I'm in New England and winter has been a little rough for a couple of weeks here (-18F, yikes), but with the coat on I feel nothing. So much warmer with it than with my North Face long parka.	episode_done:True

Plus, a black gorgeous corset makes me feel badass when I want to cosplay a badass character.	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:I feel like a more casual dress code actually usually better allows you to express a personal sense of style, versus a more formal dress code that can kind of turn into a uniform of things you can only wear at work and would never choose for yourself. There are some general guidelines I would follow though, at least until you've been there some time to see what everyone else really wears on a day to day basis and had time to prove yourself so you can get some slack for more interesting style choices.  Generally I would keep hemlines to at least the knees, keep necklines well above showing any cleavage (even when bending over), cover shoulders, and make sure that all my clothes were fully opaque. I'd also avoid crop tops, or even the appearance of a crop top with a layer underneath. That still gives you quite a lot of room to play with style with your fabrics, fits and embellishments I think, and you can adjust your style as needed with more time.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:got a Vintage LL Bean blue plaid shirt on ebay and it turns out the seller shot up the contrast hard on the picture- the wear on the collar and elbows is more muted in real life, but so is the contrast of the dark and light blues of the checks!

I'm tall and in decent shape, but want that Hobbit look.  My wife wants me to dress better, I dress like a lumberjack. Our compromise is somewhere between a Hobbit and and Oxford professor, with maybe some Peaky Blinders influences.  I know I should go for tweed and fall colors, bit I have so little fashion sense that I don't actually know *what* to look for. Like what are they called? Frocks? Waistcoats? Tweed longcoats?

text:femalefashionadvice does that in their WAYWT along with a write-up of how/why they picked the outfit.  I think that's why we tried doing it here, but didn't really stick for some reason. It's too bad because I really like the write-ups/analysis of different fits from the Fit Battle and it'd be great to see something similar in WAYWT.	labels:Would lead to 500 different variations on "I live in Texas and could never wear this because it's too hot"

text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:In my style exploration over the last year I realized that comfort is my number one priority, and I'm updating parts of my wardrobe to be consistent with that.  I wear skirts and dresses almost exclusively in the summer. Gotta have that ventilation!  For cooler weather, have you tried paper-bag trousers? They are usually cut to be especially roomy around the hips/lower belly, which is exactly where I needed the extra room. Tapered trousers would be similar I believe: think how dress pants looked in the 90s. Much roomier on top.  Me personally, in cooler weather I either wear leggings under dresses, stretchy jeggings/jeans, or paper-bag trousers.	episode_done:True

text:> Beyond fashion enthusiasts, are wide pants actually in?   I want you to sit back and think about the implications about that question for a minute.  To answer, though, in my experience yes, I am seeing people move away from very-slim fits. It is often more prevalent in women's wear, but I am seeing men do it too. Additionally I am seeing wider fits available at many retailers, including entry-level/fast fashion ones.	labels:COS is a good example of the entry level/fast fashion ones adopting it

Not sure if anyone is good at tracking down things like that in a way I haven't tried yet, but figured I'd ask.  I have a barbour heritage dept b commander from 2013 in XS that I've just outgrown.

text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:Some pretty amazing sales and discounts all around but I have, so far, managed to not give in to temptation. Partly because COVID is still an ongoing crisis and jobs security is, however remotely, an equally ongoing concern. Partly because I'm in the last year of my program and that was always going to be a time of instability and transition (try dissertating during a pandemic. I don't recommend it.).  But this damn $99 Staub 4qt cocotte sale may break me.  (I know kitchenware isn't fashion but I'll fight it out for the sake of Staub, Le Creuset, etc.)
text:I feel ya. Great sales but in the end I just picked up a pair of sweatpants cause my casual wool pants got some massive holes in the thighs. Come to think of it I've been wearing them the most at home and going on lunch break walks since Covid started. Which is crazy.  Yeah I don't envy anyone doing a dissertation during Covid. Especially if there data collection wasn't easy or involved direct contact. Heard some right bad things in the UK about lack of support for some grad students.  Hope you're doing OK with the job hunt, looking outside academia is probably the best right now.	labels:I have been eyeing, of all things, Abercrombie & Fitch for flannels--they look pretty decent tbh!   Fortunately most of my fieldwork was complete pre-COVID, but access to materials via libraries and other institutions has been a mess pretty much.  Non-academic jobs are beginning to be posted again, which is encouraging, but word is a lot of institutions are still in a holding pattern due to new COVID waves, potential lockdowns, etc. Hate the uncertainty really.	episode_done:True

Complex alterations like adjusting shoulder width on jackets may be best left to professionals at first, but adjusting skirt and sleeve and pants length or width is extremely easy and easy to reverse if you do it without cutting up the garment.	episode_done:True

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:I spent $1100 on a Canada Goose parka after going back and forth for two years on whether it would be worth the money. Finally I said fuck it and got it for myself as a birthday present. They're not exactly what I would consider "fashion" though the logo patch is recognizable and somewhat stylish in some cities. I also really thought it was just overhyped. But let me tell you: that parka is worth every single penny. As someone who is ALWAYS cold, I love my parka so much. It's not sleek and it's heavy but I've been to Chicago, Vienna, and and Boston in the absolute worst of winter and blizzards and have never been cold once even if I just wear a flimsy not-warm but super cute outfit underneath it. It's the only expensive clothing item I've bought that has actually lived up to its price.	episode_done:True

The vast, vast, vast majority of them don't drive with heels on. How do they do it? they keep another pair of shoes in the trunk.

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:1. I really like ankle boots that skim my ankles and don't go taller. I think they go great with pants and tights/skirt/dress combo. 2. When I'm forced to wear black tights because of lack of color choice, I wear ones with a fishnet pattern- loose or tight pattern depending on how much I'm willing to let my legs be exposed to the cold that day.  3. If I'm doing a bare leg with ankle boots, I wear ankle socks with lace or scalloped edges that peek out over the boots.  4. No suggestions from me, sorry! I've never worn any 5. I wear 0-2 inch heels max with dresses ( I can't actually walk well in higher heels). It works for me, I'm comfortable most of the day and think i still look fairly put together all the time.	episode_done:True

text:What do you get tailored?	labels:I love the idea of tailoring in theory, but in practice my body changes shape a lot. In the past I've struggles with an eating disorder, and had periods of fairly rapid weight loss and gain. These days I've been doing better with that, but I've also finally come out as non-binary. Some days I wear a chest binder and some days I don't. If I tailored things, I'd need a whole lot more clothing lol.   I expect there are people out there whose bodies change a lot even without these factors being involved. If anyone has tips for improving fit without actually stitching anything, or just wants to comiserate about the difficulties of an evolving body (whatever the source of those body changes), I'm here for it.
text:I do my own tailoring and I often just do darts or take in side seams and leave the original seam in place so I can easily remove the tailored seam if I gain weight or want it to fit differently.

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom is completely opposite to many of the posters.  My mom takes dressing appropriately for a situation as borderline virtuous. She always notices if someone completely nails or misses for a particular event, venue, etc.  This isn't in a catty way, as she doesn't think it makes a person good or bad, but rather is a skill that some people have and others don't.  Because of her commentary and feedback, I always know how to dress for a given situation.  I also break her "rules" and it drives her nuts, but she raised me to be independent so whatever.    For example, if we are at a wedding and the someone's speech is amazing she will commend them.  If the mother-of-the-bride has a perfectly appropriate but non-frumpy dress she also will be like "well done" (in her head).  She "gets" fashion and admires when other people do.  It's a skill and one she thinks is important.  Her best friend has zero interest in fashion and it makes my mom roll her eyes, but she values so many other aspects she doesn't care.	episode_done:True

Shorts with tights are actually the only way I'll wear tights, but doesn't come close to the ridiculousness of a short sleeved romper with a turtleneck and leggings underneath it.  I've got a bell sleeved shirt that comes out during transitional seasons that I actually have to tuck up into itself if I want to do anything practical (like use the bathroom) and the warmer months brings out all the lightweight dusters that I have to watch for snags.  Spiral earrings are the only thing I've actually temporarily retired, and only because getting my masks hopelessly tangled in them felt dangerous.	episode_done:True

text:What clothing items have you reverted back to since WFH/quarantine?	labels:I've really been embracing dressing more youthful. I'm in my early/mid 20s, and now that I've worked a couple years at the same place, I'm wearing more what I want than boring professional. I also started caring about what I wear and planning my outfits. Velvet shoes, corduroy overalls, rainbow prints, sequins, bold colors. Who cares? I've been called out for dressing "fancy" before, but I've stopped giving a shit in correlation with my confidence in my abilities. I'm a teacher...if anything, I'm showing the students it's okay to be yourself and take risks.
text:Same here. I work as a high school teacher and decided to dress the way I want rather than the way I should, as long as it stays appropriate, even if I'll be teaching in jeans, sneakers and a metal band t-shirt. I do pay attention to the state of my clothes, the fit and what kind of print there will be on the t-shirt though. That allows me to stand out from the students.

I bought a pair of amazing green boyfriend jeans from lucky brand in 2017. They had wonderfully deep pockets and fit me perfectly. my favorite pair. So comfy and flattering and went with everything. They were ruined a few months ago in a stain remover accident, and I have been searching for them online ever since.

Do you ever dip into the men's section?	labels:Usually for things like PJ pants, solely because they have pockets, which women's do not (in my experience).

Which colour of the iron rangers is the most versatile? I usually wear darker outfits (selvedge denim and darker chinos), so im thinking about getting the dark brown ones (amber harness).
text:It's just personal preference. If you wear denim, any color works. Copper Rough and Tough and Amber Harness are probably the two most popular IRs. Oxblood are being discontinued so if you like them, grab a pair.  Next year Ebony Harness is coming back and Slate Muleskinner is  going to be introduced.	labels:Thanks for the reply!	episode_done:True

( Yes , I've been trying out men's boots and they never have my size since the lowest is EU 39, women boots are usually sizes lower ). It's usually on the leg that it gets large and it's uncomfortable, since woman tend to have smaller legs the model are smaller in the legs ( I hope I'm right).  I'm not sure if there are any identical boots I can buy in the woman section that will look good and not be feminine.  Am I being stupid haha?
text:Women's shoes usually run B width which is 2 sizes smaller than standard men's (D). If they fit, you can wear them.

text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:Corridor: its advanced boring.  I don't hate it or anything but theres nothing interesting (maybe one or two things, like the patchwork jacket from a season or two ago) enough to justify it.  Same goes for me for Taylor Stitch.
text:i still have love for Taylor Stitch even if I don't really wear their stuff anymore. they were great for me as the "next step" in dressing well after J. Crew. and IMO they do make a quality garment that is "built to last", as their motto goes. great customer service too.  but i can only get so excited after year over year of variations on a solid indigo shirt. i think they are a great brand for people who are going for that casual but still a bit nice workwear look, but as my interests started skewing more prep and more brighter colors/patterns, i've drifted away from the brand.	labels:	episode_done:True

I feel you here in many ways, except a bit of the opposite with my A cup boobs. Some days I can rock the no bra look and feel like a million bucks, and some days I look in the mirror and think "who is that little boy trying to wear grown up clothes?"

text:Google Launches Price Insights for Online Shopping.

Rolling out next Thursday in the US and "select countries" whatever those are, since no one has given a list I could find.  They're just tacking this on top Google Shopping and some Google.com search result pages. Which isn't going to be particularly helpful for certain fashion and clothing brands in my experience. Most the time if you search for generic keywords for clothing you get faff from AliExpress or some third party Chinese droppshipper selling on Amazon who invested in good SEO.

Personally I  believe in the philosophy of age appropriateness because that means you care what the group (society) thinks and that reflects that you are not a narcissist or stunted person.

This was expected, since I posted the orange creamsicle album here (and a couple of other, less interesting places).  The funny thing is, it only attributes about \~350 of those views to reddit / old reddit. About 1.1k are apparently "direct," IE they typed my blog name into their address bar. And specifically the creamsicle article's name. Yeah, right.  I don't know how much of that error is based on noscript / privacybadger, but I don't think most people have those installed, so I'm really kind of curious as to why Google is so stupid.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 12, 2020	labels:Hi, I'm trying to get some better jeans for my wardrobe, I'm looking for some good midrange jeans in the $60-120 USD price range. I've heard that Levi's are really good for their price (in America at least, from what I know they're more expensive outside of the U.S.) but I don't really like the way that they fit loosely around the butt because I just prefer the way it looks when jeans have more of a snug fit around the butt. I know there are a lot of different styles of Levi's though so if you know of a style that fits differently like that, I'd be happy to check them out! Also I bought a pair of Uniqlo jeans and I am actually pretty happy with the quality, but I'd rather support more environmentally-friendly companies if I can.

text:Is it disgusting to not wear socks with shoes?	labels:Eh people wear loafers, flip flops and slip ons without socks all the time. As long as you don't wear them all the time, they'll air out and be fine.
text:There are definitely certain shoes (boat shoes?) that are made to be worn without socks, or at least made such that it's possible.  That said I would wear socks with Vans for sure.	labels:Which is why you can generally only wear boat shoes for a season before they need to be tossed.

About $1500 gone.
text:This is why I don't really let my husband run the laundry too often. He's an amazing human, I love him, and there is so much he is good at; but laundry ain't it. He puts everything all in the same load, all on Hot water, and all in the dryer for an hour. If I left him to do it with no supervision, everything would be ruined.	labels:Yes, my husband too!!!!

I do not think they will do that.  I would look more to Stussy as a model as to how VF could fully monetize Supreme while still keeping somewhat desirable and interesting.  I mean go ahead and hate VF but people still love North Face/Timberland/Vans. People still wear that stuff and it's not necessarily looked down on. I think they'll do fine with Supreme in that portfolio.
text:Vans shoes aren't what they used to be though.	labels:We can talk quality and I'd agree... but people still like and wear Vans.  Also, it's interesting two of Supreme's biggest collaborators (North Face and Vans) are in the VF family.

text:What are novelty leather keyrings/keychains for? How do you use them?	labels:Mostly, they're a money grab - cheap enough that people will buy them for their cute or aesthetic factors without the qualms that might go into dropping money on a purse or coat.    That being said, I have a pretty hefty key chain, so I keep quite a few keychains on it (all of them are sentimental or associate with specific friends/family)  and I like using sturdier ones for distinguishing my luggage.	episode_done:True

text:How do you feel about vegan/faux leather?	labels:I've gotten two pairs of vegan leather pants from Aritzia and they're just kind of disappointing. They look so glamorous on the models but I feel sort of squeaky and uncomfortable with them. I think buying secondhand leather items is better in terms of quality and environmental impact than faux leather.
text:If you've already committed to the faux leather pants, try to eliminate the squeak with a dab of mink/neatsfeet oil on a cloth. Then apply to the areas that are the loudest lol. If you want to stay away from animal products, try a small amount of coconut oil :)	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Not so much the process but the opportunity to actually work there: How old are you and how did you originally get into that line of work?	labels:I'm in my mid-20's. Have been working in menswear for the entirety of my working years, so almost a decade in the business now.   While its not exciting -- I started at Brooks Brothers. This was years ago, when the brand stood for something. I got to work along some hardcore industry vets who took me under their wing.   Then over the years I have gotten to work at just about every "type" of menswear shop. Big box retailers, flashy online-only outfits, bottom of the barrel makers, the extreme top of the top family owned shops.   I've been able to do everything within the business, too. I've sold, designed collections, marketed, ran operations, did the buying, taken out the trash, taped up and shipped orders. The whole thing.	episode_done:True

And **Carve Designs** also has some nice apparel, in addition to their swimwear.
text:thank you <3	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:I agree with the Pinterest recommendations but also! Thrifting is a great way to expand your wardrobe fast and on a budget. You can always go and try on a huge variety of different styles at once and see what you like on your body and what combos look good. I usually prefer having an idea of what styles or items I'm looking to add to my wardrobe (e.g. denim jacket, crop top) before I go out. There's definitely a bit of a technique when it comes to thrifting though, so if you're just starting out, you could check out some of the more curated (but more expensive) thrift stores in your area! I got hooked on thrifting after I started following bestdressed on YouTube, whose style I am obsessed with :)	episode_done:True
text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:Yeah, I think age correlates heavily here. It's not just that with time, you see so many styles come and go, but you have more life experience generally, and I've found that I have more responsibilities and things to care about every year. Trends come and go so quickly that I have less and less energy to care if my wardrobe is keeping up.  I'm "only" 31, so maybe I'm just a curmudgeon lol.	episode_done:True

I managed to snag a backup pair because I would have been so sad if I ever had the give them up.	episode_done:True

text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:Here's a different point of view... I'd take a serious look at two categories beyond the bespoke / haute couture options.  First, my preference is for the Italian tailoring houses. Kiton, Zegna, Loro Piana, and Etro Milano etc.  First, they are more male / menswear oriented. And their materials and tailoring are exceptional and can be altered or mtm if needed. I have a Loro Piana Icer in cashmere that's beyond mere mortals. Of course, $4,000 won't get you very far - - but the quality is a level beyond the French design houses.   Second, depending on his design taste (and if I was younger) I'd consider the younger brands like CP Co, Rick Owens, Acne Studios, etc to see if they are more in tune with my desired look.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 13, 2021	labels:Does anyone use Gatsby hair wax ? Is it harmful if I apply it only once or twice a week ?
text:I actually tried this stuff once and while it does hold well and smells nice, its IMPOSSIBLE to get out of your hair unless you use shampoo. So unless you plan on shampooing after every use then find something else. Personally I've dropped all gel/spray/wax etc. products and stopped shampooing entirely and my hair feels significantly healthier.	labels:I don't think cutting out shampoo entirely is a good idea, your hair still does get grimy over time.
text:it really depends on your hair type, my hair is THICK and absorbs oils like crazy. After the adjustment period my scalp stopped over producing oils and my hair balanced itself out and hasn't felt grimy or smelled bad at all, I still do the occasional mask or condition, but shampoo did nothing positive for my hair except dry it out. but again ymmv, depends on your hair type.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else always hesitate to buy what they truly love because they don't have a social life?	labels:Yes, because I like to enjoy the things that I have, and if I don't enjoy the situation in which it would be appropriate for me to enjoy the thing, then I'm not going to actually enjoy the thing.   I mean, sure, I could wear the fabulous cocktail dress to the grocery store, but I'm not actually going to have all that much fun wearing it to the grocery store. I have learned during the pandemic that I do not actually enjoy getting dressed up for a night at home, because when I get dressed up for a night out, I do not have to worry about my cats ripping the lace on my fabulous dress, or shedding on it, or whatnot.   However, if I have nowhere I would like to wear it *now* but I can see myself enjoying wearing it when it is safe and prudent for me to leave the house to do things I like... I get the thing.   Your mileage may vary.	episode_done:True
text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom grew up a tom-boy naturally beautiful so-cal model with the long blonde hair. She didn't do anything to her hair or wear makeup. So...I don't know how to do anything. I've tried following youtube videos, but there is so much ground to cover and it's hard to find someone teaching fundamentals. Like I don't really know how to curl my hair, or style it anyway beyond brushing it and putting it up in a pony tail. I don't know that I needed fashion advice as much as just personal grooming advice and help with basic things. I would love to take a hair styling class/makeup class but I'm not sure where I could find something like that short of beauty school.	episode_done:True

text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:IMO- everyone should have a down jacket. They are incredible in the cold. So much better than any of the synthetic weather proof options.

I'm far from vegan but some down harvesting is extremely cruel, and I'd rather not support those practices.	labels:Patagonia does a lot of recycling with their down jackets, I have the silent down jacket from them and it is 100% recycled duck and goose down from older jackets.	episode_done:True
text:what are your fashion flaws?	labels:Constantly getting the stain of food dripping right onto my boob and then ending up with permanent boob grease stain. this is how most of my white shirts die.
text:To get food grease out of shirts: mix baking soda, a small amount of water and a few squeezes of dawn dish soap. Mix to make a paste. Put paste on stain. Let sit for an hour. Wash normally. Strain gone. works for set in stains too.  Sincerely,  Someone else who constantly gets food stains on her boobs.	labels:Thanks for this tip!  I am definitely gonna try this.  I've been putting cornstarch on the stain and then using Spray 'n Wash, but that only works like 20% of the time.  Oil stains are also how most of my clothing dies (though usually from oil splatter while cooking).

text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:I moved from a northern state to DC and still had to adjust my cold weather attire! My experience with DC winters has been wet (often heavy rain, and damp cold when it snows) so in addition to warm layers, you may want to also look for a long rainproof shell to go over your coat.

text:Why I’ve tracked every single piece of clothing I’ve worn for three years	labels:i honestly tried something similar like this.. keeping track of how often I wore what.. as a way to see where I should spend less and more on.  in the end it never worked as I guess, I psychologically pushed myself to wear things more equally when I looked at my charts.  I'd see something on my chart that I didnt wear so much, and start wearing it to 'balance' it out.
text:Author here. I think this is a really interesting point. I hadn't though of it, but I ended up taking this "outside observer" perspective. I try divest whatever I divest as sustainably as possible. Some things I sell through second hand channels, some I donate to be sold or to charity, some I keep using as sportswear or garden work clothes, or rugs, and some I put in fabric recycling that fashion stores are mandated to offer. This, what I believe to be a good way to divest, has helped me get rid of clothes I don't wear rather than trying to increase their use.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Looking for a Shear Thing (Shearling Jackets)	labels:This time last year I was on the Arizona Trail. I was heading to town to resupply and I got a hitch from a Gila County cattleman in an old F-150. Handsom young guy, quiet but kind as can be. He was wearing old 501s and a shearling bomber over a tshirt that had once been white. His sandy hair matched the undyed wool and the leather matched his dusty boots. It was the most natural, most fitting, least pretentious use of a shearling jacket outside of being in the ball turret on a Flying Fortress. And *even he* just barely pulled it off. Because shearling is the peacock-feathers of Americana.

text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:You're kinda making a mountain out of a molehill here. It's not hard to wear colors. Relax about it. It's not a disaster if things clash slightly. You'll be fine. There are no fashion police.   My usual style is I get either brightly colored top or a bright bottom (or a bright dress). The other is relatively neutral to avoid clashing or being overwhelming. This is not a hard and fast rule. There are times when it's fine to break it. It's just a guideline for when I'm in a hurry.  Match saturation and brightness. Burgundy and plum are fine together because both are relatively saturated and dark. Pale pink and lavender work together. Burgundy and lavender are harder because they don't match in saturation and brightness. They aren't impossible to put together and look good but it's a bit harder.  You will not look good in some colors. This is 100% fine. Try things on. Figure out what makes you look awful. You can do this. It doesn't need any special knowledge.
text:In total agreement with this. I kept trying to find my season/palette/whatever using a bunch of systems and always got frustrated. But then I found friskygatos on IG and she was just like... "Hold up colors next to each other and if you like them together, wear it." And her lizard brain concept was super freeing.  Today I wore an all pale pink outfit and got tons of compliments and felt fabulous. I don't even know/care if it was my most flattering color, but just the fact that I looked different than the sea of neutral outfits out there made me happy!	labels:> "Hold up colors next to each other and if you like them together, wear it."  That is literally how I choose outfits and I've been told I look well-put together.	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:My husband sews and has hand-stitched several garments that he wears nearly daily. They are holding up fine, some of them after years. He doesn't do anything special to care for them, he throws them in the washer and dries them in the drier on warm. His interest is mainly in historical recreation, and as he points out, laundering clothes used to consist of beating the fuck out of them with a paddle. Our modern washers are *way* more gentle.

It sounds pretty run of the mill but I havent found one that actually looks like what I want. They're all either satiny, or they have this transparent lining layer on them or they dont have sleeves.

I usually go away a lot as well (not happening any time soon, though!) and am wondering what boots/shoes you would recommend to go with it?  I'm thinking brown brogues for more formal occasions but looking for a pair of durable boots that will allow me to stay on my feet all day but won't lose me fashion points because they look like something I should be wearing on the hills.

The time period covered in this album is also a near-exact overlap with the liberalization (along broadly "American" capitalist lines) of India's domestic markets, as well as the West's own hamfisted attempts, after the fall of the Berlin Wall as well as the USSR, at a kind of liberal multiculturalism (of the "United Colors of Benetton" variety).

Especially when you're on a campus and moving from building to building. Also scarves are great for making sure my face and nose don't freeze. Gloves are a must for me, I can't leave the house without them in the winter. Unfortunately I've lost a few gloves here and there so i have a few singles. Hats feel more decorative. I've had times when my ears got so cold with the wind that they hurt so a coat with a hood is great. I also second the comment saying the jacket should be long. I got most of my stuff at old navy on sale but I've also been gifted many scarf sets. Another great place to get coats that aren't super duper expensive is a place like Ross, burlington, Marshall's, etc.	episode_done:True

text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:I've always loved the quote of "fragrance is meant to be discovered, not announced", because it kinda reflects where I stand on fragrance *amount.* I'm always curious what people are wearing, but if it's overpowering, or the fragrance strongly lingers in the room long after someone has left it (ghost perfume!), it turns me off from the rest of the outfit and I tend to avoid the person. I'm not a fan of strong/intense smells.  I tend to associate flowery fragrances with twee and more dainty fashion choices, and more "masculine" (for lack of a better word) fragrances with alt, androgynous, and other such styles, so I tend to expect x fragrances if someone is wearing x outfit. But even if someone doesn't wear what I'm expecting, it doesn't really take away from the outfit too much.  I haven't worn fragrance in ages because my favourites were discontinued (DKNY Be Delicious and Katy Perry Meow). But based on my style nowadays (more masculine, lots of darker neutrals, odd silhouettes), I would probably choose something less sweet just to complement my outfits a bit more.
text:+1 I'm not super sensitive to scents but I think it should only be smelled inside of someone's personal bubble. Like a hug, or if we're sidling up to the bar together, or leaning in to talk in a loud place. It's obnoxious to wear it strong enough that others can smell it outside of a few feet.  I don't really match fragrances to outfits. It's just a little extra finishing touch or polished appearance	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What is something you've heard as fashion advice that isn't worth following?	labels:1. no socks and sandals - they've become cool and high fashion now, but even while not in a catwalk you can still rock them tastefully 2. no navy blue and black - bs, my mom rocks this color combo a lot and looks great, when you know how to pair them using different textures and harmonizing the outfit you can look great  3. Double denim - can look cool if you know what you're doing.

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I am a very ordinary person so take this with a grain of salt. What I would do is a commitment to wear sth "new" every day. It's just not how you put it on and look at the mirror, but it also has to do with how you feel in it all day long.   Sometimes it's gonna work, sometimes it won't but you can have fun with your wardrobe everyday and hopefully you will find what goes well with what you have inside that huge wardrobe.

FOR NO FUCKING REASON. Except to torture us I guess (and also probably to save money on material costs, but whatever).
text:YES! Remember the comfort of the rare chair that didn't have a cutout? Being able to sit without worry?	labels:For real, the reason I was so excited when high waisted jeans came into style around my senior year was because I didn't have to worry about my underwear riding up higher than my pants ever again. But then of course all my male friends made it a point to tell me and my female friends how much they hated our "mom jeans," so I guess you never really can win in highschool.

Most skirts nowadays are either miniskirts (that are basically flashing your panties) or thin, cheap imitations of pleated skirts. I've been looking at school uniform skirts , but they're also very expensive.   Blouses with a collar and bow. If anyone is curious by what I mean, there are Josephine (brand) blouses that look super cute. They're not all cute but some of her designs are my favorite.  I have a ton of things I want to try honestly. Even food purses. Like Rommy de Bommy's art bags. So amazing but they're crazy expensive.	episode_done:True

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:I work at a TJ Maxx/HomeGoods combo store. We absolutely do not know what we are going to receive until we actually open the packages that come off of the trucks. At my store, we got like 10+ pairs of blue crocs, but literally only two pairs of white crocs.  And unlike most retail stores, we have buyers choosing which items to purchase every two weeks instead of monthly/quarterly. With that in mind, the best thing you can do is check in as much as possible. I'd say for every gem, we have about 200 decent items. Go during a weekday as soon as we open for the best chances as weekends are generally busy.   Also I agree about the Runway stores, I saw a Gucci purse like two years ago at a TJ Maxx with a Runway section in Scottsdale, AZ. (Also to my fellow Arizonans, the locations on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd and Miller Rd have the best selection, in my opinion).

Also ngl, I legit dig the style - he's got perfect "grumpy but loveable old grandpa" energy.  And he's one of the few who can even pull the look off well.	labels:The fact that this fit is the one being talked about is ridiculous. He doesn't pull the look off well. What the hell kind of fashion sub is this? Joe was wearing a killer suit we could be talking about. Barack had on a really nice overcoat I would love to hear more about. Every single woman on that stage absolutely killed it. But people are just fawning over Bernie and his Ross dress for less outfit. Is it really good "men's fashion advice" to suggest wildly underdressing for important occasions? Or are people legit trying to gaslight me into thinking this outfit is good? I get this sub skews young and reddit loves Bernie, but this has a pretty psychotic "the emperor has no clothes" vibe to it. It's a bad outfit. It doesn't fit him well. The colors are bad. It's wrong for the occasion.

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:Shoes - Russel and Bromley. They are incredibly good quality and don't need breaking in.  Bags - Picard. It's a small German brand, and the quality is top notch. Their bags have lasted me 7 years, and still look good with only minimal wear and tear. One of the bags I have, the leather is incredibly soft. I've never seen something like that in a handbag.   Cashmere - lots of great recos above. For a cheaper price point & Other Stories has good cashmere pullovers. I got one from them maybe 5-6 years ago and it looks brand new, no piling.   Socks - Icebreaker merino. They come with a lifetime warranty, and they exchange worn out socks no questions asked. I also like their underwear. It's nothing exciting but by some miracle it doesn't show panty lines	episode_done:True

text:What are your tips for being stylish when your weight fluctuates like crazy?	labels:So many great suggestions! This is all really helpful.  No one seems to have mentioned jersey dresses (stretchy, forgiving, comfortable, beltable) or Old Navy. I'm not sure if it's just been my particular experience at clothing swaps, but I feel like I've had several "sisterhood of the traveling dress" experiences with Old Navy. That seem to make a lot of great stretchy dresses and other clothes that can be worn at a variety of sizes. For example, I was happy to find that my cousin (who's multiple sizes larger than I am) looked incredible in a bunch of my Old Navy ts that I originally picked up for $5 each. I wore those heavily for *years* before passing those along to her and I think only one got damaged in that time. Worth a try as a place to find some affordable basics.  ETA: I realize I'm suggesting a fast fashion option here and I just want to say, you can easily pick up stuff from this brand secondhand!	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite outfits to wear with white booties?	labels:White boots go well with patterned dresses! Modcloth has a few short 60s style patterned dresses, but a dress from any retailer could work. Because white is neutral, it could technically go with anything, but a pattern with white in it would help the boots stand out.   But yeah, I don't think anybody listens to the no white pants/shoes/whatever after Labor Day any more, lol.	episode_done:True

text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:No pressure..it's been liberating. In the beginning, it seemed like I was depriving or restricting myself but then on a day-to-day basis, life is soooo much easier. Everything looks good on you, no second-guessing outfits, no decision fatigue.   This is obviously not for someone who loves fashion and for whom dressing up is a creative outlet. But I'm loving it so far...and I literally just started.   Do what works for you and don't overthink it!   It's just clothes. Even if your whole wardrobe is classic and timeless, someday a whole jar of sauce could fall on your clothes and render them unwearable, your clothes could tear or you could gain or lose weight...you get the drift..  .... Life is ephemeral..go with the flow!	episode_done:True
text:Is Chanel going to be better off without Karl?	labels:I feel like Karl Lagerfeld's legacy & tenure really glossed over his last decade or so of design. Sure there were some good shows in the 2010s, but a lot of it was just....   Virginie Viard is always going to come up short because she's Lagerfeld-esque and has the misfortune of coming directly after Lagerfeld. Lagerfeld was good at making his name and Chanel synonymous so that if you see a tweed jacket - you immediately think of both. As Viard tries to draw upon Chanel classics & house standards, it's seen as copying Lagerfeld (and failing) rather than her being referential. She hasn't really presented her point of view, separate from Chanel or Lagerfeld, either, so it's really hard to pick up on the specific aspects of her designs that are *hers.*

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:I used to live near a TJ Maxx so I saw when the trucks would come in, usually every Wednesday morning. Sometimes on Thursdays, too, before the major sales holidays. On Tuesdays there would be bigger discounts and by Wednesday night the new stuff would be stocked. I went in pretty much every Tuesday and Wednesday to browse and get a feel for what they were getting in, but I would usually only actually purchase stuff maybe once a month since I'm a spendthrift. I got to know some of the gals that worked there and a few of them would put stuff aside for me and some of the other regular shoppers that they thought we'd like - so sweet and they really did not have to do that.	episode_done:True

text:All-time favorite cold weather pieces?	labels:I love Falke wool tights for winter, and I have pairs that have lasted me ten years. For fun tights and socks, Hansel from Basel are solid quality.  Seconding the love for La Canadienne and Blondo boots, and adding Wanderlust and Martino Canada to the list.   I have Reynaud Phenomenon, so my hands and feet are always cold. Merino or silk glove liners and sock liners make all the difference. If you buy conductive thread, you can make any glove layer touchscreen compatible with just a little darning.

text:Recreating Pinterest outfits.	labels:I started using a random number generator to pick items out of my closet and then building an outfit around it.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:I just bought two size of the Wolverine 1000 Miles (size 6 and 6.5) and I'm wondering which I should keep.  The 6.5 felt comfortable right out of the box, with a slight slip in the heel when I take a step. Everything felt roomy and not cramped.  The 6, however, is tight on the top of my feet, where the vamp and the tongue are stitched together. At the heel, it's also tight where the stitching wraps on the sides - almost feels like it's pinching the sides of my heel - and I was relieved when taking them off.  My question is, how much stretch should I expect from these boots? Will the size 6 stretch out to fit better and less painful, or is it problematic that the pain points are where the stitching is? Will the size 6.5 stretch out to be too big?  I tried them on with both thick wool socks and thinner crew socks. The size 6 boot felt better with thinner socks, but it was still a bit uncomfortable. The size 6.5 felt good in both.  I'm really excited to own my first pair, so any advice is appreciated! Thanks in advanced!
text:I would stick with the 6.5 boots can stretch some but in my experience if the vamp and heel are too tight its prolly to small overall	labels:Yea, that was my worry. Sounds like I'll be sticking with the 6.5. Thank you for the input!	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 08	labels:Looking for a semi lightweight raincoat to go over a suede valstarino jacket. Was looking at other valstar options but not too sure. Would like something more on the formal/tailored side.  Budget of up to 600usd, but lower wouldn't hurt.	episode_done:True
text:What are you hate wearing?	labels:High waisted bottoms. I bought SO many high waisted sweatpants, jeans, and pants because they make my short legs look long. I've spent so much money on them and have bought cropped jackets, shirts, tube tops, etc, to match.  However I don't like wearing them anymore because they squeeze my fucking organs. I literally get stomach pain/cramps and am miserable.  But I continue wearing them when I have to go somewhere that I know I'll be at for a short amount of time (i.e. grocery store). I wear them out of guilt and don't want to think I threw my money away.
text:I too shared this sentiment for many years. In the past year, I've switched to high waisted pants with front pleats (some subtle, some exaggerated), so my pouch and organs beneath it can breath when I move.   If you ever want to give high waisted pants another go, that might be the way to do it.	labels:I bought a pair of pleated, 13" rise, wide leg chinos off Poshmark (a discontinued Uniqlo cut), and love them so much I've bought them in the other three colors they were made in.   My first super high rise/flair pants were some super discounted Madewell jeans I snagged for $28 after mall employee/sale/sale discount/student discount. I loved them pre Covid, when I exercised 4 times a week and had a flat stomach. The Uniqlo pants are what I live in now, even though the Madewell jeans and the Uniqlo pants are both size 6, and Madewell (historically) runs large and Uniqlo (historically) runs small.	episode_done:True

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

text:Best and Worst Purchases of 2020?	labels:Best: I snagged an olive Mack style rain coat off of poshmark from Club Monaco and I really dig how it goes with literally everything I wear consistently. I wear suits to work and it looks unique but subtle with them. Got a great deal too.   Worst: the 4 different attempts to buy a Patagonia Better Sweater Vest from grailed/ebay.

text:My 2020 Clothing Challenge	labels:I think the Anthropologie dress is a hit the Black Loro Piano Scarf is a miss. I would also say those boots are a miss. The dvf dress is okay but just looks a bit loud for your style. The satin pants are fantastic. Linen shirt is a miss.
text:I'd love some more insight! I know the black scarf and linen shirts are basic but also figured they're classics. My problem with the DVF dress isn't so much that it's loud but that it just doesn't fit well and looks like I'm borrowing from someone. Would also be curious to hear why you don't like the black boots!	labels:I think the boots are a bit overly long, I don't think they suit. I think calf length would be much more flattering. Yeah I just thought the linen shirt was too boring and the black scarf was just average. I would say the satin pants are the biggest hit, they look very flattering.	episode_done:True
text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:Freaking Doc Martens. I saved up for months to buy a pair less than a year ago, they're already worn out.

Also shirts with the strings attached to them to tie around your back, but I never tied them I just let them hang loose.

text:My makeup mostly changes depending on the warmth of my hair color. Warm colors highlight the pink tones in my skin, yadda yadda. I did change up my daily MLBB type colors when I switched from purple hair to blue--something about the pinker tones I used to use made me feel really clowny.

It shifted my perspective as I thought about how I present myself and see other presentations or representations in media, clothing, etc. I didn't realize how my actions were often if not always geared towards presenting some image or view of myself. I can't say that they don't anymore, but I feel like having some awareness of it and making conscious decisions in light of it takes the control back.   But then again, maybe not!	episode_done:True
text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:I've spent so much of quarantine trying to find my personal style! Here's what worked for me:  I got all the clothes I regularly, reliably wear, and I laid them out on my bed. Then, I wrote down some observations about them. The materials, the colors, the styles, the patterns...anything that seemed noteworthy. I realized I had three different color palettes going on, so I grouped them accordingly. After assessing everything, I tried to come up with a few adjectives to describe what I was looking at in front of me, and those adjectives became how I describe my personal style. In other words, rather than gravitating toward an aesthetic and trying to make my wardrobe fit into it, I just looked and described what my style, in practice, as it already exists, is.   And ever since I loosely nailed it down, now I make sure that any new clothes I purchase relatively fit those descriptors too. So everything I own is pretty stylistically compatible. :)	episode_done:True

text:Which are you wearing? The tread is specially designed for wet surfaces.  If you own an actual boat shoe and not a fast fashion version you'll see a very intricate sole with ridges and curves to allow lots of traction on wet surfaces.  Edit: I will say crocs are an all time staple of regular sailors now.	labels:Sperry top siders. I know what grooves you're talking about, but in my experience they're pretty smooth and not nearly as good traction when wet as other shoes. Also, crocs would make great shoes for sailors - very stable, dry quickly, and have lots of drainage.	episode_done:True
text:Better With Age: 10 Things Better Bought Used – Put This On	labels:This is my jam.   I love thrifting (does virtually count?)  so much I'm sad I already have all the things he listed.   Wool sweaters are fairly easy to find second hand and for the quality some mainstream brands sold (LL bean, Land's End, Woolrich, Pendelton) you'd pay $400-600 to get the weight and craftsmanship today.  Recently been into the old Levi's as well though I've focused on the Japanese versions so far.   Great/Overcoats are great second hand as well though the lapels are often dated so there's a lot of sifting.   u/chashew tipped me to a couple places in Toronto when we could travel a while back and literally spent 4-5 hours going through a few places.   I often wonder the story of where an item has been, what it's seen, who had it.   I find it all beautiful to think about.   Not even mentioning the sustainability portion.

I watched and learned about a ton of fashion for a month first with all the free time from covid. I have never spent this much on myself ever.

Just do it and after the first couple of times it'll feel easy. Anybody who is rude to you has the problem, not you, but it's never happened to me, including while shopping in other countries - - in Japan I wouldn't fit in most women's clothes, so I basically have to shop the men's and they seemed to think it was interesting and were happy to make the sale.  Maybe not the most apposite comment for your situation but wanted you to have the perspective that there are a lot of reasons you might be shopping there so you don't even have to feel like you're under undue scrutiny. One more suggestion: if you can, it might be easier to shop in a bigger city; in New York nobody would blink.	episode_done:True
text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:Gold, silver, & pearl go with everything. A few statement pieces along with these should be good. Go for quality as they look better & last longer.	episode_done:True
text:Canada Goose Workers Allege Unsafe Working Conditions in Winnipeg Factories. “Before I came to Canada I was in Qatar and then Dubai and it’s the same here in Canada Goose: No humanity.”	labels:That's sad how hopeless she feels at times.

text:2020 Gift Megathread	labels:I'm looking for something for my 26 year old brother-in-law, who is also a good friend. I've already gotten him one thing (a mug with his pet on it) and need something else for around $20-30. He likes fancy lego (but usually specific sets), maps, and drinking. I've gotten him fancy or interesting bourbon in the past, but I'd like something a little more personal than that. TIA!
text:Check out Displate. They have a lot of cool map related things. There's always a promo code so never pay full price.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:When did skinny jeans go out of fashion?	labels:I think it's important to remember that what's in style for 18-year-olds doesn't have to be what's in style for 30-somethings.  In fact, it would be weird if our style preferences were the same.	episode_done:True
text:Who are your fashion idols?	labels:I'm researching the curated closet method as I suffer from 'lots of clothes but nothing to wear'-itis. I made a list of what I need in my wardrobe and it's black jersey dresses - long sleeve, crew cut, modest a-line or bias cut. Gah, I can't wait to have a good set of basics! So sick of having an existential crisis every time I get dressed. I think the idea of putting a lot of thought into your wardrobe upfront so that day-to-day dressing is easy is a smart one.  My style icons are: Zoe Kravitz, Amber Heard for their bohemian-but-tailored vibes. Melissa Auf der Maur and D'arcy Wretzky in the 90's for their gothic, futuristic, minimalist vibes.	episode_done:True
text:Underwear review: Soma vs. Parade after 6 months	labels:I ordered some Parade and I really like how they look and feel. But their waistband does roll up when washed, it's not an issue when I put them on but I did not expect this problem since they're higher priced than say, Aerie.	episode_done:True
text:The Terribly High Cost of Cheap Goods	labels:Don't believe companies when they say something domestically produced will cost tons more. They lie! It's pure green. Unfettered capitalism. Maximum profit, minimal expense. I've discovered many high quality brands that have their goods made ethically and away from China! They do not cost a lot more and I'm happy to support locally made. No I'm not rich. The problem is that big greedy companies have the marketing budget to promote their cheaply made crap and thus make it hard for smaller independent brands to compete. But we have reddit which has been super useful in discovering such independent brands.

text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:I can't do a lot of lighter neutrals, but there are some shades of brown I like a lot. What's really been bugging me this season is how hard it's been to find patterns aside from plaids. I've been wearing plaid pants all the time just because I'm sick of wearing a solid top with a solid bottom.	episode_done:True

text:Favorite fashion bloggers that are your size?	labels:I doubt I'll ever find a fashion blogger close to my size. I'm barely able to find clothes that fit right. I'm 5'11" and a 4-5x plus. The closest I've found are 3x bloggers. Until I'm able to lose weight I just view fashion as something to admire from afar.   I've been lucky that torrid has some nice outfits for me but the available selection anywhere else is horrible. I get compliments for wearing my torrid outfits though so I'm not completely forced into grey tees and sweatpants.
text:Look up fatgirlflow (5'9 I believe and 3-4x), kandy foxx (5'7 and 4-5x), glitterandlazers (5'9, 3x), justine kay (5'7 and 3-4x) all on youtube.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:If you get more than 6 days a year, spend three money on goretex shell jacket and bib style pants (I'm happy with my Burton AK gear for mid line goretex stuff). If not, the main thing you're looking for is a powder skirt (removable if you don't want it bugging you while you're in town) and arm pit zippered vents. I find Holden jackets look good off the hill too, and like everyone else said, don't be the loudest looking guy on the hill.   I find unless it's colder than -15 celsius you won't need more than 1-2 baselayers. If you have a cold walk from the car to the lift line you're likely perfect for when you start sweating and working hard. Get some thin fabric liner gloves and throw them on underneath waterproof mittens. Smart wool socks over really, really thin moisture wicking socks.	episode_done:True

I felt so overdressed. His family was all wearing jeans and UGA apparel because his grandfather was a huge UGA fan. I felt really bad too because I was probably the only UGA alum in the group and no one told me about the dress code. My husband clearly didn't know either because he was wearing a suit.	episode_done:True

text:Which color palette do you hate wearing?	labels:Grey. I fucking hate it, and it makes me look like I'm dead or terribly sick, especially light grey tones. There are very few grey items that I enjoy looking at on other people, it's just the most dull and boring color in my opinion.   Also I don't wear olive at all, it's not my color at all, I also don't really like seeing it on other people most of the time, but I don't have as strong opinions on it as I do on grey.

Living in South Florida allows me to do that 99.8% of the year.... but when I have to meet clients I wear dressier flats but rarely do I ever wear heals. I prefer to wear a cute flat that allows me to move easier, and be in a better state of being because my feet dont hurt. Whatever you decide to do with the rest of your wardrobe make sure you wear comfortable shoes!! Bad shoes can ruin your day with painful steps and blisters that burn like fire when you get in the shower.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 20, 2020	labels:I'm looking for recommendations for a cheap-ish fitness tracking watch (or smartwatch), and they all seem to have big watchfaces/screens, and I'm looking for something smaller profile, even though I have big hands/wrists. Amazon's Halo was looking like a winner, but it doesn't have a display, GPS, or wifi connectivity, so it leaves a lot to be desired, but the look of it (basically just a cotton strap) I liked.  using for tracking steps/walking, biking, and sleep tracking mostly, has to work with android.  budget: 200, preferably under $130. in the US.

Online shopping can be quite hard to resist for me and I control myself by sleeping on it and thinking about it the next day and assessing how much I want it.	episode_done:True

text:Men’s clothing	labels:I would say pants wise, measure yourself because men's clothing is based on measurements. So my 40' waist is going to be a size 40. If you're looking for ways to blend it into your wardrobe more subtly, kinda like wearing a more flowy piece with a more structured piece, try mixing a more feminine piece with a more masculine piece.	episode_done:True
text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:My friend who loves fashion will create opportunities to wear her nice stuff (ex: plan a fancy dinner or GNO with friends, social media "photoshoots", etc.) but she'll also just dress up to go to the store or run errands.	episode_done:True

text:How to find non-custom tailored clothing for short men (under 5')	labels:This is a huge issue I haven't been able to solve as a short man who isn't skinny and has large hips. Boy's clothes are just too small, even in "hefty" sizes. Hefty sizes that are big enough are often too long regardless. Also, while it's possible to find pants for short men, jackets are impossible to find. Suit jackets, yes. But anything more casual, no.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 19, 2021	labels:I never thought I'd become this person, but man, shipping costs really can fuck up my desire to buy something. I was just about to commit to buying another pair of sneakers and it's probably the best deal I'm going to find on them, added to cart, shipping info entered, billing info entered... $20 for the cheapest shipping option. No shipping codes available, no threshold I can cross to get free shipping. $20 period, no exceptions.  It's a $300 pair of sneakers discounted to $180, I guess should be able to rationalize that at $200 (including shipping), I'm still getting a better deal than what's available anywhere else online (only a few select retailers got this colorway, and all but one are sold out in my size), but still, $20 shipping feels *wrong*. My brain has been trained from years of online shopping that there should always be some way to get around paying for shipping, or otherwise, shipping should be cheap.

text:I've taken 566 outfit photos over 4 years (my style from mid-20s to 30)	labels:Thank you for putting together this post! You've definitely been aspirational to me over the years and your reflections are very insightful. Inspires me to want to take outfit photos and see what my style evolution will look like in a few years. ;)  Edited to add: A lot of your experiences also resonated with me, as I too have moved to London in the last few years and have specifically purchased items because "It's what __ would wear!" or to replicate an exact outfit I saw on Instagram. If you have any tips on how to find items you love - and not because you loved it on someone else - I'd be keen to hear it. I'm *still* learning what my style is, and I'm over 30!	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: what does your shopping process look like?	labels:I don't make a big purchase unless I love the item so I pounce on it because of what I've heard jokingly called the Moscow Rule - grab it now, because when you go back it'll be gone.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:Ordered some leggings from a user recommendation on reddit (I think it was on this sub?), and while I did eventually get them, they were waay too small. All the dimensions mentioned when I ordered were more than enough for me. I was surprised they even arrived at all since the website disappeared 4 days later.    They refused to refund because they were "as advertised", which 1. no they weren't, and 2. there was no longer any way to check.    So now they're sitting in a bag while I wait on MasterCard to make a decision, and I'm not communicating with the company per my banks' orders.	episode_done:True

text:Stockings vs Tights vs Leggings	labels:Honestly, I find pants to be too cold in the winter. It's one layer of fabric!   Instead, on really cold days, like other people here I wear fleece lined or wool tights. On top of that I'll wear wool socks, knee high (or over the knee) boots to block wind, and a skirt in a thicker fabric or sweater dress.   These layers keep me way warmer than pants would, unless you wear tights under your pants and I personally hate how that feels.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 09, 2020	labels:What's with the loose clothing trend? I see it a lot in inspiration albums on this sub, and I don't see the appeal. Perhaps someone could help me out with this?
text:Well fitted clothes will always look nice. But there isn't really much room to play around with silhouette and proportion. It can get very samey or boring. Loose, baggy, oversized clothes open up a lot more options and aesthetics when it comes to your fashion	labels:So it's about playing around with illusion?
text:Hard to really give a definitive answer for why fashion is the way it is. You seem to be thinking of fitted clothes as the default and anything loose as a deliberate deviation from that. Really they are just different looks that appeal to different people and give off a different vibe.	labels:Yes, but I'm confused about said "vibe" and its appeal.
text:Fashion tends to be cyclical and new trends often reject the old.  The move to looser fits is the rejection of a decade plus of slim fits.  . There is no need to be confused by this. It's simply a fashion look that you don't find personally appealing.   Ultimately, we are pretty much in a post-fashion world so if slim fits flatter your physique and you like them, you will almost never look out of place wearing them.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:I'm still relatively new to putting effort into my fashion.   Maybe you have a mix of styles? When I look at my closet, I can't really identify one style. There are a few and I interchange based on how I feel about myself or what I'm doing.   It could also be because you still live with your parents and go to school. When I moved out, I went BERSERK with my styles. Cute, short dresses. More grunge. Because I could never wear that at my parents' house. It could still be your style but you're just not able to wear it right now, unfortunately.  You could try adding something more grunge/alt to your outfits. Like a jacket, beanie, jewelry, etc. Anything small that you feel reflects your desired style, without hopefully getting in trouble.	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:Honestly, I learned that the "investment" pieces of today are of quality that is way lower than it should be at those price points. Cashmere, silk, etc today are worse than they were 20 years ago and there is a large quality spectrum in these fabrics. Stitching and durability is also a major problem. For me, investment pieces are clothes that have a forgiving return policy so that I can buy, take home and try out of the day, perhaps dry clean or wash a few times before I make a decision on keeping that item. If they have a repair or replacement guarantee that lasts a few years, even better. I don't mind paying the big bucks if it means my piece of clothing is not going to be next to disposable after a year.
text:Washing a few times before returning? What place would allow that?	labels:Plenty if you start looking. Nordstrom, Patagonia, LlBean, Darn Tough all return for a refund if your item falls apart. My favorite are brands that repair like Darn Tough, Barbour and LlBean.	episode_done:True

text:What rockstar(s) you take fashion inspiration from? What do you like about their style?	labels:Ive always wanted to get inside Brendon Uries closet & try on all of his suits.

text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:My guess is the light wash, loose jeans will be obsolete by then, which is a shame
text:OOH!  If light wash loose jeans hit the charity shops eventually, I will be able to buy SUMMER jeans! (I very very rarely buy anything NEW).  I have one pair of light wash jeans (if that means pale?), which are men's slim.  Bought maybe 2014 so getting somewhat tired now (put away for next year).	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I moved to a big city in 2012 and driving and parking is miserable, so I have been online shopping for years now.  I use Zappos and Amazon a lot. For Zappos returns, you print a label, tape it up and take to any UPS place. I have a very difficult time buying shoes, so I might order a dozen pair and sometimes return them all. If the business wants to do this, I am cooperative.  You have to check on Amazon before you purchase and make certain it's returnable. UPS will box it up for you, it's amazing.  I hear Kohl's does also, but I never go there. You can print your own label and return it to an Amazon locker, that's even easier than a UPS store.  I check my measurements carefully and read a lot of reviews. I don't actually return much that I buy except for shoes.  I buy everything online, but bras? I don't know, that might be difficult.	episode_done:True
text:I (M/39) just bought some bright yellow, women's, terry loungepants from August November. What wonderful "non-female" fashion items have you purchased recently?

Most men's pants won't go over my hips easily.   I bought a few crew shirts from the Goodfellow brand at Target, they are thick and durable. Recommend!
text:(Womens pocketless PJs) WHAT IS UP WITH THAT?! I want to put my phone in my gendered PJs too!!	labels:Aha!  I could not figure out why ANY pjs would have pockets!

text:Textured Knits	labels:Can I just say, the inclusion of women in these posts is really refreshing. My girlfriend even looks through MFA posts since she wears some menswear and these looks are something she appreciates as well. Keep it up.
text:Yeah refreshing is the right word. Also always something to learn from the differences. The guys from the main collection seem to be wearing more conservative colour pallets, the girls despite ostensibly wearing similar stuff contribute subtly more aggressive colours. Good shit.	labels:Very well said. I think there some some neat looks from the women really pushing the envelope in terms of pallets and purposeful clashing which I enjoyed seeing. There have been some really awesome inspo albums featuring looks from women that I would like to wear as well in similar styles. I think this is a trend that we will be seeing more of in the upcoming years as women begin to adopt more clothing traditionally worn by just men. I mention in another comment how when I am at the thrift store, at least half the time, there is a woman going through the mens jeans and mens collared shirts or sweaters that I am going through as well.	episode_done:True

Standing up to Mountain Utah winter. I was gifted a Universal Standard full length puffer this year and DANG it's warm. And stain resistant as I found out dropping drive through all over it.

I'd suggest finding an upscale restaurant that serves them.

text:Have you ever found a designer, maker or collection that makes you seriously think, "Everything they make is so beautiful and I want to own/collect everything they make?" If so, what is it?	labels:Of course, for me it has been Kate Spade New York. I remember the first time i purchased something in the brand i was 17 years old and it was a dress for church, i still have it and it's so precious for me because it hold so many memories, after that i saved to purchase my first purse which i loved and wore everywhere with everything lol. Her brand really called me because of the fun colors and shapes; it's so bubbly it reminded me of my childhood, so ofcourse it took me by surprise Kate Spade's passing in 2018. I still collect her pens, stationary items, shoes and other things from her, and i been lucky enough to have had past relationships that understood my connection that gifted me some items.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online?

The owner is an awesome, hilarious, relatable person- I've actually had several non-purchase related conversations with her.   I came across it when she'd posted a tank top in her shop- she typically does all the modeling herself. She wasn't wearing a bra and some people wanted to come in and be assholes. She fucking HANDLED them. They should not have come for her, lol.   Her aesthetic is "irreverent woman" and I think she represents it well. If I had more money, I'd have bought a lot more of her stuff.	episode_done:True

If i stand and smooth the legs out everything is straight. After a few paces the material bunches up around the knee and i have 2-3 breaks etc. The shop pictures show them straight on the models.  Is that bc they are slim fit? Not washed? Normal?   Imho it does not look good...
text:It sounds like you have calves. Many fashion models don't.  Slimmer pants reduce the margin for error - some dudes have forward pelvises - if 2 guys both have an X inch waist, and one dude's pelvis is more forward, it means given the constant waist size, the small of his back is also further forward relative to his calves, compared to the other guy  Think   _   .|    versus   _   I    The guy with the forward pelvis is much more likely to have the pants physical sit on his calves, because they cannot really hang straight down. A guy with the opposite problem would be prone to having the pants touching the front of his thighs.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Can we talk sleepwear?	labels:When I prepared to give birth to my first child, I splurged on beautiful long sleeping gown / bathrobe set in white cotton.   It was comfy / flexible enough to accommodate my post-pregnancy recovery. But it was also luxurious and pretty - something that new mothers don't feel. (Also, my FIL was visiting & would often wander around with his camcorder! So I couldn't just walk around in my maternity undies).  I wore that set for more than 5 years.  I also have PJs that are button-down tops with matching little shorts. What makes the difference is high-quality cotton, good tailoring and detailing .  One set is black with white piping. Another is lavender. The guy I've been talking to (mostly via video) loves the black set, even though it's not overtly sexual like lingerie.  I don't wear anything silky to bed because it bunches up & also feels OTT.   Confession: I also "steal" hotel slippers because they are so comfy.

I am somewhat getting a new style together and because I work in a warehouse as a painter I don't get to wear any of it in the daytime.   Evening time does last about 3-4 hours, so I've just been wearing nice clothes at home, doing my hair in the evening and wearing jewelry.

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:besides cleaning and storage it is very important to handle the items with ease. for example when you are taking off a pair of shoes or heels do not use your other feet to pull it out. use your hands to untie and remove your shoe properly. similar goes for zips and buttons.   avoid dropping them to the floor when you are done with your shoes or bags once back home. take the extra effort of putting them in their place then and there.   if you sweat a lot leave your jewelry outside for a bit before you place then in a closed box. this way it retains its shine and coating for longer.  give shoes and Demin a day break between your wears. this would give them time to breath and stay in shape longer.   watch out where you sit down and stand, this is basic.	episode_done:True
text:Is it disgusting to not wear socks with shoes?	labels:She's a jerk, but also it's better for the shoes if you wear no-show socks.

text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:I think with the current trends, shoes in general are on their way out, and we'll see less invested in them as trends, at least for a while. Everything is deliverable now, no reason to ever leave, and by 2021, I think that trend will only accelerate more. A pair of flips to get to the mailbox, a pair of warm boots for fall/winter excursions, and you're probably set.  I also think we'll see a resurgence of "athleisure" stuff, yoga pants, crop tops, leggings everywhere, and hoodies. No one's dressing for a day running errands or a night out on the town anymore, it's a five minute look to get out and get back, so it'll be whatever does double duty as loungewear and outside-appropriate.  And people who like dressing up for funsies (like me!) will just buy any damn thing and love it, especially if it's on sale! My cat isn't the harshest fashion critic, after all...	episode_done:True
text:Is it disgusting to not wear socks with shoes?	labels:Yes it is gross. But not to the point of insulting someone you just met. I have very little tolerance for smelly but not to a point of being a rude person and if you are wearing your shoes, there shouldn't be aby problem. Though, I have forced some people to keep their shoes in my home. Smelling someone else's feet on my floor two days later is gnarly!	episode_done:True
text:BoF: J. Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:I think this could potentially be a good idea because the preppy/sweater vest style is very in, the "dark academia" style is very in, and it seems like a lot of young adults on TikTok have been romanticizing the old money aesthetic.   I would like to see them treat their women's line with as much seriousness as the men's. A lot of the men's styles are classic and come in basic neutrals, while the women's clothes are riddled with sequins, ruffles, neons, and slogans.

text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Outside of formal wear, I don't own clothes that aren't comfortable to sit around the house in. Even my jeans are soft and stretchy.   No skinny heels, no open toe heels, and no pumps/things that don't cover the top of my foot. My feet and ankles are much more comfortable in a thick oxford heel that laces up or booties than open shoes.  No grey. I went through a period of buying a lot of grey, with the thought process that those items would "go with everything", ignoring my colorful inner self entirely. Couldn't figure out why I was bored and hated getting dressed for a long time. Now, I've given up on "neutral" colors and accepted that I am a vibrant color person. Crimson red is neutral as far as I'm concerned, it goes with most other colors. So does cobalt, mustard yellow, on and on.  If I can't wear it with a regular bra or no bra, I'm not buying it. No strapless, or one strap, or oddly shaped bras for me.
text:Fellow color lover here! I feel so out of place on this sub some times for looking color. Until a few years ago, I didn't own a plain white or black t-shirt lol. I have since bought a few though because I have colored pants that look a bit better with a neutral colored top.

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.
text:Yep, I'm pretty sure the lightest and least insulated jacket I own is my snowboard jacket. It's just there for wind and waterproofing, not for warmth. Plus because it's supposed to be worn with many layers it doesn't fit right without said layers, so it's not very useful as a casual jacket.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 18, 2020	labels:I'm dying for a pair of GATs and/or AF-1 low analogs that don't have any external branding  and are of decent quality.       I have a pair of genuine article GATs from the 1970s, and holy grails though they are, they're pretty uncomfortable to wear because they're so old and had been broken in by someone with more of an arch than me. Does anyone know of a Buzz Rickson style brand that has made GATs in exacting (or very close) detail without putting their own spin on it/covering it in logos?     H&M used to make a great-looking AF-1 rip off, looked almost exactly the same but without the swoosh/nike air embroidery/tongue tag, which is exactly what I want. Unfortunately, H&M quality is something I can't deal with when it comes to footwear. Can anyone recommend anything similar Ideally i'd like to spend 300 or less per pair? Or is my best bet to take a pair of AF-1s to a cobbler and ask them to remove all the stitching and swooshes.
text:Hender Scheme makes a ton of homages to other popular shoes. Personally I like Maison Margiela GATs the most and they can regularly be found in many colorways for your budget both new and used.

I thought of getting a pair and having the tongue tag removed, but then i'd be left with the square of holes in the center of the tongue, which would then draw attention to the fact that they're unbranded, which is the exact opposite of what I'm after.  THAT SAID, these Hender Scheme's (which I'd never heard of before) have a plain black AF1 and a Plain GAT that both look fucking incredible. Thank you so much, I'm absolutely getting the MIP-22 in black if I can find it in my size.

Orion Leather was my go-to, but they have since been defunct, along with a bunch of the recommended that I knew years ago. So I'm trying to compile a list of brands to research and decide on before I make the purchase. Budget is $50-80.

And by "extra-long", I'm talking about just total length and not the sleeve length.  I wear a 42L, but need a coat that is 49" or more long (from bottom of collar to bottom of hem).  It seems like the trend now is for shorter coats, stopping at the knee or higher.  I would like a coat that stops a few inches below the knee which seems to be hard to find.

text:I generally find it's too thin for a good cardigan. The author of the article seems focused on more of the chunky cardigan thing.  But I think a thinner cardigan can be awesome on taller/thinner people (at least, that's where my aesthetic tends to think it's most useful, ymmv, and that can depend on the shape of the cardigan and all kinds of other stuff that goes well beyond the basics.  In short, merino wool cardigans probably aren't "basic" - not that a few of these are anyway, but there you are.	labels:those thin merino wool cardigan, sometimes those cotton ones too, often feels very fragile to me.	episode_done:True

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:I think of it like this, fast fashion exists to be replaced quickly by something newer/more on trend, it's not that the product is garbage (well, sometimes!), but that it's supposed to be worn a few times and then replaced by a newer trend/print/cut/style.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 18, 2020	labels: Two of my old beloved 514's are getting too many holes, but in trying to find new ones on the Levi's website is......confusing. It seems everything is "stretch" now, and the pair of stretch I do have (511s) feel a little snug around the knees when sitting (which working from home all day in jeans means I'm sitting in jeans all day until the office opens again).  So, does Levi's even make 100% cotton jeans anymore? I'm hesitant to get the 514s with stretch since they are supposed to be a little baggy in the leg and I'm not sure how stretch would work, and I really don't love how it feels in general when it comes to jeans (but love stretch in my Everlane chinos that I used to wear when actually going to the office...some day again soon I hope!)  Finally, if all there is is stretch, would 513 be a better choice than 514 for what I am describing?

I have the Uniqlo long johns and while they're extremely comfy and warm on their own, wearing skinny pants (which aren't skintight) on top of them makes it nearly impossible to sit down without feeling like I'm going to rip my pants at the knees - the friction between the two layers prevents me from really being able to pull my pants up that small amount to sit down. Does anyone know what sort of fabric/synthetic I should be looking for that would still keep me decently warm?

I don't get fully dressed every day but I love to still pick out outfits as if I have somewhere to go. I do my makeup (though lighter than before) and put on jewelry. I plan activities with my friends where we can get together just to dress up and have fun. Like before but different.  It feels like I have no control left anymore and this is one simple thing I can continue doing to create structure and routine in my life, and something I know will make me feel good.

I've worn one of the shirts once (Zoom meeting) and one of the dresses once (one of the few times we had in-person church).  However!

She thought at one point she was going to have to spend the night on the mountain which might have killed her.    Don't wear all white while skiing.

text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:For me I got rid of some old work clothes recently as I work remote last as I realized even if I go back to work in person my style has changed. I have also greatly reduced my wardrobe to about 1/3-1/4 of what it was about a year or so ago.  I went about it by identifying clothes I hadn't worn in a while and stuck them in a drawer(s) I wasn't using/cleared out for this purpose. After a while I forget it's there unless there was something I want to wear at which time I grabbed what I wanted and kept it. Leave it in there as long as you deem necessary, for me it was about 3 months. Then I donated or threw away.  At first this was easy, and then it got a little harder, but at this point I had closet space and so I washed everything and put everything on a top rack. After I wore it it was hung back up on the bottom rack. After a while I removed what I hadn't worn up top and hid them in the drawer again.   I did this process several times over a year or so until I felt like I had successfully minimized my wardrobe, which I feel I have.	episode_done:True
text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:I don't like wearing synthetic fabrics for the most part and try to avoid them, but I am vegan and that leaves out wool and silk, so almost everything I own is cotton or linen. I find I sweat too much in most synthetic fabrics or they just cause weird sensory issues for me, but not all synthetic and blends are bad or cause me issues. It's hard because I generally need to feel the fabric to see if it'll cause me a problem and when ordering online, it's not possible.   I do think fleece is particularly problematic because of the plastic fibers that get into the water when washed, but there are bags to wash them in to trap it. I don't think all synthetics shed plastic like that but I'm not sure.	episode_done:True

text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:I've always loved the quote of "fragrance is meant to be discovered, not announced", because it kinda reflects where I stand on fragrance *amount.* I'm always curious what people are wearing, but if it's overpowering, or the fragrance strongly lingers in the room long after someone has left it (ghost perfume!), it turns me off from the rest of the outfit and I tend to avoid the person. I'm not a fan of strong/intense smells.  I tend to associate flowery fragrances with twee and more dainty fashion choices, and more "masculine" (for lack of a better word) fragrances with alt, androgynous, and other such styles, so I tend to expect x fragrances if someone is wearing x outfit. But even if someone doesn't wear what I'm expecting, it doesn't really take away from the outfit too much.  I haven't worn fragrance in ages because my favourites were discontinued (DKNY Be Delicious and Katy Perry Meow). But based on my style nowadays (more masculine, lots of darker neutrals, odd silhouettes), I would probably choose something less sweet just to complement my outfits a bit more.
text:Completely agree! I went to high school with a girl who I always knew was about to enter the classroom because I could smell her signature perfume long before I saw her. It was a nice-smelling perfume, and I didn't find it overpowering actually, but I do find it rude to be wearing so much perfume that others can smell it without being in close proximity. I like it when someone is wearing *just* enough that I notice a subtle scent and want to lean in closer to get another whiff (though I don't, cause I'm not a creeper)	labels:	episode_done:True

You should wear things you love and are interested in. It doesn't matter if it's flattering or not. As long as you are happy with it and think it looks great, it should be fine. In time, when you get older, you will find a style or styles that really speak to you, and it turns out, that weird thing you liked in your teens and early 20s wasn't a phase, but it's something that really spoke to you, and you just updated what you wore 5 years ago with a more adult version of it.

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.
text:I absolutely love wearing dresses but finding ones that look nice, like for work, and are comfortable is a little hot and cold for me. Can I ask where you've found good dresses?

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:I'm borderline X/millennial.   I see Gen Z wearing styles that I remember from middle school.  Things like baggier jeans, the high waisted trend (my early 20s was defined by low waisted pants), oversized clothing (think Billie Eilish), etc.  I see some of these styles and think "this should have stayed in the 90s".  The example I think about is Mom jeans.  Many millennials still remember the SNL skit where they made fun of them and how unflattering they are.  They made them look matronly and dowdy.  I can't bring myself to even go near them in the store without that SNL skit playing in my head.
text:Yes exactly! This is the same reason that I can't bring myself to buy a fanny pack. No judging anyone who likes them. I just happen to remember a time when they were considered very uncool	labels:Yes fanny packs scream "retiree tourist" to me and always will.	episode_done:True

text:Ever been censored at work because of what you wear?	labels:I am super progressive but I agree with the school, teachers should not be wearing clothing with any kind of messaging whether it be Trump, Jesus, or feminism. You are not held to the same standard as students obviously. You are an employee and a professional. I would not wear any kind of messaging in my workplace either and if a fellow colleague did I would find it inappropriate even if I agreed with what it said.  Edit: downvoters are teenagers or non-professionals.

text:What are your tips for dressing a big chest!	labels:This is probably not the answer you're looking for but I'm leaving it anyway: have you considered a reduction? Like you, I thought I was destined to look dumpy and matronly forever but after a particularly bad day of clothes shopping I was mad enough to look into it and went through with it. It changed my entire relationship with my body.  If you don't feel the need to go to this extreme, I salute you and hope you get some good advice.	episode_done:True
text:All things K-Fashion!	labels:I love you for this thread.  I've definitely been more into Kpop than Kdramas, but there's obviously overlap in them. As someone who isn't white, it's also fun to see fashion on those closer to my ethnicity. That being said, most actresses and models are still super skinny.  I love the femininity of South Korean fashion without being too over the top and also modest. It definitely runs in with the styles I like, the girliness and also the street styles

text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:I have found people overwhelmingly wear clothes a size too small (like speaking to friends and whatnot). My sister, for example, buys the same size leggings as I do despite her hips and waist being 5-6 inches larger than mine, and then complains about them being see through. I have strong suspicions that this is the reason people find thongs horrifically uncomfortable as well.	labels:I have slim hips but a wider waist, so I have to pick a smaller size for mid-waist then for high-waisted. Slimmer hips also comes with a bit of belly pouch, even at size 6-8.  Most bottoms are cut for wider, but flatter hips then my round ones, so sizing pants up rarely works if it get's larger in the wrong places.  Tight, high-waisted jeans doesn't work at all for me, since they try to force my lower torso into another shape, and usually leads to stomach ache.	episode_done:True

text:He's a snake oil salesmen basically. He's a combo of alpha m but worse and those weird pick up artists.	labels:Forgot about Alpha M, all the videos are to pick up the "spicy senoritas". True, they are hustling to make a good living but they can tone down the cringey-ness.
text:I dig Aaron Marino but at times he had no faith in the people watching his videos	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom taught me basically everything I know about fashion/style! She has a very classic/classy style which I resisted for a long time (because I wanted to keep up with trends like ripped jeans) but now that I'm in my mid-twenties, we trade clothes and have a very similar style. She always seemed overdressed in our Florida home (she's not American, and also wears heels 90% of the time) but now that I live in a city, I appreciate her style a lot more.   What she didn't teach me was how to have fun with fashion and be expressive with it so maybe one day I'll venture into that.	episode_done:True

I'm 5' 9.5 and very slim. Not sure if S or M would be better, but I guess it depends on how much these shrink.

text:Do you have any pieces that "should not" work with your body that just seems to work?	labels:Seems to be that many so called rules are mainly to minimize our strongest and most unique features. But why are we being told to be apologetic about our most unique attributes? I'm one who tends to flaunt my strengths. I show off my muscular shoulders. I cinch my high waist at my actual waist instead of trying for the illusion of a proportionate waist. I wear pegged pants on my munchkin legs with FLATS *gasp* i like me. I like my style.	episode_done:True
text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:The most expensive bag I bought was a $500 Tory Burch bag, and I have already sold it. I regretted the purchase. I always wanted a Chanel bag, but after the pandemic, my perspective has changed a lot and I am happy with my Madewell leather bags I have collected over the years.
text:As someone who lusted after the classic Chanel flap for close to 20 years and finally acquired it, I honestly wish I had the change in perspective that you did. I bought it second-hand after I got promoted and while it is beautiful, it was all very anticlimactic, and I barely even use it.  I guess it was always fun to have "THE GOAL" bag, but after idolizing something for that long, I feel like it was inevitable for it to fall short of my expectations. I definitely need to re-evalute whether it's worth keeping, or just selling it.	labels:Just had that same anticlimactic moment with Chanel today >.< was obsessed with this boy bag for years, hunted it down, finally received it and honestly the leather on my old vintage Coach purse was far far superior and 3200$ less	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:Figure out what inspires you about the style and then "translate" that to your own shape (and vibe and lifestyle etc). The retro men's khakis probably look good on the men in the photos because they're tailored to flatter that specific shape - they communicate ease and perfection and the possibility of summer fun.

text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:I occasionally buy clothes from Shein for fashion pieces when there's a trend I want to try and don't want to spend a chunk of change on it so this comment is specific to Shein. I understand the ethics behind buying fast fashion, I just don't have the ability to buy from sustainable brands all the time.  Truthfully I don't recommend buying from Shein if you're looking for something that you're going to wear more than one season. The clothes look great before you wash it, nice quality even, but they detoriate the moment you try to wash it. The fit is alright but the fabrics pill easily and the materials they use for the clothing photograph well (on the reviews) but are not comfortable. A lot of the clothes are very poorly made in materials that don't suit what the clothing is meant to do e.g. not stretchy loungepants.   My top tip is to read the reviews and try to look for photos in different body types to see how the clothing is actually cut. Stick to basics because it's hard to get wrong. Good luck!	episode_done:True

text:What a vapid take	labels:No?   Aesthetics are important, and Star Wars has some of the most iconic space ships, characters, environments etc.  Everyone knows what the Death Star is and people see the flying triangles as Star Wars ships. Only the shape of the Enterprise is iconic.   That is my take.
text:I dunno. Although the Klingon Bird of Prey and Borg Cube don't have the same mainstream exposure as the Enterprise, they'll forever be iconic in my eyes.	labels:They are still iconic, but not having the same mainstream exposure I think is what the OP meant be losing the popularity contest.	episode_done:True
text:What work for my boyfriends taste and body type?	labels:Photos and a budget would help.  Layering can be good, especially for a guy with a broad frame like you're describing.  If he wants more Americana, he can try westernwear (denim, flannel shirts, chambray shirts in the summer, rugged leathers). Flannels can be worn open over a tee shirt as a very casual midlayer, or buttoned up as you might expect.  On the smarter end, he might be interested in Ivy / Prep. That will include oxford cloth shirts with button down collars (a "university stripe" in blue is a good start), tassel loafers (a Brooks Brothers original), khaki chinos (overrated), and a navy blazer.  I can give more specific recommendations if you give us an idea of your budget.	episode_done:True

His comment basically implies its just an "inspo album", inspiration for what exactly?  In my eyes, this is just wearable art and has no connection with advising people on what to wear or how to wear clothes.
text:This is still fundamentally a fashion subreddit my guy. Not a "teach neckbeards how to dress themselves" subreddit. It would seem an album of fashion photos fits into a fashion related sub, no?	labels:> Not a "teach neckbeards how to dress themselves" subreddit.  That's where you're wrong, the title and bio of this subreddit tell a different story.   > It would seem an album of fashion photos fits into a fashion related sub, no?  Not when the album of fashion photos don't help in anyway with helping people decide on what or how to dress. Posting some dude with a paper mache globe on their head dressed in all black with a giant white circle on their chest is not my idea of "fashion advice".

text:Future of fibers?	labels:Increasing rate of consumption of natural fibers is also terrible for the environment - mass production of cotton is environmentally atrocious. The shipment of sustainable clothing from Ukraine to New York, for example, is also really bad environmentally. If it is a concern for you and you're able, I would suggest looking into local producers; this includes designers, fibre producers, factories, dyers, etc etc. Thats the best way to ensure minimal impact of clothing on the environment.  However, not always practical or possible.
text:> I would suggest looking into local producers  I want this to be the future of not just fashion but the whole global economy. So many places (at least in the US) have lost "local flavor" to global brands, and that minimizes the diversity of options, competition, innovation, and perspectives in fashion and every industry. We need to move towards a better balance of local and global production and identify ways we can strengthen small businesses and enable them to compete and (re)establish a local culture.	labels:Yeah, i agree completely. Its difficult to actually do often (i live in reasonably northern Canada, like not North but we do not have a winter growing season of any appreciable value) so if i don't want to like get scurvy in the winter I won't be buying local.

text:General Discussion - December 23, 2020	labels:Do you feel like social media (possibly over-accessibility in general) "ruined" things you otherwise like because it seems to cheapen everything? Ex. every look turning into a meme. Or is that it all never actually mattered in the first place and this idea that you knew about stuff on the low was utterly meaningless to begin with? Kinda like every kid in the neighborhood suddenly became privy to "your" private swim spot.   Maybe it's the association of all of it. I feel like this big shift has occurred, especially in the last 2-3 years where the kids who rock vineyard vines have found themselves getting their "street style" on or rich girls who wish they were indie chicks compensate by wearing bucket hats and only using film cameras.  Still organizing my thoughts around this.. going through a fashion identity crisis atm.
text:Idk man. This kinda sounds like "people are enjoying the things I enjoy but *they're doing it wrong!!*", which is a pretty snobby attitude, imo.	labels:I suppose that's one way to take it and probably a piece of it, if I'm being honest.  You discredit the inauthenticity that plagues a lot of it in the process though. Maybe it's just what I experienced living in Brooklyn and observing kids who fetishized being fashiony and "poor" then finding out their parents are cutting their rent checks. Same as in the techno/dance music scene as well. Shows got absolutely ruined thanks to overexposure.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 13, 2020	labels:hey there! so I'm really confused about color and how to match it? i've already read the sidebar and i find the seasonal approach too confusing to me, is there anything else I can use? mainly the colors I wear are red, black, white, green, and yellow, I prefer to be rather muted and don't prefer high contrast as that brings the attention to me whereas I want to blend in, so I would like to know how can I layer with these colors, assume that my shirt/t-shirt/crewneck etc is one of these colors, then what should I wear with it? what color pants? what color jacket you know?
text:I'm new to this too but one thing I realized way too late was how bad I find mismatches in the intensity of color. If the green in my tee is muted, like an olive, then there isn't a single color of jacket that is super bright that I enjoy going with it. Instead of want a similarly muted color in my jacket (say more of a maroon than a red). I also really can't beat the classic black/dark jeans, white tee, color pop in jacket look.	labels:ahh that's very much true, I do love that look as well, but I don't want to people to see me all the time in the same clothes almost?	episode_done:True

That's the way I try to dress most of the time, although with a more casual twist because I'm lazy and live in a relaxed place.   I'd love to see a board along the lines of Mod, But Make It Modern/Plus Size: I love the whole 60s mod aesthetic, but so many of the looks are tailored for Twiggy and not for people with body types like mine.

text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:I do my washing once a week, twice during winter since the clothing is thicker, thus requiring more space in the washer. I wear leggings, jeans, underwear, socks, bras, etc.... only once before washing. same with work clothes like blouses or cardigans (since I wear them all day long). I typically will wear a coat or hoodie a few times before washing, I just don't feel like they get as dirty, possibly because they're being worn over another layer of fabric already. Sometimes I will rewear tshirts too. Especially sleep shirts. I'll wake up, change, throw my sleep shirt on the bed to wear again the next night. They always still smell nice when I wake up and I don't sweat while I sleep, so they just seem clean enough to get a couple wears out of each time. Dresses I'll usually wear a few times too before washing, unless I went out dancing in it or something, in which case I'll clearly wash it after wearing.	episode_done:True

So yeah, I have 27 dresses and nowhere to wear them.

The less I saw the stuff advertised the less I want it.   Harder now but real, in store shopping makes me less likely to buy stuff.

text:In Europe (The Netherlands at least) Carhartt, or more specifically it's street wear subsidiary Carhartt WIP, is considered very fashionable. I literally just bought a Carhartt sweater and I love it and I just can't see it as a farmer or workwear brand lol	labels:This. Same in the UK. Carhartt doesn't have the farmer connotation over here. We know it's a workwear brand first and foremost in the States but over here it's always been marketed as streetwear. In fact, I think you'd be hard pushed to find carhartt in any real workwear shops here (I mean shops selling clothing to actual tradespeople rather than ones in East London run by bearded hipsters in heavy flannel shirts and raw denim).   Carhartt WIP is what we know as Carhartt in Europe and I'd imagine you'd probably get laughed out of the local bar if you want to hilbillyville wearing a lot of it.

text:What Are Your Regional Fashion Stereotypes?	labels:Southern Germany:  \- Young people are mostly into street wear these days with big sneakers, track suits, those gucci strap bags and strap back caps. In bigger cities like Munich, Stuttgart or Freiburg you also get the student hispter crowd wit skinny jeans, vintage shirts and chucks.  \- middle age people are wild, mostly they look like they were blindfolded while getting dressed. Lots of functional stuff in odd colors, square toes, ill fitting suits, boot cut jeans, etc.  \- from 60 onwards it is mandatory to only wear functional clothes in beige and of course socks + sandals  &#x200B;  Generally, there is a mistrust against well dressed people or people who spend money and care about clothes. This is mostly seen as something a respectable person wouldn't do...
text:Haha this is spot on! I'm half German and I do have to say that I find it very liberating that no one gives a shit compared to Sweden (my other home) where you'll find people in their 40s desperately trying to keep up with fashion.   I've been working in a lot in high end restaurants and you can (almost) always spot the german tourists within a second. I'm sorry, but a white dress shirt won't make your  jack Wolfskin rain jackets and trekking shoes blend in any better (although they're very praktisch).	labels:Haha so true. Another classic are these hiking nylon pants you can unzip to turn them into shorts. And 3/4 shorts in summer are also great.  I lived in South Africa & Australia for some time and it was incredibly easy to spot the Germans. Oddly, I find that there is a weird "sense of fashion" if you can call that. It just includes the wrong items and fits...

text:How Much Clothing Should I Own?	labels:I don't think anyone is going to be able to tell you this as it's subjective and dependent on your job and lifestyle. It's going to come down to keeping stuff you actually wear on a weekly basis and throwing away stuff you don't wear. This will let you know where you stand with your wardrobe right now and you can build from there.     Personally, I just went though this and cleaned out my closet from all the all the old high school, college, and worn clothes I still had hanging around and my mind set was that ***it's better for me to throw away a little too much than too little***. Only do this if your in the financial situation where you know you can replace an article of clothing pretty easily though.
text:> I don't think anyone is going to be able to tell you this as it's subjective and dependent on your job and lifestyle.  This especially. I don't have laundry in my apartment.

text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:Louis Vuitton
text:Is Virgil Abloh an accepted response?	labels:How did this guy go from doing overpriced edgy street wear to a top role at LV?
text:Because streetwear has been tremendously successful for luxury brands, and Virgil is a big part of the reason why luxury streetwear is a thing.	labels:That and his "style" of management is also really convenient for a corporate brand. It's sort of this known thing, sometimes spoken sometimes whispered, that Virgil doesn't design a ton of the stuff that his brands put out. He would claim he has a "collaborative model" which basically means he takes credit for designs 100% start-to-finish created by his employees, who are on NDA. He does some design work himself, sure, or gives feedback, or provides mood boards, or whatever, but some amount of his "output" is him just taking complete ownership of other people's work.   This is kind of ideal for a megacorp like Louis Vuitton, because he can be a spokesman and figurehead and he's more than happy to have LV employees do design work for him so long as he gets credit for their work. LV is happy because they get to borrow the weight of his celebrity status, he's happy because he has a massive armature of LV's employees that he can take credit for.

I would then show them what I liked and sometimes they could tell me what type of top it was, style, neckline, etc. Now if they are giving their clothes away, they usually ask me if I want to take a look and gives to a chance to try things on and keep things.	episode_done:True

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive are things I plan to use a lot and for a long time, so that would be my  jewelry, purses, and shoes.  And I wear and use them hard, every day.  I get great value on them.   My most expensive per wear items are the gowns I got for my daughters' weddings. One wear for an expensive dress. Thankfully, my kids are all married, so no more fancy gowns for me.	episode_done:True
text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:While we can't say for certain: is it possible that the second experience is the correct one? A lot of men believe that they need a fully custom suit to fit well, but in actuality for most body types the patterns are rather close. If an OTR size with alterations would look great, paying for MTM is a waste of money. I've done MTM suits and bought OTR suits and have generally found that getting OTR with alterations is a faster way to a well fitting suit than the low to mid level MTM stuff we're talking about here. I've done Indochino MTM which was generally a mess and a tuxedo from Black Lapel which eventually worked out well, following one full remake and $100 of local alterations (that they paid for). My OTR blue line suits from SS fit great after alterations.
text:Yes, I even considered this. It is possible that all the fuss associate with a MTM may just create work and not contribute much to the overall fit. I'm kind of build weird though...rather "wide" with a 36 inch waist, but not pudgy at all. My legs and arms are really thin, so I look like I am completely swimming in most OTR jacket sleeves and trousers. My SS OTR trousers I have do fit well, but not as well as the perfectly tapered MTM ones.  I failed to mention that I own an OTR SS Sienna as well, which I bought online and had altered. The MTM one fits much better, but it's mostly sleeves, shoulders and trousers....so basically all of it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:Not white, not red and depending on area, not black. White and red are the bride's colors (culturally dependent). If the bride wears white, red can be considered attention grabbing. If the bride wears red, her culture probably views white as a mourning color. Black can be seen as an objection to the wedding and mourning - very regional.   Something conservative enough for church weddings. Knee length, covers shoulders? Shoulder covering can be fixed with a cardigan.   Something light for a hot outdoor wedding.   In my area, most weddings are cocktail or semi formal aka short dresses are fine. Formal would imply floor length gown, so if the store has a good one, that you like, and you think someone seems more likely to go full formal, that might be a good call.   If you have seasons, then one for each season. Think about the weather in your general area. How cold or hot does it get?
text:> not red  Christ, yes. One of my old college buddies who I haven't been close to in like a decade wore a bright red dress to my wedding. The photographer took a million photos of her, to the exclusion of older family members I'd have rather had photos of. Part of that's on the photographer, of course, but it wouldn't have happened if she hadn't worn BRIGHT RED.	labels:	episode_done:True

Usually manufactured in an operating room. Bella Hadid has purchased herself a pair if you want to see an example.

text:Why Ralph Lauren Never Goes Out of Style	labels:RL is and was an absolute visionary at creating a lifestyle brand that is instantly American. It never shies away from the idealized Americana that Ralph cultivated either, which is why I think most of the vintage pieces are still relevant even in 2020.   The recent documentary about RL was a fantastic look into his philosophy of style.   And Double RL...man those are some of my dream pieces right there. I was recently at the RRL store in Malibu and it was an unreal retail experience.	episode_done:True
text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:Glad it's not just me.

I wish I had it together enough to have an official aesthetic. Maybe some day.	episode_done:True

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:I was a teen in the early 2000s. I remember a time of layering an impossible number of different-length camis  under a polo shirt. Also...boleros and shrugs...so many shrugs.
text:From 2000-2006ish, my upper body was most often clad in a tight cropped jacket, over a tight zip up hoodie, over a tight short sleeve graphic tee (from Theadless, of course), over a tight long sleeve tee, and yet somehow I still managed to expose buttcrack for the world to see.  Good times!	labels:I really dont know how or why we layered so much!! Lols on the buttcrack !!

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:My first husband gifted me a vintage Bottega Veneta clutch purse I'd been eyeing at a shop but never could make up my mind if I should buy it or not - it was WAY overpriced for a used BV. It was supposed  to a make-up gift after a huge fight right we had before I caught him secretly spending our money on nonsense, mostly tech gadgets. Shopping addiction isn't for ladies only!  Anyway, I ditched the guy but kept the purse. After 17 years, I still find ways to use it. The first purse I got for myself? You bet it was a Bottega!

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I'm pretty tall with long legs so the proportions might be different for you, but I wear a lot of ankle booties with skirts/dresses that are right at or above the knee. No idea if it looks proportional, but I also don't overly care. They're all with pretty low heels.  As for tights, I end up rolling the waist down so they sit right under my hip bone, they don't constrict me near so much. But thicker ones in a more legging material would probably work better?

An alternative I've found useful and maybe useful for others.. rather than wearing a sweater over your shirt.  wear one of those uniqlo heat tech under shirts under your shirt.  they have 3 levels of warmth and can get pretty warm. they are also cheap.

text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:Im a fat person, so for an incredibly long time i wanted nothing to do with fashion, I figured it wasn't meant for me, I just wore mens clothes or the biggest sizes from the thrrift stores.   When i got my job 2yrs ago, one of my friends told me abt stores that cater specifically to fat people (namely AdditionElle but theyre closed now) and it was revolutionary!!! I started buying clothes left and right, bulking up my wardrobe which had only seen used items before.   Ive always had a kind of alternative, grunge style, and i think i still do, but now I can do it and still look cute, I feel amazing in everything I wear, I have a beautiful motorcycle jacket with all the zippers and snaps.   Once I found a place I could buy clothes, I started a fatshion blog on tumblr (@fine-ass-fatshion for anyone on tumblr) and the community changed me.   Now im here and fashionable to stay

text:Ordered from Shoe The Bear (rant, experience in post)	labels: On Cyber Monday 2018, I bought a pair of Suede Chelsea boots from Shoe The Bear and they're one of my favorite pairs of kicks. Fit was awesome, quality was amazing for what I paid (~$70). I've worn these boots 100+ time and still holding up great.  Fast forward to this past Cyber Monday. I wanted a pair of cognac/brown colored Chelseas from Shoe The Bear. They arrived within a few days fron Portugal. I was so excited to open the box....and they are completely the wrong color.  They're so far from the correct color, customer service is claiming that I treated the leather myself and they don't carry boots in this color.  To say this experience is bizarre is an understatement - No, I did not treat the leather. I took the picture within minutes of opening the package because I couldn't believe what I received. I'm going to try and return them but now they're claiming I treated the leather so who knows what will happen.

text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:So many textures make me cringe. Polyester, satin, chiffon, wool, nylon, linen, lace, and metallic textures are out. I also hate acrylic.   Fit-wise, I don't do thin drapey things, rigid waists, low or mid rise, tight arms or neck, or scratchy waistbands on dresses.   So, sturdy cotton knits, denim, cotton sweaters, and flannels make up most of my closet. I like t-shirts, jeans, leggings, sweaters and swing dresses. A mix of colors, graphics, and patterns keep things interesting!   In a quest to expand my horizons, I recently thrifted a cashmere sweater and cotton corduroy pants. I want to try something in silk as well, just waiting for the right piece.
text:Tight neck is a no-go for me too! Hard pass on turtlenecks.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:I know that legitimate IG shops exist. But for me personally, any IG shop I've "discovered" has clearly been either a scam or uses drop-shipping. I simply refuse to shop on IG all together.  I really recommend thrifting and organizing clothing swaps with friends (if/when safe, of course!) and/or using online alternatives like Poshmark, as someone else suggested.	episode_done:True
text:advice on how to stop buying clothes I don't need?	labels:This is definitely not the normal way of doing things, but I've decided if I really want a cute fashion piece I can make it myself. Sewing is one of my favorite things to do, so it really makes me think about what is coming into my wardrobe as I will need to spend hours and hours looking at it while I'm making it.  For things I can't make myself (heavy duty coats, athletic clothes) I buy second hand. Really the only things I buy new now are underwear/socks/tank tops.	episode_done:True
text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:I second every comment suggesting tights!   I live in Montana and have put up with many frigid winters without having to sacrifice my love for long skirts and flower-child dresses.

I always kept flats and a makeup baggie for my socks in my desk for when I didnt want to be in boots all day.	episode_done:True

That gear is expensive so its what I have in my closet (like a lot of younger people, I prefer quality over quantity). Its more of functionality, convenience, and comfort than fashion.

Taught me how to take care of my wavy hair. I started getting bad acne at 12 years old, besides a dermatologist she took me to Ulta for a mineral makeup consultation so I could learn how to cover it (I was being bullied at the time).

text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:I'm loving the colors this year!

text:The last look has lots of dizzying prints, holey and paint splattered jeans, and a messy updo/bun. Paintbrush or chalk or pencil tucked behind ear optional. Big, big thin frame glasses.	labels:It actually a bra I knit layered under a shirt I knit worn with a skirt I bought specifically to go with the shirt and no other reason.	episode_done:True
text:My 2020 Clothing Challenge	labels:I agree with the other comment about adding a belt to the red dress. Maybe to both dresses even. Simple belt or even a scarf as a belt for a different look.	episode_done:True
text:Store closings at malls	labels:Kind of related but not really, but oh well. A friend of mine got into a bad car accident and I decided to order some Sol de Janiero stuff from her at Sephora. I pre-ordered it for curbside pickup so I wouldn't have to go inside the mall (the Sephora entrance is outside), but when I got there Sephora was the only store with their outdoor entrance closed and I had to go inside the mall to pick it up. Just a rant, I really didn't want to go inside! It was weird to even drive into the mall since I haven't really been anywhere in the past year.	episode_done:True
text:What's your favorite kind of novelty clothing?	labels:silly earrings! my favorite are a pair of tacky wooden cats wearing sunglasses in vibrant '90s colors. thrifted, ofc. they're like 4 inches long, super lightweight, ridiculous, and wonderful. they get many compliments.
text:4 inches is 10.16 cm	labels:	episode_done:True
text:what do yall wear to the gym (or at home if you work out there)	labels:The only gym I go to is the climbing one, usually wear climbing specific pants and a vest top, with a hoodie.  Climbing Pants:- Moon Climbing Vest Top:- Black Diamond // Moon Climbing // Vans Hoodie:- Element // Converse // AllSaints

text:Celebrating the Basic Grey Sweatpants	labels:I know they're expensive but I'd like to throw out that Noah sweatpants are really great sweatpants. I own two, snagged them off Grailed for like ~$70 a piece, I've been wearing them weekly for like two years now.  I almost hate when it gets hotter because I can't wear them because they're so comfortable. I'm even wearing them right now.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 27	labels:How is a jacket supposed to fit?  I wear large t-shirts and xl hoodies. I bought an XL jacket as well since my xxl jackets are too big.  This XL jacket is a bit tight. I can close the front but it really sticks to my body. I am wondering if it's too small? It's a leather jacket and it's expensive.  If I buy xxl like usual they look too big and I look like a balloon in them
text:Do you have pics? Sounds too small, but it's hard for us to say.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Kibbe System and Body Inclusivity	labels:I have negative associations with it because 99% of the time "red pill women" (or other women with deep issues) are the ones saying good things about it.  When I hear "Kibbe" I immediately think "red pill".
text:I think I dislike Kibbe because it is so popular in the red pill community. I think the first time I even heard about it in this sub I clicked on a couple of users profiles and they were posting in red pill communities so that confirmed whatever preconceived notions I had about it	labels:Hahahaha I think I know exactly what comment you're talking about. I've noticed that association too its quite odd.	episode_done:True

text:Yearly Aesthetic Goal Setting	labels:I have never seen this done before, but think it is a fascinating way of doing things, and one that I'm keen to try.   I live in a place with a lot of seasons, so wondering if maybe two different ones will work best for that? I don't want to be "restricting" myself now for 2021 summer. How do you manage that..?  Over the past few weeks, I've gotten a bit bored with my clothes and what I was wearing (hello lockdown fatigue). So I've gone through my closet, honing in on what I like, dumping what I don't (to charity shops), selling items of value and considering what I want or need to fill the gaps in my wardrobe. It's a fun process, and I honestly think this came at exactly the right time for me to undertake the exercise. Thanks for sharing!
text:I do not live in a place with many seasons, so I can't speak from any real experience here, but I would personally still maintain one yearly board with a variety of seasonal clothes. I would also think about what my plans or goals are for that season (i.e. travel plans, important holidays or birthdays, starting school, new job, etc.) and then arrange the board so that it flows seasonally like the actual year.   In regards to feeling restricted, I think of it more as "focused". For my personality, adding limits and focused restraint is a good idea. For you, it may not be. I am still open to the idea that 2021 may look completely different. After all, my 2020 board did not feature any sweatpants but you better believe that has been my most worn clothing this year!	labels:I think that's a really good approach, thanks for the response. It has definitely given me a lot of food for thought.	episode_done:True

I don't mean boots in the sense of doc martens and more in the sense of tan/brown/green combat boots I guess. I only ever see them styled in very streetwear-esque types of outfits and I was wondering if that was just the limit to their stylability or if people just haven't thought outside the box with them.	episode_done:True
text:Favorite Lingerie Brands?	labels:I love blush lingerie out of montreal
text:I'm sad that I'm just out of their size range. I bought a couple of their bras before I knew my proper measurement. Beautiful quality, fast shipping, and they have really great sales.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:All the time. I have a smaller waist and big hips and a butt and thighs and am never going to look great in tailored pants or straight skirts. I will never be able to do French Girl Chic and I have to be really careful with those floaty looks you like because I can easily go Earth Mother when I don't really want that.  For what it's worth your "model off duty" in reality is probably wearing jeans and a tee and flats or flat boots.    You might want to make a pinterest board and then consider how a garment that you like could be incorporated with the rest of your clothing. A pair of skinny jeans and a floaty romantic top short or long can be very cute.
text:I'm a skinny French girl and I'm not able to wear the French girl chic because it's a white rich fantasy Dior thing. It just doesn't exist for the non-french Gainsbourg people.	labels:I always thought it was a made up thing.  But it was very popular as an idea here in the USA a few years ago.  It's nice to know that it is definitely a fantasy.
text:It really is, we even have a Book about it which is entitled "je ne suis pas parisienne". It explains that this fantasy is not allowed for poor, non white, non cis, non skinny, non upper class, non hetero....   Jeanne damas is a lie and is way more popular out of France than in france, because French girl think this parisian joke is really rudiculous. "Hello this is me without make-up (LIE!) just getting out of bed with my baguette !"	labels:Thank you very much, the end of your post made me laugh even though the beginning is very sad.  While I assume most people, no matter what their color or sexual preferences or weight can't afford Dior it saddens me that anyone would believe they do not have a right to wear it or something in the style of Dior that they can afford.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 27, 2020	labels:Measured Foot Size vs Shoe Sizing  I had my foot measured and saved in volumental a few years ago. It said I had 9.7 left and 9.4 right and D width and the salesperson told me to size one up for a size 10.5 Brooks. Since then I only got 10.5 Brooks for running and now I want to try the New Balance 990v5. Should I also size 1 whole up to 10.5 instead of 10?

Now I'm just sad my planned May Italian vacation was scuttled.

So, when I buy 2XL shirts (which fit my tummy) they are often too big for my chest. I have also very recently begun to wear crop tops, and I am loving it!	episode_done:True

text:Marine layer does have great quality basics but the company is racist. I helped open up a store with them then got fired when the ceo came to check out the store and saw me, a poc person was working there. Really f-ed up.	labels:Oh my god?? Thank you for letting me know! I'm so sorry you experienced that!
text:Yeah it was really sad honestly, I really loved the store and formed such an attachment because I helped build it from the ground up and then to have some dude come in and take one look at me and not even speak to me and have someone else fire me was pretty fucked up. Definitely moved past it at this point, but I do miss the soft shirts!	labels:The shirts are so soft! But I'll just try to find them second hand now because fuck that.	episode_done:True

text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process? What would you prioritize?	labels:I'd buy my basics. I'm a creature of habit and comfort. I wear variations of the same thing every day.  I like a good maxi or midi dress. It's easy, comfortable and can be dressed up or down based on accessories.   So based on that I'd buy a good quality slightly oversized denim jacket, a leather jacket probably from Decjuba and a Max Mara coat. One pair of Ribcage Straight Levis. Then, however many Rixo and Bec & Bridge dresses I could afford during sales season.	episode_done:True
text:Formula for a put together outfit that works for most aesthetics	labels:"If your hair has a lot of personality" comes off uhm. Quite interestingly. You might want to specify what you mean - does curly hair have "a lot of personality"? Bright ginger hair? Natural afro? Just a suggestion to think about the assumptions you're making when you picture a put together look.
text:I took this to mean dramatic cuts with strong lines, styles like an effortful updo, or brightly dyed colors outside the spectrum of naturally occurring hair pigmentation (blues, purples, pinks, greens). For me, none of the examples you listed would count for extra points because they're all attributes I see all the time in my daily comings and goings (well not lately since I don't leave my house anymore, but in the before times...), and nothing about them particularly draws my eye. Like, an asymmetrical lime green bob catches my eye whereas most hair really doesn't.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do men's outerwear differ from women's? I found a really good deal on a 100% wool coat, but in men's...	labels:It'll be fine wearing it open, but it'll be tight around the bust and hips if it's closed.    Plus there might be more shoulder padding to give you an exaggerated V shape. Fine if you're intentionally going for an androgynous look, just don't expect it to look/fit like a women's coat.
text:yeah I thought the shoulders looked kinda exaggerated, but wasn't exactly sure... oof def not into the should pad look	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Why Ralph Lauren Never Goes Out of Style	labels:Ralph Lauren never goes out of style, but it also goes out of style all the time.  It's a massive brand with many sub-brands, some of which are absolutely terrible. Each year, about half the Polo collection is bad.  Yeah, with the amount of pieces they dish out, they're doing things right and a lot of it stays alive and keeps working decades down the road. There are also MANY regrettable items.  (BTW I'm wearing 2 RRL items right now. I don't hate on the brand, I just think flattering comments regarding the staying power are to be put in perspective)
text:The abundance of sub-brands is really confusing and annoying. There's the shitty Kohl's tier Chaps and Lauren Ralph Lauren brands all the way up to Purple Label and RRL, and what seems like another dozen or two in-between. I don't understand why it was thought to be a good idea to create so many damn lines.  Shit, there's literally three sub-brands with the word polo in the title. Which then creates a situation where a garbage brand like U.S. Polo Assn can leech off your sales by making people assume they're another RL sub-brand and result in you having to spend untold amounts of money suing them over it.	labels:Purple label, PRL,  LRL  with RRL as a niche offshoot.   High end, mainline and diffusion.   Chaps was sold to Kolhs and has no  relation to RL at this point.   What are the 3 other sub-brands ?
text:PRL, Polo Sport, and Polo Golf. On second look, it seems Sport doesn't really exist anymore and Golf got replaced with RLX.	labels:There also was rugby which was big for a while.

text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers. Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:Because I wasn't able to find Old Faithful peacoat this year (how do you lose a coat??) I ended up buying a long black coat with a structured collar from Old Navy. Holy geez, I love the length and I wear it all the time. Never going back to a short coat, and now I'm on the hunt for a higher quality long, double-breasted wool coat.
text:I lost a coat this winter (summer? 90% sure I saw it at the beginning of the fall) too! I've looked in all my cars / closets / hidey-holes and it just hasn't turned up. It was an old faithful arc teryx  atom that could easily be packed in a purse. I'm so bummed but still hoping it might pop out somewhere.	labels:My down coat was in my boyfriend's trunk from a fall fire pit hangout. Finally found it last week! I had also forgotten I rearranged stuff when I moved and had a whole bin of winter gear tucked in the basement. Did you do any covid cleaning that might have moved it?	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Fashion AITA	labels:AITA for not wearing a purse to the mall in 2009?? Back in 2009, when malls were still relevant, I was perusing a newly opened Madewell so that everyone nearby would know that I was *hip* and *cool* and *trendy.* An older woman approached me and asked for help finding something, I told her I was sorry and I that didn't work there. She responded by giving me a dirty look and telling me "Well you should be carrying a purse then! Only someone at work *wouldn't* be carrying a purse!" At first I thought I was in the right, I didn't do anything wrong after all, but the more I think about it, how dare I? If I saw a woman at the mall or shops without a purse I would've probably assumed that they were an uneducated heathen- not simply a worker. So maybe I got off easy? AITA?

Each time I found one I thought it was cute until I checked the tag and immediately put it back on the rack. Cuteness isn't worth the shame / embarrassment I'd feel knowing someone might recognize it while I'm wearing it!
text:I have a dress and shirt from this brand that I absolutely love. I removed the tag and if anyone ever asks "it's Calvin Klein but I bought it so many years ago, sorry"  No harm done - it's not like they could find the exact item in stores anymore even if I did confess the real brand.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 03, 2020	labels:Looking for some designer sunglasses, what are some brands that are worth the money? Mainly looking at Tom Fords right now but what are your thoughts?
text:They're all made by basically the same company. To be frank, sunglasses have probably the worst cost to quality ratio. No fashion designer has ever thought about crafting sunglasses, they just send vague brand ethos to Luxotica and they pump out something. This is meant to be encouraging, don't overthink it and just buy what excites you because "worth the money" isn't a valid statement for designer sunglasses.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:I feel you - I am 5'1 with wide shoulders, a huge ribcage, and a small chest. RARELY does something fit me off the rack. Try finding a good tailor in your area, or better yet, one who can make custom clothing to fit your body type (though that can get pricy - but for basic staple items can be worth it). It helped me a bit stress wise because now I can buy something off the rack  - even if its too big I know I can always rely on my tailor to hem something or take in specific parts where I am lacking! Hope this helps!	episode_done:True
text:Let's talk about sleepwear-- what are your favorite pjs?	labels:Just bought my first non old tshirt or 8 year old fraying flannel pants pajamas from Lunya since their whole vibe is in line with my "buy a nicer version of what you already like" approach to fashion. In this case silk tank and shorts, I like that there's no embellishment.

What are your shoe essentials?	labels:Spent most of my adult life with 1 pair of trainers, trainers, 1 pair of Docs, and a pair of black flats but I got a job that pays less than poverty wages a few years ago and bought some more.   Currently:  2 pairs of Docs (ankle/combat style), 1 pair brown AllSaints combat boots, 1 pair of Docs (knee high riding style),  silver trainers, black converse low tops, adidas shell toes black/blue, 1 pair otk faux suede heeled boots, 1 pair holo blue statement heel, 1 pair chunky black flat sandals.   And for work:    2 pairs Teva-knockoffs, 1 pair trail running shoes, 2 pairs hiking boots, 1 pair green wellies, 1 pair purple short wellies.    I hope to buy a less chunky riding boot, a flashy pair of wedges, black wedges Chelsea boots and some different coloured chunky sandals when I get more work.  Turns out I actually like shoes, even if I used to hate shoe shopping because all the good shoes were expensive or always out of stock in my size* *worked in a shoe shop later and discovered it was because there is only one pair in my size in each box.	episode_done:True

text:What age do you think you're too old to follow teenage-type style trends (ie e-girl style etc)? Or are you ever, why/why not?	labels:Eh, your style will mature itself as your interests shift.          Either that, or like me, you start to realize you need/prefer clothing that has more support. Trends geared towards a younger demographic can get away with flimsier material.	episode_done:True
text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:Brown, knee length boots, that fit my long legs and thick ankles. I found one pair, once, and wore them almost everyday for 2 years until I wore holes in the soles. I should have weatherized those bad boys.  It has been 3 years, and I have not found a suitable replacement.   Since the issue is that I can't quite get the boot on, sales people often suggest I special order the wide calf. However, since I am sooooo close, or can fit more relaxed/slouchy styles, I really don't want to make a nonrefundable special order without making sure my relatively "normal" upper calf doesn't look ridiculous.   I once ordered custom boots, but they were supposed to take 6 weeks and I canceled the order after week 14. Given how hard it was to get my money back, I'm now terrified of dropping that kind of dough again.	episode_done:True
text:Have your clothing purchases dramatically dropped now that we can't go anywhere?	labels:I've been looking to fashion as a form of escapism during this time, plus I have way more disposable income since I'm not spending it on going out to bars/restaurants like I used to, so no--been buying much more. But, I've wanted to revamp my wardrobe into something less "quiet" for a long time, and this has felt like the perfect opportunity to prioritize that since I don't have much else going on. Biggest caveat is I'm trying to avoid pieces that will likely be horribly out of style in a year or so, since that's when I'll likely be able to actually wear most of it out in the world.   Honestly I'm pretty pleased with my progress so far and I have no regrets!

I know I complain about it slot, but my feet are small and wide. Whenever I got to thrift store I find some shoes I can.visually but never physically.	episode_done:True
text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:I'm in the same boat, but my willingness to have things dry cleaned or hand wash cashmere/delicate wool items has vanished now that I WFH.

text:I wash wool in the machine all the time. Just use the delicate/bulky option, cool water, and air dry it.  Its not my wool as I'm allergic, but my fiance hasn't had any complaints about anything. I've done it with my moms cashmere sweaters as well and she reported no ill effects.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:advice on how to stop buying clothes I don't need?	labels:I've been watching YouTube videos of fashionistas showing their latest purchases, trying the new thing on with other things, sewing their own clothes, purging their closets, etc. It's like vicarious fashion. Right now I don't have the money or anyplace to wear new clothes (or old ones), so it's nice to watch others shop and spend that money and get the thrill of something new. Then I watch them trying to make the decision to let go of things that don't work for them, but often, even when it's obvious, they have a hard time letting go and that clutter just goes back in their closet. Which reminds me I have a lot of clutter in my closet that needs to go.	episode_done:True
text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:Well, I'm starting to shift in the way of Dark Academia (although, I didn't know it had a name until way after I fell in love with it), but I don't think each personal style needs a specific label bc if they all had one . . . that would be way too many to keep up with, so just do you, boo boo. When it comes to fashion, do what makes you happy . . . not what you think you should do.	episode_done:True
text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:This comes up here a lot, but many of the outdoors brands have turned into mostly fashion brands, and the quality has dropped as a result. The North Face, with the exception of a few of their collections (e.g. Summit); Columbia, and Mountain Hardware which they bought; and Marmot are some of the more famous examples.  Patagonia, Arc'teryx, Outdoor Reaearch, Fjallraven, and Kuhl are currently good alternatives, but I like to check the ultralight / camping subreddits for the most up to date info.	episode_done:True
text:Recommendation for Seamstress/similar	labels:I would suggest taking your ideas and designs to your local self-employed seamstress. It means you don't have to worry about poor working conditions and you'll be supporting local business!	episode_done:True
text:Brands that are actually great that you discovered on Instagram?	labels:Lo & Sons bags: I have a backpack(Hanover 2), weekender tote (Catalina Deluxe Tote), purse (the Pearl in saffino leather), and wallet. Love them all. Good construction, attractive design, and functional interiors. They have good sales pretty often too.   I wanted another Pearl in the softer leather (safino is built to water and stain resistant), but I literally only wear one bag full time for years until it gives out. I have several other purses in a box under my bed but they get used once a year, if that.
text:I have the Pearl in saffiano in two different colors. I bought the first 3-4 years ago, and it still looks new. I love the pockets, versatility, and size. Probably the only two bags I will use this decade.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting our 'Finding A Style and Building A Wardrobe' guide	labels:I know it's supposed to be a general guide and COVID won't be around forever, but maybe a note about services that let you try on clothes at home before you buy would be good. That's also a good idea for people who don't live near a mall or have a variety of stores to visit in person.
text:Do you have any services you'd recommend?	labels:Like the other person said prime wardrobe is one that comes to mind. There are a few subscription boxes too like Stitch Fix, Nordstrom trunk club, and Thredup goody boxes, though you can't just pick what you want in those
text:A friend of mine was doing the Nordstrom one for awhile. She made it sound like she had a personal stylist selecting items based on her preferences and over time her boxes gradually changed to be more to her taste, but maybe I misunderstood.	labels:That's been my experience with Stitch Fix. You take the initial quiz and they send you some items, then you give feedback on each box and what they send changes slightly based on that and what you keep. I don't know if it's a person assigned to you or an algorithm of some kind though.	episode_done:True
text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:I'm 26 and I love vintage styles, so I definitely don't mind wearing "dated" clothing.
text:Maybe this is part of the answer - on young women, vintage clothes look like a deliberate fashion choice, but someone might think an older women wearing the same has just not updated their style lately. I don't ascribe to this, btw, but I could see someone who doesn't know much about trends cutting a lot more slack for retro vibes from younger people vs older people.	labels:Yes, this.   Also, age/perceived age/phase of life is a privilege, along with being attractive, having clear skin, nice hair, etc. It affords you the ability to play with stylistic choices without looking sloppy or unintentional.   Once you start to lose these privileges, or if you never had them to begin with, you have to try harder to look well styled. Maybe that means adding more accessories, dyeing your hair, getting your nails done weekly, wearing tailored clothing rather than RTW, etc.   It takes more energy to look put together, and that combined with having the same amount or less energy than before (because age/life/circumstances), makes looking on-trend a lesser priority.   I say this as a 6-month pregnant 34 year old who has loved clothes her entire life and is currently living in primarily leggings and sweaters. I will always love clothes and fashion, but I will likely continue on this trend on caring less and less about what everyone else is wearing, unless I find it personally inspiring.	episode_done:True
text:Spring/Summer trends: Dresses	labels:I find these cut-outs hideous and the tent-like dresses even worse. I vowed to only follow my style for dresses and not the trends. I want nice knee-length a-line/rather 50s dresses. And I want clear colors, aqua and mint and reds and not 50 shades of greige   Sorry for my rant but I missed a whole summer due to corona and want to go all in this year and feel my best.
text:I miss A lines and fit and flare dresses!!   I actually started sewing during lockdown so I could make A line dresses to wear to work. Been fun!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are some stores/brands that have surprised you?	labels:Some weeks ago I thrifted a maxi dress from the brand Holy Clothing and this dress is the most comfortable I've ever worn. I never heard of this brand before, so I went looking them up and I was pretty surprised finding out that they are an ethical brand.  I'm currently saving a bit to buy more of this dresses and some pants.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 22, 2020	labels:How much do you feel you've saved or spent compared to last year when it comes to clothing purchases?   Ex: last year I was able to maintain my weight. I didnt buy much but I did spend on more unique things (because I felt they would fit me for a long time). Pandemic happened, put on 30lbs and none of it fits me any more so I had to go out and buy like 2 pairs of pants and a warm jacket. Less places to go out to and income is less predictable so saving has been more important than clothes. I probably spent $400 less on clothes this year.
text:I've bought more on luxeswap / eBay. I was thinking of buying a suit, but I never did. I haven't gotten new dress shoes or made any expensive outerwear purchases either. So... I've definitely saved this year.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:Where I live is aggressively casual, so I may have framed cutting my hair & keeping it short and not wearing makeup as my concession to being casual...despite the fact I'd do both regardless.  Other than that, practical shoes, and the occasional casual outerwear piece, I've accepted that I'll always get the whole"Why are you so dressed up?"	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:Honestly, I just love the expression and creativity of it all. I don't follow trends much, but I love clothes. I was joking with my husband just earlier today that he should use some of his new work bonus to get me something new, and he was like, "You already have enough clothes" and to me "too much clothes" - that just doesn't exist, lol.      I have a chronic illness now so some days I just don't have it in me to even get dressed, tbh. But when I do, I often feel like I'm not just getting dressed for the day, I'm putting together a creation that reflects my inner self to the outer world. It's like an artistic thing.	episode_done:True
text:How would you style or rebuild your wardrobe around your holy grail fashion piece?	labels:Comfy, smart black ankle boots that fit me perfectly and which do not kill my feet after couple hours of walking. How would I style them? With everything that I currently own in my basic wardrobe set and its winter add-ons!  Edit: Wow, this blew up and I completely didn't see that coming! Thank you all for great recommendations!  Funnily enough earlier that day I ordered a pair of really lovely Clarks ankle boots,so we will see if they fit and do the job! But I am totally jotting down your recommendations for the future search! Big thanks!

text:Beige, tan, burgundy, white, yellow would all compliment.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your tips for being stylish when your weight fluctuates like crazy?	labels:I think dressing on the heavier side looks more stylish with some well coordinated splashes of colour and striking bold patterns. Otherwise a heavier silhouette will tend to look like a dull, monochrome blob. Dressing thin obviously would be more forgiving. You could wear the plainest, most boring clothes and still get compliments on your outfit.	episode_done:True

He's 22 and very into video gaming with his friends (who mainly live in other states) and he's dungeon master of his D&D group. Last year I got him a "dragonskin" D&D journal and fancy metal dice.   He's also planning a trip to London once COVID is over. That'll be his first international trip! Maybe a cool gadget? A passport holder?
text:They just came out with a D&D cookbook that's actually pretty legit. I got it for my brother expecting it to be inedible gamer food recipes like chicken tenders crusted with cheetos or something, but its really well done and the food looks delicious. If your brother has any interest in cooking at all he might like it, too.	labels:Omg I am 100% buying this. Thank you!

text:I guess I'm weird or something but I went no-poo for my hair and beard years ago and it's been the best thing ever. I get gnarly even after only a couple of days without showering but that's never really an issue for me.  I tried oils and stuff but if I use them more than like 2 days in a row I start to break out so now I only use beard oil after I trim as part of a little regimen I have so that I don't bother my SO's sensitive skin with newly sharpened bread hair ends.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you care for your expensive/fragile pieces?	labels:Hang drying pants upside down allows the weight of the waistband to pull out wrinkles as the pants dry. It is basically magic. Just match up the pant leg openings using the inseam to align them in the pants hanger clips.    Edited for clarity	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:\> outfits they are posting oftentimes *do not* look good without heels, especially for people that are short like themselves! Midi skirts that hit at an awkward spot, long billowy trousers, etc.     I think this only applies if you subscribe to the mindset that your body has to look a certain way or  clothes can only look good on certain proportions.	episode_done:True
text:Which color palette do you hate wearing?	labels:I refuse to wear white, pastels, or light colors in general. They wash me out and make me look ill. And even if I did like that color palette, I'd dump coffee on them and then be upset.  Even during the summer, all of my clothes are dark colors, because that's what I enjoy wearing. And it's nice not to have to separate colors for laundry.	episode_done:True

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:Personally I would be fine with it for me as long as there's not a prominent logo of the brand on the piece.  (I hate "logo" or "branded" clothes, anyways, bc I think they look junky, but that's just my personal opinion - I've been known to cut little logo tags off even brands I like and support, like Patagonia, just because I don't like wearing branded stuff - but I'm weird that way!).  You could even cut their brand name out of the tag on the inside if you really don't like the brand or what it stands for, but they don't make money off you buying it secondhand.  And if someone asks, just say it's something you got secondhand and you don't know the brand so that you're not directing customers their way.  Maybe something like Poshmark indirectly supports the brand (upping it's resale value?  I'm not sure about this...), but if you bought it somewhere like Goodwill or a thrift store, I don't think there's any way it would affect the brand or even its resale value.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:my body is (from what it sounds) extremely similar to yours. my personal wardrobe is consistent of mostly tight and form-fitting shirts, sweaters and long sleeves shirts. i try to limit baggy shirts (not during quarantine cuz i wear hoodies every day LOL) just because they dont look very good. on the other hand, i wear baggier pants. either wide maxi skirts, mom jeans or loose shorts are my personal favourite. wearing patterns or something eyecatching is usually preferred with shirts as opposed to pants for me, personally.	episode_done:True

text:What are some stores/brands that have surprised you?	labels:Kirkland and Costco in general. I lost weight right at the beginning of the pandemic when fitting rooms were being closed and the only place I go outside of my house is costco to get groceries so I've started getting clothes there too. Prices are good, quality is good, and the return policy is amazing. I've been surprised with the quality of Kirkland brand leggings and tops and I've been able to restock my wardrobe with coats, basics, and work from home outfits (mostly leggings!) for very cheap. Recently got a plush, warm, long robe for only $9! And there are good online deals pretty regularly as well. They also have lower prices on designer clothing/purses/perfumes/make-up.
text:I love their sweatshirts. Some stylish ones too! I  love the Tuff leggings there.   The 32 degree base layers there I think are better than uniqulo that gets touted here a lot.	labels:I love the 32 degree base layers! Lightweight and affordable. The best part for me is coming in from the snow and taking off several layers and then just wearing the 32 degree leggings and long sleeve shirt inside for the rest of the day. I recently saw they have body suits now and I am hoping to see them in store.
text:Try Uniqlo heat tech. It better than the 32 degree lasts longer too!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:I highly recommend Blondo for classic waterproof leather/suede boots and booties.  I have 2 pairs that have held up beautifully through the rain.  The shoe salesman at Nordstrom told me they are a perennial bestseller in the PNW.  As a bonus they are comfortable and reasonably priced.
text:Defintiely Blondo, I work in engineering/construction and needed a shoe that I can wear in the office but not worry about in the field, a Nordstrom stylist brought be taupe blondo booties and they have held up beautifully over the past three years (I do no maintenance on my shoes, heathen, I know)	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Discussion: what does your shopping process look like?	labels:I have about 10 tabs open for products that I want and periodically check back on them and close a few that I've realized I don't actually want when I start getting too many to manage (15+)  After a few months I might buy one or two items from the list, but mostly it's just a never-ending rotating list of tabs.   Actual purchases usually wind up being impulse buys when I find a sale or discount, whether the item was something on my "list" or not.	episode_done:True

I keep getting ads for them and I like a few things but I'm hesitant because of all the polyester I see	labels:I've made 2 purchases from upwest and I only have good things to say. The first was a corduroy puffer jacket that I love and is so warm. The second purchase was a men's sweater and sherpa pullover. They feel very nice, look good, and the sherpa is SO plush.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 19, 2020	labels:I hope this is OK but I am looking for a present for my husband.  I know this is a long shot.  He has this one shirt that I really like on him.  It is casual.  Made out of t shirt material.  It buttons at the neck with 4 metal buttons.  It doesn't have a collar.  The seams are visible in a darker color than the shirt.  His is olive drab in color and very soft.  It looks like a shirt you would see worn by a old time soldier or adventurer.  I can't figure out what the style is called.  I have tried googling everything I can think of but I can't find something similar and it isn't a name brand shirt.  I would really like to find a couple more for him since one of his gifts cost less than I budgeted for but does anyone have an idea what the style is called?

text:Alexander Wang accused of a history of sexual harassment - fashion in a year of reckoning?	labels:We have the same issue in the architecture & design industry. The whole industry is run by people that are glorified and hero-worshipped, and others are supposed to sacrifice their health and life  under them, in exchange for being a part of the "glorious brand". Very few people that rise to the top are able to turn down money for ethical reasons- on the contrary, you are downright rewarded for ignoring ethics. The whole Neri Oxman/MIT/Jeffrey Epstein funding situation comes to mind.
text:I worked at an architecture firm once on contract and I have never been so grateful to have a contract end early in my fucking life. Worst place I've ever worked. Treated the female principals terribly. Super famous Canadian firm too. Fucking awful.	labels:It has sadly been my experience that the more well-known the firm, the more toxic the atmosphere.

text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:I'm planning to keep a couple of my favorite clothing items/accessories for my own sake and maybe offer then to my kid if they want them. But I dont plan to keep anything to intentionally hand down to them. But like, my favorite blue dress that I got from Target and wore when I got married, I plan to keep that forever. If my kids want it, and will wear it, great! If not, it'll sit in my closet for a long long time, and every time I look at it I think about my wedding day and my husband and get all teary eyed because I'm a sentimental dork.

text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:I buy a lot of my jewelry from amazon, actually. I've also dabbled in etsy jewelry a little bit (under $30 range). I know everyone has a different idea of "quality," but I've been extremely impressed with the quality I've received from both amazon and etsy. It is definitely a step up from the jewelry you could get at Target or even Madewell.  I look for gold-plated or gold vermeill (also gold plated but it is plated over silver instead of other metals) since my budget is pretty tight. I started by buying a few different sized gold hoops, plain gold layering chains , and a few rings. I occasionally wear silver but I already had quite a bit accumulated over the years and find myself reaching for gold more often these days. I hope to be able to invest in fine jewelry someday, but what I can find on amazon or etsy in my current price range checks all the boxes for me.

Quick note, I know someone who works in the jewelry business (works in a workshop that mass produces jewelry for retailors) and it was clearly stated that Tiffany's quality is relatively the same as others. Of course it looks nice due to the higher attention to details (polish/finish) but quality shouldn't be the determinant factor in the purchase from his opinion.
text:Given the price that makes sense - you're paying for the name, really. I did a bit more research and it seems like rhodium plating silver is more expensive than it's worth. The plating is expensive and needs to be renewed every few years but many jewelers won't rhodium plate silver because they would need to maintain a supply of material specifically for silver jewelry. If you find one who will it'll likely cost the same as the original price of the jewelry.  I did find a few comments from people who were pissed when they found out their jewelry was rhodium plated because of how expensive it would be to re-plate it.	labels:	episode_done:True

With the exception of this year, every race I've done came with (at least 1) t-shirt (which was the uniform for staffing candidates, events, etc).  After the campaigns are over, those t-shirts go into my PJ drawer.  They're paired with either boxer style sleep shorts (warm weather) or flannel PJ pants (cool weather).  I usually get those at places like Walmart or Target.

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:I spent like two months investing in a bunch of nice wool sweaters that I could wear through the winter, put them in a separate laundry bin after wearing so I could launder them myself, but my ex washed and dried them on high heat and they all shrunk so badly that I couldn't even fit them on my dog. About $1500 gone.
text:This is why I don't really let my husband run the laundry too often. He's an amazing human, I love him, and there is so much he is good at; but laundry ain't it. He puts everything all in the same load, all on Hot water, and all in the dryer for an hour. If I left him to do it with no supervision, everything would be ruined.	labels:Is there a reason y'all don't use separate laundry baskets? I do my laundry, he does his. We do own a washer and dryer so maybe this doesn't work as well if you're headed to a laundromat.

text:General Discussion - November 02	labels:i feel like my interest in fashion has been cyclical throughout my life, where i'll care about clothes for months, if not years, and then have to drop it for a while  anyway life is pretty tough atm so i think i'm dropping fashion / reddit for a bit. see you guys on the other side!
text:Thanks for taking us along this cycle, it's been a pleasure! I get that by "break" you probably just mean stopping active consumption of fashion as a hobby and just wearing shit, but unless you have a box of video game tees and ill-fitting loose jeans stashed somewhere to replace your current wide tees and well-fitting loose pants I don't know how you can *really* stop with your very fashionable wardrobe.   That's what I love about this stuff personally, I can't completely drop it like every other hobby I've had cause even if I stopped giving a shit I couldn't truly stop giving a shit with my wardrobe and cause everybody *has* to wear clothing.	labels:	episode_done:True

That's age indiscriminate really.	episode_done:True

text:What trousers do people wear these days?	labels:I wear comfy dress pants really frequently! Highly recommend	episode_done:True
text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:I don't know why people think they can't find 100% cotton and other natural fibers in fast fashion stores. Zara, H&M, sometimes Mango and others all carry these items.   I avoid polyester in a lot of item categories and have never had issues shopping at these stores. I don't find that there are differences in price or quality. In fact, the men's clothes are sometimes more expensive, because there's more fabric that goes into it.  I have plenty of cotton sweaters, they weren't more than $30. Sturdy 100% cotton jeans are super easy to find anywhere. Tons of 'basics' like t-shirts are cotton. In the summer, a lot of the stuff is cotton and linen - dresses, shorts, shirts, etc. All my winter coats are 50%-75% wool - all from fast fashion stores.   All this stuff also lasts for years, you just have to take care of it just like more expensive clothes and not treat it like shit just because it was cheap.
text:I agree. In many cases, the same basics for men exist for women alongside the hundreds of other options women get. Lots of women don't want 100% cotton because they want things to drape better than that or want thinner, slinkier fabrics or patterns that won't fade.   In some cases, prices may be different because of the construction. A man's t-shirt is often just a rectangle with sleeves while women's version might have a total different cut.   There's plenty of sexism in fashion, but women have way more options and cool styles than men. I think a lot of people here would prefer for society to expect them to dress in the same basic unchanging way men do. While I support anyone who wants to wear nothing but suits or jeans and T-shirts or whatever, I long for a day where men's fashion will be as varied and interesting as women's. The day I go to H&M and all I see are their basic lines instead of whatever leopard sequin off the shoulder top they whipped up that year will be a sad day for creative dressing.	labels:I completely agree and I'm super over this "anything men do or men have is automatically superior" attitude on FFA.   "Men don't wear purses and that's sooo much better!", "Men have baggy clothes and that's sooo much better!", "Men only go shopping once a year for a 10-pack of basic white boxers from a big box store and that's sooo much better!"  No one's stopping you from living like what you deem a man lives like, but it doesn't make it better in any way.   I like not having to carry all my belongings in my pockets and then have to sit on them or get poked in the thigh because society tells me bags are for girls and thus, stupid.   I like having variety in my clothes and not being forced to wear the same blue shirt every day because that's all they sell.   I like being able to choose different cuts and silhouettes and play with fabric drapes instead of being forced to wear the only acceptable straight-cut style of shirts and jeans in the same 3 acceptable colors.   Whoever thinks men's fashion/clothes are objectively "better" is mistaken.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 14, 2021	labels:I work in an office setting and I'm looking for a jacket that I can wear with a simple solid color cotton polo and slacks/khakis that is NOT a blazer and frankly I have no idea what websites I could look at or what kind of style/material I should even be looking for. Stores are pretty much out of the question because I don't have anything nice around where I live. I know this sounds silly, but it will mostly be for walking from the car to the building and occasionally out and about so if it worked with some dark denim jeans and boots that would be a plus. I appreciate everyone in advance!
text:A shawl cardigan would look great with all of those outfits and should be super comfortable, depending on your budget you could go for one in cotton (cheaper) or wool (more expensive but warmer).

text:Best and Worst Purchase of 2020	labels:Best purchase by far was an actual wool sweater from Aran Sweater market. Completely opened my eyes to how high quality materials matter and made me rethink how I view budgeting for clothes and my day to day outfit.   (Side note, because I had never had anything wool before I was *sure* people were lying when they said wool wouldn't have to be washed to get rid of smells. I'm still baffled 8 moths later about how this damn sweater stays fresh when everything else gets stinky after like one day)  My worst one was another scarf when I don't and have never worn scarves. I *think* I want to be a scarf person but I'm really not, and it's a waste of money every time.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 15, 2020	labels:Is it a dealbreaker for a leather jacket to have sleeves that are too long? (I.e. stopping near fingertips). If it's relevant, this would be a more eccentric piece (fringe biker jacket). I've been scouring the vintage shops and the closest fit I've found is good everywhere but the sleeve length.
text:You can have the sleeve length altered by a tailor, but it will be on the expensive side.  Leather biker jackets typically have longer sleeves so that when your arms are outstretched they end at your wrists. But finger tip length is a little too long.	labels:Fair point, thanks :)	episode_done:True

text:Well, this is my first time compiling an album and I actually spent most of my time trying to hunt down pieces from memory. If I had been slowly building up a repository I would have included a lot more variety.   Also I didn't want to mine instagram, SF or WAYWT threads without permission from folks (though more than a few fits definitely came to mind).    Philosophically there's room for discussion too. Some of these alternative sources, especially instagram, are just as affected if not more so than marketing shots. At least the styling from retailers aim to place the emphasis on the chore coat rather than divert attention to supporting pieces. And you can definitively say runaway or campaign styling are exactly as the designer intends.	labels:imo, waywt fits are fair game for inspo albums

text:General Discussion - January 12, 2021	labels:does anyone think that for some reason men are obsessed with the technical details of a fit than women are? I usually don't generalize things around gender like this but with this I have found it to be hilariously common and wondered if other people have found it similar.  It's all anecdotal but my dude friends IRL or the reddit/sf dudes all seem to care deeply about sizing of an item, how certain things should be (e.g. where pants should stack, how to cuff pants, where jacket sleeve should fall compared to your hand, I could go on) and take the longest time comparing pit to pit, sleeve, rise dimensions between different sizes and items before pulling the trigger.  On the other hand, from my limited dealings with women who are interested in fashion, I've hardly ever seen them asking for measurements from sites and these technical details don't seem to be high up in their list of priorities when they're deciding to purchase or deciding on their fit.
text:In the past I've typed up multiple comments about this exact thing, but deleted them all for fear of weird misogyny vibes cause I don't exactly excel in expressing myself in English.        All I'm gonna say is that I think it def is a thing, although mainly on the Internet and even then not *that* big of a thing and that I think it's because fashion is EXPECTED from women so there are far more women not intensely invested in it but who still participate because of social pressure, where as men are expected to NOT be interested in fashion, so the people very invested in it who are interested in things like details and cuts self-select to be the majority of male fashion people due to the not-so-interesteds dropping out due to social pressure.	labels:FWIW, I've written and deleted a response to this three times, and English is my only language, so don't feel bad about that.  You actually articulated what I wanted to say better. I was going to say that due to societal pressure on both men and women, there's *way* more women that would rate their interest in fashion in the 2 to 8 range on a 0-10 scale. There's probably more women that would want to be a 0 or 1, but feel pressure to make more of an effort than they would choose to without those pressures. And there's more men that would be in the 2-8 range that are 0s and 1s because it's not considered manly to be into fashion. So the few of us that decide to say fuck it end up going all in at a 9 or 10. So that's how you get a ton of dudes concerned about the length of the collar points on an OCBD, and a ton of women that don't care about the inseam length on their capris.	episode_done:True

Buggy website, too.  Problem is, the algorithms picked u on it and I keep seeing ads for exactly the clothes I want, but they all reveal themselves to be clones of the same outlets as the same items and site issues appear.

Are they just for style?**    I understand wearing a type of tshirt under a dress shirt to absorb pit stains when sweating, so they don't show on the dress shirt itself.  But a singlet (or wifebeater as it is also known - an unfortunate name) does not cover the armpits, so would not absorb pit sweat. What then is the point of wearing one as an undergarment? Do they provide enough heat to protect from cold when it's chilly? Is it something else?  Is it just personal style?

text:you should buy Barbour from uk sites. They are 200 dollars cheaper, usually.	labels:Do you get dinged with shipping/taxes/duties? Is it $200 cheaper after all that too?
text:shipping is like 20. No duty between US and Uk, I think.	labels:This is false, at least on goods coming from the US and being imported to the UK. Not sure on the other way around but I would assume there is some sort of tax.
text:but I didn't pay it when I bought it. Maybe it's factored in into the price of the goods. But it's still way cheaper	labels:You wouldn't pay it then, because you're not paying the company you buy it from. If there are import taxes, the government/courier will charge you (you'll get an email, most likely) and will keep the item/s until you pay it. At least, that's what happened to me. The taxes ended up being almost as much as the purchase itself, so I just had it sent back. Hope you don't get got like that!	episode_done:True
text:What socks do you guys wear? and some advice on socks please?	labels:I'm big on merino socks. Currently have outlier merino socks in black sadly no longer being made in that color way. I also have unbound merino socks and wool and prince merino socks. I carry a couple of nike cotton socks for harsher conditions that warrant more wear such as running. I've also heard very good reviews on darn tough socks which is a combo merino blend if you want to take a look at them. They will be my next purchase. Hope this helps.
text:/u/BachelorUno  Are the merino socks thick? they look thick on pictures, and also, i just have a conceptual understand that anything wool is thick	labels:They have varying thicknesses.	episode_done:True
text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:I'm pretty much the same. I have also found that, compared to the machines at my laundromat, soaking and hand washing gets things much cleaner without as much wear and tear because being able to soak a garment beats all. I know that the new washers are meant to conserve water which is important, but if it's knitwear, I think soaking is necessary. When I started doing this, I was disgusted at how dirty the soaking water was because the machine wasn't really getting them clean. I had sweaters I was washing once or twice a month after only a couple of wears and the first time I hand washed them, it took 7 or 8 minutes of rinsing until the water wasn't visibly dirty.
text:holy shit I did not think of this! I'm gonna try this with my sweaters!    Dumb question: What  do you mean by 'rinsing' exactly?  LIke literally squeezing out your sweater for 7 - 8 mins?	labels:I wound up resorting to that with really unexpectedly dirty sweaters. Knitwear can hide a lot of dirt. Typically I just fill a bucket with water after the soap soak, swish it around and repeat 2 or 3 times until the rinse water isn't dirty or soapy.	episode_done:True
text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:I work in an office (well, in non-covid times. We're remote right now) and usually have colored hair. My default is green hair and I tend to wear earth tones or complimentary colors just since that's my taste, but every now and then I need a change and go red or pink or something else with my hair. I used to care about clashing, but now I mostly don't. My feeling is: if your hair is bright, just embrace being a colorful person haha. I think if your clothing is bright too it ends up looking cohesive even if the colors aren't necessarily complimentary. I might throw in an accessory or something that matches my hair to tie things together if I feel like it, but otherwise I just wear what makes me feel confident and comfortable.	episode_done:True
text:What’s something you wish you could tell clothing manufacturers to do differently?	labels:I love that some brands are making "curvy fit" jeans but I wish more would do this and that they would do it for other styles of pants that aren't jeans! I think this fit is in pretty high demand and it would be worth it! Also more button down shirts that accommodate bigger boobs (no gapping).
text:Sigh. I always tried on the curvy fit stuff because my jeans always gape in the back, but turns out my issue is not what is assumed in curvy fit! I have super wide hips but basically no butt.  It took me a lot of purchases and returns to figure that out!	labels:Oof I'm so sorry! I hope you find some pants that fit!	episode_done:True
text:What are you hate wearing?	labels:Anything that is even slightly restricting on my neck (turtlenecks, mocknecks, even some crew necks). Yet, for some absurd reason, I am absolutely drawn to the aesthetic. Its an ridiculous tug of war between fawning over them from afar but ripping them off my body within seconds of having them on.
text:I used to hate having anything close to my neck but now fitted turtle necks and mock necks are like all I wear, I can't resist them. They're absolutely the most flattering tops for my body type. I'm not really sure what I like to wear in summer but fortunately that only lasts about three weeks here	labels:You give me hope that one day I will be like "Ya know what? I love the feeling of an angry itchy snake clinging tightly to my entire torso!" Then I can be rid of all my purchase guilt from years of buying neck grazing garments that I despise wearing. Turtlenecks are so flattering but I have such a hard time with them!! A girl can dream...

text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Wanted to give you some advice on socks!   DO NOT wear cotton socks if you'll be in a cold environment or if you're prone to sweating. To and from the car to buildings and stuff you'll be ok, but shoveling or anything like that you're better with synthetic or wool socks.  I have trouble with wool sometimes, but I swear by Smartwool socks, especially their phD line. My feet tend to sweat and wool wicks that moisture away to keep your feet dry and warm. They keep me so comfy and warm and they make very stylish types as well.
text:This goes for T-shirts too! If you get too warm under a down coat, you'll sweat, and later get a massive chill, unless you change immediately. Take this advice from someone who knows, as a 5+ mile daily walker in the upper U.S. midwest.	labels:	episode_done:True

Ever since i bought my 1st pair i feel like i can't go back. Especially as a smaller person (from where i live at least)  Cardigans. Somewhere last year i realised i just don't like the regular vest/cardigan with zipper and those strings look (sorry idl what to call them in english lol) Qs i also really like witchy looking outfits there are a VERY nice addition to my wardrobe.

text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:I would get:  - a knee length/mid-calf black, brown, grey, or navy dress (good for anything and you can pair with colourful accessories for a wedding if you want)  - a flowy maxi dress (good for outdoor weddings in hot weather)  - a fun one that is still appropriate.   Avoid:  - excessive cleavage  - tacky rhinestones  - white dresses and anything close to white.  - completely red dresses   - black dresses can be a bit somber but I think can work if accessorized properly. Try to make sure it isn't too funeral-looking.   Things to keep in mind:  - at least one dress that covers your shoulders might be a good idea for any more traditional/conservative weddings.  - keep the length classy  - look for timeless styles, dresses you can wear in almost any decade and look good. Your fun one you can have fun with and have it be a trend that might not work 5 years from now.  - don't buy a dress you don't have the undergarments for/don't plan on buying undergarments for. Eg. Do you have massive boobs, and can't wear strapless bras? Don't get a strapless dress.

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:My style is academic/smart/business casual - slacks and sweaters, jeans and blouses, pumps or loafers. Throw in a pencil skirt, blazer, or scarf if I'm feeling fancy. Neutrals year round.  Pros: compliments from my bosses about professionalism, less gendered harassment from male colleagues, way less catcalling and creepiness in public. My clothes are sturdy and need little care.  Cons: bosses say behind my back that I "class the place up" (ew), I see my female colleagues and friends getting harassed and I feel helpless. People expect me to behave as though I'm part of a higher socioeconomic class, though I dont know the culture and I don't have the main privileges (i.e. I'm secretly poor and trashy). I feel like an imposter.	episode_done:True

From what I can see, Oak Street Bootmaker (campus chukka) and Alden make chukka's like this, but I can't find anywhere that stocks in my size (8.5E Brannock, so probably an 8 in Alden and 9 in OSB). Meermin currently has an order going on for them, but they don't expect to ship until March. Grant Stone has a lot of natural cxl shoes but I didn't see any such chukkas.   Any suggestions? The Aldens at around $600 would be the upper end my price range. Thanks in advance.

text:Fellow clothing trackers, what coveted items are you tracking now?	labels:A good, buttery brown leather crossbody purse. After two years of searching, I found the PERFECT shape and size at MadeWell. I placed my order in late August 2020, and still had not received the item by November. I knew it was a 6 week waiting time for shipping, but since it was well over 9 weeks by then, I finally called MadeWell asking where my purse was.  Turns out they had sold out of the item and erroneously did not take it off their website, and it still allowed you to purchase the purse. I was livid, but if anything, extremely heartbroken because I was sooo looking forward to this purse, and one of the few bright and good things I had to look forward to at that time in my life (life was throwing me some crazy curveballs).  I have yet to find the perfect buttery brown leather crossbody, the right size, color and a smooth surface. And under $300. Keeping my fingers crossed!

They usually end up as booty shorts but that because I end up cutting them shorter and they ride up and sit like hipster panties except high waisted.	episode_done:True
text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.

text:Just how revolutionary is Harry Styles’ Vogue cover?	labels:The article hit all the points I was thinking except one. Why Harry? Why do we all look at Harry Styles when talking about revolutionary men's fashion when there are so many others who've done it before and are doing it right now. Just a thought.
text:My theory on why Harry is this: playing with gender in fashion isn't new as you pointed out, eternal icons like Grace Jones have been there and done that. However, Harry's instance is unique because we have seen in a highly publicized way the evolution of how he sees his gender. He started as a (sorry fans) generic white musician with bland style and has since sort of aggressively redone his look. I'm sure he's been called "brave" in numerous articles documenting his steps towards this moment. Similar pretty boys like Ansel Elgort and even people like Post Malone have played with gender, but none in an as aggressively pursued and marketed way as Harry did. I also think people see that he has an X-factor because of his sexual identity. Billy Porter being a publicly queer person is sort of expected to do these things. Yeah his gown moment was highly publicized but it certainly didn't "break the internet" and spawn discussion like this did.  edit: also exactly what u/Anthraxistaken said	labels:I was thinking that too about how it was all because we've seen his growth and I couldn't have summed it up better.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone take their “power color” really seriously? Basing a whole wardrobe around one color - not just choosing an accent color for a neutral capsule?	labels:This sounds like a cool idea. How do you find out what your power color is?
text:I used some loose seasonal color analysis to come up with the options I listed. What color do you feel best in?	labels:Well, blue is my favorite color and it brings out my eyes.

text:What’s your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:I love it personally as a 90s baby. I feel like for a long time body-con skintight clothes were in fashion. Skinny jeans, body suits, bodycon dresses, etc.   I am loving the 90s trend because the clothes are so much more functional and comfortable for me.	episode_done:True
text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Pros: Since my clothes are mostly composed mens and cargo stuff, my clothes are usually very comfortable and practical, and I usually never have to worry about storing my phone or other items cause I have pockets that fit my hand and half my fore-arm  Cons: It's usually tough to find certain clothing, especially in the womens section. My mom also tried to get me to wear more womens clothing, which usually is really impractical and all around shit. Like I just got a new pair of sweatpants, and they're this thin spandex materials, capris (I hate capris), and the waist band is either too loose, or bunches up when I try to tighten then. My mom's pissed that I don't like them and says I'm really complicated to shop with, but it's complicated until I go into the mens section where I find exactly what I'm looking for in like 10 seconds. Rant over I guess	episode_done:True

text:Jewelry trends for 2021	labels:I've been feeling this way for a few months now. I have a big pile of minimalist gold jewelry and lately I am just sick of it.  In terms of clothing, my style has become a lot less minimalist recently (more colors, more patterns, ruffles and accents). I think it's the desire to look more interesting on Zoom and to spice up my stay-at-home life. I haven't found a replacement for the minimalist jewelry yet but this thread is giving some good inspiration.	episode_done:True

text:Does your language affect how you wear colors?	labels:I read an article in scientific American forever ago that discussed the way some languages are structured to center the group or the space rather than the individual speaker the way English does, which can contribute massively to how a culture's values are learned (individual gratification vs acting on behalf of the group, consuming/hoarding natural resources vs conserving/cultivating them). In my amateur  assessment, I'd say language effects our fashion choices more in the realm of what we're dressing to communicate (personal wealth, individual perspective and creativity, respect for the natural environment, etc), and in the realm of how we consume fashion (desiring to have more or better than others in our community, desiring newness, desiring to leave a smaller environmental footprint, etc).	episode_done:True
text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:I loved Modcloth, I bought most of my clothes from there. After the Walmart take over I ordered two dresses to test the waters. The zippers were made out of plastic and broke right away, the stitching was off and both dresses were really underwhelming in person.  I was tempted and ordered a sweatshirt on sale a few months ago and it was made out of the worst and cheapest feeling fabric I've ever encountered. In their defense, they refunded me for all three of the items. I just don't think they're worth another shot.	episode_done:True

text:Straight to savings. I finish my doctorate this year so this was going to be a year of uncertainty and change regarding our living situation--where, doing what, etc.--anyway. Doing it through a continuing pandemic? Cannot recommend.   On the bright side, spent most of the last week polishing an application for a dream job, sent it in just before midnight, did the usual paranoid morning-after read-through and it still reads excellently so: here's hoping for some good life changes this year.	labels:Not a bad idea honestly, I was in your position around this time last year and that's exactly what I would have done. I'm pulling for you with this job app!	episode_done:True
text:How do you challenge yourself?	labels:I bought a top that was quite pricey and turned out to not look how I had hoped- I was hoping for more of an off white, Edwardian style blouse, but it was a crisper white, pretty this, and had thin lines of bright silver. My s.o. quotes the Seinfeld pirate shirt episode when he sees it lol. Well this week I decided to just go for it and embrace the pirate aesthetic on a day I knew several coworkers were out and wore it to work. The longer I wore it, the more I decided I liked it.	episode_done:True

text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:A comfortable pair of completely waterproof boots. I bought my first pair of Timberland waterproof boots about 10 years ago when I started university and they were one of the best purchases I've ever made. I've always walked to class / for commute and waterproof footwear is a game changer. Honestly I think soggy feet should be banned, no one should have to suffer that!   Nowadays I have a pair of office appropriate waterproof boots and a pair of semi-hiking boots and my toes never have to feel the horror that is wet socks.
text:Not really an investment, but years ago I got a pair of rain boots for $11 because they were literally the only ones that fit me in all of Chinatown (possibly I was too broke to go elsewhere?) and they have been amazing. Completely waterproof, I've gotten so many compliments on how they look, and for a couple winters I even wore them as my winter boots (with fluffy socks) because they were way grippier than any other boots I had.  It's been probably almost 10 years and they are still going strong (fingers crossed)!	labels:	episode_done:True

One is brown corduroy and the other is denim, I'm starting to where them as the weather is cold. Also a long sleeve polo shirt from him that he was wearing in this one picture of the two of us when I was a baby.

text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:I am going back to the office in a week for the first time since mid-March and really looking forward to getting dressed up for work again! It's a great season for transitioning back as well - cooling down enough that it won't be a battle between cold/hot. Dressing for the office makes me feel confident!	episode_done:True
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:I started getting my clothes tailored last year and the difference is incredible. Looked like I lost a ton of weight and I gained so many compliments on my clothes. It makes cheap clothing (but well made) look expensive!  The alternations were mostly taking dresses/tops in at the waist and shortening the length of some long dresses and skirts to make them closer to knee length.	episode_done:True
text:What unknown/smaller brands should we all know about that don't often get posted here?	labels:**Kotn** has affordable, sustainable, and quality basics. Really love the look of their supply chain. I've got three of their turtlenecks and they're nice. You can also get a bit of a discount if you order from the Canadian site since they price everything the same regardless of currency.   **Big Bud Press** is awesome if you like a 70s vibe. I've got two of their cropped honeycomb tees, they're beautiful.   **Ovate, Sisters of the Black Moon, I Do Declare** if you like linen and victorianwear. They're pricey, though.  **ARQ** sells crop tanks and lingerie basics in the most fab colors for women and children. Everything looks very well made.
text:Kotn is great! I have a handful of their tanks and two pairs of pants and all have held up extremely well	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Fashion should be fun, not stressful.  Honestly I feel like a large part of this is in your head because I don't think most people, especially in school, care as much about your appearance as you think they do - like so long as your clothes are clean, you should be fine.  (this is coming from a background where I went to an engineering school and my parents, growing up, could never afford on-trend clothing/accessories/backpacks).  I think the idea other people have suggested of wearing a uniform would definitely help - find a good fitting pair of jeans and shoes and just rotate blouses/sweaters.  Sorry for being blunt - I'm just not a big fan of posts in a fashion subreddit complaining about having to participate in fashion.
text:We all have to participate in fashion whether we like to or not. Maybe op just came to this sub to ask the experts.	labels:I disagree - there's being "fashionable" and there's "wearing clothes" - anyone can wear clothes; no one has to participate in fashion.  Also, if she wanted to ask the experts, she could do so in daily questions, with actionable specific questions (not a general "how to improve my style without providing any pics of what she's currently wearing, or what she'd like to wear" which I'e found is pretty useless because people have different styles and tastes).	episode_done:True

text:Help with 2020 post-COVID scrubs style	labels:I'm an intern (I guess it would be the equivalent of a PGY1 Resident who rotates in all specialities). I really enjoy wearing scrubs because it saves on laundry and my regular clothes get a lot more wear. I really like Cherokee brand scrubs, they're comfortable and have all the pockets! I recently discovered a female black owned scrub company called Dope Scrubs and I'm saving up to get them as they look so cool!!!	episode_done:True
text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:I wouldn't say I inherently hate the brand but I think Champion is an example of a brand that exploded a few years back/to now basically all because some celebrities or whoever wore it- and everyone who wears it now is most likely a ding dong hypebeast type or the VSCO type girl or whatever. Like I'm old enough to remember it being bottom tier Wal Mart level shit you'd get borderline made fun of for wearing- but now all of the sudden it's enjoying this moment. So it's just that perceived inauthenticity and collective pivot in peoples' minds to a fashion name to people rather than just athletic apparel that irks me somehow.  However though, the Todd Snyder Champion stuff is PHENOMENAL- it's not the mainline stuff. You don't see any of those assholes rocking that.
text:I have a vivid memory from elementary school of getting bullied for wearing champion sneakers instead of nikes I legit never got how people think champion is a hype brand now	labels:To be fair I still think a high schooler would be made fun of by their peers if they wear champion sneakers lol	episode_done:True
text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:It's easier for me if I donate them or put them up on Poshmark/ebay. I usually don't want to mess around with pictures/shipping though.   I have a spot in the back of my closet for five (!!!) things I like but I won't wear. I figure it's few enough things that I can keep them for sentimentality but it makes me really think about why I'm keeping things.   In order to help me purge I had a considerate friend who helped me be ruthless. "Are you going to wear that? Does it mean anything to you? Into the donate box with you!"  However anything not suitable for donation was "smuggled" out of the house to be either tossed or turned into rags, but I couldn't bear to watch.
text:I like the mental release of having a designated number of things I can guiltily keep. Absolutes and harsh rules are hard mentally, but it's easier to pick out the couple of things "I wanna keep for keeping's sake" vs just tossing the whole lot.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:Wear pyjama tops as jackets/overshirts.  They come in a broad range of fabrics/colors/patterns, but all tend to be comfortable (duh).    I have several poplin ones for summer - they often have wider uncuffed sleeves (again, for comfort) so you can go for a sort of noragi look.  (finding a very light fabric chore jacket turned out to be a pain, or they were too expensive. So instead I wear a rotation of thrifted poplin pyjama tops. They look a bit different, but work fine.)  Recently I also got one in flannel, lovely to wear around the house this winter.  They're like oversized overshirts, but also have pockets. I want pockets.
text:Not saying I don't believe you, but can we see some fit pics?	labels:What is there to believe?
text:I'm not sure this is a good look.	labels:i've done this around the house, but to be honest, I wouldn't go out with it. the tops feel too soft and loose, more than even the softest structured flannel will be.
text:That's the point? Unstructured - good. Soft and thin - good.    Might not be what you want, it is what I wanted.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:When washing, zip, button, and tie absolutely everything; turn each piece inside out (and while you're doing that, clip any loose threads); put shirts, sweaters, underwear, and anything else you care about in their own lingerie bags (the ones branded Tide are great); separate by color *and* weight; never use hot water; use minimal soap and/or run an extra rinse cycle with a cup of white vinegar in it to get rid of soap residue; only use the dryer for linens and towels and then only on low; avoid dryer sheets. Oh, and dab a bit of clear nail polish on the thread of each button when you first take the tags off a garment -- your buttons will stay on much longer.
text:Wow that is a complicated wash routine!!  I do wash on the lowest setting (30), and don't have a dryer.  I use 1/2 a tablet rather than the 2 the box says.  But I throw everything in together, nothing fastened or inside out.	labels:If it works for you, that's all that matters. I just don't like fading/fraying. Closing all the fasteners and turning things inside out protects the exterior while everything is getting thrown around inside the machine.
text:Maybe more of my clothes are soft?  I wear tees and hoodies, denim shirts in the winter.  I guess mostly the sort of things which can go on forever and just age gently!  Must admit one of my denim jackets is getting a bit worn where the cuff is folded back (I wear a watch), but then it was from a charity shop some time before 2015.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:“I'm all locked down with nowhere to go – but that hasn't killed my lust for fashion”	labels:I'm still lusting over pretty fit and flare dresses even though I already purchased a couple of them online during the height of the lockdown last year. It's not like I'm going to be attending any events anytime soon. But I miss getting dressed up for stuff. It's too cold to wear dresses just for grocery shopping. I can't wear them around the house with a rambunctious nine month old kitten running around getting into constant mischief. But that doesn't stop from me from wanting to buy a couple more of them.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I have a base of black skinny jeans and black tank - typically a nice top will go over the top of that, worn with ballet flats and either leather jacket or formal coat.   I have a strict color scheme for my wardrobe, with a few patterns I like, I definitely have a theme so I'll only buy new items that stick to that. I have some very similar items, like a good few cream vest tops of similar style, but I'll have more interesting key pieces too.

text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I began the year on a no-buy. Went well until lockdown hit and I decided to learn to sew. I have still made myself quite a few garments. Not a perfect system but better than buying new and I definitely value the clothing more as a result of the effort. At this point I have bought two new items - a rain coat and some new work shoes, both necessary. My loophole is quite extreme but proof I think that humans will always find a way around an ultimatum!
text:Ugh same, lockdown really didn't help hahahah. I would love to learn to sew!! The most I have managed is hemming a top to make it cropped :(	labels:No sad faces, did you feel good and proud after you hemmed it?

text:Thoughts on Shein?	labels:I have only made one order so far. I bought two dresses that I love, a cute lingerie set,  and a handful of sweatshirts and waffle pull over sweaters.  The sweatshirts are a weird material on the outside but the the inside is soft. The waffle pullovers are thin but comfortable/soft, you have to wear a shirt underneath but idk anyone who doesn't do that with pull overs anyways. I think my engagement ring may have caught on the front of it somehow so I do have to clip part of the fabric. In the same order I bought some hair accessories I can't figure out how to actually use yet, a mask that is comfortable on my face, and a cat light switch sticker. About 13 items for just under $100. By no means is shein high quality material etc. I have yet to wear everything as it all came in last month so I cannot say how long the clothes will last without falling apart.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 05	labels:**Reflective vests, but make them fun?**  I use a reflective vest on my bike commutes. It's function over form: packable, easy to throw over my regular jacket and keeps me visible on the road. Doesn't stop me from wanting something neater.  So I'm curious, apart from reflective jackets, has anyone come across reflective gear that look less like an afterthought and more like a fun addition to an otherwise basic fit?
text:3-M reflective windbreakers had a moment in mainstream streetwear a couple years back, you could def incorporate them into your wardrobe	labels:While 3M jackets are superb for visibility, I haven't seen any that I'd also want to wear in daylight instead of another jacket.

I don't like fleece leggings cause they make my ass sweat. If you have a normal ammount of ass sweat, these may work for you.   \- Really just wool anything. It's the best bang for your buck if you're worried about getting cold. The idea is to dress in layers. REI has some great guides if this is your first rodeo.   \- Cute slippers since we're all grounded inside.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 06, 2021	labels:Are there specific long coats for shorter guys that I should look into? I'm about 5'7" average build.  I'm  aware that I should look for mid thigh and above lengths, but it's hard to judge online and a physical store is pretty limiting, I plan on visiting a few these weekend anyways. I was mostly looking at ASOS, but they don't  have measurements beyond model height and the size of the piece unless I looked in the wrong places.  If it's necessary, camel/tan and single breasted, with a budget of about $140. I can budget higher if it's  recommended, but please don't do this to me lol.
text:There really aren't any specific long coats for short guys also I wouldn't worry about the length of the coat too much your not going to look shorter with a coat that reaches past your knees.	labels:Well,not specifically for short guys, I probably worded it wrong. I mean long coats that are on the shorter side. I prefer them shorter anyways, going past the knees is kinda uncomfortable for me  E: am I doing something wrong? I'm just looking for reccomendations on shorter pieces...
text:I think asos will have something you like long coats are only just recently stated coming back h&m had mostly shorter jackets too when I tried some on a couple months ago	labels:Thanks man. H&M was one of the places I was going to check out so that's  good.  Asos had one that I wanted but it's sold one, and the only one that looked like it might be the fit I wanted.  Thanks again.	episode_done:True
text:There is no unmarked woman	labels:just read it- BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN. Author is eloquent and conveys the message gorgeously. I agree!! Well done on her part.
text:Also- does anyone know a sub where i can see more stuff like this?	labels:Not a sub, but if you look up the reading list for any gender studies college course, tbh, you'll go down a million rabbit holes of suggestions for great books and essays reflecting on similar topics - some outdated, others more recent. It makes for interesting comparison.	episode_done:True

text:Serious question about Lululemon, because I see every 2nd comment on here, has that brand in it.   What makes it so special and is it worth the price?	labels:Comfortable. Athleisure is the state of fashion at this moment. It's priced for the middle-class professional, so attracts a big demo. It's the JCrew of our generation.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone take their “power color” really seriously? Basing a whole wardrobe around one color - not just choosing an accent color for a neutral capsule?	labels:Go for it! Start gradually with a few solid pieces and see if you like it. Red seems to be easier to match and find things in, but I really like the idea of cobalt blue. It's very striking.  My brother has been doing this for about 10 years now with bright "safety" orange, and he still loves it. He doesn't own any clothes not his particular shade of orange. It started with a beanie and now his closet is still a hilariously solid orange block. He has not grown tired of it. However, he is not a fashionable person, and most of his wardrobe are t-shirts/polos and cargo shorts. He has managed to find an orange 3 piece suit though it took a while. Speaking from experience, it's a rather difficult color to find in a consistently bright shade.	episode_done:True

text:What are your favorite (not too expensive) ring sellers?	labels:I have two mountain rings from Everli Jewelry, as well as some earrings, and I love them.

text:Oh these are all lovely, thank you for the suggestion.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What niche do you feel is missing from the fashion blogging/YouTube world?	labels:Midsized women who want to be fashionable, but not in a professional/streetwear sense. I've found some size twelve ladies who dress neat and tidy and ready for law practice, and I follow some size 12 ladies who wear streetwear, but nobody wears anything of actual interest in that size between either spectrum. Anybody I do see not in those two categories seem to be more in a "Macy's catalogue, 2013" aesthetic.  I need someone with stomach pudge and jiggly thighs to show me what cool structural and interesting pieces I can pull off without me spending 10 days and 10k dollars at the store to find it.

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:Just buy things carefully. Really think about what goes with the rest of your wardrobe, and buy things that you would want to wear again and again.  I buy fast fashion, but I have a very small closet. I don't consider my fast fashion items disposable. They are treated with similar care as I would treat the more expensive pieces in my wardrobe, like Max Mara, etc.  I also purchases second hand a lot of the time, and often consider trend cycles when I buy items. I avoid the really trendy stuff - unless it's something I really want to try out, and buy things that wouldn't feel that outdated in 3 years time.  In the case of buying 2 dollar tees and really cheap shoes - it might not be sustainable in the long run, because based on my experience, bad quality tees don't last very long.

text:+J/UNIQLO SPECIAL COLLABORATION: What’s the verdict?	labels:I have a black cardigan -- its thin, hangs nicely both open and closed, pockets lined with maroon (same material), good layering piece. I like it.  And the leather rope belt. Oddly enough in a collection that runs large, this could have used being a bit longer. If you double it up, there isn't much length left after having knotted it. It looks a bit as if I'm using electrical cable to hold up my jeans but I think it's cool.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 15, 2020	labels:Does anyone have experience using no-rinse detergent to handwash a wool garment rather than getting it dry-cleaned? What should I know before doing this, and are there any detergents you recommend? Thanks!
text:I use Woolite, but it does require some gentle rinsing.  Wash, gently (no scrubbing), by hand in cold water and Woolite. Rinse a couple times in cold water. Lay it flat on a clean dry towel, roll it up in the towel and squeeze it to remove excess water. Then, lay it flat on a separate clean dry towel and allow it to dry.  Edit:  This is for a wool sweater.  If you're asking about cleaning trousers or a jacket then you should get it dry cleaned.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:Darn tough socks. In particular the thinner ones that are about the thickness of a standard sock. They fit comfortably and keep your feet warm without overheating indoors when wearing shoes/boots.   If you're in Canada, Canada West boots. In particular their WM moorby line. Basically like Redwings, but cheaper and in my opinion better built and more comfortable. Made in Winnipeg.
text:Ha holy shit, I was just thinking about recommending my Canada West - WM Moorby boots,  I've never heard anyone else mention them. They're great, a real versatile boot, look great with just about everything.	labels:>Canada West boots.  Wow, I just looked at these. The black ones are literally sex.	episode_done:True
text:Feeling self-conscious with changing style around family - anyone relate? Tips?	labels: I way overdress for my family and have been for a few years. Lately they have started upping their own style for things like holidays and family hangouts which is kind of sweet. My dad once saw what I was going to wear to a restaurant with him went "SHIT" and put on a whole new outfit with nice shoes and a suprisingly hip button-down.  You may face some comments, but eventually they'll just get used to it and may even start putting more effort in themselves!
text:That's adorable! Good on you for inspiring your dad (and the rest of the fam) to up their game. (As long as it's actually inspiration and not shame)	labels:(haha I'm 82% sure it's inspiration)	episode_done:True
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:Other people have covered the specifics of shoes, but if you struggle with putting colors together, and want some inspiration, swing by a paint store. Typically they will have brochures with curated color palettes with different types of mood or theme. There will usually be between ten and twenty colors in each one, and the idea with them is that you can put any of the colors in a given collection together and have them look good. Find one or two collections that feel like you- maybe one that has a lot of similar colors to your current wardrobe, and one with colors you'd like to start wearing. It can help you discover combinations that you otherwise wouldn't think of.	episode_done:True

text:BoF: J. Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:Their quality has suffered so much in the last several years. I also think that their styles have leaned too much toward the trendy rather than the classic, but the quality has been by far the biggest issue. Their prices remain the same, but their clothes fall apart immediately, the seams are all wonky, nothing lays correctly, the fabrics are terrible quality, the stitching is poor... Expensive garbage. I feel sad saying that. J. Crew used to be almost all I wore back when it was classic, well made clothing.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - October 30	labels:Bought a vintage US army wool shirt from the mid 70s a few days ago. Really nice fabric, but man do those things fit small. I'm like 5'6, and a size XS is pulling at my chest a little bit. Also, my closet has that "surplus" smell to it now, which is fun
text:Yeah love the material on those things but the fit is so weird. Boxy but with short, loose sleeves?	labels:And to make matters worse, the fit changed literally every couple years, so it's been ridiculously difficult to find one that works for me. And you're so right about the sleeves. They're billowy as hell, which really makes no sense considering how slim the chest is on the 70's models. Did everyone back then have extremely built arms, but literally no chest definition whatsoever?

text:If you like Red Wing, I prefer the Blacksmith over the Iron Ranger.   They are almost the same except the Blacksmith does not have a cap-toe, which I think makes it a bit less "work-weary" and easier to pair with the BB.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I Dyed My Jeans With $6 Dye and Here Are The Results	labels:I've dyed many a pair of Jean's before, I always get the same black ones from primark that I wear to work because I know they fit really well, but the colour starts to fade quickly so I redye them so I can wear them to work for longer :)	episode_done:True
text:Style rut: Pinterest vs reality	labels:I agree with the general consensus that your friends are rude... but to answer your question I would recommend starting with investing in stand out staple pieces. I actually have set out to mimic my Pinterest board as well, and it's taken about 4+ years but I'm definitely getting closer to what I wanted! When looking for staples, I took the approach of quality over quantity. I usually make about 5 big "statement" purchases in a year (eg. I just bought a Valentino coat), and try to spend minimally on basics and only when I absolutely need to. Thrift and vintage stores are also great in my opinion, but maybe that's just more suited to my Pinterest aesthetic! I would also say as a rule of thumb, splurge on staple items and save on super trendy items. Could you maybe give an example of what kind of aesthetic you are looking to imitate?	episode_done:True

I would like some more "adult casual" looks.	episode_done:True
text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:Fashion is a 20-ish year cycle because that is enough time for the trendsetters to admire what they were never a part of.

text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:Your lifestyle is SO important to your closet! Consider your climate and the things you actually do on a daily/weekly basis. If you're a student, wearing high heels all over campus probably isn't going to happen. You'll end up wearing your sneakers and more comfortable shoes, so make your comfortable shoes part of your outfit. You can still do a girly style in sneaks! Think Keds or similar. Whatever your "ideal" style, make sure it works for your realistic day-to-day.	episode_done:True
text:MFA Theme WAYWT: Corduroy	labels:I absolutely love cords! I like to wear tailoring, but dislike looking up "corporate".

text:Messy eaters? Tell your stories and hacks / fixes.	labels:Most food stains will come out by gently massaging handsoap, dish soap, or shampoo into it and let dry.  The stains should lift when you can wash the garment next.   For wine, club soda and lots of blotting is the first step before going for a cleaning agent.

text:Do you have any pieces that "should not" work with your body that just seems to work?	labels:Conventional knowledge about fashion is very subjective. I don't think those rules are worth bending, I think you can just bring them straight to the rubbish bin and leave them there. If you're trying to figure out what female/feminine clothes look good on you try finding bloggers/celebrities who have a body similar to yours and a style that you like, and take notes on how they dress. Another thing that's more effective than following all the weird fashion rules is searching for solutions to particular issues, e.g. "how to wear oversized clothes and not look fat" and "how to hide a belly". And then take everything with a grain of salt. It might be useful, or might be total BS.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 19, 2020	labels:Many Europeans seem to wear their winter coats inside room tempeture areas and not overheat or be uncomfortable, so it made me wonder:  What gives an outer coat an ability to keep the wearer warm in -20 C (-4 F) and not overheat or be uncomfortable then the wearer is inside an apartment (room temperature)? Can a topcoat or an overcoat accomplish all that?  What gives chinos an ability to keep the wearer warm in -20 C (-4 F) and not overheat or be uncomfortable then the wearer is inside an apartment (room temperature)?  What shoes would match the formality level of combination topcoat or overcoat+chinos+t-shirt?
text:Fabric type and weight helps but also you have to consider interior temperature of homes, central heating, the local climate, and personal preference.  > What shoes would match the formality level of combination topcoat or overcoat+chinos+t-shirt?  Could wear some casual derby boots, derbies, or just plain minimal sneakers.	labels:Okay, so what fabric type and in what weight range an overcoat must be so that you can wear it comfortably and without overheating in -20 C (-4 F) weather and in an apartment in room temperature?  Thank you for the reply :)

I can remake the question again if needs be, just let me know :)
text:Do you honestly believe that a coat that will keep you warm/alive at -20c could be worn comfortably indoors at around 20c? There's a near 40c difference in temperature. How likely is it that such a thing exists?   It's questions like this that make people here (and in other subreddits) think you're trolling.	labels:Okay then, if such overcoats don't exist, what tricks do Europeans use to manage stay warm outside in really cold temperatures and not overheat when indoors without taking off their coats?

Partly because my skin tone embraces the jewel tones, but mostly because working remote this is my one chance in adulthood that my work uniform can be princess chiffon paired with renaissance brocade accessorized with combat boots and prom jewelry from Claire's.    (F*k you I won't do what you tell me.)

text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:Low rise jeans - you can pry them from my cold dead hands. The high waisted trend just isn't for me. I style them with a classic tuck and belt or I wear a form fitting sweater that hides the low rise but still gives me shape.
text:I prefer a muffin top over everyone's gut popping out like a bum in front any day of the week. So glad low rise are coming back.	labels:Hahaha I love this comment. Sorry you're getting downvoted, I guess it's an unpopular opinion. But it made me laugh! Team muffin top!	episode_done:True

text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:Remove yourself from the mailing list for all shopping vendors that you have coming into your inbox. They'll tempt you every time you get a notification. Likewise, maybe take a break from any of the fashion social media items that you follow, Instagram, Pinterest, certain subreddits.  &#x200B;  This advice might sound really weird, but I actually did this successfully a couple times during the initial shutdown. I caught a couple of those amazing sales and I added a lot items. I got a really good  "ooo 75% off!" high. Then I looked at the cart and logged off. I never actually purchased the items.

text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:Is anyone else kind of tired of posts and comments that variously try to "justify" the price of obvious luxury goods, designerwear, etc.?  Good thread on the SLP teddy, but just about nothing in there is surprising. Is it well-constructed? Duh, it's SLP. Does it have little refinements all over, compared to everyday varsity jackets? Yeah, that's kind of the point. Is it "worth" $2,000? No, obviously not.   Like...at some point we need to acknowledge that these efforts are misguided, even if well-intentioned. You're buying SLP because it's SLP (or Ackermann, or Dick Ovens, or whatever your thing is). *That* is the justification. And that's a fine justification in and of itself! An analysis of the materials and construction is unlikely to throw up surprises that'll make people go "damn, that really makes it worth the obnoxious price tag!"   (This observation does not apply to bespoke clothing, where the justification genuinely is that you get something more or less customized for you, and you alone.)  What do people think?

Also, I'm pretty sure that there was another egg-themed named outfit for some reason. (I don't know why they weren't my favorite food or anything)  Irony: this year I developed an egg allergy.

text:Style Lessons from Male-Presenting People: An Inspo Album	labels:What's a male presenting person?
text:There are probably more nuances to everything below, but anyone who looks like they are a male. As far as looks go there are feminine, androgynous, or masculine or somewhere in between them all. Some people may identify with one gender but look like another. OP doesn't want to assume the people in these pictures all identify as male, but they all look masculine in these pictures.	labels:Then why not just put masculine instead of male?
text:The term itself "male presenting" is used by or describing more masculine genderfluid people for example. If you havent heard it before, especially a in a different context, I understand how it is a little confusing.   For an extreme example if I showed a stereotypical homophobic person one of those pictures he would say those are feminine looking men. So he could recognize them as men but not think they are masculine. Feminine and masculine are up to interpretation.	labels:Another good distinction. I didn't just casually say "male-presenting", I specified this because I think of male-presenting as being different from masculine. A masculine style can still be femme on someone who identifies as a woman, and I wanted to make sure that I was inclusive in case one of the people in this album did not identify as male. At its roots, this is an album about men being good at clothing, but I wanted to use the most inclusive language I could. Thanks u/firesandwich for more help explaining!!	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:Not so much a uniform as a personal 'dress code' that came about because, if left to my own devices, I will randomly buy patterns and fabrics I think are beautiful and make dressing myself impossible.  I have a handful of cuts I like, have cut my colors down to specific shades, have gotten really, really specific about what makes an print acceptable, and if I really love something, I'll buy one variation and make it a pair.  (Just today, my boatneck, black & white floral t-shirt got a black and white floral, square neck tank sibling.)  End result means that while I'm not wearing the same thing every day, I can kind of choose a something I'm feeling (geometrics! black and white patterns! green!) and wear it for a stretch.	episode_done:True

text:I find that at least half of sunglasses I encounter are explicitly unisex, even when they're sorted by gender. Wear what looks good.

Half of the reason my shoe collection is so large is that I rotate my work boots to where I wear a pair every other day.

This lipstick does not budge, at all, even after hours of wearing a mask. I still miss my other, gentler lipsticks, but this is a good stop gap. If you really miss those fall lip colors I recommend getting a few of those "no-smudge" lipsticks.

I am also avoiding /r/frugalmalefashion for the foreseeable future and not because I ~~buy~~ am a sucker for whale trays or $20 Nike Killshots.	episode_done:True
text:All things K-Fashion!	labels:I wonder if the 2020 trends (logos, maximalist shapes, general flamboyancy) will actually play out in the US in the next year or so, when there's a tendency to minimize in times of economic recession. Or do you think it's the Gen Zeers who are mostly into K -fashion? If the trends persist, it'd probably be through the generation that isn't at risk of being laid off.  I like the simpler "classic feminine" styles and the fitted silhouettes. Not big into the ruffles.
text:I looked through the first link and it seems like most of the trends originated in the states or Europe, and were very popular to begin with. Nothing uniquely k-fashion other than possibly the large ruffled blouse. Am i missing something ... ?  e: checked out link 2 and harpers bazaar link as well. Some things like ruffles, houndstooth and logos stand out as unique in the kfashion market this season. Oversized sweaters? Pink Blush egirl outfits? Accessories? Large sunglasses? Not particularly groundbreaking and have been popular for a while  The most relevant link seems to be the Kdrama examples, you can clearly tell that there is a maximalist vibe with these outfits, certain pieces are more traditional and tailored which is unique (reminiscent of the chanel sets). Those ones make the difference in fashion markets clearer and stands out as the best example.	labels:Hm, you're right, and also I'm going to have to say that a lot of the stuff that's popular in SK has taken it's inspiration from earlier trends (and by earlier I mean several years/decades earlier). Sometimes they update certain styles to be more in line with South Korean tastes as well, and you find a lot of celebrities wearing western designers. It's more of a blend?  And it really depends on when you're looking and comparing. I started getting into Kpop/Kfashion about 8-10 years ago, and styles that were popular on celebrities, would then trickle over to US after a season or two. I'd end up seeing them even in fast fashion H&M and Forever 21! Fun fact, F21 was started by a South Korean couple, which then made a lot of sense to me aha.	episode_done:True

text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:I don't have it any more, but much like your dress #1, I had a dress from Old Navy circa 2003 that was like magic.  It somehow fit when I was 20 lbs up or 20 lbs down.  At some point the lining became wonky on it and peeked out from the over layer and *it looked like it was supposed to do that*.  It was appropriate for many occasions.  I wore it for probably 8 years, spring to mid-fall, some of those years once a week in the summer.  I think I may have paid 20 bucks for it.	episode_done:True

It's my favorite jacket I've owned so far (apart from a lightweight bomber) and I find it both stylish and useful. I also love long jackets.  edit: I did not see which sub I was in sorry.

If someone wore a coat/jacket inside my house, I would take it as a sign that I either need to turn my heating up or they are being rude and signalling that they don't want to stay long.	labels:This is so enlightening for me. My family does this (wears our jackets inside). I'm not talking a jean jacket or a light exercise jacket. I'll wear like a down coat inside the house. Now I know why people think it's weird if I keep my coat on! I wonder how many times people thought I was trying to make a hasty exit...
text:I'm sure there are dozens of you.   Kidding aside, why do your family do that? Are you cold all the time?	labels:Yeah, pretty much. Growing up, our living room was an addition to our home, and it didn't connect to our central heating. We just had a woodburning fireplace, but that wasn't enough to really be comfortable. Even though I now live in a thoroughly heated apartment, I just never broke the habit of always keeping my coat on.	episode_done:True
text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Expand your definition of "statement piece" to include texture, pattern, silhouette, and x-factors instead of just colors vs neutrals. A shiny pant makes a statement even if it's black. An oversized blazer makes a statement even if it's tan. A snake print bag or skirt  makes a statement even if it's shades of brown or grey.   Some other ideas that might help: make color decisions based on seasons - if you have a lot of winterwear you love in a certain color scheme, start there and weed out what doesn't go with those faves, and so on with the other seasons. Make pinterest boards with the colors you're considering. Take pictures of combinations you like. Consider what colors you like best on yourself.	episode_done:True

text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:What i have found really fun is to go on etsy and have vendors make clothing custom to your size. A more affordable option is Eshakti where you can input your measurements and adjust the garment to fit you perfectly.  They have many cute options and you know it will fit because its made for you! The custom size costs only $9 on top of the garment price which is super affordable!
text:Have you ever used eShakti?  I'm similar to the OP here and have had my eye on them, but am a bit wary of inflated hopes!!	labels:Yes, I have! I have multiple dresses from them. I was very happy with he purchase. I also ordered some for my mom and sister and sis in law and they all loved it. The customization options are amazing and you can really make something that is 100% your style. I get compliments on my eshakti dresses all the time. People are like : wow that fits you perfectly.  And it does because it was made for me. :)	episode_done:True

text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I think if you don't mind pairing two (or more) different bright colors together, then a small but really colorful capsule could totally work.  Coincidentally, it would also probably be far more interesting to look at than the typical "four neutrals and two accents" type of capsule :).  To me, the key to making this work is keeping your colors generally in the same level of saturation and keeping them either cool or warm.  It's easy to match a saturated cool blue with a saturated cool red, rather than a warm red.
text:That's very true! I'll have to pull out my clothes and see if I can make any good matches with what I have so far. I like to wear a lot of blues, greens, and purples, but also warmer fall colors too. I have pink undertones (the cooler colors) and auburn hair (the warmer tones), so it's a fine line between the two color palettes for me as far as what looks good on me.	labels:Also, your neutrals do not have to be traditional ones.  I use light pink and burgundy as neutral options in my wardrobe. They work with almost everything.	episode_done:True
text:Do you think that designer brands will no longer be as sought after in the future?	labels:No but I think the focus of how luxury is defined will shift.  The silhouette may be very simple but materials and tech & safety features will be better in luxury items.. real luxury will be safety and healt features.. RFID blocking pockets, antiviral coatings, temperature regulating fabrics.  I solidly believe that luxury fashion will move into star trek future wear. I hope that fashion becomes democratized, too.  It will, by necessity unfortunately, need to become dual purpose. SPF will not be optional in a few decades, for example.  But art, and fabric art, and beautiful things and aesthetics are not going anywhere. I hope artists always make beautiful things for people to wear!	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts on Shein?	labels:I've had a hit-or-miss experience with them.   I mostly use Shein for scrapbook supplies and cheap earrings. I've gotten a few t-shirts and a swimsuit from there and they've been the same quality as what you'd find at mall brands like Forever21 or H&M. But the last time I tried to order more "dressy" tops, what came in the mail was either totally see-through (despite not being sheer on the model) or a really uncomfortable fabric. I probably wouldn't order Shein clothes for an important event, but they have some nice things if you stick to the items with good reviews. And pay attention to the size chart! It changes depending on what you buy.	episode_done:True

text:The vanishing line are my go-to, as well. Not only for the panty line reduction, but they don't ride up. It's great.  I'm also a big fan of the lace at the leg style. Cant remember the name, but it's a similar cut, and I rarely have issues with lines or riding in them.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:Pretty much anything that is cut slim/fitted and in a bunch of neutral colors with no labels or graphics, and is also cheap and not made for only plus sizes or older women. I was slightly underweight as a young adult and I couldn't find anything that wasn't fast fashion and not neon colors/age appropriate and also affordable at the time to throw together for multi-purposeful outfits (2006-2012ish.)  Also I can only find robes, nightgowns or winter-wear for the house that's either for teenagers, little girls, frumpy motherhood type stuff or housecoats for the elderly. Nothing just straight up 'average adult that just wants something with no graphics  and durable.' Closest thing I could find was fuzzy pjs that were neon pink and polkadot that also ripped after a couple wears, or I had to shop in the men's department.

text:Effortless style - let's exchange tips and tricks	labels:I mean, I'm not sure my actual effortless looks would fit your definition of effortless, because its a dress, nice shoes, and braided hair with some basic jewelry i almost always wear - it takes less than five minutes,  but probably is not appropriately tousled.
text:Same for me, except I don't even braid my hair, just comb it lol. The tousled hair look seems anything but effortless to me nowadays, like it looks great and more power to you if you have the patience to style it, but I don't wanna spend that time or money on it.  If we're talking effortless, I don't put on makeup either. Absolutely nothing against anyone who does, but I don't do it because 1) I don't want to spend the time on it and 2) I don't want to normalize that my skin needs to be covered up to be considered presentable on a daily basis.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your fiction and or nonfiction plans and outfits? What are the things you want to wear just to wear?	labels:\+1 for the shiny midi skirt idea :)  Christmas day fasion is easy: surgical gown and white tyvek PPE will be my ensemble.  Which means my dear husband will do all the cooking (as he does every year!) and I will get to relax and do nothing apart from eat when I get home.   So for the evenings at home, something easy and simple, one of my vintage Laura Ashley floral tea dresses would be perfect with nothing more than a pair of black tights. No make-up and some fancy braids in my hair and that's it.  Everything is shut and visiting outside of your immediate household "bubble" is banned but that isn't going to stop me dressing up for the evenings. Cute and fun will be the general idea.
text:Might I suggest layering some sort of chunky knit patterned sweater with your tights, floral dress, and braids ensemble then lounging in exaggerated poses all over the house for the full Vogue experience.	labels:Yes!  I will find a classic Christmas sweater for maximum effect.   Suggestions for shoes?  Thigh high, high heel patent leather boots maybe or pair of strappy heels...?	episode_done:True

I love the fit of everything from The Tie Bar but I hate the fact that they only have like two shirts with button down collars.

text:General Discussion - December 19, 2020	labels:So I know this has been a problem since the dawn of online multiplayer, but it really bums me out how disrespectful people are in these online competitive games. I was in a situation where our team had won the match but because I wasn't playing \*as\* optimally as a few of my teammates would have liked, they all started trash talking me over voice comms after the match was over. It's such a bummer because it turns me off from wanting to play, even if I enjoy the game itself.  /end nerd rant
text:i played a few games competitively when i was a teenager and 90% of why i decided to quit was because people would rage in chat at me constantly and it was such a drag because i was just trying to improve or have fun. most were fine but it's not fun to go into every game wondering if the person i'm playing is going to rage and pm me slurs and call me shitty if they lose lol. it really turned me off gaming and on the rare occasions i play now i just mute everyone. was lucky enough to never play a game with voice chat though, that sounds horrible	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:I'm hoping those "Is it Wine o'clock?" shirts (or anything involving  women drinking wine to deal with life) you find at any mall store/Target directed towards adults.   Perhaps it's because I can no longer pass as a youth and will no doubt get thrown into the demographic these companies sell to, but it's always painful when you start to see a trend in clothes and you hate it, and it lasts YEARS.
text:I'd love for those to go out of style, but I think they might double down with quarantine+wine shirts.  On a related note, i hate the workout tanks with slogans like "Namastay in bed" or "Coffee Please!" or anything else in that genre.	labels:honestly any clothing with silly catchphrases or puns on them is horrific
text:I don't think I've ever seen one that didn't make me wince. The only exception (and only barely) are shirts for specific locations or events that have an associated tagline.  Edit: Although, not gonna lie, I perform as a clown and my clown self LOVES a hardcore cringey t-shirt.	labels:Do you have a clown-aware therapy group to discuss what your clown self's choices say about your non-clown self?

text:Best and Worst Purchase of 2020	labels:Best purchase: bought a burberry trench coat. I was on the fence about it but had heard so many good things, so, I decided to just go for it. I swear it is the best trench coat out there.    Worst purchase: bought a couple of Natasha denona pallettes in the summer. I expect the packaging to be good for the price point but I was disappointed. Some shades just fell out of the pan as soon as I opened it. Also, there's a weird condensation on the mirror whenever I open it. I store them in a pretty dry place, idk what's the issue.
text:What makes a Burberry trench superior to other trenches? So curious!	labels:It's waterproof and warm. So I can use it when it raining and not just in the winter. The quality is amazing so it's gonna last a long time. Also, it looks very flattering.	episode_done:True

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:Punk rock saved me from being ridicule for being lower middle class cause you can rip things up, wear a bunch of tank tops and little boys superhero shirts from walmart and just jeans with a belt or whatever. That was my style from 12 to 18 and now I am into anything and everything. Definitely was all about the forever 21 in my early 20s. Then addiction issues, so just wore my friends clothes who wore the same size. Currently love thrifting and new stuff but don't get to shop very often. I'd say currently I'm pastel goth/boho/grunge. A lot of my stuff is from friends and family and just an amalgamation. Definitely was all about the forever 21 in my early 20s. Love cords, cropped jackets, band tees, overalls, sundresses, 90s shit.   Oh and also I have haunted tours pre Pandemic so I have TONS if costumes. And I tiedye so lots of that too!	episode_done:True
text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:I'm not sure where the dividing line is between leggings, workout pants, and actual pants. I bought a pair of what Costco calls ' Skechers Ladies' High Waist Pants', I would call them leggings.  I wore them a couple of times and just went back for another 2 pairs.  Costco has them in grey, black, and burgundy. $19.99 with a $4.00 off at checkout ($2.00 more on-line).  4 slim pockets. Perfect length for me. From XS to XXL, and Costco sizes generously. A slight compression feel, so snug-fitting. They are so much nicer than they look online. I don't wear them with a tucked-in shirt - perfect for flannel shirts, button-downs, longer Ts etc. I'm wfh and they are so comfortable,	episode_done:True

text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I think a lot of these rules come from old fashion norms that are meant to make people look as thin as possible so I hope they become a thing of the past! I remember once seeing in a magazine not to wear turtlenecks or high waisted pants if you have big boobs and that's basically all I wear. I think the example picture was Jessica Simpson and I thought she looked gorgeous in that outfit.  I also love mixing black and navy.

I'm 5'3" but I'm short waisted so I figure my legs are probably about average length. have a 28" inseam. 7/8 are always a little too short.   I recent bought TWO different pairs of leggings, from two different vendors, that claimed a 28" inseam. Like hell. They're too long. I measured that shit and they're both 29.5".

Something that says "woodland creature" but also "able to walk". After that, loading up on cute, flattering tops in different colors and patterns. I've been slowly phasing black out of my wardrobe as I realize cats and black clothes are incompatible if you don't want to look linty all the time. This would be a great time to grab some colorful clothes that would fill holes that black shirts left. The last two things I'd want is leggings, which I have a criminally small amount of for someone who hates pants as much as I do, and more PJs.

You can take out the liner and use it as a rain/spring coat. Everything attaches by buttons, including a heavier liner for the hood and faux-fir trim. I just looked for it on their website and couldn't find it! Anyway, eventually I did buy myself a black one (always kind of regretted not getting the light green colour) and I've worn it for years. I just noticed that it is starting to wear through in high-rub places and felt grateful to this winter staple that has served me so well. I bought a long super puff to replace it. So far, I am loving the warmth and comfort of the super puff.

A lot  of it is going to be trial and error and just time. People's opinions and tastes change over time.   As far as inspiration, I'd say you can find it anywhere. There's a ton of great stuff on instagram, but you can also find it in movies, music, literature, etc.  I'd say look for something that gives you some form of joy or happiness and go from there.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:That's helped me too! I'll see something stunning online but the list is a reminder that I don't buy spaghetti strap tops or maxi skirts cause they look strange on me.	labels:Yes haha I always have to remind my self that I don't like most off-shoulder shirts/sweaters because they never stay in the right spot lol.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 29	labels:How can I start taking care of my hair / deal with split ends?  I'm 21, and over the past couple months I've started getting more into fashion and taking care of myself. Buying new clothes and shoes, taking care of myself, etc etc.  However, the area I'm completely lost in is my hair. I've never used shampoo or hair products any more than just a generic bottle of cheap shampoo. My hair is currently just down to my shoulders, and it's kind of a mess. There's a lot of split ends, and it's messy - but not in the 'intentionally done to look good' type of messy.  I want to start taking better care of my hair, so how would I go about doing that? First priority would be taking care of the split ends, shampoo recomendations (I don't even really know the difference between shampoo and conditioner tbh), things like that.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!
text:Split ends need to be cut, no way around it. Go to a *good* barber, ask them to fix up your split end (likely quite a lot of hair will have to go to get rid of all of them and make the cut still look even) and ask them for a shampoo recommendation.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Which higher end brands do you find to be "worth it" and for what?	labels:I love comfortable shoes. Aquazzura has comfortable, stylish heels. Eileen Fisher has less stylish, more comfortable shoes. I have not been impressed with Cole Haan lately. (I have loafers that are 5 years old that are comfortable, and shoes that are 2 years old that I regret buying.) I also like Lanvin shoes, but only have two pairs so not sure if my experience can be applied to all their shoes.  I hate Chanel espadrilles. They're insanely uncomfortable.  I don't like Commes des Garcons clothes are worth it. They feel like fast fashion quality with their brand slapped on.   Loro Piana cashmere is a fucking dream, but $$$$$$.   I have a Burberry leather jacket and the leather is nice. I can't speak to its durability because I've only worn it a handful of times.   Most of my every day clothes come from COS and Allsaints (on sale). Durable and drapes nicely at a reasonable price.
text:+1 for Lanvin shoes! I have several pairs, mostly heels and they are comfortable. My oldest pair is from 2010 - they still look great after being worn 3-5 times a month. All I do (with all my shoes, actually) is wipe them down or brush them depending on finish at the end of the day before they go back in their boxes and have the heels/soles fixed as soon as it becomes necessary.	labels:	episode_done:True

I've worn a few almost everyday for 5-6 years now and there are no signs of it ever deteriorating. Truly a r/buyitforlife they are quite pricey but they're fucking amazing quality.    Wings + Horns or Reigning Champ tiger fleece hoodie. Indestructible material, texture looks great. Nothing fancy, but looks great on it's own with just jeans.   Uniqlo jeans. Amazing quality for its price. I've now own two of the same black jeans and I wear them almost everyday   Uniqlo basic tees. After W+H these are what I wear. Super simple but lasts long for its price and fits great. Soft material.   Engineered Garments wool cinch vest. Very flexible. Can be worn over a long sleeve tee, sweater or even a hoodie. Great for layering   Wings + Horns flannel. Bought a zip flannel from them back in 2010? I'm only getting rid of it now because the sleeves have finally ripped.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 25, 2020	labels:What is the custom or culture around wearing an inherited doctor's ring?  A few years ago, I was given my grandfather's ring that he got as a PHD in literature, and now, with a masters under my belt and having not only completed my academic journey, but gotten through some really, really rough times over the past few years, I feel like I have grown enough as a person to wear it.  But is there anything saying I shouldn't? Any custom on what to do with it, if I can wear it or if that would be looked down upon etc. The whole "I don't have a doctorate, can I wear this inherited ring?"
text:I don't think there is any culture around it.  It's a family keepsake. Wear it if you want to, or don't.  A ring isn't what bestows or marks a PhD (*unless you have a Stone of Jordan).	labels:Custom is different in Scandinavia, where the ring is a social signifier of academic acheivement, similar to military medals or such.  In the states, I believe theologians with a PhD can (and often choose) to wear similar rings.

I have an abnormal shape (PEAR HIPS PEAR HIPS PEAR HIPS) and so during covid it's basically impossible for me to get good fitting clothes. I played the "buy shit and send it back cause it doesn't fit" game for too long lol.   Any recommendations for such services? I googled a bit but I'm interested in the best quality service, not the one that's best at hitting the frontpage of google.

text:Stockings vs Tights vs Leggings	labels:I wear fleece tights with knee high heat tech socks over them to help combat wind. This year I'm going to try thigh high socks over them to see if it will be warm enough for mini skirts. If you can get a maxi skirt that has cold proof materials in it like wool, then that will help too. Bonus points if it has a lining, if it doesn't then you can buy a separate one to wear underneath.

I have saved searches on my favorite brands that I know I can get for a great price there. That being said, I'm taking a break from ThredUp because I've had terrible experiences with the last 3 orders I made with them where I ended up returning almost all of it. They've been bad about listing something as "you might mistake it for brand new!" and then when it arrives there is definite fading that wasn't apparent in the photos, obvious lightening under the arms, pilling, etc. Very frustrating.

For me it's mostly a mental thing - when I get fully dressed up for work, I'm psychologically in work mode.  I should mention that I always overdress in my position (to the point where it's a part of my work persona), so it's not out of line in my colleagues' eyes.

But it was only one time I felt it was really bad  &  wished I had the option to change.  A coworker of mine did have a major blow out of his pants. Just owned it and told everyone before anyone even noticed.  Used maybe a sweater to try to cover it up.  Whenever things start normalizing keeping a bag at work with some spares, a tooth brush, etc might be kinda nice...	labels:	episode_done:True
text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:I tend to go black-heavy with clothing anyway, but especially when I'm rocking the crazy hair.   The only real planning I put into it is trying to avoid color combinations that evoke holiday vibes or something I'm specifically not wanting. With my fire engine red, I avoided wearing green, except for Christmas, for example.	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I switched jobs and the dress "code" went from frilly/preppy to casual (but no jeans). It really threw me for a loop when I started to realize that I hated everything I owned. I had accumulated things that helped me fit into my previous role but I didn't like the clothes at all. So I not only had to fit into a new work environment, but I also had to figure out what I actually liked and what made me.. feel like me (mild existential crisis anyone?)  I utilized the book "The Curated Closet" as well as the author's blog to help. It took a couple of years to honestly figure out what I liked and didn't like but I'm glad I went through the process. I donated much of what I owned and it helped me process the fact that I was trying to fit in instead of trying to be myself for a very, very long time.	episode_done:True

There were some tears in the lace but that can be replaced easily or covered by long hair. It also doesn't fit my body type but it's so pretty I had to get it.	episode_done:True

text:How do you challenge yourself?	labels:I branch out when I watch a new TV show and I really like the main character's style. I will buy one or two things that are really 'them'.  But then I always end up not feeling like myself. So I'll either immediately return those things, or I'll wear them a lot for three months and suddenly snap out of it one morning, like, 'what was I thinking?' and push them to the back of my closet.  So now, when I have that itch, I just add everything to my shopping cart and then close the tab and go to bed.	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Let's Talk About Purses	labels:I don't like ever being unprepared so I always like to have a light sweater and my laptop with me, as well as a full down parka, a tent, a sleeping bag, my pistol, a mid-size portable generator, some snacks, several chickens, gold bars in case society falls to ruin and paper currency is rendered worthless, kleenex, and my favorite lipstick. Does anyone have any stylish but functional suggestions? For the time being I've been unhinging my jaw like a snake and fitting everything down my gullet till I need it, but space is limited and I'd like to be able to carry a few more essentials. I really am a purse person.

text:Most jackets have a polyester filling that's not a knock just not a plus	labels:How do they compare though? Wellensteyn jackets have DuPont Sorona filling. It's Elastomultiester.  EDIT: Also keep in mind that these jackets cost 300 euros plus.	episode_done:True
text:What is something you've heard as fashion advice that isn't worth following?	labels:I'm an hourglass shape, and I always read the advice of "accentuate your waist" online. But it doesn't work for me, or a lot of people who don't like form-fitting clothes, because I like to *hide* my feminine figure rather than emphasizing it. Let me live my life as an amorphous, androgynous blob thx.
text:I'm kind of an hourglass and love fitted tees but I realized recently that I'm actually more of an inverted triangle. They say to add more more weight to the bottom to balance out your top, but I'll just keep showing off my upper body, thanks. I like my bust and I'm proud of my muscular arms.

Color 8 CXL  Bathing trunks?  Color 8 slides  Warm colors?  Cool colors?  Florida summer colors?  Color 8.  Burgundy pants?  Fuck it, color 8.
text:Color 8 shell looks so good with denim, it hurts.	labels:I'm exaggerating of course, but color 8 is my answer when my kid asks me my favorite color.	episode_done:True
text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Cons: People think I'm crazy  Pros: Other crazy people recognize me as their own. Regular people are not as startled when I act weird or talk about weird stuff.  I wear a lot of very unusual clothes that I make myself. A lot of them are inspired by historical fashion and videogame characters, but there are elements that are sort of hippie or vaguely goth/theatrical. A lot of what I wear is exceedingly lazy in essence, but people don't really notice, I think. I also have a very... medieval view on colors - specifically I consider the idea that some colors clash to be just a nasty rumor.  Also, I am autistic. I figured out that it pays to advertise. People are less weird about some of my odd behaviors (that I can't really help) if they get a heads up in the form of a huge lavishly embroidered long red skirt and a baby-pink viking style coat and a bright green shawl. And a pale purple puffy pointy hat that looks like the tower top of an ortodox church.

text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:I love buying men's shirts and clothes in general and usually put a belt, stitch it up or vest or sweater over it to make it feminine. Usually I give it an thought or two before I buy it before making that purchase over women's clothing.	episode_done:True
text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:A green plaid blazer that isn't fast fashion. Something with real weight, you know? So like wool or something. It's my thriftshop dream.	episode_done:True
text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:In a perfect world, everything I own would be able to go in the washing machine and dryer. I have a lot of environmental allergies, so I wash all of my clothes after each wear. That said, if there's a piece I really love that says hand wash or even dry clean (and it's priced such that it won't be the end of the world if I ruin it), I'll put it in the machine on delicate with cold water and hang it to dry. Most things I've done that to survive just fine. The things that are less likely to survive are delicate fringed hems/mesh/beading, so I try to avoid that, even if I love the aesthetic. Rayons can shrink, so cold water is important. Polyester can usually take a lot of abuse, even if the label says otherwise.  The only thing that I bother to actually hand wash are ballgowns. Those get washed in the bathtub with mild soap, rinsed, and hung to dry. Usually with ballgowns I do a focused scrub on the armpit area to get out any deodorant stains/odors, and don't use much friction on the rest of the dress.	episode_done:True

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:Buy less and buy used whenever feasible is my motto.   Pretty much my entire work wardrobe is thrifted. The thrift store is amazing for turtlenecks, sweaters, and blazers. Pants and layer tees can be a bit harder.
text:Agreed. Buy next to nothing is the only answer that's justifiable. People talk about buying less fast fashion  and become more consumer conscious, but the talk still consantly involves *buying* yourself a sustainable wardrobe.  There's no such thing as sustainably buying something new, frankly because in 99 percent of cases it's not because we don't have a pair of pants. It's because we don't have a particular color or function kind of pants.  Stop buying, that's the only answer, so asking this on a sub that's about fashion just doesn't make sense. We can't be fashionable and renew our closet and at the same time shop conscious.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Tips To Spice Up Wardrobe	labels:I agree with the commenter below to work what you already have in different ways. A lot of people think they need a new wardrobe or a lot of new items, but really it's often just wearing things they already have differently. This can also help with deciding what you do really need to get the look you want also. Definitely look for outfit inspiration if you feel stuck with ideas.	episode_done:True

text:The 90s Are Back. Long Live the 70s.	labels:Anyone know what the pattern is called on the blazer that's on the first image or where to find something like that?
text:There are a few images - which one are youa asking about?	labels:First image
text:Prince of Wales Plaid.  Oh, you mean the first blazer, not the first image.  It's hard to see, but it looks like it could be houndstooth.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What niche do you feel is missing from the fashion blogging/YouTube world?	labels:Adult goth/ punk/ alt fashion is something I'd like to see. I'm talking more tasteful and stylized than the full blown, head to toe Killstar or Dolls Kill aesthetic that's been cultivated recently. I'm 35 and always learning how to "age up" my look over the years, without looking too silly.
text:Holy shit, yes. I've been trying to perfect this "style" for years, because it's truly what I feel reflects me. However, I can never find style inspiration because the second you let the word alternative, punk, edgy, or goth slip through, you get -- how you describes so precisely -- head to toe Killstar.	labels:You know what's helped me is looking up our foremothers and their evolving aesthetics over the years. Like Siouxie Sioux in the 90s and 00s, Vivienne Westwood, and Helena Bonham-Carter all look chic but have an edge to them that's very distinct. I've got a couple of Killstar and TrippNYC pieces, but pair them with more toned down aspects so it's not like a 2009 Tumblr flashback haha
text:That's such a great suggestion! I always struggle looking for style photos for inspiration, but I never thought to look back at people like this.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism? I love it, but how do you do it?	labels:Based on that album, I guess I am maximal about half of the time! :D  I think the easiest thing to do is to start small.  If you wear a lot of solids and neutrals - dip your toe in with a great coat. A coat in a fun color, maybe even a patterned coat. Wear that daily.  If you don't want to commit to a coat, get one "loud" patterned item. The easiest way to pair it is to pull out one of the colors in the pattern and that is what you wear it with. Instead of using the neutral, use one of the accent colors.  And number 3 is color blocking. That one is super easy. You just pick two solids, but skip the neutrals. Tone on tone is fun, as well as things that are near opposites on the color wheel.  I have yet to master pattern mixing, that is one of my goals.	episode_done:True

text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I found Verillas on Facebook, and now own 2 of their kilts, 2 shirts, and 5 pairs of shorts from them. ( I only order during sales and usually get 50 % off, including on the leather kilt which was $200 down from $400. Please don't judge me, I've never spent over $100 on a single item of clothing except for a bridesmaid dress, but this kilt is my absolute dream clothing item.)  The quality is amazing, the style is totally me, and i would dress in them head to toe if i could afford to. I read a ton of reviews before my first order, so i was reasonably certain it wouldn't be a rip-off.	episode_done:True
text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:It sounds stupid, but making a concious decision to not dress uncomfortably was a huge help for me. Make a list of your most uncomfortable clothes. Address each one - what's an alternative to it?
text:This is a great tip and now I know how I'll be spending my time off.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I hope it's okay for me to reply to this, even though I am not exactly missing regular clothes and lipstick. I am 55 and this has been a really good test to see how I might be able to transition to retirement which I hope is earlier rather than later. Until COVID I thought it might be difficult as I would miss getting dressed and wearing fancy clothes. Until COVID I hated athletic/casual gear and sneakers.   Since COVID I am getting more and more comfortable going around bare faced with clunky sneakers and athletic/casual gear.   Have not packed on any pounds, but working very slowly towards losing pounds.   Have also not yet packed up / given away/ decluttered my work clothes. Not yet. Not yet.   Was walking on the trails this weekend and there were some women wearing booties rather than sneaks, jeans rather than leggings, sweaters rather than hoodies... and kind of looked ridiculous. But I do get it.	episode_done:True
text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:Wore a white knee-length skirt to High School the day I got my period. Bled all over it. Worst part is this asshole guy who loved to harass me was MAKING FUN OF ME FOR IT, and I wanted to cry. One of my friends heard what happened and tore him a new asshole in our gym class in front of everyone. She was glorious.	episode_done:True
text:Help with 2020 post-COVID scrubs style	labels:Hospital social worker, new to scrubs during COVID. I love my Figs bottoms. I wear hospital logo tees and a track jacket style zip up often.  I feel like even with scrubs, you can cultivate a style. Badass lady surgeon with a no nonsense scrub cap? Nice friendly nurse with holiday themed scrub jacket? Ready for action floor staff with snappy tennis shoes and an athletic headband? I personally lean towards my more fitted bottoms, a clean pair of stability running shoes that only live at work, and a wide yoga-style headband. And the makeup setting spray to protect against the mask smudgies, don't forget that.	episode_done:True

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:Classically styled boots: LL Bean. I have a pair of brown riding boots that are over 10 years old and I may very well be buried in them, because that's how well they're holding up.   I've replaced the heels a couple of times (expected) and had my cobbler repair a small hole in the leather where it was creasing over time. You can only tell where the repair is if you're looking for it. But the boots are full grain leather and take polish like a dream.
text:This is a ringing endorsement! I will look at LL Bean the next time I need hiking boots.	labels:Hiking boots are a different story. They wear out by definition and aren't BIFL items. I generally go for Merrill or Keen because I can get about 500 miles out of them before the tread wears down. Resoling treaded shoes like hiking boots or work boots is rarely cost effective (I've checked).
text:I also recommend Eddie Bauer, whose quality I generally find to be what LL Bean used to be in terms of quality, plus excellent warranty/returns policy.  I've had a pair of their winter snow boots for like 20 years.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Denim Jacket as a Layering Piece	labels:As a mid layer, it looks forced and unnatural to me. I am curious about others thoughts, does this look good to anyone?
text:I like it, especially when worn under a longer coat.  the cropped jacket versus the longer over coat is cool to me.  Plus like, every one wears their denim jackets over a hoodie. Its been a super common look for a minute now. I think this is a good sometimes option, to try something new.   Personally, I try not to wear the same outfit more than once (although i do have fall back go-to formulas).  so if you're like me, or you just want to try something new, i think this is an option for switching things up, it gives you an other option to work with for fall.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:I'm in a ambivalent state of mind right now. For a like over a year now I have been into streetwear. Baggy, oversized clothes with lots of prints and branding. This was my first period of taking clothing serious and feeling "fashionable". But one can only see so many of the "same" outfits.  I grew really tired of streetwear in the last couple of weeks but I'm scared to leave my comfort zone. I'm 20 years old but feel like dressing like a teenager. I really really like graphic tees if the prints are well done and If I would imagine dressing like lets say Tim Dessaint for example, who is not into graphics/"crazyness" at all, It would feel too "mature" for my age if that makes sense.  But at the very same time, I feel like im dressing too childish when wearing cargo pants + graphic tee.  Am I overthinking this?

text:How do you feel about vegan/faux leather?	labels:I've gotten two pairs of vegan leather pants from Aritzia and they're just kind of disappointing. They look so glamorous on the models but I feel sort of squeaky and uncomfortable with them. I think buying secondhand leather items is better in terms of quality and environmental impact than faux leather.
text:All the influencers try to act like Aritiza's faux leather is god's gift to earth and is way higher quality than other places. Idk, if I'm buying (plastic) faux leather pants they're going to be for $25 from H&M. I'll spend the big bucks on real leather and I buy mostly secondhand anyway so I usually get a good deal on it.  I'll gladly pay more for Aritzia's wool, cashmere, and linen but every time I see people rave about their faux leather I get a little mad lol.	labels:Honestly I am over their cashmere as well.

XP their accessories are another story however.	labels:I highly disagree, at least for a woolen sweater I have. It is so sturdy and warm and not itchy at all! No fuzzy fibers falling off, which happens to every single Aritzia sweater I own. And usually if I get a size up for the oversized look, it looks really baggy and weird at the shoulders and waist. Not so with this purposefully oversized sweater. I can't imagine finding anything of similar quality and cut at Aritzia, Zara, or other similar stores. I'm sure I could find something similar if I expanded my budget, but I paid $500 for this sweater and it was worth it imo.	episode_done:True

The day after that will always have a narrow selection, so avoid it.  * Measure your best-fitting items while laying flat. This will help you determine what fits if you can't try stuff on. You can even bring a little tape measure with you to the store.	episode_done:True
text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:My ADHD is a big factor for me. I have poor impulse control, and I am prone to hyperfocus on "that one thing I want" until I get it. A brain like mine also craves novelty, so I'm never finished shopping and the thing I coveted two months ago is now part of my everyday life. It's a problem.

Academic femme is totally my new England jam. Bah	labels:I live in Mexico so I know what you mean with not being able to wear the clothes you want...it's just something you'll have to accept. It sucks when it's 90 degrees outside and you're scrolling through Instagram and all these influencers are wearing cute thick sweaters...so many trendy things just don't work in tropical weather. In the end, climate always wins haha.
text:Climate definitely always wins. I don't think I've truly wrapped my head around the change in weather, going from a place with 4 seasons and 1-2m of snow a year to tropical monsoon climate where it gets below 10C/50F like once a decade. I went through my clothes and gave my friend a whole trash bag of just winter work clothes. At least we're moving down during the dry/cooler season. Showing up in the beginning of the summer would be awful. Gonna melt for the first first year until we get used to it.	labels:It's definitely a huge adjustment! I completely understand. And it makes you realize just how much the fashion world is biased towards places with traditional 4 season weather. I feel like I've had to create an entirely new persona since moving to Mexico 3 years ago because so much of my wardrobe didn't work here.	episode_done:True

I can never understand why everyone says they're more comfortable than mid-rise jeans. And because it's in fashion, it's difficult for me to find a jean that looks good but isn't high waisted. Maybe it's because I was a teen in the 90s. I'm glad I'm not the only one!  And amen to the bra situation! I don't want to have to buy a new type of bra just so I can wear a certain type of shirt or dress.	episode_done:True
text:What are some stores/brands that have surprised you?	labels:Kirkland and Costco in general. I lost weight right at the beginning of the pandemic when fitting rooms were being closed and the only place I go outside of my house is costco to get groceries so I've started getting clothes there too. Prices are good, quality is good, and the return policy is amazing. I've been surprised with the quality of Kirkland brand leggings and tops and I've been able to restock my wardrobe with coats, basics, and work from home outfits (mostly leggings!) for very cheap. Recently got a plush, warm, long robe for only $9! And there are good online deals pretty regularly as well. They also have lower prices on designer clothing/purses/perfumes/make-up.
text:Almost all of my new clothes are from Costco. Eyeing that tie dye hoodie for $15 right now	labels:I got the Kirkland Signature sweatshirt and said I wouldn't get any other hoodies/sweatshirts for a while. The tie dye one is cute though!

text:2020 in Hindsight: A Year in Fashion — Die, Workwear!	labels:An excellent article, one that resonates with me deeply (especially the whole third section about longing to be seen). I hadn't read that New Yorker article by Rachel Syme before but I empathize with her tremendously. I've resolved that when I am vaccinated and this pandemic comes to a close, I'm going to dress to the nines every fucking day, and I've charged those close to me with holding me to it. I want to live intentionally, act intentionally, and dress intentionally. That is my path to self-actualize.  In the meantime, being part of a fashion community like MFA helps to fill that gap in my life and I really appreciate all of you for sharing your passion with me.
text:Deciding what to wear in the morning is definitely one of the things that gets me excited for the next day.   After moving onto StyleForum when I was focusing on menswear, coming back to MFA after a ~3-4 year hiatus and posting regularly on the WAYWT threads has been such a great experience.

text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:Definitely a distinct style, which my friends teasingly refer to as "grown up goth". All-black monochrome, hardware accents, drapey silhouettes, varied textures, lots of knits. Anything outside of this style is because there's a dress code.	episode_done:True

I literally have no ankles (a genetic thing, my aunt and father have no ankles as well. It's pretty much just leg then foot), and skinny jeans show them off alot. Also, I'm not curvy, and don't like showing myself off, so anything baggy is what I'm looking for. Trying to find pieces that resemble the 80s/90s eras, since I'm into the 70s/80s/90s. Graphic tees for bands in those eras, turtlenecks to layer underneath, stuff like that.	episode_done:True

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:> So where does that leave the consumer who has a closet full of items purchased at fast fashion retailers, but rarely makes new purchases and many of their current pieces have remained in their closet for years?   If you already have a closet full of fast fashion, taking good care of it and using it for as long as possible is the most ethical choice.  I'm in the same boat.  I'm doing a year of no new clothes/shoes purchases (only thrifted/poshmark) and I'm trying to only get things that are high quality and will last, even if they are used.    Most of these online clothing boutiques (at least the ones I see on Poshmark/Facebook/Instagram are not sourcing ethically produced items.  I'm sure there are some that are, but they all seem to have the same stuff and you can tell just from the photos that it's cheaply made.  Again, I haven't seen every online boutique there is so I'm sure there are some out there that are fine.	episode_done:True

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mum didn't really teach me much. She tried to teach me to like pink, frilly, typically girly clothes and failed dismally. She also then tried to teach me to dress and do makeup for conformity and to minimise any risk of standing out, which also failed (but did help fuel a bit of an identity crisis a bit later in life).  What I found annoying about all of that is before I moved in with her and my step dad (and before she moved in with him) she actually had quite a good sense of style, in a 70s way. But that transformed into what I'd call "middle class Home Counties" and cruise fashion style (the latter more for holidays).	episode_done:True

text:London street style Inspo (circa 1985-1990s)	labels:Hi all! This album is just a collection of street styles taken from London circa 1985-1990s by Mr. Shoichi Aoki.      I was very much surprised when going through the photos today because of how good the fits are considering they're mostly from the mid 80s. These looked like styles from the streets of Tokyo & Seoul but they turned out to from the UK instead. I know in terms of fashion many countries draw inspiration from each other but I never expected the folks in London to be so in command and stylish from such an early period!      Another pleasant surprise was how similar these fits look to the current trend of streetwear, high fashion / avantgarde style in the recent 2-3 years. If I had no clue of the year these photos were taken from, I wouldn't have a problem believing that they were from recent years.

text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:I have a few designer bags, but I bought them heavily discounted. I went through a PHASE and bought a bunch of bags, and now I'm done. I also regret spending thousands on waxed canvas??  I have a friend who fucks with reps and she's always concerned that someone will call her out for owning fakes. I wouldn't be able to deal with that constant stress, even if the bag were a really good knock off and I got a great deal (compared to retail) on it. I also think that the whole "they aren't QCing the bag, they're QCing you" is really fucking rude.  If I buy more bags, I wouldn't buy designer and stick to okay quality and mid-tier prices. There's nothing wrong with indulging if it's going to bring you joy, but I think that a lot of people drop $$$$ on a bag and then never  fully enjoy it because they're afraid of scuffing the leather.
text:Waxed canvas, lol. Yup. I got tons of that.  Worrying about people being able to tell you have a fake and being self conscious about it is not worth it.	labels:The self-consciousness wasn't worth it to me, either. I decided I was better off going quality no-name, since the brands I could afford were not doing anything I liked. One day I'll have the money for even a used name that I'm interested in, but for now I'll support a smaller operation.	episode_done:True

text:What niche do you feel is missing from the fashion blogging/YouTube world?	labels:Midsized women who want to be fashionable, but not in a professional/streetwear sense. I've found some size twelve ladies who dress neat and tidy and ready for law practice, and I follow some size 12 ladies who wear streetwear, but nobody wears anything of actual interest in that size between either spectrum. Anybody I do see not in those two categories seem to be more in a "Macy's catalogue, 2013" aesthetic.  I need someone with stomach pudge and jiggly thighs to show me what cool structural and interesting pieces I can pull off without me spending 10 days and 10k dollars at the store to find it.
text:Hm, my pudge and jiggle and I should start this blog. You're so on point re: Macy's catalogue 2013. Knitwear is the worst, that's the title of my first post.	labels:I would read the shit out of a blog like that. You should go for it!	episode_done:True

I'm anything between a 29 inch & 31/32 inside leg, depending on what type of trouser I'm going for. Does opting for slim fir, or trousers with stretch, make it better or worse?

I sort of knew this, but now it's something I'm conscious of, and will definitely be conscious of when I shop for new clothes.

I just treated myself to a leather kilt from Verillas that was half price, but still over $200 after taxes.

I know midriff scars are on a more noticeable part of your body, but I think you should work on being less self consious of them so you can wear the styles you want. If the scars bother someone, its on them not on you!	labels:I don't know if I'm self conscious or I just don't want anyone pointing at it and asking and having to tell the whole story! I wrestle with the idea of showing them or not
text:Say you fought a shark, just totally deadpan.  Other options are did surgery on Edward scissorhands, bear dentistry, crocodile ear piercings.. etc	labels:My mom always told my brother and I that her appendectomy scar was from a fight with a bear.

text:What female TV characters do you think are well-styled and worthy of imitation?	labels:I find my fashion is really similar to Britta from Community. The kind of fashion that's casual enough to be wearable every day, yet edgy and subtly upscale (if you looked up the retail price you'd find her in leather jackets that cost $450--I'm nowhere in that ballpark, but I'm a big believer in investing in wearable basics). She could easily have a capsule wardrobe if it weren't for the whole "big TV network, never-rewearing-outfits" thing.   Her jeans are always skinny and she likes to wear a lot of black. It me.
text:I've been rewatching it recently, and in the first season someone describes her as a vegan with an endless supply of leather jackets.

Others are dress shoes or loafers for warmer weather. Basically looking for something for a date in a casual-mid-level restaurant/bar that we will likely be outside under heat lamps for the next few month  What is everyone wearing for this sort of thing? Do I just do the clean white sneaker/trainer aesthetic but in black? A more casual style black Chelsea? Any other suggestions?  Me: Late 30s, but admittedly probably dress on the younger end for my age Budget: under $200, though less is better Location: Philadelphia (tends to be more casual than NYC, where I used to live)
text:Does it have to be black? I'd probably wear docs myself.	labels:Doesn't have to be black per se, but generally I think of my outfits and then have an idea if it would call for black or brown shoes. I feel like I currently like my Brown winter options but have a bit of a hole for black options. Maybe something like navy or gray could also work, but I'm just not visualizing right now, so here asking.

text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:I would't consider Sezane a paragon of originality at all. They are also copying someone.  Every season there is a grab bag of trends for people to interpret. This year we have big sleeves, chunky knits, and 70s office wear as the inspirations.   And each brand takes their spin, and washes it with their point of view. Sezane does its rendtiion in the classic, same for brands like J.Crew and Banana Republic. Madewell's version is a little hipster and boho takes on the same classics. Anthropogie is quirky femme takes on the trends. Gap would do the plainest version - yes to chunky knits but not super statement sleeves.  It is hard to deem a solid knit sweater as a knockoff, there are only so many versions you can make.
text:Yeah Sezane didn't invent bodysuits and pom sweaters, they're all copying from somewhere else and EVERYONE is making these. I think it's bullshit that it's only ever cheap brands that get called out.  When Sezane sells rip-offs, it's "inspired" or "trendy" (but in a ~timeless~ rich person way ofc), when a cheaper store does it, it's a "blatant rip-off" and "stolen intellectual property"?

At the end of the summer I discovered no-show socks and it was a huge _"OH"_ moment.	labels:Honestly you can always clean them if you want to, though.
text:in my experience, once they get the smell, there's no washing it out. even after washing, baking soda, the freezer, you wear them once after cleaning and the heat and sweat brings it out immediately again.	labels:Try UVC sterilizing lights.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 24, 2020	labels:What clothing should I wear to make my shoulders appear smaller?
text:You generally don't see a lot of clothing specifically designed for that purpose, and I'm not totally sure why you'd want to, but...  Avoid jackets with heavy shoulder padding. A natural shoulder can kind of accentuate the shoulder, but at least it won't exaggerate it.  Get jackets and shoulders that are wide in the body, so that the drop from shoulder to body seems less dramatic?  Large scale patterns make your body seem a little smaller, maybe. Since you're worried about shoulder width, you could try large horizontal scale and small vertical scale, if you find something like that.	labels:>You generally don't see a lot of clothing specifically designed for that purpose, and I'm not totally sure why you'd want to, but...

Things like baggier jeans, the high waisted trend (my early 20s was defined by low waisted pants), oversized clothing (think Billie Eilish), etc.  I see some of these styles and think "this should have stayed in the 90s".  The example I think about is Mom jeans.  Many millennials still remember the SNL skit where they made fun of them and how unflattering they are.  They made them look matronly and dowdy.  I can't bring myself to even go near them in the store without that SNL skit playing in my head.

text:Find your measurements and shop online. I'd suggest starting out at a department store like nordstroms, where you can shop a bunch of different brands that range from $-$$$. So many different brands and designers use different patterns, there is bound to be something out there that might work or come close.

If there some new fashion thing I'm insecure about I'll wear it when I'm doing stuff alone, like running errands by myself or something.   Also in my experience if you start "dressing up" for group outings people in your circle might start also dressing up. During my first office job everyone dressed really casually but most of my clothes were from when I worked my retail job. So I wore a lot of dresses and skirts with tights and everyone else wore jeans and t-shirts. I definitely got comments but it was literally all I had to wear. After a few months other people in the office started "dressing up" as well.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - February 15, 2021	labels:I don't know if anyone else can relate but I am trying to reboot my wardrobe with a more focused and coherent look. I am so excited now that I can see it beginning to take shape but I JUST WANT IT TO BE FINISHED!!!  Doesn't help that my tailor won't be back open for months :(  I'm thinking I'll take a break from participating in WAYWT threads for a while, until I am in a place where I am happy.
text:building slowly is the path to really treasuring each item :)	labels:I know and I have counselled patience to many people either starting out or doing what I am doing. I am just getting frustrated because I have a vision in my head for how I want to look and I simply can't implement it in the way I want at the moment. Incidentally I am moving into a more focused Ivy look, exactly as you suggested to me so thanks.
text:Mmm yeah I know what you mean for sure. It'll be that much better when it does happen then, excited to see how it develops!	labels:Thanks man, I am really excited to be able to put it out there for people to see.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 13, 2020	labels:I just showed the woman in seeing my new coat and she absolutely hates it, even though she tried to hide it because she's so nice.  I don't think I can wear it around her but it wasn't cheap.
text:If you like the coat just wear it	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I just go off on the vibe/mood I'm feeling that day, plus maybe the kind of setting I'll be going to. Sometimes I go sexier/tighter, other times I go more "proper," etc.-- it just depends on my mood and where I'm going. There are days when I really want a Jessica Rabbit moment, other days I feel like wrapping myself in oversized everything. The most important thing is I feel good and comfortable in my body and in my surroundings.	episode_done:True
text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:Short, skinny-ish male.  * Cropped trousers, sometimes with a significant drop-crotch or rise. This, apparently, isn't good if you're short. * Tabis with heels. Heeled anything on a male is usually not the norm. * Skinny jeans, but they're too skinny/my legs are too fat. My only options here, really, are cheap fast-fashion men's stretch jeans, or if I want anything more designer, women's denim leggings (or other materials, if I'm not trying to look like I'm wearing jeans.) * Long cardigans with hoods	episode_done:True
text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:I used to enjoy Victoria's Secret underwear, but the quality got really bad while the prices kept going up. I was just like "screw that".
text:I stopped buying VS undies when I had a newish pair literally fall apart on me. Aerie is like old VS quality, so I only buy from them now.	labels:Have you noticed Aerie's quality going down? I loved my pairs from the past few years but I bought some more earlier this year and they're a lot thinner and don't fit as well.
text:Yes! I have a couple pairs of underwear from four years ago that have literally outlasted more recent purchases!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 10, 2020	labels:I get that everyone else on MFA is a washed-up dusty old man who skipped being a teenager straight into adulthood and thus will never get what I'm about to say, but man it's so hard to feel properly angsty without wearing black. It's like I need a whole other wardrobe that's all Rick just for those days I'm feeling down and/or rebellious.
text:Nah, we get it. We just channeled that via listening to early 2000s emo and pop punk music instead. Jimmy Eat World, Weezer, Dashboard Confessional, My Chemical Romance, Panic!

Edit; also, no Deathcab?
text:Truly blanked on Deathcab. Could've included Bowling for Soup, Modest Mouse, Something Corporate, The Shins, Sum 41, Paramore, Less Than Jake, and Yellowcard too. I'm sure I'm missing even more.	labels:God, Something Corporate's She Paints Me Blue was the soundtrack to my time going through puberty, same with like LifeHouse.  The Shins replaced them when I discovered Scrubs.  Recently we were listening to the worst versions of that genre: Hinder, 3 Doors Down and my all time fav: Daughtry.	episode_done:True

text:The Business of Markups on Logo T-Shirts. Why You Shouldn't Drop $600 on a Gucci Tee	labels:Yeah pretty standard. T-shirts, hats, wallets, keychains, etc etc.  These are often the highest volume products. The customer cant afford the 5,6,7 figure bag/dress/suit, but they will spend the money on the shirt.  Its a way to get a piece of the luxury brand.  The people who buy those brands that are wealthy and can afford whatever... often (but sometimes) dont buy those "entry level" items.  So if you know your shit, you can look at a branded item and know who it is meant for.  And like any brand, they have certain quality requirements for the different levels of product. Those entry level pieces are meant for the "masses" so they get the lower end of care/quality.

text:General Discussion - December 26, 2020	labels:Been thinking about using some Christmas money on sewing patterns and books to fuck around to try to make my own unstructured sack jackets, high rise trousers, and outerwear. The catalyst has been wanting the Beams+ corduroy patchwork balmacaan, but not willing to pay for it, and just getting frustrated that I can't find any sack jackets (vintage or new) or pants in the fabrics I want for a price I'm willing to pay.  Am I crazy to think that's a reasonable endeavor? I'm concerned I've got some hubris about it since my mom was a family and consumer ed teacher and I've made quilts and shit with her in the past.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 16, 2020	labels:Does Levi's even make non-stretchy jeans anymore? Got a pair of (non-stretchy) 510s secondhand and they're the best jeans I've ever worn. Can't find another similar pair anywhere.  &#x200B;  I've tried the outlet stores, Macy's and similar. I even called the hotline, which gave me an ID# for the stretchy 510s.
text:There are plenty of non-stretch 510s on eBay.	labels:Thanks! I've looked around there and am struggling with how to phrase the search. I've tried -stretch -flexfit (can't do -spandex or -elastane as the ones I'm looking for are actually 2% elastane).
text:Try including the terms "deadstock" and/or "new old stock" in the search. That will hopefully separate out a lot of the newer stuff.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:My favourites are Nike Legend 2.0, now discontinued. I've worn/washed some of my pairs literally hundreds of times and they still look new. I don't like any of the replacement styles because they're either crappy material or have the logo on the leg. I don't get people who like a whole brand - fabric is everything, and no one makes a full range of ideal leggings.  I also like VS Knockout Tights, again discontinued, for their mild compression and durability.  I'm dreading needing new leggings and going through the whole process of weeding out  the unsuitables again.	episode_done:True
text:Dress Sneakers Are Alarmingly Popular	labels:I also think it's on the rather unfortunate looking side... counterpoint: I know a surprising amount of people who have to wear dress shoes for professional reasons... but comfortable sneakers for health/pain reasons... this caters to them and after several have told me in how much pain they are I don't give a hoot anymore. Let Cole Haan/whoever do their thing.  Edit: this is not counting people I know who may have very different requirements throughout a workday/ work trip and may not want to pack/ bring several shoes and are in a constant haste.
text:hmm is this all a result of office culture getting more casual and people having trouble finding good looking dress shoes that are also comfy?   would be cool if people here could recommend comfy dress shoe alternatives, but I guess I am a bit late here	labels:There are moc-toe dress shoe styles that come with soft rubber soles. For example, the Eastland Falmouth. Comfortable as all fuck (with or without socks), dressy enough for a stuffy middle-aged office, casual enough to go grocery shopping in. You could describe them as loafers with laces, or as boat shoes without the boat part. These are my favorite type of shoe.	episode_done:True
text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:Ballet flats, and leggings under dresses/skirts. Yes, I know the leggings thing has been out of fashion for a decade, but I don't like wearing trousers so they add a layer to transition me from summer to winter when I switch to tights and boots.	episode_done:True

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:Really???  This is even a question???  You can be poor and not have the money or even physical access to fashionable clothing while still loving fashion and having a personal style that you would realize if you had the money or time.  Or you may not even have access to fashion information (magazines, etc) to form ideas or even have the mental bandwidth to devote to something as frivolous as fashion because you're trying to figure out how to survive.	episode_done:True
text:Inspo Album: Texture!	labels:I love a monochromatic look. Used to be highly neurotic about exact matches (akin to Gina of the RHOM) until I discovered texture. Differing textures can take a slightly different tonal color from "not so much" to "yes that looks good".	episode_done:True
text:I have made a realization that, apart from school uniforms, I only ever wear polo shirts	labels:I think as long as you avoid the synthetic fabric blends and look for high quality pique or sweater knit styles, polo shirts make an excellent staple.   I would explore polo shirts that have minimal branding and instead explore visual interest with contrast ribbing, or through muted sweater patterns.
text:This is the reason I've recently come around on polo shirts, especially when paired with soft/casual tailoring. I used to think all polos were shitty synthetic blends with garish company logos and not much more, but then I discovered Italian knit polos and my opinion began to shift.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:I've accepted that black is my color for shoes and bags. I'll go for colored items if I want to make a statement, but brown has been banished from my wardrobe. Other than that I don't really have too many rules besides only buying what I know works for me.
text:No brown gal here. All black, white, grey, with splashes of navy, maroon, emerald, creams, and floral, plus blue jeans. I've tried to do color with accessories, but it's all black, white, navy, and skin toned (shoes only). I want to be able to grab any top and bottom and not be concerned that it works together. Shoes and jewelry can make a look more or less formal/casual.  My only hard fast rule is that the clothing must be soft and comfortable. It cannot be itchy anywhere.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are your go-to, everyday shoes?	labels:I love my sorel PDX wedge boots, it has a heel, but I've yet to wipe out in these. I can walk all day in a city in them. They give me a nice confidence lift because I feel like a badass. I have converse low tops in white and use, wait for it. ELASTIC LACES. I got the homar brand from amazon, and it turns them into slip on and offs, I can still run after my kid, and not have to worry about retying my laces.
text:Elastic laces sound like a total game-changer! I used to LOVE converse and keds but couldn't stand the laces.	labels:Get the elastic shoelaces! Try a couple of brands, figure out what makes you happy but having slip-on shoes as an adult, that is such a joy. I got white to match my shoes they got as dirty as my shoes did so it all works out	episode_done:True

text:Coveteur: An Ode to the Striped Shirt	labels:I cannot resist a good stripped shirt or sweater. My wardrobe is full of stripes for every season and occasion. I appreciate the simple yet classic touch it can bring to an otherwise monotoned outfit.   I'm always on the HUNT for a sturdy, well made striped black and white t or long sleeve. I have plenty from like j.crew and madewell but I feel like they don't hold up for as long as I want. I got one from Vince a few years ago that's aged nicely but it's not black and white so it doesn't get put in rotation as much.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:Now long legs gives you a great variety of skirts, especially with tie waists and high waisted styles to accentuate your long legs and narrow waist. A flowy midi-type skirt with sandals and a tucked in t-shirt can really show off broader shoulders to their best. Also a tie waist skirt is not a huge shift from what you already wear and if you tend a bit towards in-turned knees they won't show.  You need a really supportive friend to try stuff on with, and an online shop with a good return policy.	episode_done:True
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Outside of formal wear, I don't own clothes that aren't comfortable to sit around the house in. Even my jeans are soft and stretchy.   No skinny heels, no open toe heels, and no pumps/things that don't cover the top of my foot. My feet and ankles are much more comfortable in a thick oxford heel that laces up or booties than open shoes.  No grey. I went through a period of buying a lot of grey, with the thought process that those items would "go with everything", ignoring my colorful inner self entirely. Couldn't figure out why I was bored and hated getting dressed for a long time. Now, I've given up on "neutral" colors and accepted that I am a vibrant color person. Crimson red is neutral as far as I'm concerned, it goes with most other colors. So does cobalt, mustard yellow, on and on.  If I can't wear it with a regular bra or no bra, I'm not buying it. No strapless, or one strap, or oddly shaped bras for me.
text:Fellow color lover here! I feel so out of place on this sub some times for looking color. Until a few years ago, I didn't own a plain white or black t-shirt lol. I have since bought a few though because I have colored pants that look a bit better with a neutral colored top. It's also been hard to find fashion YouTubers/bloggers to get inspiration from because I feel like most just do a neutral palette :/	labels:You made the mistake of thinking a majority of users on this sub likes fashion to begin with.	episode_done:True
text:Fall/winter shoe trends: what's your dream wishlist?	labels:Does anyone have recommendations on super soft leather loafers? I love fun colors! I have struck out the past two years with poor quality plasticky loafers even from nice brands like MK.

text:How Carhartt A Billion-Dollar Brand	labels:I'm born and raised in Michigan, I love that it's a Detroit brand. I think it wraps up everything about the city in their clothes.  Their stuff LASTS too. If you get one of their jackets, you'll only ever need to own one (unless you get really fat and it doesn't fit any more or something) because of how durable they are. Even when they get beat up a little they look great.

text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:One short cocktail length and one long if you feel like it. I personally wear fancy cocktail dresses no matter how fancy the wedding  I like black and navy bc you can rewear a ton. Color is great too. Just go for classic cuts.	episode_done:True
text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:Gorgeous stuart weitzman brown suede boots with leather interior, on sale for $25 at my local thrift store. I googled them in the store and they retailed at $760. I figured, worst case scenario, if they are fake, I get a cute pair of boots for cheap.   I took them to a local cobbler to verify and they are 100% legit. Best purchase I ever made. Brown suede is not usually a color or fabric I go to so it took a lot of trial and error to figure out how to style them. I'm so happy I got them, because when I wear them I feel like a million bucks.	episode_done:True
text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:The best cotton turtle necks available, for men or women, are from LLBean. Incredibly good prices, too.   I usually get the slightly more expensive Supima cotton version, which is so cozy and soft.
text:Came here to recommend this! Also the cotton sweaters, or, if you're feeling bougie, the 95% cotton 5% cashmere sweaters, mmmmm. I have a cotton/cashmere blend cardigan from high school (grew up in Maine) that's still kicking. I'm in my early 30s.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Casual Wool Trousers	labels:The pants look *great*.  The *coats*, however, are all way too small.  EDIT: /s (I really didn't think it was needed, tbh)
text:Why do you say that? The shoulders aren't too tight and it's pretty hard to tell the fit of the waist for most of them the length is pretty short, but you can't find long jackets that go past your knees nowadays	labels:I'm just riffing on the "Big/Bigger Coats" Inspir posts on here recently.

text:If I want to dress like Insert-Character-Here, where should I shop? Part 2	labels:Blair Waldorf. Haha
text:Since Blair's character is somewhat based off of Olivia Palermo, Tibi seems like it'd be a fitting recommendation. For hyper feminine yet classy looks I'd try Rebecca Taylor, Joie, Alice + Olivia, Giambattista Valli, or Zimmermann. A lot of the looks Worn by Blair on the show were from Marc Jacobs, so main line or Marc by Marc Jacobs is a solid place. Also, Ralph Lauren and Tory Burch for the classic preppy looks, but stay away from the TB Logo Ballet flats (per Blair's advice in Season 1). Also Diane Von Furstenberg actually has some nicer items that fit the bill and I honestly think Eleanors character was loosely inspired by DVF so it's fitting.	labels:love this GG fashion analysis!	episode_done:True
text:Stockings vs Tights vs Leggings	labels:I HATE stockings.  I have this theory that they were invented by men as a torture device for women.  They're the most uncomfortable garmet I've ever worn.  Tights are not that far behind (my waist and thighs are two different sizes, so I haven't found any tights that fit in both areas).  So I swear cotton leggings (the $5 F21 ones) with boots under dresses.
text:How are stockings and tights different than leggings? Inquiring minds want to know...  I mean aren't they essentially the same shape garment with amorphous stretchy points?    I am totally different body shape, apple with no waist, a belly, boylike hips and thighs.. my disdain for all stockings, tights and leggings have more to do with what goes on above crotch point than below it. They all seem to have same issue to me? So please explain as I'm seriously curious.	labels:I think it has to do wtih the materials used and the sizing.  Most of the tights/stockings I've seen have either had sizing S/M or L/XL where leggings run S, M, L, XL.  Maybe if they had made more sizes of stockings instead of combining sizes and making them ill fitting.  The other thing is that the material in tights/stockings is typically a lot more fragile than a pair of cotton leggings.  I don't have to worry about a hangnail ruining a pair of leggings or taking extra care when washing leggings.    Lastly I (personally) don't like garmets with a lot of stretch in them (and this includes a lot of workout leggings on the market).  Tights and stockings are typically in that category.	episode_done:True

text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:try to mimic in your clothes what your body does, but more in terms of structure and sharp vs soft lines rather than "broad hips need x". If you have a sharp bone structure, try sharp and crisp styles, if you look fleshy go with soft draping fabrics, if you look short then split the silhouette by colors or a belt. These are just examples but they can be extended to anything. This is basically what the kibbe system does. You can apply this idea without going into the whole thing as it can be a bit of a rabbit hole.	episode_done:True
text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I think a lot of other people have hammered in the point that jewelry is personal, and that lists like these aren't necessarily helpful. But here's a list of my must-haves.  1. super small gold huggie hoop earrings 2. medium 1-2" gold hoop earrings 3. long dangly statement gold earrings 4. gold choker necklace  5. gold delicate pendant necklace, sits around your collarbone 6. long, large pendant necklace 7. sparkly stud earrings 8. jade pendant necklace  I don't like wearing jewelry on my hands, except for my wedding ring. I also much prefer gold over silver-- the yellower the better.	episode_done:True
text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I personally don't like them, not for clothing, accessories or decor. The only animal prints I like are prints with the whole animal. Like, bees, or the Gina Linetti sweater from Brooklyn 99 that had panthers on it. Blouse with beetles on it.
text:Same! My aesthetic is very "grandmillenial" and I've just never been a fan of animal print. Partly I associate it with either middle age, suburban moms or with big hair and tight clothes a la The Nanny. Not to say that Fran doesn't look amazing, but it's just how how I would want to dress myself. My dad also was big into hunting and we had a lot of taxidermy around the home, so I think that has probably turned me off of it somewhat.	labels:	episode_done:True

That includes sales, so I'm willing to look into stores/brands that are on the higher end but usually have massive sales that can get them within my budget.  I feel that Van Heusen is a really good starter brand since they seem to always be on sale. This is my first step into the suit world so I'm not sure what tiers certain brands fall in. Where do Jos A Bank, Bonobos, Men's Warehouse, etc. fall?

text:Haha you mean a lot of ankles showing? I know it makes little sense in winter but it gives it a slightly more tailored look which seems pretty popular now	labels:I think that depends on body type though (and honestly, quite a few other variables). I feel like if you're tall, rolling your trousers up past the ankles just makes you look like you couldn't find trousers long enough for your legs.  I can see it working on a shorter man, better than having that bunched up fabric at the ankles, but even then I wouldn't take it to extremes.  This is another example of why say don't *religiously* follow trends, wear what compliments *you* the most. Personally I would never wear hugely oversized clothing because I'm 5'5 and I don't want to look 3'5 (speaking generally, because tbh many of these jackets posted here aren't so comically huge, most of them look normal to me and I'd absolutely wear some of them).	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 05, 2020	labels:Hi everyone, first time poster here.  I've been looking to get a Spier and Mackay suit for some time. but the import taxes are confusing to me. I live in Europe (Belgium) and my local websites dont really give a clear indication of what I can expect to pay in terms of import taxes. Any Europeans who have experience with importing S&M? what can I expect to pay in terms of import taxes? cheers!
text:You'll likely pay VAT at whatever the Belgian rate is (21%?), probably duty (in the UK 2.5%) and often some kind of handling fee from the customs/shipping company too.  Sometimes you escape some or all, other times you don't. I often find it makes buying (new) clothing from abroad/outside the EU pointless as the savings don't amount to much in the end.  If you really like something and there's no alternative then by all means get it. Tailoring isn't my thing but I suspect there's an alternative to Spier and Mackay that won't land you with these issues.	labels:	episode_done:True

My chest is wider than my waist but every jumpsuit I find has these issues. My waist is 30-31 inches and my chest is 40-41 inches. I am constantly bodybuilding so I will pack on more muscle:  * a medium sized jumpsuit will be exactly at 40 inches for chest and 32 inches for waist. The waist will fit perfectly but the chest will not give me much room to move.  * a large sized jumpsuit will be at 42 inch chest size and a 36 waist size.

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:$250- my knee-length Michael Kors parka, black with gold hardware. I wear it almost every day between November and March. It seriously protects me from the bitter Chicago wind and looks classy.  Runner up: $130 Sezane Venice jeans. They fit me PERFECTLY and look great with all my tops. I wear them at least once a week unless there's snow on the ground.	episode_done:True
text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:Never, why would you do that? At best my mum kept a couple of things for our dress up box but nothing beyond that (I had a Really Naf fancy dress birthday party for my 11th birthday and wore this blue and yellow dress my mum had had since just after I was born, it was gloriously 80s and even with a revival wouldn't be in style again).  Maybe a wedding veil or small thing if it's a family heirloom or particularly precious but really? Nope, let someone else enjoy it.
text:Partly because I love the stuff my mum kept - it's good quality, it was expensive and with Asian clothes you can repurpose it in a dozen different ways that you can't with Western clothes.  Partly with my move to slow and ethical fashion, I imagine I'll be spending a lot more money on clothing that last a lot longer and as long as it's not hoarding (which I can't say I'm guilty of, I'm pretty ruthless when it comes to culling my wardrobe), it's a pretty sustainable option.	labels:You said yourself that that stuff is formal wear - it's much more likely to keep well but by and large average everyday stuff doesn't keep well.  To be honest though unless you already have children who have expressed an interest in your clothes, it's not worth the closet space.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 27	labels:Are jeans just not happening right now?  I've been mostly wearing black skinny jeans the last few years and I'm tired of them (pre-pandemic, anyway - I've been wearing mostly pajama pants since March).    I've been looking around trying to figure out what to do in the jeans category, and it seems like men in their late 20s/early 30s have mostly moved on past jeans and are generally wearing chinos, work pants, or other non-denim pants.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 12, 2020	labels:I'm having problems with scarves: due to abrasion with my beard (perpetual 5 o'clock stubble), they all shed and create lint pills. I've tried wool, cashmere, acrylic, etc. Would silk be my salvation, even if less warm?

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:I wear heels that are comfortable. Ones that work for me/my feet include wedges, open toe heels, and square shaped heels. I avoid stilettos, kitten heels, and any that make me 'stand on my toes.' Many comfortable brands make heels that look great but are comfortable.- you have to search hard for them. Just try different styles and brands until you find ones that fit you.   If I have to wear uncomfortable heels for a special occasion, there are loads of products that help. I also switch shoes as soon as possible. I have genetic joint issues, but no one can tell since I take good care of my feet:)	episode_done:True
text:What’s something you wish you could tell clothing manufacturers to do differently?	labels:MAKE. MORE. SIZES. Plus, petite, tall, short, all of it! And use more than one fit model. The fact that the clothing industry has decided all women should be one of ~8 bodies and assigned them a number is ridiculous. Oh, and also, it's really just one body type and we've (badly) scaled the measurements and given it a new number.	episode_done:True
text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:Good question! Items I always feel a bit of a sense of satisfaction when clothes wear out tbh because it means they've been well loved. It rarely happens to me because I thrift and have way more than I actually need. A few:  \- A pleather jacket I wore for 5+ years was peeling pretty badly around the back collar. I ended up replacing it with a second hand real leather one that's wearing in much more nicely.  \- The soles of my Birkenstock sandals wore in so much my heels were nearly touching the ground. I ended up losing them before I could wear them in all the way sadly. Heels and soles also wear down in my favourite boots but I get them resoled!  \- My favourite skinny jeans usually last me a year or two before they get super faded and the elastic wears out around the butt. Have not found a good solution for this.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 16, 2021	labels:It's been a few years since I posted here, but here goes. I'm a middle-aged dude, who got the basic bastard down a few years ago and stayed essentially within the confines of biz casual while upgrading some small things, like watches, boots, some nicer pieces, but still the same slender silhouette. For decades, I liked to wear clothes that were slim. I recently needed a new winter coat and bought that Uniqlo balmacaan on sale. It's oversized and I just love it. It's long, flowy, and just plain comfortable. My question: **How could I at my age, dip my toe into this new looser silhouette while keeping it semi-professional? What would be a good next step?**
text:More classic-fit flannel trousers are perfect for this, especially with a slight taper. The wool hangs and drapes nicely when you have room in the thigh for it to do so, and it looks slimmer than you'd think compared to how it feels when you've got a good crease in the front. Try some from Spier & Mackay contemporary fit or Natalino	labels:Thank you	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:Up until about 2 years ago, I bought clothes with one goal in mind: hide my body. I got to a point where I realized I hated all my clothes. I Konmari'd and got rid of almost everything.   I took an inventory of what was left.   I made a pie chart for how I actually spend my time. Work and lounge wear at home are my biggest categories. Followed by casual clothes to wear around town for errands, or for game nights. Etc.   I then identified the gaps in my wardrobe, and prioritized work and loungewear. (Work clothes could always be "public" clothes if needed).   Now my work capsule wardrobe is pretty well set, and covid put a damper on needing public clothes.   Nowadays, when I shop, the two questions I ask are:   1. Does it move me forward as a person, becoming the bold, weird "old hag fashion" lady I am? Or,  2. Does it fill an existing hole in my wardrobe?   If it doesn't, I don't buy it.	episode_done:True
