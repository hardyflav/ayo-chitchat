text:Creating your own clothes: Advice?	labels:You're missing a lot of stuff here, this is very Step 1: Collect Underpants, Step 2: . . . , Step 3: Profit.    As someone who has built a brand over the last three years (I make the stuff myself) and is debating on introducing clothing, saying you have nice ideas that people will like is . . . not enough. Is you idea truly unique? Niche? Is there anyone doing anything similar? Where is your place in the market and how do you compare to your competitors? Why would someone buy a thing from you instead of someone else?    If I had the money, I'd greatly prefer to just go to someone else to produce it, but if you don't know design and pattern-making, then you're going to also have to pay someone to do that. You won't be able to go to a manufacturer and be like "here's my idea", they want very detailed and precise patterns to work from. It's an entire job in and of itself.    There's just so much missing here it's hard to even give advice, I have no idea what you do/don't know - about clothing, about business, and about marketing.	episode_done:True
text:Creating your own clothes: Advice?	labels:Maybe just pick up a sewing machine (vintage!) and begin with altering your existing clothes or eBay deals to fit you perfectly, then as you get to understand how shirts, pants, jackets, etc are constructed you could try buying fabric and make your own... then go from there if you enjoy it and feel like continuing? If you were to hire out the manufacturing it would still be valuable to have some knowledge and experience as far as how it’s done and what makes quality vs cheap construction...	episode_done:True
text:Creating your own clothes: Advice?	labels:Work with a local tailor to get your ideas made into samples	episode_done:True
text:Creating your own clothes: Advice?	labels:Definitely start by getting a used sewing machine and just learning the basics of sewing, first try tailoring your own stuff or making really simple things like pillow covers or masks and then try something more complicated like a shirt (and while I always prefer to make my own patterns, I recommend starting out with ones you can buy or find online). Even if you don't plan to do most of the manufacturing yourself, it'll still be vital for you to understand the process.	episode_done:True
text:The Future is Made to Measure	labels:TIL, the term "shoddy" came from Brooks Brothers being shitty.
text:Actually it didn't. It means fabric put together from sweepings and scraps, and only later came to mean terrible quality.

text:The Future is Made to Measure	labels:For some reason, I thought Trunk Tailors was much more expensive.  Yeah, MTM is one of thos places where... although machines not ever really overtake the hand, efficiency from machines is eventually going to complement handwork to make something very good very cost-efficient, and then Bespoke and RTW will both be struggling to compete.
text:I think MTM is more of a long-term threat to bespoke rather than RTW. The technological improvements, which will theoretically make it possible for software to draft a pattern indistinguishable from one drawn up by a human, could eventually make it very difficult for bespoke makers to compete on fit. The market could shrink to basically just the guys who want to be able to say they bought bespoke for sentimental reasons.  RTW will likely always exist just because it’s cheaper and easier to mass produce clothes in standardized sizing. Maybe the higher-end RTW market shrinks, but  at the bottom I don’t see a future where Zara only stocks M2M suits ordered online in advance.	labels:This article was about bespoke, but there are a lot of businesses taking mtm from the other angle -- not only making it cheaper, but making it such a cheap marketing hack, using it to reduce dead stock  using it to reduce return rates... As it gets better, it's going to get more efficient through multiple dimensions and eventually, rtw is going to feel some pain too.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 17, 2021	labels:# How acceptable are tailored shorts really as you get older?  I am reconsidering my outfits for my planned road-trip summer vacation in Italy, and classy non-beach vacations in general  I had planned for the daytime white, light blue and light pink slim-fit polo shirts, paired with light blue, pale red, and pale yellow tailored shorts. Boat shoes and Espadrilles for footwear. Basically my tried-and-true combos for hot weather vacays.  But as I reach the tail-end of my late 30s, **I wonder if shorts are appropriate at all anymore**. I always strive to look extremely put together, rarely wear anything without a collar, no denim, custom-tailored shirts and blazers even in home office, etc.  Shall I just wear my night-time outfits (pants and long-sleeve button-down shirts, both in linen or linen-cotton mix, in white and light pastel colors) during the day also?

text:The Terribly High Cost of Cheap Goods	labels:Most of this conversation is sadly ignorant of how global development works and prioritizes people in wealthy, developed countries over those in developing countries that need manufacturing to raise their standards of living. Since the post-colonial period there has only been two ways that any countries have significantly increased their economic development level, resource extraction like oil (which just isn't an option for most countries) and becoming a low-cost manufacturing center.  Countries that are now flourishing like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan were only able to do so because they became hubs for cheap international manufacturing, which enabled them to transform  into thriving, world-class developed economies.  Slave labor or child labor should always be unacceptable, but the idea that you are helping anyone except those who are already wealthy on a global scale buy strictly buying goods made in developed markets is ignorant. If people stopped buying goods from developing countries they would basically be condemning them to permanent poverty.	episode_done:True

If you do manage to find something from America that's as cheap as a cheap Chinese item then that item was very likely made in similar conditions to what the sweatshop workers there do.   The sad truth is clothing takes a lot of effort to make and because America has had stagnant wages for decades that means that is getting harder and harder for people to afford even basic domestic clothing. It's still worth it if you can manage it, these domestic manufacturers are operating on super thin budgets with extremely small profits, they need any help they can get.

text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:No other way besides just buying multiple sizes and trying them on. Find websites with good return policies like nordstrom and buy a few items to find your fit with the brand. Just make sure to buy things while they are still plenty in stock, or you risk buying something that doesn't fit, only to find out your actual size already sold out.  Part of the reason people are loyal to certain brands is because they become more familiar with their fits, and then you can buy online with more confidence, even with final sale items	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:Do  * Know your measurements * Check size charts. Know the difference between body measurements and garment measurements. * Check return policies * Ask others with experience with the brand * Compare to things you already know fit well  Don't  * place too much stock in letters or photos of models. * assume that one of the sizes available is going to fit you well * buy something that you know won't fit because it's a "good deal." * Place too much weight in measurements. They're very helpful, but garment measurements are taken from the outside of the garment, so the thickness of the garment factors in, structure factors in, your layers factor in... there are a lot of variables, so again, be aware of the return policy.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:If they have a size chart on their site, that should help, also, measure out your clothes you wear most often to be sure and if not, you could try getting it a size larger than usual	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:My normal ways are:  \- Know your measurements - Not foolproof as I found out when ordering a navy blazer online recently but certainly helps you out, especially on places like eBay  \- Ordering multiple sizes when shopping somewhere new - Technically cheating maybe and not always a viable option at high price points but this is generally a good way to see how a particular retailer fits you  \- Stick to retailers whose sizing you trust - This is obviously very limiting but sometimes I just want to try a style and I know the Uniqlo version will fit me well.   &#x200B;  As a side note too, when you try things on from brands, take pictures and save them. Then you can build up a catalogue of the ways retailers fit. This helps when you look back in six months and are tempted to reorder that thing you've been eying because you can't remember why you sent it back.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:Buy something from Uniqlo—they are cheap, decent quality, and all of their items have detailed measurements—and just compare other retailer’s sizing info to ‘qlo stuff you already own.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:Easiest way? Buy a measuring tape and measure yourself or your best fitting articles of clothing. Noting that your exact body measurements is your bare minimum (and you never need to go that slim anyways).   Uniqlo, Proper cloth, ledbury, kamakura shirts, all have in depth sizing guides, with proper cloth giving you example measurements depending on your fit and data provided. I suggest starting from there with regards to important measures to follow.  Denim websites and similar offering boutiques usually offer measuring guides as well, especially for jeans. Some boutiques like self edge, blue owl have a database to search for jeans based on measurements. Very nifty.  Honestly, its quite a bit of research to buy the right size the first time around. The most foolproof way is to buy multiple sizes and return. That being said, its not always the most economical, location, and/or shipping policies don’t allow this. Barring that, asking the sales team and cross referencing sizing with other vendors’ resources, reddit threads, official company sizing guides, will be your best bet.  Now all said and done, with tops usually measurements like chest, body length, sleeve length, shoulder length may be sufficient. Technically armhole size also matters but is usually never provided, rarely the armhole size will matter as they are in proportion to the aforementioned measurements.	episode_done:True

text:Arc'teryx Radsten Parka (2020) Review	labels:For what it's worth, I have the camosun, one level up in warmth from the radsten. Uses a slightly thicker synthetic insulation and also adds some down, and it keeps me comfortable down to -20C easily, no matter how much wind there is.  Otherwise a lot of what you mention here is valid in terms of construction between the two coats.
text:yeah the camosun might have been a slightly better fit for me. I am pretty happy with my radsten anyway, but wouldn't go any colder with it then the weather in vienna rn. When ordering I was afraid that the camosun would be too warm, which I think it could also very well be. So I chose the one where I thought that it would maybe be a bit too cold instead of too warm and having to sweat. I think that I might pick up a good fleece or thermal underlayer and that should do the trick for the cold days. :)	labels:That's a really good point!  I only start to wear the camosun around 0 degrees and have other lighter coats for above that. Really depends on what your needs are, since winter in Canada can get a bit more extreme than austria.
text:yeah the only other jackets I have (besides the UNiqlo one that I hate) is just a very light nike acg jacket with primaloft insulation and an old lightly insulated barbour coat which I had to wear together at about 5C.   I remember when first checking out this sub not realising how fcking cold canada can be and thinking that I'd need a therme with a down jacket and fleece underneath haha	labels:	episode_done:True

text:4SDesigns FW21	labels: 4S Designs is a relatively new brand, whose first collection was Fall-Winter 20 as things were going absolutely haywire in the world.  A lot of talent working for the brand, with the key designer being Angelo Urrutia. Angelo worked for the Nepenthes brands and Engineered Garments for god knows how many years (Through FW18 if I remember right?). Angelo is commonly known as Daiki's right-hand man, and from an outside perspective seems to have nearly as much influence in the brand's growth as Daiki has.   4s is definitely a different animal than EG. Still a workwear influence to be sure, but the styling is a little more conventional.   Fabrics are even crazier and much more lux than most of what EG has used - a lot of stuff that seems to be made special for the brand. Chanel-esque lurex-laden tweeds, soft and bulletproof melton, heavy twills, and ventile keep the choices interesting. Similar to EG, there have been many unconventional uses of fabrics.    While I don't think Angelo and team are aiming for the Conceptual collections ala Rick Owens, I think they nail an absolutely wearable aesthetic. Their lookbooks have been "different" but are one of the few brands that are unlikely to alienate people. With that, the details are still interesting enough to keep a normal enthusiast interested.	episode_done:True

I am reconsidering my outfits for my planned summer vacation in Italy.  I had planned for the daytime white, light blue and light pink slim-fit polo shirts, paired with light blue, pale red, and pale yellow tailored shorts. Boat shoes and Espadrilles for footwear. Basically my tried-and-true combos for hot weather vacays.  But as I reach the tail-end of my late 30s, **I wonder if shorts are appropriate at all anymore**. I always strive to look extremely put together, rarely wear anything without a collar, no denim, etc.  Shall I just wear my night-time outfits (pants and long-sleeve button-down shirts, both in linen or linen-cotton mix, in white and light pastel colors) during the day also?

Simon gets bespoke everything it seems like but I can see the appeal occasionally outside of just being a nerd.  edit: Not to mention that there are specialty denim tailoring services to hem with a chain-stitch, taper with flat-felled seams, take in the waist, etc. etc. If I'm gonna spend ~$400 on some specialty denim I can see putting that money into getting fittings being entirely worthwhile rather than some special Japanese fabric and shuttle loom.

text:"Which Sports Jacket Office Are You?" – Permanent Style	labels:Good article with some nice outfits. I've always been someone into tailored clothing and classic menswear, and honestly the odd jacket / trousers combination is absolutely the way to go. I own a single full suit, which I love, but generally it's a functional piece to be worn when a level of formality is *required* -- and therefore not as much fun.  Meanwhile, I have lots of different blazers / sports jackets and tailored trousers, and not only are they more fun to style and mix up, they're just that much more versatile that they become my go-to combination for what is basically my every day style. You can play around with the shoes, whether or not you have a tie, or a hat, and all of a sudden you have so many more options!  My suit simply doesn't have the same versatility, to the point that (when social functions were a thing) I probably wore my black-tie dinner suit more often.
text:I think you can have a jacket that is much more exciting than a pair of pants can match. Solid color pants are all I really wear, with more bold and exciting jackets.  And for 90% of the population, anything with a jacket is a "suit"	labels:	episode_done:True
text:"Which Sports Jacket Office Are You?" – Permanent Style	labels:What are your thoughts of the colour I should get for my first sports jacket? I feel like an oatmeal colour is the most versatile, contrary to what most people on here say (navy/grey). I say this because owning both navy and mid-grey trousers, an oatmeal jacket will be able to be worn with either trousers colour while still being formal enough. Whereas if I got a grey jacket, would I be able to pair it with the grey trousers, or would the monochromatic outfit (grey-on-grey) look dull? Thoughts??
text:I like brown. I suppose oatmeal fits in the brown spectrum although I would prefer a mid to dark brown. Brown works with everything navy would work but is able to also work with navy pants.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:The inspiration of vintage leisure and sportswear	labels:wow its almost like Simon reads Street x Sprezza lol, its almost like his take on that tailoring-adjacent essay I wrote 2 years ago!

Though I will say that it's important to remember era: Scott Fraser definitely takes inspiration from 50s-60s leisure wear whereas most of the ideas here are taken from 30s-40s photographs. There are small nuances to pay attention to, but overall its cool to take vintage inspo.	episode_done:True

text:Elk IV Parka from Wuxly Movement	labels:I don't see how canada goose promotes animal abuse. The down is never live plucked and the fur is sourced from animals that are killed by the state because of overpopulation
text:The issues people have is with how the fur is obtained, and a large portion of CG's fur is obtained through trapping. And trapping is generally looked down on as the animal can remain in the trap for days or even weeks at a time suffering. Are coyotes extremely overpopulated in a lot of areas of Canada and need to have their population culled? Yes, absolutely, and anyone trying to argue otherwise is a fool that doesn't understand the negative effect coyotes have on local animal populations. But allowing these animals to suffer for so long isn't the way to go about it. So the main crux of the issue is that yes, the fur is technically obtained legally and from a severely overpopulated species, but the way that it's obtained isn't ethical and shouldn't be encouraged.  This being said, CG has pledged to switch to "reclaimed fur" (whatever that means) starting in 2022.  Oops, kinda glazed over the down part. I've personally never seen anyone slate CG for how they collect their down, it's the fur that's the issue. Apologies for misreading at first. Though apparently it took them until the end of 2019/start of 2020 to become 100% RDS (responsible down standard) certified so maybe there were issues I haven't heard about...	labels:	episode_done:True

text:This is unhelpfully reductive and doesn't really address the issue in a way that makes sense. Down vs. synthetic is a tradeoff based on use cases, not a simple matter of one being better for everything.	labels:If one wants to make an ethical argument, thats up to them.  But down in a parka that has a waterproof shell is never going to lose against synthetic. Especially down which has been treated to not absorb humidity.   In sleeping bags, or for technical layers, there are more tradeoffs. But the OP already put themselves into the bucket of style/weight where Down is going to win across the board.   Synthetic can win on price (and get close to matching other considerations). But not $600 synthetic.	episode_done:True
text:Recent Purchases - February 14, 2021	labels:I bought a pair of American Eagle slim black jeans for $30. I don't think it's too bad a price and their slims fit me pretty well. Last summer, I bought the same fit, but in a dark rinse with 2% elastane (they're so comfy). This new pair will be 100% cotton, or so they claim. With shipping, the price ballooned to $38. I'm not happy, but I didn't want anything else from American Eagle.  I expect a fair bit of wear out of them. I did a cost per wear analysis and if I wear them once every other day for a year, I will pay 22c per wear. I don't even wear actual pants that often, especially in these COVID times. So I can reasonably cut the wear down to 1/4 of the year and extend the lifetime to 2 years (assuming the jeans fail at the end).   Wanna know what's more reasonable? 52 days of the year. I'll wear the jeans once a week, 3-8 hours per wear. I have many other pants I can wear when I'm not wearing those black jeans. Once a week for 7 years will amount to ~10.4c per wear.	episode_done:True

text:Andrew Marc New York Leather Jackets -- exploring the different "grades" of this brand	labels:Most current Andrew Marc outerwear is coming out of a licensing company called GIII. They handle outerwear for labels like Cole Haan, Karl Lagerfeld, Levi’s, Tommy, and quite a few others. The quality is going to be low to medium at best.   I wouldn’t pay much for it.
text:THANK YOU! This is precisely the kind of info I'm interested in.  When I look at the quality of recently made Andrew Marc... I'm underwhelmed. Then go to their site and see. They'll have garments with a so-called MSRP of "$695" with a discounted price then a promo price reducing it to $295". So really, that original price tag is nonsense and not indicative of that level of quality.	labels:All of this should have been the first sign that it's garbage.
text:And your comment helps... how?  This article is focused on the vintage Andrew Marc. Have you owned one? The leather is terrific quality for the price, if you know which style releases to look for. The fact that recent production is a notable drop in quality means you can find "gems" in older releases. If you think that's a joke, then the only reason why you're here is to troll.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Andrew Marc New York Leather Jackets -- exploring the different "grades" of this brand	labels:What is Andrew Marc quality comparable to?
text:From my own experience, I'd say the best made "vintage" Andrew Marc leather jackets are better than a lot of "mall" brand leather jackets I've owned or tried like Kenneth Cole, Tommy Hilfiger, Reilly Olmes, Ralph Lauren Chaps. I have a Ralph Lauren POLO leather jacket (original MSRP $695) from 1999 made of a heavy leather that has held up wonderfully over the years and I'd say is better than the best Andrew Marc I've tried (but my experience is limited--there may be "gems" out there, like limited editions).	labels:90s Polo is kind of golden era polo, somewhat different to what we have 20 odd years later.      RL Polo iteration one happens in 67' , RRL comes in 93', and then Purple label is in 94', but over the years I think the gap in quality has really widened sadly.
text:Polo is the hardest sub-brand to place. To simplify, there are two different tiers: department store Polo and RL store Polo. If you buy it from a department store  you'll get clothing at that level -- made pretty cheaply, a lot of basics, materials aren't special, etc. I can't remember if suits are half or full canvassed  At an RL or Polo store, though, some of it is pretty good. They have runway stuff. Some cowichans that will remind you of RRL's. I don't know if they still make Polo suits in the US or Italy, but if they do, those might be fully canvassed. Maaaybe some c&j footwear, although that's still mostly RLPL. Of course, most of this stuff will be overpriced, and still not actual RRL quality.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Thank you. What I showed is just some of what they've offered. They did produce other styles, like moto and cafe racer, though not as prolifically as the more traditional bomber, field, and blazer.  If Andrew Marc had only improved over time rather than cheapen, I'd have spent more time and gone into more detail. But after acquiring one of these nicer examples hidden among the cheaper ones, I thought it would be worthwhile to share what I learned. If you know what to look for, you can pick up some seriously nice deals for not much money.	labels:	episode_done:True

It also feels kinda funny buying made in India/China stuff with purely American heritage designs for x2-x4 times the price of many other repro brands.  Not to say that designs don't absolutely rip.

text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:I've taken a couple of laps before writing this comment, but up-front I think aesthetics section should be split, because I think the most basic question, which is answered aesthetically but not functionally, is what do you want your clothes to **do**? Giving off a vibe is mentioned, but there's an even more functional level of "are these clothes sensible for how I live my life?" Are you buying lots of hawaiian shirts even though live at the north pole, or buying down parkas when you live in Hawaii? Do you regularly find yourself cold and wet because you don't own any raincoats, or find that your fishnet sleeves keep getting caught on the mill in the machine shop, or that your raw denim really doesn't give you the flexibility you need to dance?   I think what the clothes do should meet you where you do what you do, and at the most basic level that's physically enabling you to do things, and you can build a vibe from that.

text:While I agree with you, I don’t think a large segment of of the world aspires (strongly at least) to dress vastly different from what makes sense to Wear in their climate. I don’t think there are guys who work at the factory and dress up in bespoke suits; they’re smart enough to discern context.  Even urbancomposition, a union electrician, is able to dress how he wants, and that means dressing for his context.   I also think figuring out your aesthetic is also finding how to mix context with what vibe you want. Cotton knitwear turtlenecks exist, so you can definitely wear a roll neck in LA (within reason). There are cotton flannel aloha shirts that are long sleeve.  You can have a linen over shirt or a flannel overshirt. Open weave, high twist wool suits exist as much as flannel and tweed. Flannel lined chinos are a thing.  Apart from drastic things like wanting a to wear outerwear, there are definitely ways to make a personal desired aesthetic work for your context.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:This is a fantastic resource Boba! You’ve put into words a lot of the smaller aspects of looking at construction outfits really perfectly, I’d consider myself at least marginally better dressed and this is still a really helpful method of approaching fashion.  >What is your relationship with gender and identity within fashion?  In particular may be the hardest question to actually answer here(or maybe that’s just me), the past year or so I’ve very much been questioning my sexuality and as a whole I’ve never exactly felt like I identified with or liked traditional masculinity, I’d say my current wardrobe leans much more heavily into categorically masculine items and fit and it’s def something I’ve been wanting to shift away from.   I’m like tiny and prefer high crops anyway so I really need to just start embracing more womenswear but I’m lazy and haven’t bothered to learn about womenswear brands uet
text:Thank you for the kind words :) I wrote the list and even I will go back through and do my own homework assignment because I think categorizing your tastes and then zooming back can be a great way to guide you through your own aesthetic. Doing fashion can become so overwhelming!  And yes that is a heavy hitter of a question. As a queer person I also have been wondering what my relationship to "mens"wear is. I ordered my first women's shirt a few months back and wow is it liberating. My answer to that question would be that I like to kind of blend things from the now decaying bi-gender system. In the same outfit I like to wear feminine clothing right next to something that I perceive as masculine (here in the midwest athleisure is the most masculine dress type) because with my minimalist, meditative taste I think it can look chic and balanced. :) thank you for sharing your experience.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:What a beast of a post Boba, love ya for this  I think something that newbies need to do is go out and explore what’s out there to develop their visual and textural vocabulary. Obviously tougher with COVID, but that’s one of the best things about thrifting — even if you don’t purchase anything, the sheer volume of weird and wacky stuff out there will help you realize what’s out there, especially touching and feeling materials. Best part is that it costs nothing to window shop!

text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:This guide is actually really comprehensive and goes into the finer details. I think it’s easy to be like “just look at the basic bastard and go from there” and even some of the guides on the sidebar aren’t that great or informative. Developing a style takes time, takes years and a lot of mistakes in choices. Still I think taking a moment outwardly and asking “what do I want my style to be” and using the questions really would have had me avoid some of the mistakes I made and maybe sped me up to where I am now
text:Absolutely agree. Learning the technicalities behind stuff is great and all, but you really need to hash out your own taste otherwise that stuff is useless. I think having a style journal where you reflect and elaborate more is great. What kind of style, shape, fabrics, colors, patterns, etc are all questions you need to answer to develop better style. Having a journal or way to reflect on prompts gives you not only a think tank for you aesthetic but it also can inform how you purchase and style things. Lots of beginners just have no idea how to start developing, I certainly didn’t.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:I like this a lot.   I've been looking at the six or so inspiration pictures I've saved from MFA, and I guess I really like the monotone/tonal look. I sort of knew this, but now it's something I'm conscious of, and will definitely be conscious of when I shop for new clothes.  I also realized a connection between the styles of visual art, music and architecture I like, and the kinds of patterns and colour schemes I like. So that's neat.

text:Assuming you're not trying to troll, I'll give you a solid answer.   I went to schools that had uniforms, for 8 years, the same thing ad infinitum. I love high fashion/couture and its been like that since I was a kid. It's art. I used to just admire the looks that came down the runway. Now when I look at lines, I put them in my cart and buy what I like *(on sale cause retail is for suckerssss).* I can't be bothered with business casual looks & fast fashion like H&M, Gap, Asos, J. Crew, etc. I'm simply sharing my aesthetic. Not everyone likes an abstract Picasso, but they understand that it's art nonetheless.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Both.   Most of regulars here are hobbiest, we’re more interested in fashion than the average person, and that means pushing the envelope a little bit, I don’t love everything in this album but I think it’s all pretty wearable tbh.  You also gotta keep in mind a runway show is by definition meant to show off the skill of the designer both in design and styling, obviously runway shows and look books are going to be more out there, it’s akin to art gallery, would you wanna pay to visit the MET and find out the entire thing is full of Thomas Kinkade paintings? How people actually style the items they buy is often much less out there and easier to digest.  I also think people not involved in the fashion world have a bad habit of assuming brands or designers are “telling you” to wear things which...look I don’t know where this idea springs up from, I guess the idea that people who like fashion are all vapid and shallow and just following trends dor the sake of it.   It isn’t true, the people here are making clothing that they want to make(obviously business and being able to sell this comes into play so if anything it's being toned down), it’s not telling you you need to go out and buy any of it, if it’s ok to not enjoy this and just move on.   So, yeah, most of this(that I like) I’m approaching from the standpoint of seeing things I’d like to incorporate into my wardrobe. And what I don’t want to I can usually appreciate just as art	labels:	episode_done:True

The mainline ones are slightly thicker with a bit stiffer fabric with more structure to it, so the Factory ones drape a little differently but are also a bit softer.

text:Cyberpunk and Fashion | A Video Essay | 40 Minutes	labels:Great video and i am myself a fan of the Cyberpunk genre.  However i think that because of all the raised environmental awareness i don’t believe synthetic fabrics have any future but rather organic fabrics such as a cottons or wool etc.
text:I think synthetic fabrics are definitely here to stay and evolve tbh. They’re engrained in general fashion because of its military heritage. But, I notice some techwear fits overlook a lot of good organic fabrics. They’re classics that work for certain climates just as good as synthetics, or tech clothes. Well made Wool clothing is the best, and has great properties. Wool is a very technical material that’s been used for a LONG time. Cotton is alright for hot days, it’s major disadvantages are how much water it absorbs, and in really cold environments it’s dangerous if wet, or when sweating.	labels:Yes synthetics are here to stay for sure and i can totally see the military wearing uniforms made out of cheaper materials etc...  But synthetic fabrics havn’t been around for that long and it has already caused major environmental pollutions. It had it’s break through in the 1960’s so in this short amount of time it has caused a disaster already. Every time we laundry polyester or synthetics micro fibres releases and polluting our ocean water, so the fish get it in them which we eventually get back in our bodies again when we consume fish for example.   So even if it’s here to stay i’m longing for it to be taxed to the degree where it is not profitable to produce it anymore.   And absolutely yes! Wool is defenetily the best way to go. It keeps you warm as it releases steam from the body which keeps the wearer in a better state. While synthetic clothes on the other hand causes a ”thermos” effect which forces the wearer to compensate with more laundrying and tons of parfume because of all the sweating.   Cottons is for sure not as good but it still ”breathes” in a way that synthetics doesn’t and can be made in many different ways depending on which season. Brushed to turn it into cozy flannel or corduroy for colder climate or denim or percale for warm weather.   My overall feeling tells me that we will move towards buying more consiously and less clothes of higher quality (since synthetics will be taxed too high anyway) in the future but to take better care of what we bought and therefore the trends will slow down a bit and leave people less anxious to feel constantly outdated and forced to buy the latest all the time. Which is ridiculus when you think about it.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: What is the environmental impact of different fabrics?	labels:Anything that's sustainably farmed will have a positive or neutral environmental impact. Traditionally raised cattle for example extract carbon from the atmosphere so therefore the environmental impact of suede would be positive unless you're shipping the fabric long distances.
text:Eh, that's not really true. There are a number of environmental impacts from leather/suede. Even when sustainably raised.  1. Cattle actually suppress growth of native grasses(coming from a US centric perspective) due to the shape of their hooves. Buffalo have a different shaped hoof (more of a spade) and actually stimulate growth. So if you got your hands on some buffalo hide boots thats a great start.  2. The dyes and softening agents can be incredibly toxic and harmful. Traditional practices actually employ human excrement (both urine and feces) but modern practice focuses on more... palatable but also less environmentally friendly chemical agents.  3. Discerning origins of hides is difficult. There is quite a bit of disingenuous advertising as far as what is sustainably farmed and what standards it meets. There are many different verification organizations, looking into who has partnered with them (ie. NGOs or government programs) and who provided foundational funding is a good start to finding a reputable org.  So, you are totally right. But only if you account for all of those point as well as sourcing the materials/labor/sales locally. To be honest I think just making sure what you buy lasts a long time, taking care of your clothes/shoes, and limiting your future purchases will have a more meaningful impact.	labels:so, I'm an ag and soils researcher, and the research is really up in the air right now as far as grazing and soil carbon. we havent really figured it out yet, and the field is in a major state of flux with new research coming out all the time. maybe we can grow cattle in an environmentally friendly way that is carbon neutral or even positive (this would require much lower stocking rates and innovative new techniques that are far from common today), but maybe we can't	episode_done:True

text:Thank all of you	labels:Do not do what you are thinking about doing in the last part of your post. You are experiencing the beginner's high; you found something new and exciting and want to replace everything with it. One common rookie mistake for people that are new but not limited to fashion is to throw everything away and buy a completely new wardrobe only to regret it down the road because when the high went down, they realize they did not really enjoy some of the pieces.  You need time to process and enjoy your first part of AE. Let the initial 'honeymoon phase' calm down and see if you really like shoes. If you do and want to spend money, there are thousands of great shoe brands ($$-$$$) that you can read up on /r/goodyearwelt. AE is just a starting point.
text:As I mentioned to another poster I am going to give it some time to make sure. But at this point I am less trying to go ‘all in’ on AE than I really never want to put on my old shoes again. I wear dress shoes to work every day plus a few evenings for work commitments. Assuming the ones delivered are as comfortable to wear as the ones in the store my choices would be keep wearing painful shoes most of the time or spend a bit on AE’s.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Thank all of you	labels:So a number of people are telling you not to buy a bunch of AE shoes because they are “entry-level” and that you may eventually want to move up in price. This is true, but consider that anyone saying this has become a hobbyist who appreciates and collects high-end footwear, and therefore retroactively views AE as a gateway drug that led them to discover a new hobby. This implies a linear progression from spending $350 on shoes — an amount 98% of men would find insane — to eventually spending $1000+ on shoes, which is completely bonkers to all but a very small number of people.  Definitely wait a bit and avoid buying a dozen pairs of AEs too quickly. But also consider that if AE makes you happy and your goal is to amass a rotation of multiple good-quality shoes in different styles and colors, it’a perfectly acceptable to avoid leveling up. You don’t *have* to keep buying progressively more expensive stuff, and can instead enjoy what’s in a price tier you’re comfortable with.
text:>You don’t have to keep buying progressively more expensive stuff, and can instead enjoy what’s in a price tier you’re comfortable with.  This is one of the most level headed responses on the page and something that resonates with me. Basically all of my shoes are in the $300-$450 USD range and while I like having quality shoes and want to talk about GYW shoes and raw denim and stuff, it just is unfathomable for me to spend US$500+ on shoes at this time. Maybe when I'm making $200k a year I can think about spending that kinda money on shoes but it just doesn't make sense to me.  And, truly, if you're buying even a pair of AEs. If you don't wear them like a tool box, you will have them for years to come anyway.  Some of the other brands like Enzo Bonafe, John Lobb, etc, that other people have rec'd might not end up resonating with OP. They might, but they don't have to. I can appreciate people opening OPs eyes to other high end brands but it isn't necessary to buy them.  Hell, my most complimented shoes I have are a pair of Cole Haan Zero Grand sneaker oxford hybrids that my SO made me buy.  So a lot of the time, buying the high end shoes is only gonna matter to one person, that being the wearer. So buy whatever you want. Just make sure you do your best to get it to fit right.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Thank all of you	labels:Hey man, I know how you feel. Funny enough, I'm also 9.5EEE in AE. If you are okay with used shoes, try eBay or other resale websites for your size. They're out there. When I started a new job, I got three pairs of AE shoes in my size for about the cost of one new pair and they all came in pretty good shape.
text:I am not opposed. But the cost isn’t really an issue either. I just never got the point of expensive shoes before. I tried on expensive ones and they hurt just as much as the cheap ones. So why bother... I feel like a whole new world just opened up.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Thank all of you	labels:I'm so glad you were able to experience well-fitting shoes!  Allen Edmonds used to be the default recommendation back on MFA and GoodyearWelt, but they've fallen by the wayside in favour of places like Meermin which offer more absolute value.   One thing that I think people really don't take into account though is how vital AE's customer service is for someone just getting into good dress shoes – they're not going to have a good understanding of how a dress shoe should fit, and the staff at AE are really great at getting that across as well as finding the right size.  Once someone has gotten some experience, then they're more equipped to try better value brands with an online-only or foreign presence. But that initial guidance is critical and in my opinion, worth the "premium" that AE charges over Meermin
text:I wasn’t kidding knowing what I know now, I would have happily paid $400 just for the shoe fitting. I just never realized how much I needed it.

text:This I think is where I am and thank you for the thoughts.   I need at least six pairs of shoes for daily wear. With that requirement I will soon have one pair of shoes that’s even the right size. So buying a stable of AE’s to get started seems reasonable.   I doubt I will ever really be a collector, and the idea of spending $1,000 for a pair of shoes still feels insane. But owning a base line of shoes that don’t hurt sounds well worth replacing my current shoes with AE’s even if there are other good options out there.	labels:check out preston on elegant oxford where he links a ebay sellar who lists AE for a fraction for what you would pay in store.

text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:While we can't say for certain: is it possible that the second experience is the correct one? A lot of men believe that they need a fully custom suit to fit well, but in actuality for most body types the patterns are rather close. If an OTR size with alterations would look great, paying for MTM is a waste of money. I've done MTM suits and bought OTR suits and have generally found that getting OTR with alterations is a faster way to a well fitting suit than the low to mid level MTM stuff we're talking about here. I've done Indochino MTM which was generally a mess and a tuxedo from Black Lapel which eventually worked out well, following one full remake and $100 of local alterations (that they paid for). My OTR blue line suits from SS fit great after alterations.
text:I know this is hard to do, but I really think men committed to getting a great fitting suit within a reasonable price need to try on several OTR companies and stick with the one whose cuts fits the best with the least needed alterations. I've done that with SS; their Havana and Lazio cuts fit me perfectly, and I only need to get the pants hemmed.  Unlike Spier & Mackay for me, whose $199 liquidation suit needed $240 of tailoring in NYC. At that price, plus the extra slight risk of returns since they're in Canada, I'd rather stick with SS despite them lacking in more conservative fabrics when compared with Spier. But for some people, Spier fits them the best, whereas SS is too slim.	labels:Agree 100%. Most of the go-to's offer free exchanges as long as it's your first suit, so it's not at hard as it seems.

text:Yes, I even considered this. It is possible that all the fuss associate with a MTM may just create work and not contribute much to the overall fit. I'm kind of build weird though...rather "wide" with a 36 inch waist, but not pudgy at all. My legs and arms are really thin, so I look like I am completely swimming in most OTR jacket sleeves and trousers. My SS OTR trousers I have do fit well, but not as well as the perfectly tapered MTM ones.  I failed to mention that I own an OTR SS Sienna as well, which I bought online and had altered.

text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:I've bought two suits from SuSu and had the rush treatment almost every time I go. It's especially challenging when it's a busy day for them. I would first try a different location if possible.  One thing I'll advise against is going without a strong idea of what you want. Their sales team will try to put you in a suit if they sense a squishy client. Hold true to your expectations and tastes, and they'll be more likely to put more care into it.	episode_done:True
text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:I’m going to agree with a couple of comments in here and say that the second experience at SuSu wasn’t *wrong*.  The outcome of getting a custom suit isn’t only contingent on what the client asks. Since a “perfect” fit is a subjective concept, each custom fit is a confluence of not just the client’s requests, but also the individual preferences of the fitter and the standard cut of the brand. That is, it’s not just about where you go; it’s about who you work with when you get there.  I’m an associate for SuitSupply myself, and we all do a lot of custom. At the shop, each of the associates design custom suits a little differently. I almost always heighten the rise on the trousers, for example, and cut my chests really close. My coworker, on the other hand, always does a full leg taper and shortens the jacket a half centimeter. I’ve had clients switch from me to someone else and vice versa for custom because they liked an individual’s fit better.  With all of those adjustment options at your disposal, it’s easy to get anxious if you’re not seeing them all getting used. Remember, though: if your suit doesn’t fit right, alterations and remakes are free, and the changes are noted so they can be added to the next suit you make. If you go back and let them know during the fitting about your prior experiences and how you want it to fit, or even bring in your original suit to guide the process.  I would give SuSu another chance. But I’m biased.	episode_done:True
text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:I too had two different experiences.  My first suit I purchased at the Philadelphia store.  They sized me at a 46R and I paid over $100 for alterations.  I lost about 20lbs in the following years and needed to get the suit altered.  This time I took it to the KoP store where they said I should not have been sized at a 46R and had to pay $100 in alterations.  They sized me for a new suit and minor alterations at no charge to me.	episode_done:True
text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:I’ve also dealt with suitsupply twice and like you had two very different experiences.   In the first - a blue suit - I had a very clear idea of what I wanted and ordered it shipped to store so that I could just do minor tailoring. They took full measurements on every aspect of it, and asked what I wanted for each measurement too. Ie Do I like a wider pant opening? Or more tapered? Length of sleeves, etc. felt very much like a whole rundown of the entire suit.   The second was... bizarre if im being honest. I went in wanting to shop for a dark grey suit. I didn’t have a clear idea of what I wanted, but I was assuming I’d go the fully customized suit route and had toyed a bit with that on their website. I went in to the store to see fabrics and stuff in person before I made my purchase. I told them what I was planning and they basically took my chest measurement and then pushed me to not do the full customized, but instead buy off the rack. And for my color options, I was browsing the whole rack, but they straight up pointed me at only the grey tones they had in store at the moment in my size. When I asked about other shades I saw they basically said “yeah, we don’t have that one in your size” and stared at me. It was like the concept of ordering a fabric/color combo I liked in my size was a foreign concept to them. Measurements were weird too. They only measured and marked one pant leg and one sleeve for tailoring. I asked why he wasn’t doing the other sleeve/pant leg or any other measurements and he just said they weren’t necessary. I overall felt pushed around by the process, and rushed, and definitely don’t think the suit is as personally tailored to fit me as the first I bought.   Nevertheless, now I’m looking at getting a new blazer and again I’m looking at SS because the quality and fabrics are quite, quite good, and I don’t have many other MTM/customizable suiting options in my area.
text:Your second experience is very much of a piece with mine. Perhaps they are trying to treat MTM as more "factory alterations"? Thanks for the response.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:They offer a "from scratch" option on the website. Don't start from anything, have them measure you and make that jacket. They're being firmly lazy with you, you have to be firm and demand a good fit.  The store I walked into, the guy promised that their new "custom - from scratch" option included things like armhole size, shoulder slope etc. So that has to be the way to go.  Contact Black Lapel and see if they can do that. If not....  Where are you? Kent Wang MTM offers a *ton* of options, but it's NYC only. There's Spier and Mackay, Imparali... What's your budget, around $1200?

I told them it still says it is available in select markets on their website and they stated that what they offer now is call, "Advanced Alterations" internally and is branded, "Custom Made".  I clarified that with them because it was a shock to me.  My prior suit was purchased under their true MTM program which no longer exists.  The new advances alterations platform does include armhole height, sleeve circumference, waist, chest, shoulder so it doesn't seem like much is being lost. My feedback to them was that the rep should still measure you and should customize every measurement because what are the chances that I happen to be exactly the same waist, chest and shoulder as your 42" pattern. She thanked me for the feedback and said the experience should still include full measurement, but something has been lost in translation as they roll out the new platform.   For a suit I can go $1200, but I'd like to get a blazer done under the SS price of $650.  The most I've ever paid for a suit is $1500 and that was Alan David NY.  I loved their work, but they get expensive fast when you start looking at nicer fabrics. I'm still considering going to another SS and getting properly fitted via this program because I like the totally unstructured shoulder for this more casual blazer.   Does Kent Wang travel or do I have to come to them?	labels:Traveling tailors are hard to find on even a $1500 budget... This would be easier if you could tell me what the nearest city was.
text:Orlando. I flew to NYC for Alan David and willing to do so again, but that turns a $1500 suit into a much more expensive one, obviously.	labels:Yeah... I don't know many shops in Orlando. Supply and Advise is a great store in Miami, next time you're there, but I'm not sure if they do anything MTM.  For NYC... You could always just go and get measurements on file at a few places. Kent Wang, black Lapel, the Armoury, Mr. Ned, Martin Greenfield, Imparali, et cetera. And visit No Man Walks Alone and Turnbull and Asser and Meermin and Carmina and... We've got a pretty large number of menswear stores worth visiting.  Buuut I wouldn't fly up for just one jacket. Get a tailor to measure the shit out of you, tip him $10-20, and keep those measurements on file, they're yours, you won't lose them like SS did. Then try to get a shirt mtm online (Spier and Mackay, Proper Cloth, Luxire, Black Lapel, Alton Lane...) And see how that goes for you. Online MTM suiting is trickier, but you know... Give it a try.
text:I like the idea of a trip to NYC and getting measured at a number of places...thanks for the advice. I'll check these places out.	labels:Don't *just* go for the menswear though. There are plenty of great restaurants, bars, museums, and parks there too. Make the trip count!

Particularly liked this excerpt around the 3-minute mark that a lot of people need to hear:   > The problem I find with dressing to maximize your perceived height is that 1, it puts height on a pedestal-- it assumes that your height is the most important factor for determining your attractiveness--and 2, it assumes you should dress to maximize your attractiveness to others... you are dressing with one priority, to look taller and more attractive to the eyes of other people and the result of that is a sea of men dressing the exact same way... where is the personality in that?

text:Review: Church's McPherson Brogue Derbies with Commando Soles	labels:Great review!  Totally agree re: church's, I've got a pair of their cornwood (Chunky Chelsea boots) which I got around 40% off last year and they're brilliant, they're a tumbled leather so have a softer grain to the embossed calf but have held up to my abuse brilliantly. I've noticed that Church's are excellent at the clicking process and only the highest quality hides make it in (in my experience, they're the only brand I've never seen any inconsistencies in leather quality from).   My only complaint is the last (103 as opposed the the 133 on yours), it looks amazing but leaves me swimming at the heel with a relatively stubby toebox.  I agree too about C&J, their scotch grain is softer (and I'd argue maybe a little *finer*) than church's. But Church's firmer leather is not a bad thing for country shoes and is more in line with the Zug grain you see from Trickers.

I actually interviewed one of their co-founders on my podcast, and decided to treat myself to one of their garments after being really impressed with their brand and company values. I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of product, but as soon as I unboxed the package, I instantly felt the quality in the weight of the hoody.   The organic cotton is soft to the touch, but there is substantial weight in the body of the hoody, which to me is exactly what I want in a garment that gives me comfort, especially in the winter.  I've only had the hoody for a month, but after 20 or so wears and the first wash, it looks like new, which is a great indicator of longevity.  Aside from the quality, I personally love everything Asket is about from an ethos perspective and have nothing but great things to say about my experience with them so far.

I've been knitting for over 20 years, and I would love to try my hand at some replica design, I just have to get through more of my queue and stash first.   I'm always excited when pop culture knits inspire more people to get into knitting. I've found taking this step to make my own socks and accessories to be eye opening about the value of garments and clothing. And as one of the interviewed knitters said, it is very fun to chose different fibers and yarn weights to make exactly what you want in the project.
text:> just gotta get through more of my stash and queue first.  Narrator: "They were never able to do so."  But forreal, I just cast on my first self designed sweater. I've been knitting for a year, but crocheting and sewing for a decade. Slow fashion is such a rabbit hole because before you know it you're trying to talk yourself out of learning to spin, cause maybe when you buy a house you could get a sheep? Maybe some angora rabbits?! But it's such a cool interest. As a young person I'm really happy that it's becoming a mainstream thing!  It gives me hope.	labels:Yep...very accurate.  I have successfully not purchased yarn for myself for 458 days now (not like I'm counting), so I might be able to reduce the stash a bit. But more than likely I'll cave here in the next six months while I still have 40k yards to work through.   The rabbit hole of slow, self-made fashion goes deep. The yarn, the yarn dyeing, the desire for an angora rabbit, the realization that you dont like drop spinning, but thinking maybe you'd like it on a spinning wheel...	episode_done:True

Way back when a suit or jacket is part of normal daily wear, people wear them over anything- think tweed work jackets over thick crew neck sweaters, with or without neckerchief. Tailoring used to be much more free-form compared to the generally more prescriptive "worsted-wool sharp businessman look" nowadays. Crew neck sweaters are basically the OG t-shirts, and easier to wear on its own since plain t-shirts were originally underwear and not meant to be seen.	episode_done:True

text:I also just don’t understand the inclination to “push it” when just about every guy who owns a tailored jacket also has a closet full of collared shirts. The right way to dress down a jacket is by going with a more casual button-down, not by opening up the t-shirt or hoodie drawer.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Can You Wear a T-Shirt Under a Blazer and Not Look Like an 1980s Leftover?	labels:This look working is dependent on a couple of things. The fit of the shirt and the jacket has to be on point. The fabric of the t-shirt should be higher-end cotton or similar material, can't be your run of the mill t-shirt. Most importantly though is the person wearing it, you've gotta be in shape to pull this look off or you look like a sloppy neckbeard.	episode_done:True

text:Dressing Drakes on a Budget	labels:Good write up on a good topic. I've specifically said that Drake's is visibly expensive before, a lot of these looks are hard to replicate for cheap... But you really have done a great job, at least with the simpler looks. Yes, styling and fit are huge factors.  And of course, materials are a big factor, particularly for their silk and shirting...   But the real magic in the brand is in specific details, color combos... The closer you can get to the exact color palette you're trying to imitate, the better. If you're looking at cord, don't just look at the cut and color -- think about the difference in wales per inch (IE the width of the cords), look at the buttoning method, and every detail you say you're not worried about, just know what you're sacrificing, because they have a real eye for detail.  (Or, do somewhat less work, and you'll still look pretty good, but details matter, that's all I'm really saying).	episode_done:True

text:Drake's Collection One, 2021 Lookbook	labels:Love Drake's style, but it's so expensive. Any more affordable alternatives (preferably european)?
text:Yes! It takes a bit of work but you can definitely replicate Drake’s styling for much cheaper.   A lot of the value of Drake’s is in their styling, and a lot of what they sell is basics. Some of their clothes are literally just marked up pieces manufactured by other brands - their suede crepe sole shoes are Astorflex, for example. A lot of it is also basics, and you can find a lot of similar stuff at other brands for much cheaper. For example, kamakura has great slim fit oxford cloth shirts with a substantial collar for a fraction of the price of Drake’s. You can find slim fit high rise jeans for much less than they charge at lots of brands nowadays.   It takes a bit of sleuthing but I’ve been able to replicate the “drake’s look” much more cheaply. For example, I really liked their crepe soled suede shoes, so I bought a pair of astorflex chukkas for $40 on eBay. I liked their corduroy chore coat so I bought a j crew one for $100. I have brushed shetlands from other brands - also made in Scotland, but a lot cheaper. The main thing that’s tough to replicate is their ties and scarves, IMO. Even that, you might have luck with some clever searches on eBay.	labels:	episode_done:True

I only considered Topman items when they were in the sale anyways.  Since I shop semi-regularly at ASOS, this change won't affect me too much. I'm not concerned about the uality of ASOS products either; they seem fine enough for what I need.

It’s the coldest leather I’ve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I’ve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I’m glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there’s no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.

text:Spotting is certainly a common complaint and I can see how it diminishes people’s enjoyment of shell boots. I live in a place with 250 days with rain per year and wear mine in all weather conditions (except old snow as I’m afraid of the salts). I have some semi-permanent spots on faded ravello, but have accepted them as part of the patina. My color 8, black and cigar shoes all deal really well with rain and mud and I find them much easier to clean than calf skin/cow hide boots. Now that I think of it, maybe there’s so much rain here that they now have ’even‘ stains. Shell shoes can be enjoyed as heavy beaters, I believe.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Strange. I find them to be great hot weather wear, no warmer than calf (and cooler if unlined). Also have not had problems with permanent water spotting. I live on the equator and wear my shell in any weather.  ETA: That said, most of my shell is on the darker side (burgundy/colour 8, dark brown, black, or navy). I recommend these colours to those who are deeply bothered by water spotting.	labels:Similar experience here. I wear mine year round in Florida and don't really notice a difference between shell / calf leather as far as getting too hot. Usually what stops me from wearing boots is the weather gets so hot I don't want to wear pants so the boots go too. I can see how the spotting would annoy some, but I usually just don't wear them if I know it will rain. If they do get wet a quick wipe down with a damp cloth takes care of it for me.	episode_done:True

text:My experience has been different with shell, though it varies by manufacturer.  My Alden and Allen Edmonds shoes were all comfortable out of the box, and I wear them in all temps comfortably (always with relatively thin socks).  Ditto my Carmina plain-toe-bluchers, though admittedly these were purchased second-hand.  My Meermin longwings have always been very stiff.  Five years and they haven't loosened a single bit.  However, they are comfortable.  Then my favorites, the Truman captoe boots, have been pretty soft since day one.  They've weathered a lot over time (due to conditions and general lack of care), but still very comfortable.	labels:Love to see some pictures of the Truman.	episode_done:True

I paired it with a rather full cut white dress shirt and black tie.   It won't see much use in the future except for other funerals, and frankly, I don't see much issue with that. It's polyester-y and the shoulders are off, but there won't be much in the way of judgement about the minutia of it. Keep that in mind. As long as it's reasonably conservative, it will do.

text:Hedi Slimane’s CELINE- an idealized look at 1960s rock & roll (large inspiration album)	labels:Love the inspiration folder, showing the clear influences and understanding of Celine under Slimane.  I do really enjoy Celine before Dancing Kid, but the latest collection wasn’t targeted to me.  The Dancing Kid is really to appeal to a new generation of buyers, when the past collections were to appeal to people who knew him as a designer.  I do like Dancing Kid though as a collection, I think it fits in with his more androgynous side that used to be more common with his days at Dior.  But it’ll be interesting to see where the brand goes post S/S 21 because I honestly don’t know what will happen.  I personally love the style and influences he had for Celine pre Dancing Kid.  As a kid who grew up watching French New Wave and listening to music from the British Invasion, I can definitely see myself transitioning to wearing clothes like that when I get back into an office.  It’ll always look cool.
text:I completely agree with your assessment- there is not a lot from The Dancing Kid that is cohesive through his earlier collections, but also recognize that it was calculated to broaden the appeal of the Label beyond Hedi devotees. I'm very excited to see what the FW21 show will look like, and if it extends the Dancing Kid, or goes back to his more historic influences.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: How do I know my clothes weren't made with slave labour?	labels:While not a direct answer to the question, I'll suggest that for those who are concerned about slave labor in the apparel industry and want to know what they can do to help... reduce, reuse, recycle.   You can reduce demand for new clothing by cutting back on clothing purchases where possible. If something doesn't fit quite right or is damaged, consider taking it to a tailor or mending yourself rather than immediately rushing out to buy a replacement.  When you want or need to buy something, consider buying used clothes instead of new where possible (easier than ever even if you don't have local thrift shops thanks to the rise of the secondhand menswear market on ebay, Grailed, TheRealReal, etc.).  Not that any of the above is a substitute for systemic change, but at least it can help you avoid becoming part of the problem.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I know my clothes weren't made with slave labour?	labels:Same as always, buy used, you can’t trust corporations to tell you the truth about their labour practices, in part because they have a very vested interest in not telling you the truth and in part because actually tracking he supply chains for clothing is incredibly difficult to do accurately, and, yes this applies to the cool mid range denim brand that replies to all your posts on ig. Even Patagonia got busted for using Slave Labor, if you look past the long winded apology letters they put out since they got caught, the reality is that it’s basically intrinsically locked into the supply chain of modern clothing production unless you're paying thousands upon thousands of dollars to have a local tailor make all of your clothes using locally sourced materials.  Buying used is the single most ethical option you have, and, frankly, is the better option anyway	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I know my clothes weren't made with slave labour?	labels:As others have mentioned--you don't. The best way to avoid it is by thrifting since you're not adding to the demand for clothing production. A thrifted item could have been produced by slaves originally, sure, but your purchase of it doesn't contribute to that.  Also, contrary to what you might assume, in many cases companies that have gotten into trouble for abusing slave labor in the past are actually safer now. They overcorrect and invest in auditing to avoid the issue happening again. This only applies to companies who care about their brand in this way though, like Target.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I know my clothes weren't made with slave labour?	labels:Make em yourself. But then what if the textiles were produced using slave labor?   Buy the fibers and a loom.  But what if the processing facility that produces the fiber uses slave labor to harvest?   Honestly, unless youre willing to grow your own cotton, and raise your own silkworms, and process the raw materials into a finished product...shop thrift. Give that money to your local owner instead of into the hands of a bunch of companies that make you worry about whether theyre using slave labor.  The clothes at thrift might have been produced unethically, but the local owner profits 100% from the sale of the clothing, and it doesnt support the evils.  But you can definitely produce your own silk, your own cotton, all of it. Lots of people do it, its just super fringe and takes a lot of time and patience.

text:Bruce Boyer on Finding Your Wardrobe and Sustainability in Fashion – Put This On (Derek Guy )	labels:Really good read as expected from Bruce. I know that sustainability is thrown around a lot and it can be a bit hypocritical or at least out-of-touch in regards to classic menswear. On the surface it can even seem elitist, since its a luxury, though Bruce here has shown that even he experimented and seems to encourage people to try different modes of menswear apart from trying to be timeless all the time.  I think it would be great if Bruce talked more about his taste, like why he liked George Cleverly and Anderson & Sheppard (I know he mentioned sensible lapels, etc).  I think diving into taste (or POV as it were) a bit more as it relates to menswear details would help show guys that while J. Crew suits and Meermin are fine and can last a long time with proper care, sometimes aesthetics for the sake of aesthetics win out in how we acquire clothing.
text:yeah that creeping need to want to 'upgrade' or have the 'best' is a big contributor to the unsustainability of fashion i feel like. Even though you could sell/donate the item, it may just end up being thrown away or shipped out. I still have a donegal crewneck from j.crew i bought 9 yrs ago that i still love to wear, but I can't say that I've kept every piece of clothing like that.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:In the interview Boyer mentions buying a custom three-piece flannel suit around 1965 for $125 — which would be $1,027 in 2020 dollars. That’s obviously quite a bit less than a similar piece would cost on Savile Row today, but it’s not like that was a cheap piece for a recent college grad at the time. I don’t know all the ins and outs around why the cost of tailored clothing rose faster than inflation, but I suspect it has a lot to do with the casualization of the Western wardrobe sharply reducing the demand for both bespoke clothing and its inputs (like wool), which meant the industry couldn’t profit from volume.  Inflation in particular seems to be an element people have difficulty mentally grappling with over time. If a guy grows up thinking a pair of jeans should cost $50, he’s likely to consider anything more than that outrageous even decades later, when the money is worth 3x less. I think this is an under-appreciated element of the race to the bottom in our clothing — it’s not just that Instagram encourages everyone to wear different clothes in every picture, it’s also that we’re conditioned to think price tags should never increase over time. The clothes most people wear every day are significantly cheaper than they used to be in real terms, and that was only made possible by using cheaper labor and cheaper materials.	labels:Furthermore, that generation wasn't really bothered by inflation, as the wages were generally keeping up with it. But since the late 70s, early 80s, wages have stagnated for most. I think this is the reason most people cannot justify saving for a higher quality item. Good quality garments nowadays are keep getting further out of reach for most.	episode_done:True

For me, it's a hobby I get to wear.	labels:One decent suit in any closet is always a must, a couple of times I got the job I was interviewing for simply because I wore a suit and tie to the interview.

text:> is always a must  It's not anymore though. For so many people wearing a suit just isn't needed outside of maybe a handful of events a year and at that point why bother spending anything more than a couple hundred?   You don't need a full canvas suit that's been made out of a fabric you picked for your measurements. Just like buy a navy worsted wool suit from J Crew on steep discount or any of the other many budget brands for suiting out there now.  You can vary easily do more than just get by with a suit that many people who browse here wouldn't even bother calling "decent". Many might not even need a suit at all. I can't remember the last time I needed to wear one.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:The Conscious and Somber Decision of Solid Jacketing	labels:I read a great portion of the essay, and what I felt was a great compliment to some of these outfits were 1) the green watch I think the OP wore, and 2) the orange watch worn by a red headed gentleman at Drake’s.  Very nice pieces indeed, and I really felt they complimented the solid colorways of the jackets, and the striped colorways of the shirts.	episode_done:True

text:The Conscious and Somber Decision of Solid Jacketing	labels:I also love solid colored jackets, but for a different reason. I try to only have two patterned pieces on my chest because I find it the most visually pleasing, and I love patterned shirts and ties so that only leaves room for a solid jacket.

text:The Conscious and Somber Decision of Solid Jacketing	labels:I'm a big fan of patterned pants, and thus solid jackets. Menswear already has so many pieces on the torso (tie, jacket, shirt, pocket square, maybe vest) that things just feel too top-heavy if wearing a patterned jacket and solid pants.
text:Very good point! I've probably subconsciously agreed with you on this, as embracing solid jackets is a contrasting move against being top heavy. Though I haven't made the push to patterned pants yet; currently getting used to solid colors like purple or red!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Hey! The vest over a sportsjacket is me! I too thought it was a bit bold — but I have seen it in some lookbooks before and decided to try it out. Without the lapels rolled over, it looks pretty atrocious, the parts of the jacket that stick out below the vest look misplaced. With the lapels pulled out there’s a little bit of continuity and the vest doesn’t dominate the upper body.   I definitely agree it’s not an everyday look, but for a layering challenge I thought I’d take a leap.	labels:	episode_done:True

I looked at your albums (HS til work, and the wardrobe) and perhaps I might’ve missed it but I think you’d look great with a plain tee + button up (tucked in, unbuttoned 1/3 ~ halfway). Maybe roll your sleeves up too?  I also really liked the sweater + collared (I assume a button up) outfit, but I guess the Texas weather ain’t great for that—but I’d love to see you in smart casual. I’m curious how’d you look like with glasses in these types of outfit—it’ll lean towards the nerdy side if that’s your thing. I also think a plain white button up for work would be nice—although it’s common and boring if you wear it right it’ll look great.  Try cardigans? I only skimmed through your future purchase so if you were planning on getting it, oops.  And the Adam Driver resemblance is uncanny—I can’t tell if I prefer you with long hair. You look great in both the work/WAYWT length hairs.  Korean men fashion is somewhat similar to the Japanese fashion style but I think there’s more so if you wanna look into that too.   I know very little about men’s shoes but I think finding more (semi) formal (?) options (leather... etc;) would benefit your outfit in the long run.

text:I’m moving from California to Michigan. Best way to move my wardrobe?	labels:I moved across country. May be an unpopular opinion, but use the opportunity to clear out the wardrobe and free up some space. When I moved I sold off/donated probably half of my clothes and shoes. Otherwise, what I did:  \- Left everything that was in the dresser/drawers in there and moved them as one piece (even stuffed extra stuff in each drawer)  \- Space bags for all of my button downs (lots of ironing when I arrived)  \-  Anything that could tolerate it (like suits, wool coats, down jackets), I rolled, folded, etc and packed them into either space bags or just into boxes  \- Packed shoes into boxes as tight as possible (I don't keep the shoe boxes normally)  \- Anything of any high monetary or sentimental value (RMC leathers, a few of my favorite Vibergs/Aldens, etc) traveled with me in the car.

text:What's Up With G By Guess?	labels:G by Guess, as you know it, is dead. Gone. The name will still exist, but it is basically a Guess Factory store. GBG has been struggling to perform well financially for a long time. The G by Guess design team does not exist anymore. Before COVID happened, Guess laid off the entire team, and the few designers/employees that survived were transferred to the Factory team. If you still want some quality, I suggest spending your money at the regular Guess stores. Their quality is still quite good in a lot of their clothing (accessories is a whole different story) and there is a dedicated Design team that still produces new collections every season. My source: I am close with several friends that have worked/are still working at the headquarter offices in Downtown Los Angeles.
text:Thank you so much for the insight. Yeah, the writing is on the wall. I know the brand was never popular since I always felt I was the only one buying their stuff. Sucks about the design team because the men’s stuff used to be good. Forever 21 had REALLY GOOD men’s stuff when the men’s line first debuted too, but they let go of a ton of designers too (many whom I heard were from GUESS).	labels:You’re welcome :) I actually met one of the Senior Designers working with the G by Guess team and he was actually really good. You can tell he was really creative and was able to design with the customer in mind. I do think that in the past few years they had a lot of limitations brought upon by upper management since the brand wasn’t performing as it used to. The brand, as a whole, is not what it used to be back in the days. Like F21, it’s days are long gone. Now, the company is only plagued by sexual allegations made against Paul Marciano, among other things. Not even their collaborations with J Balvin, JLO, etc. seem to do anything for them.
text:I think I’ve heard of the allegations but yeah as a long-time fan, I could notice design quality dropping GREATLY. Even for the mainstake GUESS brand. It sucks, really. And GBG never really got its footing in the market because it came out at a time when F21 and H&M started expanding in the US. And when you compare prices, people would rather pay less. GBG did have some unique stuff 2010-2012 it seems because that’s when I bought the most stuff from the brand.	labels:You’re absolutely right. GBG did not have a chance standing against the Goliaths that were F21, Zara and H&M. Their price points were much higher, with similar, if not the same quality. They did have more design injected into their clothing, but unfortunately customers tend to favor price over design and quality. Glad to know you were able to at least experience GBG at its peak :)
text:I wonder where all these designers went off to when GUESS/GBG let them go. Yeah I hated seeing GBG lose its flair out of nowhere. All their later designs became very plain. I have no idea what they’re doin now merchandising-wise by filling GBG stores with GUESS Factory stuff. Might as we just close the GBG stores. I guess corporate is still figuring something out and they are filling stores with non-GBG stuff in the process.	labels:I think most of them just went off to F21, or other companies in the LA area. Even when a brand is not doing well, the name alone still has some value. They are probably trying to hold on to whatever the name “G by Guess” still has in value. If they were to give up the name, they can potentially loose trademark/copyright of that name and it becomes available for anyone else to pick up if they show Guess not using that name. I think it is honestly all legalities.
text:Interesting. I wonder what value they see if it’s so obvious they’ve been on a decline for so long and ate scrubbing the name. It’d be odd to have the GBG sub-brand living under GUESS Factory forever. And it is sad the designers went on F21 because the stuff there (I am speaking for men) has declined so so much. When the men’s stuff came out in 2008, the designs and quality were SO good. Yes, it is fast fashion, but quality was so there. I bought F21 like crazy up till 2014 or so when quality started to slip. I met a guy who knew designers at F21 and said many from the initial Heritage 1981 men’s launch were pouched from GUESS (the irony).	labels:	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Zara | January 30, 2021	labels:2012 through about 2014 I was out of college, unemployed for stretches, underemployed for others, and underpaid for the rest. After being unemployed post-college in 2012 and living with my parents, and then my entire annual income in 2013 was about $13,000 while I was living on my own, and somewhere around $20,000 in 2014. I had some freelance gigs here and there where I could pull in $500 or $1000 bucks outside my reported income, but I was ostensibly "living in poverty" for a few years.  Zara was honestly kind of a godsend in that period, I needed somewhat fashionable clothing but had basically no money to spend on it. I work in the contemporary art world and dressing well is literally part of my job. While Zara isn't exactly highly respected, I was able to get some decent looking clothing on the cheap.  Today I find it easy to criticize Zara, whether it's the stolen designs, or the fast fashion model, or the inconsistent sizing, the sweatshop labor, and so on, but I admit that for a moment in my life they were a really useful utility. When I didn't have money for clothes but I needed decent looking clothes, Zara was one of the best options available to me. There's a lot of better options in the world if you have time and money, as I do now, but I'd be a hypocrite to ignore the benefit they provided me when I had neither time nor money.  Also while they're not exactly a "buy it for life" brand, their clothes didn't fall apart on me either, so, I'll give them props for that. Everything lasted an appropriate amount of time for the price.

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Zara | January 30, 2021	labels:twice, I've coincidentally lived right next to a Zara (like a 2-3 minute walk). As a result I often popped into the store and bought a few things.  My experiences were hit and miss, mostly misses  Hits:    Faux suede stuff.  They look and feel nice. I've often get compliments on it. I don't like dealing with actual suede, so the faux stuff is nice.     Sizing. so far sizing for tops has mostly been consistent so its easy to order online and know what to expect  Returns. super easy either online or in person.  Sales. Here they go on sale immediately July 1 and Jan 1.  You can get good deals on many things such as a faux suede jacket for roughly 20 USD, a long coat for roughly 30, etc  Style.  I think thats the reason many go here.  The styling looks really unique and interesting. although yes, there are really strange stuff there too  Blazers/sport coats.  Fits well and looks nice.  Miss:  Stitching. Like some one said earlier, its really bad. things are always loose, buttons fall off, even buckles break. more than half of the Zara items I've bought had some major stitching issues within the first half year.   Jackets. although they are cool, I've had all kinds of problems. A bomber jacket where all texture threads became loose and made a hole.  A linen moto jacket where the buckle just broke off and fixing it costed more than the jacket. My Faux suede sherling denim style jacket looks great and new but all the button stitching around the button holes have all frayed.. and i hardly use the buttons since there are zippers!   Knits. unravels, pills quickly etc  all Bottoms. discolors easily. pills easily. tons of loose threading  when I was a college student it was nice. the sale items are cheap and you can look cool  but after graduating, having more disposable income, etc.. I've mostly moved on.	episode_done:True

text:How Japan's Best Men’s Magazines Gained a Cult Following in the US	labels:Having traveled to Japan, I can second the exceptional quality of magazines there.  Or rather, magazines are no different in Japan than other things: some of them are just pure perfection due to the dedication and effort of their creators.  It is well known here in the sub that the same applies for Japanese denim and even for fast fashion like Uniqlo, among many other things. When they do something, the Japanese really do it right.	episode_done:True

text:How Japan's Best Men’s Magazines Gained a Cult Following in the US	labels:I love these magazines for their pictures and some articles, but I always felt a lot of them just end up being big ads for their friends stores/brands. Many of the ones made by the same publisher like Clutch, 2nd, Go Out, Lightning also just focus on buying with some short flowery description of the product and not much else. I’d like to see more stuff that involves lifestyle, articles, and stuff. Although it makes sense that the lack of this has brought in more readers from the west, more product pictures and less blocks of text. I also understand that the magazines scopes are limited so therefore they must retread the same discussions over and over.  Also the fact that Go Outs focuses mostly on glamping (glam camping, it was a top searched word in Japan last year) kills me as some one who loves outdoor stuff. It doesn’t have much in the way of actual camping, just setting up huge luxurious tents in an open field for the most part.  Maybe I’m just salty because all the magazines show cool stores but all of them are in Tokyo while never here in Kyoto.	episode_done:True
text:How Japan's Best Men’s Magazines Gained a Cult Following in the US	labels:I wonder if /u/Shrimp_My_Ride might be able to provide his perspective on the differences that the Japanese mindset/values have that result in such detailed products
text:Absolutely and thanks for the heads up. In my mind, it is two basic factors...devotion to principle and attention to detail.      The first is that when Japanese people choose a job or a hobby or something similar, they really make it the central focus on their lives. They tend to work way harder, spend way more time talking and thinking about it, and work much longer hours. If you have a magazine, not only the founder and main editors, but every little guy down to the smallest job will really devote themselves to that job, prioritizing it over their free time and identifying the purpose of their lives as to make that magazine the best it can be. Japanese people don't sit at work thinking about what they will do when they get off, they sit at home thinking about what they will do when they get to work.    Second, Japanese people tend to be VERY detail-oriented (read, anal-retentive). And they will have meeting after meeting or spend hour after hour on the tiniest detail. And maybe it's not anything that anybody would ever notice, but together it really forms the bigger picture. Just as an example, I am a shoe guy and a few weeks ago I tied my laces in something called the "berluti knot" to try something new. 10+ people the very first day at my company must have noticed it and asked questions about what it was, why I was using it, how to tie it, etc.    I could write more, believe me. And obviously these are generalizations and there are lazy, directionless Japanese people and those from other countries with these qualities as well. But speaking as an overall trend, this is why we see the uniqueness and quality of certain Japanese things.	labels:Love the shoe knot anecdote. That is attention to detail and bet made your day providing "tutorials" on how to tie that knot :)

text:What are "iconic" items that you should know about, and their basic history? What items can singularly be identified as "starting a trend"?	labels:Timberlands yellow nubuck boots have an interesting history, kind of the first major crossing of workwear and urban street wear. Depending on who you ask, it was drug dealers or just urban blacks started wearing insulated timberlands to keep their feet warm standing on the cold concrete late at night. Timberland was slow to embrace this new market, and that brought some controversy. If you believe that it was primarily drug dealers buying the boots you can understand why Timberland didn't want to develop that reputation, if you believe it was urban blacks then it looks a lot like racism. I tend to think they were trying market to construction workers, and were worried the urban buyers would be a shorter term market. In the end, there are plenty of better construction boots out there and they went where the money is greenest and have been an fashion staple ever since.  Buffalo check (red and black check) coats were originally full blown wool blankets that women would sew into jackets for their husbands logging in the PNW. Now it's just a popular pattern in general, and some people still swear by blanket coats.	episode_done:True

text:Tailoring is so often maligned as being uncomfortable by design, but I think the trends towards slim and skinny cuts over the last fifteen years are to blame -- to the point where many people have no idea how a suit is supposed to fit.  If jackets or formal trousers are too uncomfortable, the two most likely factors at fault are a) you are wearing an inappropriate fabric for the season and b) they are too tight. It's true that a suit is unlikely to ever feel as soft and flexible as a pair of joggers and a t-shirt, but for the most part there's no reason why it should be uncomfortable.  Some general tips: higher waists and wider thighs for trousers than what is currently trendy is much more comfortable - as is holding them up with braces rather than a belt, if that is a style you're happy with. Jackets should have wide enough shoulders and narrow enough armholes that they do not affect your movement at all; the fabric should just drape off you.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: What is the difference between off the rack (OTR), made to measure (MTM) and Bespoke?	labels:**Off the Rack / Off the Peg / Ready to Wear**: You go to a store. You see a thing. You buy it. You can tailor it afterwards if you want to.  **Made to measure**: You have your measurements taken. Your measurements are sent somewhere. The thing you buy is made according to your measurements and specifications. Options may be limited, or... not-so-limited, depending on the company you work with.  **Bespoke**: You go to a tailor's shop. He measures you. He makes you a pattern, and then a suit, with his own hands, with his own shears. There are multiple fittings. He will do anything as long as he wants to do it -- you can ask for any fabric, any detail, and as long as it fits the house style and he doesn't think you're an idiot, you'll probably get it.  Edit: okay, so bespoke can be outsourced. The technical definition is that the pattern from which the suit is made. For made to measure, there's a standard pattern, and they adjust a number of measurements to fit you better. For bespoke, they make a pattern just for you from scratch. What this actually means for fit depends on a lot of specifics, including house style and how many measurements the MTM shop is willing to customize.  Generally, the difference between MTM and bespoke is complicated, and only stands out if you really know what you want and what the MTM shop can't do -- high-end MTM will usually fit very well and come with a lot of customization options and very hig hquality.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: What is the difference between off the rack (OTR), made to measure (MTM) and Bespoke?	labels:/u/blackstrider has a great TL;DR but I'll add a bit more detail to MTM and Bespoke.  MTM: The pattern/style is generally pretty fixed, often there aren't fittings, and you make adjustments by changing standard measurements like "I want to add 0.5" to the leg opening". Pretty flexible format but I find it takes a couple of garments to really figure things out which can be tough.  Bespoke: Often a pattern is created for *you*, there are multiple fittings (in-person). This is where you can get really specialized tailoring looking at the pitch of you arms, how much you round your shoulders, etc. Bespoke tailors/cordwainers will also have styles that they specialize in so don't go to a tailor that specializes in structured "English drape" if you're looking for a casual unlined jacket or something.

text:A Bespoke Shirtmaker On How A Shirt Should Fit	labels:Sleeves are my eternal issue with shirts, and why for so long I opted for short sleeve shirts. So often with RTW shirts the cuffs are so big they start sliding down my hand (looking at you, Charles Tyrwhitt). If they have a second button quite often it makes a dip in a bit rather than the complete circle and often still goes down my hand enough that the cuff bends when I move my hands. So many RTW shirts also have their sleeves a bit too short for me (kind of acceptable considering overly large cuffs). Some end up being too tight in the upper sleeve, painfully cutting into my arms if I reach forward (looking at you again, Charles Tyrwhitt) no matter the size.

text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:NGL you can make some decent fits with amazon/target/walmart tier items - but they are not very good quality and not very good for the environment or workers.    I've still got a few essential items and styles that I was experimenting with from those places - but usually upgrade or look for vintage replacements after I figure out what I'm looking for.	episode_done:True
text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:You can. It's not a great place to do it, you'll get better values from other companies, and limiting yourself to just amazon will just not make you look good, but... Focus on fit, start with some basics, return them if they don't fit, and you'll look fine.  Try to avoid polyester.

text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:I’d doubt that Amazon offers enough quality pieces to really redo your wardrobe.  If you’re 21 and not really making money yet I still wouldn’t look for the cheapest items and “biggest steals.”  I’d look to add pieces here and there as I go along that fit the weather/routines you’re currently experiencing.  I’m not advocating for buying overpriced pieces either, just simply stating that just because you may be able to buy a “complete wardrobe” off Amazon you may be very disappointed in your choices if your wardrobe is shot by the time you’re 23.  Good quality clothes can last forever, and the money you spend will stretch further.	episode_done:True
text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:A huge chunk of my wardrobe is built out from Amazon. I add everything to a list, and wait until Amazon's algorithms decide they need to sell it for $6. They also offer Tall sizes on quite a lot of items, which is great for having sleeves that fit.  Uniqlo for jeans, Amazon's Peak Velocity brand for Tshirts, and Goodthreads for everything else is what I would do if I had to start from Scratch.  If there's a certain type of item your looking for, feel free to ask for recommendations and I can send you a link to what I'd look at.
text:Thanks for sharing!   Items I'm looking for:  \- White sneakers - preferably leather   \- Jeans - Slim/skinny light blue, navy, black   \- Jackets - from bomber jackets to other non-bomber kinds  \- Sweaters or sweatshirts I can layer under my jacket  \- Long sleeve shirts/henleys  \- boots   If you've come across any of these on amazon that you think may be decent purchase I'd love to check it out	labels:White Sneakers - Stan Smiths. Watch FrugalMaleFashion, got mine for $40  Jeans- Uniqlo is the best bang for the buck imo. Their selvedge lines are much more durable than Levis to me  Jackets - Check out Goodthreads. I got a french terry hoodie & bomber that i'm pretty impressed with for under $20 each  Henleys: Check out the Peak Velocity athletic henley.  Boots - I don't think you're going to find anything too great below $100. You can grab some Golden Fox boots, but i'd rather save up the extra $75 and get Iron Rangers seconds from Sierra Trading Post or elsewhere.  &#x200B;  I'd recommend poking around some sites like Dappered, or Primer.

I've bought jeans from Amazon in the past that came with low-quality buttons and ripped after 2 months of wear, so I don't think the quality is quite there. My recommendation would be to search on places like Uniqlo/Carhartt/Champion or even thrift stores to get better quality jeans/jackets/knitwear that can last you a lot longer than whatever you'd find on Amazon for a comparable price.
text:Yeah - I wouldn't skimp on denim and footwear. A nice pair of boots that will last years and grow patina, same with denim fades.

Of course it won't look as nice as a more expensive pair, but if your goal is just to look presentable then cheaper denim can do the trick imo!	episode_done:True

text:Haha yeah - I will admit that there were a few periods where I was unable to wear them frequently. I have actually lost weight after purchasing them 5 years ago, and the relaxed fit probably reduced any chance for common crotch blowouts. Other than that, I just wear them like jeans. Wash them without much care, in the machine. The recent pairs from last year were to fill up some wardrobe holes.. a black pair, a super neppy pair, an interesting dye pattern, and one that was appropriate for sport coats & blazers.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Whats with all the "stretchy mens pants" startups I am seeing all of a sudden?	labels:This is only me personally, and disagrees with the current vibe on this sub, but here goes.  I think people want the look of well-fitted, tailored, bordering on skinny pants.  I think the majority of the (western) world sees these tighter fitting clothes as more attractive.  However, they're not the most comfortable in many cases.  They restrict movement.  Reddit's answer and even to a degree forward-ish fashion has been to get loose fitting things and create a vibe around that look.  Big silhouettes and wide lines.  It's super comfortable.  The middle ground is to get tighter fitting clothes that still move with you - you have the look of the skinny clothes with the freedom of the loose clothes.	episode_done:True

text:Why It's Important to have a Style POV & Desired Aesthetic	labels:A well-thought out and reasoned article! I think I have some consolidating to do when it comes to my personal style POV. I tend to approach dressing from the perspective of artistic performance, and so I'm drawn to a lot of different aesthetics that don't mix-and-match as well. It depends on my mood. I am envious of your ability to have cohesion across all of the outfits in your article; no matter what style they may be, they all look like you!	episode_done:True
text:Why It's Important to have a Style POV & Desired Aesthetic	labels:I really agree with this post. As I've gotten more into fashion I really have begun focusing on intention of a fit. Using jeans as an example you can wear jncos to slp skinnies and all can "fit" depending on the aesthetic you are going for. deciding that aesthetic and discovering clothes that fit within it is the most fun part of fashion for me.   I think it's worth talking about how you do this when your POV/aesthetic isn't so cut and dry as vintage menswear or repro workwear as well. That's where I  struggle. It's easy to copy/mimic things but mixing influences to create your own style is a difficult process because of the trial and error required.
text:>  I think it's worth talking about how you do this when your POV/aesthetic isn't so cut and dry as vintage menswear or repro workwear.   Thats incredibly important. Obviously I'm writing from a place of personal bias, but I definitely think a similar mindset could be used for other styles, especially as most "common" ones have a root in classic/vintage menswear. For example, Engineered Garments and Evan Kinori have a similar basis, but done with a twist on details and silhouette.  I think its healthy to simply think about *why* a piece of clothing appeals to you and to have your own inspo albums saved for reference (and explanation, if people ask you why you did something). Trial and error is a big part of it and shouldn't be dissuaded from!  And even then I think that mimicing is an important part of style; copying would be if you wore the exact same things the same way as your inspo. The latter seldom happens due to budget or accessibility to certain brands.  For example, I've done SLP inspired looks, but instead of head-to-toe YSL, I could wear a 1950's biker jacket, reproduction rayon shirt, thrifted black levis, and RM Williams. It might be mimicing as a whole, but its still my own take on it with the pieces I already own.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Why It's Important to have a Style POV & Desired Aesthetic	labels:I only skimmed this (I do enjoy reading your posts, just on a lunch break and today's a long day) but I can totally get so much of it. It's only been recently that I've really gotten what I want to look like, and it really is great to not feel tied down by what "works" in a traditional sense. Sometimes there are more meh days and such but the fun for me has been getting to the look that I want to see myself in, and it has really helped me feel more confident and not like I'm just wearing a costume. Though that isn't to say my days arent frequently pretty basic, but even then there's always a piece in an outfit that I wanted there to be, whether it's a specific shirt that I like the pattern, or how a specific bracelet goes with my colors.  Though I will add something, I do find it quite frustrating when someone asks me for advice. Not because I don't like helping people with clothes (I quite love it sometimes), but because a lot of these people don't know what they want to look like and while I *can* dress them it's not really *them*.
text:Thanks for perusing, haha! I'm glad that you're getting closer to your own POV and acting on it. That intentionality is really what makes it seem less like a costume *and* makes mistakes easier to swallow.    I totally get you on the basic days- even I have my lazy stuff, but it could be white socks + loafers or a bucket hat that makes it my outfit more interesting and special lol.

You can also find causal shoes that are hemp (i have an older pair of Adidas that are 100% hemp fabric uppers). Plenty made out of leather as well.  Do you have a budget for clothes? A lot of companies that use these alternative materials are considered "premium" brands and carry their price tags accordingly.

I'm willing to pay as much as needed for this kind of "alternative material" jean.

text:Dress shoes EEE trouble	labels:I mean, they look like sneakers with a loafer Halloween costume that they put together with stuff from their closet 5 minutes before leaving to trick or treat. In other words, they are sneakers pretending to look like dress shoes, and it shows. Generally speaking, elastic on a loafer like that is a marker of low quality... there’s very, very few attractive and high quality loafers that have it.  BUT, your health has to come first. The brand that would be most recommended here for good dress shoes that can accommodate wide feet is Allen Edmonds. But it’s understandable if they aren’t affordable for you. You might want to check out diabetic specialty shoes.	episode_done:True
text:Dress shoes EEE trouble	labels:As some posters have mentioned, Allen Edmonds makes great dress shoes and have width sizes up to EEE (3E). They also make orthotic shoes or used to at least. I know price is a big factor for you, so I *highly* recommend checking eBay for a used pair of Allen Edmonds orthotics in 3E. As long as you don’t mind wearing used shoes. You can often find like new or barely used pairs. The orthotic models often go for under $50 used in my experience (I sell used dress shoes online).   I can help find you a pair. You can PM me or comment your normal shoe size and I can see if I can find a suitable, fashionable shoe for you on eBay.	episode_done:True

text:Dress shoes EEE trouble	labels:I can relate with you quite a lot because I too must wear eee shoes and have searched for brands that fit my desired style choices and budget. Alas, my recommendations are likely not to be too budget friendly; my favorite company is Alden and my second choice is Allen Edmonds. Both are made in America brands (with AE having some exceptions) and offer a great array of width options ranging from A to EEE.  I have worn AE for nearly three years now with my favorite last being the 201 and the 1757, both of which offer more generous toe boxes and insteps: However, my favorite shoe of all time is the Alden 405 (and the 403) because the last perfectly contours to my natural foot shape. This detail is essential because my right foot is slightly but noticeably wider than my left foot. Of course, none of these suggestions are cheap.   After I graduated from university three years ago I went to my local AE store and was properly fitted. I then searched on Ebay for a proper fit and found a decent pair of AE shoes in my size hoping to buy a new shoe later on to make sure the AE salesperson's great customer service did not go unthanked ( eventually I bought my Dalton boots from her). Then last year, I stumbled upon Shoe Mart's Alden Seconds program, reached out to their customer service team to figure out what my Alden Tru balance size. Soon after, I purchased the Alden 405 and instantly fell in love with it. The arch support is great, the ankle support is superb, and most importantly, the toe box fit like a rugged glove.  I hope my personal experience is of some help. Just keep in mind that buying used is not a bad thing if you put in the effort to properly clean and sterilize each purchase until you save enough to buy a new pair.	episode_done:True
text:Dress shoes EEE trouble	labels:Look at the good feet store or sasshoes.com. Red Wing and Hush Puppies both make extra wide. Look at outlet malls or discount stores on the sales rack. Nordstrom Rack usually has good deals on shoes. Spend the extra 20 dollars to get nice shoes.

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Camoshita | January 23, 2021	labels:I love Camoshita and look forward to the new seasons every year. I've never handled a piece from the brand that wasn't perfectly executed and ultra comfortable. I don't wear a lot of suiting, but I've had some of their shirts and outerwear on heavy rotation for years.	episode_done:True
text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Camoshita | January 23, 2021	labels:I've owned (emphasis on owned) a couple of Camoshita pieces over the years and while I have good things to say about them, I will also add that the brand is practically laser focused in what I think it does (that is, casual contemporary #menswear). I hesitate to use casual because of its manifold definitions in clothing, but I'm talking about bold patterns and detailing, not pretending a chore coat is a suit jacket.  Anyway, the one suit I've had is excellent, though maybe only appropriate at weddings because of its general boldness. In detailing, it is almost identical to my normal United Arrows suit. The buttons are really nice, "lighter" than my american and european suit options with a nice iridescent glow. Is it mother of pearl? I don't know, but it's definitely flashy if you know where to look. The sportcoat I had was similarly detailed and it made me look like a used car salesman with its bold, brown check. This is a good thing, but I unfortunately rarely have call to look like a used car salesman so I moved it on. What made me give up on the brand were the shirts: twice I bought them on deep sale but found them far too trim, especially through the sleeves, and too fussy with the buttons. I can't exactly recall but I remember there being more than one place on both shirts that had more buttons than should be there. More than I care to put up with.  Anyway, the point is to say that if Camoshita fits your life, it's great. I love my suits and still wear them. The materials, work, and design details are, in my limited experience, unimpeachable. But of course, if what Camoshita does isn't what you want, the infinite steez of Kamoshita-san isn't suddenly going to rub off on you and make you the Prince of Pitti.	episode_done:True

It was a nice magazine and had it been more convenient I would have bought it, but it was $25 and fairly large, and we were traveling kind of light and I didn't want to schlep it around for the next two weeks, so back on the shelf it went.
text:Not to potentially feed a new addiction but if u snoop around on ZenMarket most of these Magazines go for sub $10, Popeye especially is like $2-5 a pop, I’ve bought magazines for less than a dollar lol	labels:Very cool! Thanks for this recommendation	episode_done:True

text:Author here. This is a very valid point. That IS excessive, even on my scale. I have way too many now that I had to stock up when the good ones became available.  I don't want to try to explain away this, but I might add some minor points to add nuance.  Part of this inventory is at my summer house (most Finns have a summer house to go hide in), so this inflates inventory. I also need whites and blacks to with my button down shirts at work. The tanks also have a different use case.  At least they don't go out of fashion or anything. It will take a good while for me to get back down to a more sensible level, but they will all be used.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I stopped taking him seriously after I saw how many undershirts he had and how he threw some out after less than 20 wears and throws out shoes after 50 wears	labels:Author here. I understand that. As to the 20 wears for underwear T-shirts, I might note that I always (have to) wear an underwear shirt to protect whatever I wear on top of it. Most of the time, it is a button down shirt at work. I wash the underwear t-shirt after each use. It may be due to my exceptionally high metabolism, but they really start being rather shabby after 25-30 uses, some after only 20 (especially if worn on hot summer days).   It actually really bothers me that I cannot make them last longer in my work context. When i divest they, I do continue use though as sportswear or garden work or whatever where it doesn't matter that they are a bit shabby.  As of shoes, that one pair that lasted only 50 days were really falling apart.
text:The undershirts I can kinda explain, I think you probably need to buy better undershirts and question what you define as shabby, but still.   The shoes I’m struggling with, what on earth would you be doing to your shoes that they’d need to be replaced after 50 wears? Or what shoes are your even buying ? A lot of shoes are just finally being broken in properly at 50.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Not so much the process but the opportunity to actually work there: How old are you and how did you originally get into that line of work?	labels:I'm in my mid-20's. Have been working in menswear for the entirety of my working years, so almost a decade in the business now.   While its not exciting -- I started at Brooks Brothers. This was years ago, when the brand stood for something. I got to work along some hardcore industry vets who took me under their wing.   Then over the years I have gotten to work at just about every "type" of menswear shop. Big box retailers, flashy online-only outfits, bottom of the barrel makers, the extreme top of the top family owned shops.   I've been able to do everything within the business, too. I've sold, designed collections, marketed, ran operations, did the buying, taken out the trash, taped up and shipped orders. The whole thing.	episode_done:True

text:Mostly business info but I was wondering: How is your business doing?   Why does Savile Row as a collective not really work together on marketing and media?      Is there a big gap between a Tailor's management and workers?	labels:Business for us is doing exceptionally well, thank you for asking. We are unique in the Savile Row shops that we have a fully equipped team in the US (cutter, undercutter, seller, etc.) so have been able to keep the US business thriving while most of our competitors have not been able to travel to the US. Its been a slight rise YOY. Coincidentally, we are most worried about Q1 2021.   The short answer is that most of the shops on Savile Row just don't do much marketing, period. We have done some stuff here and there with different partners to get word out, but it is still very much an old school, word of mouth business. With that there is still a strong reliance on the thought process of "**We** are Savile Row! They will come to **us**!". Its a bit antiquated, and isn't the best aspect of the business. Also, most of the marketing and media opportunities that do come through tend to heavily advantage one shop or another, and therefore you want to do what you can to highlight your own brand vs. all of the shops. Think of someone like PTO or Permanent Style doing an article on one of the Saville Row shops -- they won't be likely to name drop all of the other shops along the way.   I'm not quite sure what you are asking about the third question, if you'd like to clarify I'm happy to answer. Are you asking if there is a gap between who manages the tailors and the tailors themselves? Cutters vs. Tailors?	episode_done:True

Part of the award includes a photoshoot to be printed in said magazine.   I'm a creative director for a living, I work in an environment that prides itself on comfortable dress. I have tailored suits, I know how to put together a nice outfit. However, I'd like to do something a bit different for this shoot. The suit is obvious, it's expected. How can I switch it up? Show off some more creativity in patterns, materials, or unexpected pieces.
text:I’d probably do   - unstructured sport coat with pattern or texture in something like dark burgundy or deeper green as an alternative to blue - shirt, pick what color you want - wool pants with some more texture or pattern, eg. a chalk stripe flannel or something. I think a medium gray would be the move here and would pair well with just about any jacket.  - tie and pocket square optional, I probably wouldn’t as it could come across as stuffy. Could do a square with no tie. - shoes id keep *slightly* more casual; maybe a chelsea boot or a penny loafer or something. You’re a creative director so show some creativity.  If you want some inspiration look at stuff like Drake’s, Boglioli, or Eleventy.  It would not hurt to bring two jackets, or if you decide to wear a tie, two ties, to the shoot in case one photographs drastically better.   Look a little creative but don’t add a bunch of accessories so it doesn’t look like you’re trying too hard.	labels:	episode_done:True

As a dude with an odd shape, big ass and thighs while having short legs, they fit really well without being too loose.      My only problem is I feel ethically wrong about wearing these pants, as they're made of 65% polyester, and washing them releases microplastics into the water. I'm trying to move my wardrobe, eventually, to being mostly if not exclusively organic materials like cotton and wool.     Does anyone know of any pants/work pants that have a similar fit to them, but might not use as much polyester/are 100% cotton?

There are elements of that style that have mainstream appeal today, high-waisted wool trousers being one example. However, when you take them in context with the more "interesting" elements you picked out it gives off serious cosplay vibes.

The key difference is that the style you're going for here has _such_ a strong association with cosplay and videogames and so little mainstream appeal that the number one association people are going to make is that you are cosplaying.

While the Rick Owens aesthetic may not have mainstream appeal it _is_ very accepted within fashion circles and _doesn't_ have that strong cosplay association.  So with that said my advice is to take what you've got and tone it down. Treat it like a high-fashion runway show and take inspiration from it instead of trying to recreate it 1:1. High-waisted trousers, great. Gaiters? Maybe just get some actual boots. Bloodborne-style woolen collars/scarves/hooded shawls? Wear a regular scarf that has an interesting shape or texture, or a shirt with a more exaggerated collar.

text:I appreciate your comment and understand what you're saying. Like I said in the post, I have tried many aesthetics and styles through out the years and I really do think I know what I'm talking about when it comes to dressing well. I have no need to prove anything to you but in my own social circles I've always been the stylish one and most of my friends come to me for advice or do the exact thing that I'm doing here, which is ask me where to go to find certain items.  I just don't really understand the fascination with people wanting to tell me that what I'm looking for is wrong, and forgive me if I'm misinterpreting this, and then I should stop and look for something more mainstream and appropriate? I mean to me, isn't that part of fashion? To step out of your boundaries and try new things?   If all your comment is is a warning that I may look like a cosplayer,  then I appreciate it. But funny enough, I am also a cosplayer and I think there is a fine line between items that will look like everyday clothes vs costume pieces and I'm doing my best to find those.  And either way, you won't know until you try it :)	labels:> If all your comment is is a warning that I may look like a cosplayer,  then I appreciate it.  That's all it is. There are plenty of people who try e.g. the Rick Owens aesthetic and fail to pull that off because they don't have a feel for what works and what doesn't. Confidence is also a huge deciding factor in whether you're pulling it off or not. I'm not saying it isn't possible, just that you really have to know what you're doing in order to be successful with it.  Like the other guy who replied to me said, if you have to ask you probably shouldn't.  > I just don't really understand the fascination with people wanting to tell me that what I'm looking for is wrong  We get _a lot_ of people coming through here and asking our opinions on wearing cosplay gear. Some items are asked about so frequently that they've become huge in-jokes in the community (BR2049 coat, Drive scorpion jacket, Bloodborne trench coats) so the first assumption people are going to make, particularly here, is that you're another one of those people. When someone comes here asking if they can pull off a Bloodborne-style coat the answer is almost always no. Not in the contexts in which you want to wear it, not in the outfits you intend to pair it with, not if the quality is terrible, not if you don't have the confidence to not care what the majority of people will think.  There's nothing wrong with doing this if you know what you're doing. If you're sure that what I'm saying doesn't apply to you then I really hope you find what you're looking for.   I genuinely look forward to any posts you make in WAYWT because I'd love to see someone successfully pull this off! If you have any inspiration images for complete outfits perhaps you could put an album together and post it here.
text:I would love to post pics once I find some stuff! I think maybe that's where it's getting muddled up: I don't think I asked if I could pull it off, I was just asking where to get them.	labels:You didn't ask, but people often skip considering whether they _should_ before they go full steam ahead and start spending money. Since this is an advice sub and the people asking questions are generally new to this and unsure of what they're doing, people here tend to err on the side of caution especially when it comes to more niche styles like this.	episode_done:True

text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:This seems like the makings of a really bad decision to me. Way too much going on. Unless you want to look like a cosplayer all the time I would recommend wearing only one or two statement pieces at any given time.   Perhaps the reason you can’t find any store that sells the times your looking for is a good indication that the style as a whole does not exist to the extent that you might hope.	episode_done:True
text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:You might want to check out some “artisanal avant-garde “ type designers. I tried to find a good album just now, but nothing really hit the mark exactly, but you might be able to put the pieces together. Try looking up some older Yohji Yamamoto (particularly for the high rise trousers), ann d, ma+, etc. Many pieces have this old-world but surreal feeling that you might like   Even if the prices are unobtainable, they may serve some guidance for your style that is (slightly) less video game vibed. Unfortunately, in my experience the line between cool aesthetic and cheap cosplay costume is often directly linked to the price
text:Thank you for the advice. These are items I'm definitely willing to pay for and I know what it will take to not have some of the accessory items look like silly costume pieces vs nice pieces. But finding those has proven difficult.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:For trousers/ pants I'd go with 2-pleat or ghurka trousers, both are high-waisted and look similar to what are featured in your general fashion board, actually I can see there are definitely Ghurka trousers in there. Same with Herringbone wool vests. Just by learning the names of the garments you'll have an easier time finding good brands.   The flecked suit you linked with the filson looking bag looks like Our Legacy's Midnight Sheep Jacket/Trousers from 2012. Good luck finding the exact thing, if you want to try grailed, Marrkt or ebay depending on where you live. Otherwise just include search times like "flecked" or "nep".  A lot of the clothing in the general fashion board looks to me like vintage workwear. I don't know what your budget is like but if you want to put a lot of money into it then brands like Belafonte, RRL and Pherrows might be quite good.   For the avant garde "Unique" stuff you have going on, try Rick Owens, Damir Doma, Julius, Number (N)ine, ann demeulemeester, and spend enough time in that circle and you'll figure out what you like

text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:A slouchy cardigan in a muted pattern.  Not mine, but I got it for my dad: Sunspel Riviera - they have some really nice yet understated colours in this superb mesh fabric. The aubergine is such a comforting colour - dark and easy on the eye, yet discernably saturated with purple. Some duller purples verge on brown tbh.  If you are lucky enough to find a good one in a reasonable price range - a bespoke or at least MTM shirtmaker. I was on holiday in Naples, spent basically Gitman money on bespoke shirts that are infinitely more special. Absolutely no regrets, it just conforms to my shoulder slope perfectly without any adjustment, and the armhole is so well-cut it doesn't dig into my armpits and yet gives me freedom of movement without snagging or tugging on the body of the shirt as I move. It made wearing a shirt become a pleasure, from a chore.	episode_done:True

text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:Some random ones off the top of my head:  - Lightweight popover shirt. I’ve got one in olive seersucker that I wear constantly in the summer. - A really good grey sweatshirt. Works as a mid layer in cold months or as the only thing over a pair of shorts in the summer and will be at home in a bunch of different styles. I like my Todd Snyder / champion one.  - Slim straight or straight dark wash or black jeans. As close to a “must own” piece of clothing as exists. - A good pair of boots. I like my RM Williams a lot at the moment, but something like a service boot or Chukka is equally useful. Great for all the situations “in between” sneakers and something more formal.  - Long coat like a duffle or balmacaan. Cool way to standout when it seems like every dude in existence has transitioned to patagonia or other down jackets for winter casual outerwear.

Worth every penny.  Ralph Lauren Slim fit OCBD - I find these the perfect balance between small collar uniqlo ones and old school baggy Brooks Brothers  Black bit loafers - the one dress shoe to go with if you don’t have to wear suits all the time.  Technically too casual for suits but it’s 2021 and no one cares, plus you can wear them with jeans with more casual outfits and get a whole lot more for your buck. I like Gucci but all brands make these at every budget.   One pair of black, and one pair of dark blue slim jeans  A nice wristwatch - I’m partial to a vintage Omega, vintage Rolex Datejust or a modern Panerai depending on your style that will go with everything and where you can mix and match different straps  Lululemon ABC Joggers - live in them when I don’t have to dress up, and they still don’t look sloppy  Uniqlo Merino sweaters - so cheap and does the job as a mid layer  Abercrombie sweatshirts - no logo options fit me great and are super cozy. I regret paying so much for John Elliot ones I have now  Suede biker or trucker jacket - that’s the one piece I go to when I want to look a bit “extra” and it always does the job  Denim shirt - go to casual piece to throw on a tshirt. I think Levi’s are cheap and fantastic   LBM blazers - great modern slim fit blazers with casual textures, fits perfect and you never look like you wore your suit jacket. Incredible value on sale for how much I wear them	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 18, 2021	labels:I'm renting a car to drive home with my SO (about a 14 hour drive). I rented from Avis and it was a bit expensive, about $450 (I purchased extra insurance). When I went to check on the rental, it said that the insurance was now $3,500 a day instead of $35 a day, so the rental would be more like $7,000. I was able to cancel the extra insurance, but wtf? In no way should it be legal to charge 14X the estimated price. The worst part is, no customer service agent was able to tell me why the charge increased, and the option for extra insurance just popped up at $35 a day.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 18, 2021	labels:For context, I'm 19 and I recently bought around $500 worth of clothes for black friday and this is the first time I've ever gone shopping for clothes for myself on a large scale.  Instead of looking for fashion trends I just looked for clothes that I thought would look good on me.  As my clothes got delivered, I tried them all on and was really happy with the way I looked.   But, recently something happened that made me very self-conscious about what I wear in public.  I was at a kickback with a couple of my friends, and a girl I didn't know walked up to me after I was done playing chess with my friend.  The first thing she said to me was "is that your boyfriend?"  This was a very weird situation for me because the first interaction I have with this person is already bad.  I say "No, I'm straight," and she replies "Oh, I thought you were gay."  I asked her why she thought I was gay and she told me it was because of my outfit.  Then she asks to play a game of chess against me and I didn't want to be unpleasant so I accepted.  The entire 15 minutes of that chess game I wanted it to be over because of how fucked the situation was. I was wearing jeans, a striped shirt, and a tan blazer.  I also frequently wear silver stud earrings, nothing too blingy.  This experience really hurt me because I'm a very self-conscious person.  I really enjoy being comfortable in what I'm wearing, and this has made me reconsider what to wear in public.   Are there any fashion styles I should enjoy if I want to avoid being titled as gay?  Or should I just keep wearing what I want to wear? I'd say that my personality and the way that I speak is a clear indication that I am straight, I'm just worried about people judging me before they meet me (because clearly that happens).
text:For a second lets remove the problematic conversation of looking "gay" or acting "straight", we can circle back to that in a moment.  Lets talk about context and clothes and bad habits we all have. When we start to do something new, we often over correct and this can be problematic in our personal lives. A lot of people will start their style journey and go a bit too fast and a bit too hard, styling themselves for an aspirational goal or lifestyle and ignoring where they are and what they're doing. Obviously you should dress how yourself however you feel, but then you've got to be willing to deal with people's reactions to your choices. So what do you do? Making sure your clothes aren't sending a message that doesn't vibe with the rest of your situation. You're 19 and wearing a tan blazer for a kickback with your friends, that's a bold look. In fact wearing a sports coat is super hard to do nowadays in a casual setting, it's almost immediately assumed to be "dressed up". Your peer group might not understand your new interest, but keep at it and being a little bit more stylish will become your thing. I still get teased for how much I like clothing, the number of shoes in the shoe rack, knits in the drawers - wearing chinos when everyone else is wearing sweatpants - that's life.  Now...I want to be really clear about this: There's no correct way to be Gay or Straight, a person's mannerisms, voice, personality, clothing is not dictated by their sexuality. The sooner you come to accept and understand that, the easier ride you're going to have in life and you'll be a better person. Neither is there anything wrong with being assumed to be gay, straight, bisexual, trans, queer, etc. it speaks to the other person more than it speaks to you. Be an Ally.   Finally, I understand that the world isn't awesome and that in some situations it can be dangerous for someone to think you're anything other than Straight. If you're in that situation, or around those people...stop, find new people, find new situations.	labels:	episode_done:True

Crew shirts made out of a material that feels exactly the same, but they don’t say Oxford on them. I also have a few other shirts that look the same but the material feels different.

text:That’s whack. Out of curiosity, how do you know this was a sweatshop vs a legit workspace?	labels:super crowded, poor ventilation, a staff consisting entirely of south asian women, not enough masks to go around, really, really cold inside, and when I walked in the foreman/manager was extremely hostile about making me leave. Even in the unlikely event that everyone working there had a visa and was being paid the (frankly criminal on it's own) NYC Garment worker minimum wage of 12-and-some-change an hour, the conditions were not at all safe (for covid or just generally).  "Sweatshop" doesn't really have a strict definition but if you saw this place you would certainly feel bad about your clothes being made there. It's kind of an open secret that these places exist in NY and LA but coming face to face with one was kind of a shock.	episode_done:True

text:Really hope the labor board does something about it. What borough was it in?   People are fucked. My friends and I (mostly me) do deep dives on weird/fucked up forums and there is some heinous shit out there. Like, ACTIVE forums talking about wild shit.   My friend’s dad is from what used to be Rhodesia. I wasn’t aware that it was a WP symbol. Thanks for the head’s up. Nother thing to look out for.	labels:It was in the garment district. And yeah, the surface web is underrated as a truly vile place. This forum in particular I forwarded to bellingcat since it seems like there's probably several war criminals active on it. Your friend's dad is from Zimbabwe? or does he consider himself a "Rhodesian Expat"? If it's the latter, that's a pretty big red flag (even though a lot of white "Rhodesians" were genuinely not racist people and mere victims of circumstance and the extensive media blackout by Smith's government, anyone who identifies as a Rhodesian is sus to me). Rhodesia is an insane (and totally depressing) story, but yeah the Rhodesian flag has been rising in popularity over the last couple years as a white nationalist symbol, specifically because of its relative obscurity to the general public. I'm a conflict history/general history nerd and one of my obsessive hobbies is tracking right wing extremism around the world, which is the only reason I recognized it when the order came in.
text:Yeah he says he was born in Rhodesia rather than Zimbabwe but I’ve never heard him wax poetic about it or anything. Both of his parents are older white folks and grew up in apartheid era South Africa/“Rhodesia” so I wouldn’t be surprised if they were pretty questionable politics wise.   Kudos to you for keeping track of right wing hate symbols. Might need some tips. I’ve got a Fred Perry store near me and I see some boneheads walking around pretty constantly. Should probably keep my head up looking for other signs too. Keep fighting the good fight man.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Drake's | January 16, 2021	labels:I have a handful ties from Drake's: one is Easyday, one is MTM, and the others are mainline.  I don't deny that other makers are better made, especially since Drake's ties are getting much more expensive than when I first saw the brand in 2014.  However, I think that mainly applies if you're buying solids or repps. I like buying their more abstract designs or "soft squares", as most other geometric ties out there simply don't have the same vibe (unless you're buying vintage).  The same could be said about their tapestry motif scarves, of which I also one own.  There's also their sleeveless cardigans which I really like. The wide rib on the "V", chunky buttons, and shorter length appeal to me, because again, not many other knitwear companies do it that way. Maybe if rubato made sweater vests.   I also own one Drake's shirt, which is a bold awning-esque multistripe. It seems okay, as like with the ties, I bought it for the pattern rather than the quality. It was acquired during a sale, so it was only $120~ compared to the 200+ it retailed for. In fact, all my Drake's items were bought on sale!	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Drake's | January 16, 2021	labels:I really love my items from Drake's (pretty much all bought on sale). I have a red lambswool jumper with a high crew neck, which isn't the easiest to wear with shirts but would be okay if it had a high enough collar. Had to have it repaired (didn't notice holes in the factory shop) and the repair was excellent - knew where the holes were and had trouble finding them still. I have a selection of neckties from Drake's which I haven't had a chance to wear yet but they have a nice heft and they feel lovely. I also have a purple 70% cashmere 30% silk scarf which is absolutely wonderful to wear.
text:One thing I really want to highlight with Drake's is that while the value proposition is reduced in terms of the items themselves (e.g. soft shouldered tweed jackets, etc) due to new competitors, Michael Hill's eye for colour is still one of the best in the game. His choice of pattern is amazing too, striking just the right balance between stodgy and kitschy to achieve a real sense of fun and enjoyment out of a more dressed up look.	labels:An example of this is the first Drake's shirt I bought - a cranberry + white university stripe oxford shirt. I stumbled across it in their London shop on sale 5 or so years ago in the dead of summer, and in the subsequent years have appreciated how many things it goes with - sure navy sport coats, but also greys, greens and browns all can work as well.     I bought it because it was beautiful and well constructed, but over time I have come to appreciate how versatile it is, when "cranberry and white stripes" probably wouldn't make many "Top 10 Shirts for Work" lists	episode_done:True

Found a photo book on the Kennedy’s and thought Jackie looked pretty chic on the boat so she talked our friend group into renting a boat for the afternoon. Three of us knew how to sail - she did not. The thing to remember about sailing is it’s dirty (especially rental boats) and boats kill clothes (chafe, catching on sharp bits. We all show up in grubby clothes. She shows up dressed to the nines. We make her go back and change - really unhappy about it. She came back slightly less dressed up. Ok. Spent the rest of the afternoon dodging grunge trying to look elegant on the deck of one of the most beat up Sonars (22 foot day sailor) I’ve ever seen. That said a good time was had by all.

Swap in button up shirts for tees and/or layer under sweaters/sweatshirts, non tailored jacket, overshirt, etc.  2. Swap in trousers for chinos or denim. Knit, sweatshirt, tee, polo, hoody, etc for the top. 3. Button up shirt and trouser. Layer with knit, sweatshirt, non tailored jacket, overshirt, even a hoody. 4. Jacket with denim. Non button up shirt top (knit, sweatshirt, polo, clean solid tee) 5. 4 but with a button up shirt 6. Jacket and odd trouser (odd meaning it's not a suit). Non button up shirt top. 7. Jacket, button up shirt, odd trouser. 8. Suit and non button up shirt top. Could be tied with 7 if the suit is casual enough.	episode_done:True

text:I feel one of the issues is that in this subreddit we have:  1.  A group of people who genuinely want to know why people make large purchases (people just getting into fashion, hearing about spending more to get better quality leather/materials). I was in this group for a while.  2. A group of people who are looking for the absolute cheapest way to get into fashion, they often take pride in getting things for cheap and some even get a sense of superiority for getting the same look without spending as much as "suckers" who buy designer fashion.  3. Hobbyists who have the money to spend on exact items they want.   I genuinely think that one of the issues that causes people to butt heads in this subreddit is when the hobbyists feel they need to justify their purchases when confronted with the question "why?"  Getting the exact item they have searched for is a valid enough reason, and trying to invent other reason to "justify" a purchase often causes confusion for people who are trying to get involved in fashion and are genuinely asking "why is this item worth it?" When I first was looking for new footwear, the number of times I was told that $500 boots were worth it because how long they would last was absurd.	labels:>when the hobbyists feel they need to justify their purchases when confronted with the question "why".

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 15, 2021	labels:A question about cotton/modal blend undershirts:  I used to buy the **Hanes** Comfort Fit Ultra Soft Cotton/Modal undershirts, and they were OK.  A little while ago, I picked up a few **Goodfellow** brand cotton/modal/spandex blend undershirts from Target on a whim, and they were much better than the ones from Hanes. Softer feel, but still thick enough to wear around the house, and longer than the Hanes shirts so they stay tucked in better. My only complaint was that the V-neck wasn't very deep, so it would often show when I left the top button of my shirt unbuttoned. I can't really wear them with casual and camp collar shirts.  Recently I haven't been able to find the Goodfellow modal-blend undershirts at Target (only 100% cotton), but I'm reluctant to go back to the Hanes ones now that I've tasted this luxury.  I've looked at the **David Archy** modal undershirts, because I have some of their boxer briefs and find them very comfortable, but they are a 92% Modal, 8% Spandex blend and the reviews suggest they leave nothing to the imagination.  I'm also looking the **Uniqlo** "Dry" V-neck short-sleeve shirts. However I already have two Uniqlo "Airism" undershirts, and they are so thin they are nearly sheer. I don't really feel comfortable wearing them without another layer.  Are there any other cotton/modal (or similar) blend shirts that you'd recommend? My personal preferences are:  * Ideally less than $10 each * Soft and moisture-wicking fabric, not 100% cotton * V-neck deep enough to leave one button open without the undershirt being visible * Not too thin and revealing  Thanks!	episode_done:True

I know a lot of guides have solidified around the usual classics: harrington, denim, biker, and bomber jackets  but I find myself wearing my light down jacket more often.  They are super light. they fit well and have that same short cut like the others that looks cool. I don't have to worry about piling or shaping as much. they can be very warm too.    and more importantly I find them easier to layer under another coat, while the others fit a bit weirdly.  So light down jackets in fall and spring. then in winter, put them under a wind/water proof coat.  also pairs well with a sweater or fleece vest.	episode_done:True

text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:Honestly, I can tell you are still young (mid-20s) from the nature of the question. It depends on lifestyle much more than age. Plenty of 40 and even 50-somethings wear trendy non-conservative clothing especially in creative or tech industries, while plenty of 20-somethings dress like dads because they have more corporate jobs. But as you get older, you do shift brands a bit. For example, currently, 20-somethings might still desire streetwear brands like Supreme, Vetements, and Yeezys while those older might still be hip but shifted to Fear of God, Balenciaga, CDG or more upscale brands that still have a casual street vibe.

text:Ah right ok, interesting, thanks for that!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:I’m 40, so here is an old’s perspective on this. I do think that certain super-trendy looks which work on a 25-year-old can look silly on an older guy, particularly if he seems uncomfortable. But at least he’s trying! What’s far more common is older guys whose shopping habits don’t change at all between age 25 and 45, and they’re still wearing band t-shirts to most social functions and showing up to weddings in a suit they bought in 2005 when they were 30 pounds lighter. Here, age is negatively impacting their look, not because they’re trying to look too young, but because they’re stuck in the past.  From a younger guy’s perspective, when I was 25 I remember feeling frustrated that my social circle wore nothing but hoodies everywhere, and my lifestyle didn’t really afford me many opportunities to dress up. While I totally agree that dressing well doesn’t mean dressing up, I’ve always liked to dress up. And I was a little annoyed that I couldn’t wear a blazer out to a dive bar without someone making a joke about my yacht club membership. This is an area where as I got older, my lifestyle changed so that I had a lot more opportunities to wear tailoring and other more “adult” clothes, both at work and in my social life. At least until COVID. My 25-year-old self would have enjoyed wearing a lot of the stuff in my 2021 closet (maybe with some tweaks to the fit!), but he would have had nowhere to actually wear it.	episode_done:True
text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:It's totally dependent on the environment you live/work. 5 years ago I was dripping in "minimal streetwear" but now I wear suits every single day.

text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:My perspective is from someone who got interested in wearing sport coats, ties, and “professional” clothing at 17. I just turned 24 and only now do I feel like I have a solid grasp of fundamentals to try new stuff after 8 years of taking clothing seriously.   To me, it all depends on what you want to communicate to others. If you’re only dressing for yourself, you can wear whatever. If you’re more conscious about what others will think too, then there’s an element of “dressing your age” for societal acceptance.   The reason why people shit on 50 year olds wearing hollister is because it’s so apparent that they’re trying so hard to recapture their youth rather than accepting their age and what positives come with it. In the same vein, 17-year-old me wearing ties and sport coats was me trying to shed my youth and move too quickly into professional adulthood. Both have to do with fighting against what we’ve been given rather than working with what we’ve got in a natural way.   The issue may be one of standing out from the crowd being frowned upon, but I think it has more to do with the underlying mentality and reasons why people chose that look.	episode_done:True
text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:Age plays far less of a role than lifestyle.   If "fashion" is done right for the common man it's lockstep with lifestyle providing functionality and a look that's still flattering, interesting and portrays an image the wearer wishes to project.   That's age indiscriminate really.	episode_done:True
text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:I am more into raw denim/Japanese workwear than I am into streetwear or other genres. But what I see in that world is that age has little to do with it. Cohesiveness and fit really rule supreme. In fact, some of the best looks I see pulled off in the raw denim space are among dudes 50+.	episode_done:True

text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:I'm from Japan and a male in those age categories, would likely dress quite differently.  Japan is a land of 'Uniforms'. many spend much of their grade school to high school in a uniform.  when they go out and get a job.. they gotta wear a 'uniform'.. either a suit and tie, or some company uniform.  College is usually the time for experimentation, but because people have such a strong hard-on for fads and trends, they end up being in a uniform again.  maybe in 2017-18 ish. the trend for college age men was a wool chester coat and a hoodie underneath (a mix of very casual and slightly formal).  fast forward 2-3 years later, it nearly completely fell out in favor of oversized fleece jackets, or North Face Nuptse and other similar puffers.. usually in black and yellow.  guys 30s to 40s stop dressing like that  guys 40s and up tend to focus more on brands to flex their income and status, but often wear ill fitting stuff.. as well as strange color stuff (likely went to a Ralph Lauren outlet and could only afford that bright yellow shirt that was on sale because no one would buy it)  People often judge you by what you wear as they think it reflects your occupation or status. For example some one wearing shiny black with a lot of accessories is perceived to be involved in the night industries and probably of lower education or culture.
text:Thanks for your reply. I see what you mean. Here in the UK people in Primary/Secondary school wear Uniforms, and most workplaces, but in College and University they wear anything, back in college and University a few years ago people usually wore jeans and hoodies etc. Sometimes I feel people wear things to reflect the event they are at (e.g. college or a party) instead of how old they are.  And I notice a lot of celebs wear things to make they Unique, and really stand out. Like a bright white hoodie and white trousers. I guess it's probably whilst they perform and they change afterwards? But its interesting as people within their age group wouldn't always wear the style they do.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:Reality time:    If you're good looking and fit at 45 50 etc.. then age doesn't matter.   If you have a "dad bod", balding and just average looking, you will be judged on trying to pull off younger men's looks.

A fat white man with a portable speaker on his chest walked in. He wore a baseball cap that said "JESUS!" and a hoodie that said "THE LORD".  He spoke up. With a confident voice he announced to the cart, "I am not poor or destitute, I have food and shelter, praise Jesus. I do not need and will not ask for your money. I just love to come on the subway and rap for the Lord." At this point I'm thinking "oh this is going to be *amazing*". But I had learned not to make eye contact, so I kept my eyes on my phone and my headphones in my ear. I did turn off the music though.  Indeed, he proceeded to turn on his boombox. A simple beat started playing. The fat white man tapped his foot for a few seconds and, once he got into the rhythm, he began to rap for the Lord. His voice was a bit feeble, but the meter and rhyme scheme of his verses held up. He clearly was experienced, as he came to a natural stopping point just a second shy of the next stop. There, he disembarked and disappeared.  This is probably a more or less regular occurrence for someone who lives there, but I had that warm and fuzzy "omg this is exactly like I always imagined" feeling. It was very hard to avoid looking at him, which I'm sure he would have mistaken as an invitation to talk to me. Everyone around me seemed *entirely* unfazed.

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:If you like the look of vintage clothing, workwear, brands like RRL etc there is really no need to buy from the expensive reproduction brands or the curated vintage fashion stores or IG pages.   There is absolutely loads of that kind of thing for cheap on eBay (probably where those curated vintage stores get most of it from...) and even well regarded brands like Filson, Woolrich, Schott leather etc tons of that available. All it takes is some extra work on your part to actually sift through it, find whats in good condition, worth buying etc and get to grips with the 'keywords' of the clothing items if that makes sense... ('hunting jacket', 'rancher coat', 'A2 flight jacket', 'type 1 trucker' for example) and can also be good searching by fabric type... ('vintage corduroy', 'vintage suede jacket', 'herringbone wool' and so on), these are a good way to narrow down your search.  Some downsides obviously though like not always having proper recourse on things like returns etc like brands and stores will give. But if you put the time in searching, there can be a lot of good bargains to be had and you can get the look of those reproduction brands on a budget.  Not just vintage either though. Especially on things like jeans, if you have already zeroed in on a specific model with favourite fit you know you like, ebay also has a shit load of people selling Levi's, Lee, Carhartt etc brand new old stock, whether they couldnt return a purchase, offloaded from stores closing down, end of season, whatever. Again though, obviously takes searching on your part to see what is genuine and worth buying, but I have managed to get a couple pairs of selvedge Levis and Carhartt jacket way below RRP, as cheap as I would pay from some crappy high street store.	episode_done:True

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:Go through your wardrobe minimum once a year. It helps me to have a 4 tier system.  A - Cothes I like, wear, and fit me well. I have worn them recently and would wear them recently again. These are my go to.  B - Clothes I like but might not fit perfectly but still wear. These are out of rotation but just don't get worn as often. Could also be sort of like a specific situation sweater, these I would hate to lose.  C - clothes I want to sit on to give another chance. If I don't end up wearing it in a season/year/whatever period it will get donated  D - For donate/sell. Don't wear or don't fit. No use in taking up space for something I don't like or may have not held up so well. If you can get money back great but I also say have a time limit. You don't want to hold onto it because it doesn't sell.  I also kind of have a category for gifts/memorable occasion clothing.

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:I guess the only good one I have is when you really love an item buy another one ASAP	episode_done:True
text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:This is probably opposite of most of the advice here, but I advocate for buying *exactly* what you want and not worrying about sales/price etc (assuming it fits your budget). I'd rather a few garments I love than many that are ok/fine.  Edit: NB that this is with the caveat that you have a good understanding of what you like and what works for you. If you're new to the idea of dressing well or with intention, it may be worth holding off on springing for things.

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:My “hack” follows in line with yours.  I always recommend people look into blanks (I like rue porter), because as you grow up you start find yourself gravitating towards more subtle clothes rather than a big Nike check on the chest.     Additionally, I recommend looking for timeless pieces if you’re starting off a closet. Buy things that have stood the test of time, and will look good on anyone regardless of age.  For example: - a denim jacket - a leather jacket - black jeans - a well fitting white shirt   Lastly, a “hack” I have is telling my friends to follow people that have the same body type as them. Some things look great on on body type but you buy it and you won’t understand why ya look like a saran wrap California roll.	episode_done:True

text:Why Did Bottega Veneta Delete Its Social Media Accounts?	labels:I suspect this is a marketing ploy of some description - and it has certainly worked as I have seen this covered in multiple venues. It does start/re-start the conversation about the use and value of social media for brands.   As the owner of a small brand, our results over the last few years have been mixed. We haven’t committed a lot of resources to the various social channels but I’ve found they take up a disproportionate amount of time with frequently unmeasurable results. It’s easy to see these channels as ‘free marketing’ but they are anything but. It’s good to see bigger brands look more carefully at their returns here as the costs of doing things on social media has gone up considerably. And don’t start me on ‘influencers’!
text:Thank you for bringing this small business perspective to it. I only really follow small businesses on my IG. I tried to follow my favorite brands (Acne, YSL, Casablanca, etc) and I had to unfollow. They're just a mess and I never engaged with the posts. Jacquemes is the only brand that has a decent IG and it's basically just his personal account with some shots of their office.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Why Did Bottega Veneta Delete Its Social Media Accounts?	labels:All these thinkpieces serve to do is mystify a transparent marketing strategy dovetailing neatly with the ethos of the brand. As a brand Bottega Veneta is fashion's equivalent of your friends on social media who announce to the world that they're going to be moving in silence from now on  – a brand for those who want to be lowkey, *but not really*.  Social media makes sense for brands like LV for whom the core ethos is in your face flaunting, as Instagram is both chief flex medium and ultimate marketing tool to an aspirational public. Bottega Veneta's courtship is a bit different. If I'm BV I don't even want to be seen as attempting to court that customer, and so the retreat from social media makes sense considering the brand's appeal to aspirational customers who want to be perceived as more sophisticated than those of LV. In reality BV is every bit as accessible before (just type it into the search bar) but it's the *illusion* of withdrawal which is key, both in attracting more aspirational customers and retaining your seasonal clients, for whom discretion – especially in LVMH's major growth market of China – is key.  I don't have any experience in marketing or the luxury sector but what this tells me is that LVMH believes either that a social media presence was a waste of resources or that this'll help cultivate a fake sense of "in the know" among their growth demographic, particularly with COVID exposing the full extent of income inequality's social rot.  Considering influencer fraud, flexing, and the danger of being mixed in with the bland minimal luxury aesthetic running rampant on IG, it makes perfect sense for them to pull back.  &#x200B;  TL;DR: It's just good marketing. The brand will still be very present in all the relevant outlets that actually generate sales.
text:Bottega Veneta is owned by Kering but yeah the same thing still applies to them too.  I noticed that right after Phoebe Philo left Celine and that brand changed the whole look with Hedi Slimane, there was influencers on social media etc calling BV the 'new Celine' and hyping the brand, it was getting pushed on places like GQ and other mags too. Maybe that was an organic shift and the Phoebe Philo Celine fans just wanted a new brand to love after she left but also, it could easily be inside marketing from BV and Kering to take advantage of that space. And I remember Celine never used to have an Instagram page, social media or much of an online presence at all that kept it kind of mysterious, now BV is trying that. More than a coincidence?	labels:Bottega being positioned as the 'new celine' had a lot to do with Daniel Lee taking over at BV who had previously worked under Phoebe at Celine. It was definitely deliberate positioning but the appointment of Daniel Lee meant it had some credibility to it rather being just purely buzzwords.	episode_done:True

I can’t (or haven’t yet at least) worn them outside because I’m too concerned about what other people think and self-conscious (which is ridiculous in the grand scheme of things). I think part of the draw for me is how unbelievably effortless and confident some of these fits are. The impossibly laid back styling that Japanese magazines like popeye, cluel and fudge for some reason really interests me. To me these fits aren’t all exactly what I’d like to replicate, but I think they give me some useful tips in dressing down some coats and jackets which can often come across as too formal.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 13, 2021	labels:I (M) am looking for a leather jacket that will last me many years.   - Budget: $300 US, with about $50 in wiggle room if absolutely necessary. - Color: prefer black, but I'll flex if I love another option. - Fit: slim, but I'm willing to compromise if I genuinely love the jacket.  I'd like to be able to buy from a physical store, so something at a common US chain like Macy's or Men's Warehouse would be fantastic. I live near Dayton, OH, so access to boutique shops isn't stellar.  At this price range, I'm not buying something I wouldn't wear every day for the rest of my life, so being able to try it on is extremely important to me. I would love to go bespoke, but I can't justify that, especially given how much more that would cost.
text:I'd check out Allsaints on sale in that price range. They use a softer leather and it won't last you decades like something vintage or a Schott would, but with your budget they aren't bad. Big step up from what you can typically find at dept stores anywho.	labels:	episode_done:True

For the dadlike ones, you've got to have your entire fit absolutely on point.  If anything else is slacking, the shoes look unintentionally bad and not good at all.	labels:	episode_done:True

Not that that's the only reason, but it is one of them.  >why does a plate of carbonara cost $20 in LA and NY?

text:Better With Age: 10 Things Better Bought Used – Put This On	labels:Can confirm that Brian at Wooden Sleepers is an encyclopedia on vintage. If there's some specific vintage item you've been looking for, definitely send him an email and he'll probably come up with something.  I agree with most things on this list except for vintage knitwear; maybe I just haven't seen a good example, but old sweaters are scratchy + don't really look good beat up + hold smells deeper than things made of cotton. Especially with the premium on nice vintage these days, I'd rather get something new.  Vintage OG fatigues and vintage chamois shirts are incredible though. Both fabrics are so much more comfy when worn-in, and you get to continue telling a story by wearing them doing work / making art / going on hikes / etc.	episode_done:True
text:Better With Age: 10 Things Better Bought Used – Put This On	labels:Hey all, I'm one of the guys Derek mentioned in the article.   I'd say fully half of my closet is used, if not more.  I used to thrift a lot when I was younger but as I've gotten older, I've decided that I'd rather than spend my time, I'll spend money at Grailed, eBay, and consignment stores.  Regarding the latter, San Francisco has two that are well-curated: Goodbyes and Sui Generis.  Just passing this on in case there are any SF Reddit users.	episode_done:True
text:Better With Age: 10 Things Better Bought Used – Put This On	labels:My vintage 80s Levi's denim sherpa is probably my favorite piece in my closet and was only like 40 USD on grailed.  Its nice knowing that it's made in the USA, better quality than new, perfectly faded and comfy for a fraction of the price of new.  Regardless, I feel that we're getting to the point where you're paying the same or more for vintage as compared to new due to the rise of vintage clothing stores and old pieces being trendy. Unless you get lucky at a goodwill or thrift store, but I find most of the stuff I find at actual thrift stores are pretty boring or not even all that old (lots of fast fashion crap at thrift stores now).	episode_done:True

Until fairly recently (the last 2-3) years, I didn't thrift or shop vintage much...aside from hitting up a surplus store on occasion. I also found myself wanting to break my own clothes in, for authenticity, but I'm loosening a bit on that.  My favourite second hand pieces are a pair of corduroys from Orvis, a vintage The Gap shetland sweater made in Scotland from the 80's and a nicely patina'd pair of paraboot chambord shoes. Oh and a deadstock French m47 field jacket. Actually might try a fit with all those...

I cannot overstate how taxing it was to not see the scale budge downward for so long and always seemingly ticking up. a suit I had bought a year prior to fit comfortably after I gained weight was starting to not fit, real "ah shit here we go again" moment. at the start of the pandemic though, i lost 14 lbs in like two months and was ecstatic. i ticked another 10 or so lbs downward before I plateaued and you know, I was happy about it because I never felt hungry and I had a consistent lifestyle and it was good that I could live like that and not gain or lose weight at all. Then, I came down with food poisoning in december and barely ate for like a week and lost another 10 lbs (hardly healthy but in 2020 i'll take the good with the bad). Even after getting better and feeling good again I have kept that weight off and now weigh under 200 lbs for the first time in years. I'm ecstatic for more progress in 2021 and hopefully finally being confident enough to buy the dope clothes I want and not worrying that I look bad in them.  It's so interesting what relativity does to you. I'm 198 lbs rn, but I was last that weight when I was a senior heading off to college and felt awful about it. Now, I feel fucking great and way more confident than I was before. Funny things. The mission is 170 lbs but I'll be happy to be between that and 180. Sorry for the paragraphs but I know this forum more than almost anywhere will understand struggles like this, especially for guys.

Now, I feel fucking great and way more confident than I was before. Funny things.   I've been losing weight for the last year; weight I've carried with me for far too long now.  When I have started to plateau (normally because I'm eating too many calories or not exercising enough), I weigh myself and tell myself that I will either be really happy or really sad to see myself at my present weight again, and it's my choice to decide which it will be.	labels:	episode_done:True

After years of cobbling together formal/business attire at the last minute (which doesn't look great), I want to have a go-to suit I can rely on.  I'm thinking dark gray or charcoal since I don't have a black suit for funerals. I've been looking at Suitsupply and Spier & Mackay. Neither have a storefront in my town, but I could drive 1.5 hours to get to a Suitsupply store though I'd rather not. I'd heard some good things about the J Crew Factory Thompson, as well, but I wonder if that's still a good deal.  Does anyone have recommendations for specific suits, rather than just a retailer? I have an uncommon body type. I'm 6'3 and 168 pounds. Most of that length is in my limbs. I usually look for medium tall shirts to fit my chest and sleeves.  Chest: 37"  Sleeve: 35.5"   I found different advice for measuring sleeve length. I used this method:  >ARM LENGTH: Bend your elbow 90 degrees and place your hand on your hip. Hold the tape at the center back of your neck. With a friend's help, measure across your shoulder to your elbow, and down to your wrist. The total length in inches is your sleeve length.  Thanks in advance

It's time consuming to set up and get a good picture because the preview is tiny and there's no e.g. WiFi sharing so my alternative setup is a phone mount for the same tripod. Recently discovered I can get a live preview from my phone on my laptop so I've been using that to browse the pictures and check I've framed everything correctly etc.  I use the lightroom mobile app to crop and edit the photos. Basically every photo is cropped because I have to stand quite far back from the camera to get everything in without distortion.

text:I think a non zip hoodie is a universally better option.

Stick to simple cotton if you really prefer a zip up over a pull over.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:London street style Inspo (circa 1985-1990s)	labels:As everyone is saying, this could be today. I was especially struck by the girl in the carhart vest.  Even more so because the clarity of the photos sets it apart (visually) from earlier vintage looks. If it weren’t for peripheral details like the cars, cigarette boxes, amount of garbage on the street, etc. I wouldn’t be convinced this was 30 years old.  Kind of interesting to compare with some of the outfits and haircuts in the backgrounds, which seem more typical for the era.

I was very much surprised when going through the photos today because of how good the fits are considering they're mostly from the mid 80s. These looked like styles from the streets of Tokyo & Seoul but they turned out to from the UK instead. I know in terms of fashion many countries draw inspiration from each other but I never expected the folks in London to be so in command and stylish from such an early period!      Another pleasant surprise was how similar these fits look to the current trend of streetwear, high fashion / avantgarde style in the recent 2-3 years. If I had no clue of the year these photos were taken from, I wouldn't have a problem believing that they were from recent years.

text:I’m not a tailor but I think there’s a way around it. Maybe it would cost to much to tailor but I think it could be done on jeans for example. kinda like how a tailor would cut jeans to be tighter but then instead of sewing it shut just put elastic behind it to pull it shut but when it opens just the denim shows... again idk what I’m really talking about but I feel like it could be fast ke to make pants go from like a 28 to maybe a 31/32	labels:	episode_done:True

Now I see the word 'sustainable' tossed everywhere, Instagram, TikTok, in higher volume, the marketing has changed but the culture hasn't.

There's also the question of quality. A 500€ leather jacket may be usable for 20 years, while a 100€ one will deteriorate after 2.   The reality is though, people on this sub rarely pay full price for their items. Many buy during store discounts or second hand. Buying second hand is a great way to get quality clothing for little money! Find some brands that you like and then go look for them used.

text:Guidance organizing a suit for my fiancé for his father's funeral during lockdown	labels:In this case, you're not going to be able to find an exact match for the jacket fabric to turn it into a suit, so we're looking at a somber odd jacket w/trousers look.  To keep things somber, a dark, muted, monochrome palette would be my choice. I'd recommend a white shirt, dark matte grey tie with minimal pattern (could be a grey Glen check if you can find that).   For trousers, I'd avoid navy since it doesn't work that well as an odd trouser colour. Go with a pair of grey trousers a shade or two distinctly darker or lighter. Try a pair of charcoal or mid-grey wool flannel trousers, and pair that with black shoes. He'll get a ton of use out of those trousers in the future since they'll go with almost any kind of jacket as a blank slate. The jacket should be ok — any shininess will contrast with the flannel trousers, but that's actually what you're looking for with an odd jacket/trouser combo.   I applaud you for thinking and planning in advance for him; you seem like a great fiancée.

text:Guidance organizing a suit for my fiancé for his father's funeral during lockdown	labels:So one thing to keep in mind is that, when your father passes away, most people aren't paying attention to what you wear. Many communities don't even expect a suit -- they just expect you not to wear anything too loud or disrespectful. But assuming he still wants a tailored jacket and pants.  6'5" is rather tall. I tend to say that height is not a clothing measurement, and it's not -- he might still find something off the rack... buuuuut it may be a lot of effort, especially if you can't get an arm measurement without a lot of effort. And I suppose it's not worthwhile to have him measured for a Made to Measure suit. So sure, just keep the gray jacket you have.  A gray jacket is... kind of easy and hard to pair at the same time. On one hand, it's neutral. On the other hand, you don't want to pair charcoal with black because it's usually low contrast; you don't want to pair it with other darkish grays, and you can't pair it with light grays for a funeral. You can't pair it with bright colors for a funeral. So you need navy blue trousers. That's the conservative, classic choice here... and it's fine.  100% wool is fine. Don't worry about an obvious mismatch -- you *want* an obvious mismatch, you don't want anybody to think he was trying to wear a suit but couldn't figure out how to match properly, you want people to look at him and know he is wearing separates on purpose.  A white shirt is your safest bet. A light blue shirt should usually also work, but might be a little more interesting than you want for a funeral. Get something sized by neck + arm measurements. Try Charles Tyrwhitt, they have a good variety of fits and do easy returns abroad. Charles Tyrwhitt shirts are 3/$100, don't pay a penny more.  A tie is probably still not necessary for a funeral, but if you want one anyway... well, what's your budget? There are brands that will sell you great extra-long ties.  Oh, and use a lint roller or garment brush to clean that jacket.	episode_done:True

A 10 year old budget suit from high school is the opposite of high quality.  Do you live near a Suit Supply? They are a Dutch company so will probably have high quality clothes that fit him. I'd suggest getting an entire outfit from there. They have EXCELLENT customer service and will handhold him through the process in as pain free a way as possible.
text:The problem is that we are in full lockdown (and will be at least through January). Also I want him to get a good-quality and well-fitting suit for our wedding.

We are in Europe/	labels:I'd say when the time comes, suitsupply would be a good place to get a new suit for the wedding. Their best value is their suits, but if he needs anything else, you might as well pick it up from there. The staff know what they're doing for the most part and will be able to pair things well, rather than having to combine things from other places. Since your fiancé isn't a fan of shopping, it'll be easier to get everything from one place.   Feel free to ask again about the wedding once that gets closer!

The challenge in this case comes from being limited to a sober palette.

I have researched this shoe and even watch certain reviews for it that I conclude that I want to buy it.  However in my case getting this variant of this shoe and to my proper size has been quite a challenge for me. It's availability is quite rare in my Country (SEA) and all the shoes that I have found are either fake knockoffs and well soldout ads for other shoe websites.  Recently within my dedication to get this shoe, I thought of just buying the "Basic" Variant of the Cortez, and dissapointment follows as I picked the wrong size for my shoe (in my haste to buy the shoe) I measured my foot and it is exactly 26cm and and alongside with the confusion for the knowledge of the older shoe that I bought which is US 12 and EU 44 "World Balance Freeman" it confused me and well....... I bought a Large Shoe 😂 (specifically I bought the size 12 Basic Cortez). Although I placed an exchange size for an US 11, I might be in a pickle since it will still be big for me lol.  Now anyways to finally ask my question, If by somehow the exchange US 11 were still too big for me, Can I wear a WOMANS "Nike Cortez Leather" instead???? For that I will also need advice for the sizing and basically an expert knowledge in this situation. In my case all that is available for this shoe are for Womans Shoe, and within my research I read that Nike Shoes are Unisexual (but for now I need an Experts Advice on this matter) really in a pickle, so pls help ma dudes.	episode_done:True

text:Gorpcore: How Arc’teryx Parkas and Salomon Hiking Boots Became High Fashion	labels:This style has been popular since I can remember in high school (I’m 31 now and grew up East Coast close to DC). If you had a North Face or Helly Hansen jacket back then, you were cool (and also had money). It was kinda funny seeing kids rock their NF Steep Tech jackets to class when we don’t get THAT much snow here. My wardrobe now mostly consists of Patagonia, LL Bean, and North Face. I love the retro designs from the 90s that are coming back.   I have to say, Patagonia is by far my favorite brand. Quality pieces that both look good and are practical that last for years. It’s an expensive brand but worth every penny IMO.	episode_done:True

text:1 Year - A Kmn6784 2020 Wardrobe Album	labels:I love this. I am currently working on overhauling my entire wardrobe because of two reasons:  1) I outgrew almost every single shirt and sweater that I own because I started going to the gym 2 years ago and I don't fit a medium top anymore.  2) I used to only shop at sort of street style or skate style shops and that is just not the kind of look that I want anymore (plus those clothes don't fit anymore anyways)  Your wardrobe looks so great! I feel like you've got everything for any occasion, and I agree that it looks like you can just shop for whatever you **want**, rather than what you **need**.  I really like the Greats shoes that you've got. I never heard of that brand but I was actually looking for shoes just like those. I have a pair of vans and a pair of blundstone chelsea's, but I really wanted something in between; something that says: "I am here casually, but I care about what I'm wearing". I may get myself a pair of Greats!  Also, I noticed a lot of stuff from J. Crew. I have bought from them once, a Kashmir sweater, and it was actually kind of itchy so I almost never wear it. Should I give them another chance? It seems like it's one of your go-to places.
text:Greats are fantastic, They're a bulkier silhouette than Common Projects but no one would look at them and think "chunky".   J Crew started as one of my favorites because of their absurd sales and inoffensive basics, I don't have any issues with the quality of the items and like all my pieces from there. One specific item to highlight though, their linen shirts are crazy good for the price, easily my favorite cheap linen.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 06, 2021	labels:Slippers for wide, sweaty feet?  I've been rocking a set of Glerups scuffs around the house for two years, and especially heavily since March. My wife has been non-stop complaining about tiny bits of felt that wear away from the inside, ending up all over the house... and now I've worn a small hole through near my pinky toe on my wider foot, so it's time to give them up. I'm tempted to just get another pair and deal with my wife's complaints about errant felt bits, but despite their excellent moisture management, I'm still a bit sweaty in them after a while. So, I'm on the hunt for a new pair.  I live in Florida so it's rarely ever cold indoors, the tile flooring notwithstanding. And I have very wide feet (9EEE/EEEE.) I like scuffs because I can just step into them without using my hands, but I'm open to alternatives. I've always wanted to be able to rock leather mocs, but going by even my comfiest leather shoes, I'll get far too sweaty, far too quickly, unless I'm wearing good socks... which defeats the purpose.  Any suggestions? I was thinking a set of boiled wool instead of wool felt might work better. I do have some boiled wool Haflinger slippers and I like them overall, though their construction leaves much to be desired for the price - the badly-designed seams are barely holding together, the glue is starting to separate, and the PVA footbed is prone to both sweating and stinking.	episode_done:True

text:> "why do some fits get praised when they clearly go against the sidebar"  I think this one could be enlightening to a lot of the people who don't understand how avant garde (or even just mildly experimental) inspo posts get so much praise by breaking traditional style conventions. It might help some bridge the knowledge base gap (i.e. you have to know the rules before you can break them) and help explain the (perceived) cognitive dissonance of traditional tailoring *and* designer fashion both being acceptable styles. I think that would help make it seem less jarring to those new readers who get confused when they come to this sub expecting to find answers for "how do I dress so that I look good," but they find a lot more of "how do I dress to express myself?"  For the record I think the second question is a lot more interesting and certainly the reason I'm here, and there's plenty of resources here that answer the first question (*if only people would look for them*), but I do value that this sub does an excellent job of tackling both. More discussion might be beneficial to newcomers to the world of intentional dressing, is all I'm saying, and the ones who are asking questions in-good-faith I think deserve to understand the rationale behind why someone might choose to wear Kapital instead of a suit.  One last edit: Not that I'm saying anyone owes anyone else any explanation for why they dress the way they do, but I think it's always interesting to learn the context.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Best White T-Shirts for Men 2021 - Wirecutter	labels:I am currently wearing a Lady White Co white t shirt, I love the fit and material.. but I dyed it brown lmao.  These are great t shirts, except something about them is just impossible to keep white. Maybe they havent been bleached as much ,or for some reason the fibers absorb more color, but it has been a real pain since day one. I don't really understand it  After the first wash left these weird extra white blotchy patches, which only showed up in direct sunlight. After many washes, these seemed to have gone away, though I'm not sure if the overall color has changed.  These shirts are constantly getting discolored by the wash (admittedly high in iron), and picks up all sorts of residue from the drying rack, or normal wear. Compared to every other white garment I've had, they are just super finicky. Like, its not ever been an issue with my other shirts, but these are always finding new stains to show off. One might say that I'm more critical of a $50 shirt than a $10 one, but I feel like this is an objective observation.  Ultimately, I'm much happier having dyed them to other colors. I prefer clothes which look better with age, so I tend to avoid white generally, but these are extra frustrating given the price and the hype. It dosnt matter to me how great the construction or fit is if they are a pain to keep clean.  The article says they are "offwhite", maybe this has changed? I feel like mine were very white to begin with.  It makes me wonder if something is different about the bleach or dyeing method compared to other brands	episode_done:True

text:[Inspo & Commentary] Rings	labels:A quick note about colored gold: you state that it is a different alloy composition which gives rose gold its pink hue, which is true. But there is no alloy composition for gold which gives it a truly white color. It is a Rhodium electroplating that gives white gold its brilliant platinum-like (as Rhodium is a platinum-group metal) whiteness, and white gold jewelry will absolutely require periodic re-dipping in Rhodium to maintain that color. Exactly how frequent is up to your body chemistry and wear pattern.	episode_done:True

text:[Inspo & Commentary] Rings	labels:Super interesting read. Appreciate the effort. Have saved links to anything that sounds up my alley and will be scoping them all out eventually. Can't have too much to choose from or too much inspiration.  The details about materials are cool too. I can't remember the name right now, but there was a company here in Aus that I was looking through and loving a bunch of years ago. They were aimed at men and produced rings in alt materials you don't normally see in mainstream jewelry. It was interesting cause the materials were the kinda stuff us dudes specifically might find intriguing. Alt metals like titanium where they burned in colour highlights like you see on high end aftermarket exhausts. And other stuff that's tough, totally overkill in terms of the strength of jewelry, normally used to create components etc. But they were interesting in that they had these industrial finishes, very matte and other non-metallic colours so they cut them in ways that could be geometric and have a totally different vibe etc.  I'll try track down who they were.	episode_done:True

text:If anyone is looking for minimalistic and smaller jewelry here's a couple recommendations  www.miansai.com - Simple and clean designs with a few designs having some flare. Small and purposely subtle rings, bracelets and necklaces. Most items are between 100-200 dollars.   www.alicemadethis.com - Precision jewelery. Very minimalistic but precise lines and polishes. Can be as subtle as Miansai but have various sizes to make items stand out more in terms of size. Items are expensive with most being 200-400 dollars.	labels:	episode_done:True

His is practical wearable everyday jewelry, mine is all over the top extravagant absurd cocktail jewelry.  * "Are you stealing this format from /u/cdot5 and u/mcqueenofthehill?" Yes.  * "Why is this on a sub for men's fashion advice?" This album is inspiration, not advice. I'm not suggesting anyone wear this if they don't want to. This stuff isn't for everyday wear or even traditional men's cocktail attire. But if your style is out there you can make it work on occasion. I plan to get a couple of these eventually (if the artists ever reply to me).  * "It looks ridiculous/like a costume. No one will take you seriously." The necklaces in particular are **really** out there. But I wouldn't wear any of this to work or anywhere I need to be taken seriously. But if I'm going to a party or a play and I want to dress up, something like these pieces would be fun.   * "But this is women's clothing!" Yes. I wear womenswear. I combine it with menswear. You don't have to if you don't want to.  * "This may be cool on the runway, but nobody would leave the house like this!" I would.  * "Who makes these?" Orr, Cheryl Eve Acosta, Sara Barbanti, Wendy Yue, Leyla Abdollahi are the ones who have functioning web stores and/or stockists.   * "Is this a comprehensive compilation?" No. But this kind of stuff is really hard to find.

text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:In this hypothetical I'd go with haute couture. In your friend's situation I'd keep looking until I found a designer I liked. Bespoke would be my last option for a couple of reasons. Your friend wants contemporary fashion, but most bespoke tailors make traditional clothes for a typically older crowd (you're in NYC though so there are some bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd; make sure you look for them specifically). The bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd don't have designs as good as high end ready to wear IMO. Tailoring and designing are different skills, and there's a reason Louis Vuittion, YSL, Dior, Gucci, etc pay their head designers millions per year. Of course some $4000 coats are worth more than others, so it would be good to know a bit about general quality.  Personally, I prioritize design over fit. I can deal with a less than perfect fit if I love the design of a piece. But I won't wear a piece if I don't love the design, even if it fits well.   The middle ground option is made to measure, or MTM. MTM for outerwear isn't as common for suiting, but it's out there.

text:These are all valid points and I appreciate your perspective on this. I totally value the integrity of top designers of HC labels as well. There are some incredible designs from YSL and Gucci that I would splurge on, even if the fit wasn't 100% what I wanted it to be.  The reality is though, that there are several body structures and only 1 final product, which doesn't capture all of those body builds, and that's the struggle with HC.  I genuinely think it's only a matter of time before traditional bespoke tailors move into goods that are more commonplace - t-shirts, sweaters, etc. - and most of these designers are quite good at their respective crafts.  I've interviewed many of these emerging designers/tailors myself, specifically Mike Paul, who is based in Toronto. He is moving into bespoke tailoring across multiple verticals. His story is pretty cool too. If anyone wants to hear it, DM me and I'll throw the link to the pod episode.  There's also another designer in Toronto that does bespoke jeans.  So, there are definitely designers who have identified the need in the market.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Well, but bespoke tailors can do anything. They all have a house style, and maybe the Haute Couture brands do something a given house won't replicate, but unless theres' something really unique happening, you'll probably be able to find *some* house that can make you at least as happy. Probably.  The real issue with Bespoke is just the amount of time it takes.	labels:In theory, but I suspect that the number of bespoke tailors who are 1) willing to do fashion-forward contemporary designs, 2) able to understand the 'source code' and styling of those designs well enough to capture the details of what makes a particular piece special, and 3) able to procure the exact materials needed to do so is likely vanishingly small in practice.  I've seen examples on fashion fora of people asking bespoke tailors -- even talented ones -- to replicate designer stuff, and the results are usually a poor approximation.	episode_done:True
text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:I think /u/Ghoticptox pretty much summed it up perfectly, nothing to really add. I personally have no interest in bespoke because I value design more than minuscule fit details, I think this sub has a tendency to overemphasize how important fit actually is, especially considering how nebulous of a concept “good fit” even is.  Like, the fit “issues” you highlighted,   >shoulder tiny bit broad in one coat, a little extra material in the waist of another.  Are complete non issues to me, that’s just variance in fit and design, I wouldn’t blink at that on a piece I otherwise really love.  The more important thing to me, and I can’t believe no one else has mentioned this yet, your friend got into clothing a couple months ago, he doesn’t even know what he likes, it sounds like, and I mean this judgement free, he’s just going around looking for the most expensive thing he can find, I don’t think we’d recommend anyone go and buy a $4000 coat right as they’re getting into fashion. Like, is he rich enough that he can afford to make that work or rich enough that it literally doesn’t matter? Because I think unless $4000 is something you can spend in a day and not blink itms probably not a good idea to go and drop $4000 and a true bespoke coat when he could end up getting into streetwear in 3 months and never wear it again. At least in that case something like YSL will retain value better and can be sold for more, as opposed to a lot of traditional tailoring brands, which go for pennies on the dollar on the used market	episode_done:True

So if you show them a YSL/SLP or Dior coat, they should be able to make it for you. Some won't do that on principle. Some won't even copy a garment you own that's damaged or too small. It's also impossible for it to look the same because it'll be a different pattern. If what you want is an exact copy of something, you're better off buying the thing and tailoring it	episode_done:True
text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:Split the difference. Some top houses have a very discreet bespoke line that blends bespoke fit with the adventure of couture, only for those in the know. Hermes *sur mesure* and Berluti in particular. There are also particularly progressive bespoke tailors that push the envelope in design, materials and construction at the top end: Davide Taub at Gieves and Hawkes; Michael Browne; Cifonelli.	episode_done:True
text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:He could by a ready made coat and take it to a tailor and have it altered to  fit him better.

text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:Here's a different point of view... I'd take a serious look at two categories beyond the bespoke / haute couture options.  First, my preference is for the Italian tailoring houses. Kiton, Zegna, Loro Piana, and Etro Milano etc.  First, they are more male / menswear oriented. And their materials and tailoring are exceptional and can be altered or mtm if needed. I have a Loro Piana Icer in cashmere that's beyond mere mortals. Of course, $4,000 won't get you very far - - but the quality is a level beyond the French design houses.   Second, depending on his design taste (and if I was younger) I'd consider the younger brands like CP Co, Rick Owens, Acne Studios, etc to see if they are more in tune with my desired look.	episode_done:True

I wear old navy straight fit 33/30 right now and they kinda cut into my stomach when I sit down.  I need to wear diapers some days which kinda messes with the fit some days making the jeans not go as high on the waist as I would like.A woman friend suggested high waisted jeans but I can’t think of a time I’ve seen a guy in those before.  Also a little worried about buying things without trying them on but that is what I will be doing because if Covid.  USA. Not wanting to spend more than 40-50 on a pair. Belks, AE, Walmart, and old navy are what’s nearby.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 03, 2021	labels:Are there any brands that specialise in (or are really good at making) lyocell/plant fibre button ups and tshirts? Under $100 preferably but I don't know what the price range is in the first place so I can't really pick a price.	episode_done:True
text:Recent Purchases - January 03, 2021	labels:Prada - Men’s Nylon Crossbody Bag. Quality is good however, it seems Prada have started outsourcing to China. Pretty p***** off how they have the balls to charge made in Italy prices for something most likely made in a Chinese sweatshop.  Cole Buxton T-Shirt - Simple staple for the wardrobe, quality is impressive. Cotton has a heavyweight feel.   Roger & Gallet L’Homme Menthe - Recently smelt this as a sample with an order from a beauty website. A nice clean masculine scent. A nice stand in aftershave for everyday use. Comes in 100ml and is relatively cheap  Arte Antwerp - Purchased a scarf from this company, we made piece, nice and thick perfect for walks in Jan & Feb	episode_done:True
text:Recent Purchases - January 03, 2021	labels:Finally picked up a pair of Dr Martens for $25 bucks from Nordstrom Rack. No tag, they had to go in the back and figure out the price, whoever re-tagged it clearly screwed up. Oh well works for me.	episode_done:True
text:Recent Purchases - January 03, 2021	labels:Not a huge purchase, but had the $15 credit at Nordstrom to burn from Black Friday and I got a pair of Bombas socks. It looks like a fun pattern and I've heard good things about the socks, so I'm pumped. I just can't get past the fact it was $15 for a pair.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 03, 2021	labels:Done a lot of thinking about my wardrobe and the amount of clothes I own and I think I’m gonna go through and pick a bunch of clothes to donate tonight.   I think it’s time I let the thrifting and g r a p h i c t e e life go for a bit. I own way too many band shirts and shit that I just don’t wear anymore. I need to suck it up and start investing in my wardrobe to get it to a place I want it to be instead of buying a ton of shitty bandaids for 8 bucks a pop at thrift stores. Time to be a big boy and learn to go for a few expensive pieces instead of a ton of cheap ones.   Wish me luck lads.
text:Good luck puma!  I'm at the same point with my wardrobe. I have all the basics covered and want to buy more cool shit, but cool shit is expensive. So I settle for shit that isn't as cool but still serves it's purpose, i.e. I have clark's wallabees instead of paraboots, uniqlo raws, and a lands end barn coat instead of a barbour. Of course I could just save up money to get the nicer shit that I really want, but that would mean copping less shit altogether which I was unwilling to do. Now I put myself on a jawn freeze to save up some money and practice some self control and patience.	labels:We’re in this together baybeeeeeeee	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 03, 2021	labels:I feel like the folks in my neighborhood have, on average, started dressing much better over the past month.

Textured sweaters, wide pants, bold color choices... it's all been happening. Anybody else been seeing this?

What kind of sartorial paradise do you have to live in to see wide pants in the wild?	labels:I'm in the Boston area. It used to be just college kids in nice fits, but I've started seeing people in their 20s, 30s in cool gear. There was even an older man I saw a couple weeks ago in a guernsey and big cords... iconic  Don't get me wrong though, vast majority of people over age 25 are in various forms of bizcaz purgatory or mall stasis.

text:I started doing around the beginning of the pandemic. There are several vintage/thrift shops near me, and for like two years they were my go-to for outerwear and the occasional shirts and pants. But it's so easy to start picking things up just because they're cheaper, and not be happy with them just a couple months down the line...  I've got maybe three or four real gems that I still wear from vintage hunting, but everything else has been donated or sold. I'm much happier with my wardrobe now, especially since I started to invest in nicer stuff. I'm wishing you all the best through that transition!	labels:I have gotten a ton of cool shit from thrifting but it really is so easy to grab something for grabbing something’s sake. Especially going to the cheaper places in NYC like L train. Soon you’re taking back like 2 or 3 pieces a visit, that shit adds up quick.    Thank you!!!
text:Definitely. For me, I went to some of the shops enough that I'd chat with the owners when I stopped in. For sure I value the idea of supporting local businesses + building relationships with people who are hustling hard, but it also made it much harder to leave without picking something up haha	labels:Oh that’s what I do 100%. I’m friends with like 3 of the vintage boutiques’ owners and employees around me lol	episode_done:True
text:[Inspiration] Jewelry	labels:I wish there are more inspo for gold and rose gold jewelry ,too. As someone who recently into jewelry and did a lot of research, silver tone doesn't work with everyone. Depend on your skin tone, you can look very wash out and sick-ish with silvertone, especially with shiny silver. I have lighter skintone and silver just doesn't look good on me. Rose gold however stand out.	episode_done:True

text:[Inspiration] Jewelry	labels:Cool stuff. Looking at this got me wondering.  Every outfit there is definitely on the casual side. I’m always curious to see how it would look with business casual and business formal wear, without being over the top.  Working on Wall Street, the only jewelry I’ve seen are cuff links, watches, rings, and occasionally wrist beads or bracelets. There was one stylish black man who would wear diamond studs with suits but that’s about it.  Curious if anyone has examples of subtle jewelry with suits and business casual outfits.
text:During the height of #menswear people were copying many of the Italians and wearing multiple beaded and/or leather bracelets which are a bit more lowkey since they don’t shine like metal. A single signet ring on the pinky probably wouldn’t draw that much attention given the old-school tradition of it. And if you’ll allow me to plug myself a little bit, some of my waywt posts have me wearing some rings and bracelets even with my tailoring, though it may not be super visible. Metal jewellery primarily has the intent of being seen though, so you will be making a statement by combining it with tailoring.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:[Inspiration] Jewelry	labels:I've been thinking about jewelry for a while. I got a nose ring and like it, a simple chain would be nice and a bracelet. Any recommendations for these from anyone??  I don't dress edgy enough to wear a lot of the rings/other jewelry in this inspo album

text:[Inspiration] Jewelry	labels:Nice album OP. I've been into jewelry for some time. I've always liked bracelets and such, but lately I've been into rings. Just wish I had the guts (and budget) to start wearing them. It's one of these things that I like seeing others wear but I feel that wouldn't be able to pull of.  I might start to wear bracelets again and go from there.
text:I've been slowly building a collection of jewelry (mostly rings) and I think the trick is to have a couple of things minimum at all times. Wearing just one ring or bracelet alone feels a bit off to me, and I found that people challenged me less when I wore a couple of items as opposed to one.   At least, they stopped asking me if I was getting married any time soon.	labels:I think singular items can look off because people expect a wedding band or something with a single ring. Or it can kind of look like "i want to wear jewelery but I'm not sure if it's working for me". Its definitely better to wear multiple items and just go for it. Fortunately etsy can provide a relatively low cost of entry of one is curious but not sure	episode_done:True

text:Honestly the pandemic is a pretty cool opportunity to switch up your style/wear things you usually wouldn't in the comfort of your home (assuming you're not leaving the house much) by the time you start leaving your house more hypothetically you'll feel much more comfortable wearing things like jewelery because you've actually been wearing it for weeks	labels:Agreed, but my coworkers are in for a shock when they see me over a year later having completely flipped my style and looking like some sort of Harry Styles / Ramones hybrid with zero context.
