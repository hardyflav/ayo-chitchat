I seriously loved polyvore... it was such a fun way to see not only outfits that I could ostensibly purchase and put together in real life, but fantasy outfits as well... man.

text:What work for my boyfriends taste and body type?	labels:I have found the best way to hide my dad-bod tummy features that I’m self conscious of is through layering. This is very weather specific, but one of my go to options is a t-shirt, an open flannel, then a denim jacket. You can smarten it up with a nicer shirt buttoned up.   Another strategy I really like when I’m trying new things that I’m not quite comfortable with is to wear it out for an hour or so (like go get coffee, walk in a park, or something like that where you aren’t too social but still in public) then go home and put on clothes more in my comfort zone. I have found this slowly builds my confidence bit by bit and allows my to trial run things for what works and what doesn’t.   Playing into the braid shoulders might be a good idea as well. That’s something typically masculine that looks good. Trying suspenders instead of a belt (or just not tightening the belt too much, so as not to accentuate the belly again) is a good option. Where long sleeves either rolled or pushed up can make upper arms look bigger too. I like a Henley style shirt this way as the cut is very masculine there.  Find pictures, have them on your phone while shopping to try to find inexpensive alternatives.
text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession). I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession 🤣

text:What are your predictions for 2021 suit style?	labels:Working within a multi brand store, a lot of what the buying team is seeing is relaxed fits, patch pockets and a pretty standard over arching lapel size (let’s say 2in), but it still keeping towards formal regimented shoulders (with very subtle roping) and small amounts of taper to the trouser and waist. Almost half of the suits  reviewed having pleats, but less function and more to bring an elongated look when sans jackets. Lots of hopsack open weaves giving a more draped look. I’m saying all this at least in our market, when people are looking for suits it’s become clear people want far less patterns, and moving towards subtle pinheads and puppy’s tooth, or even tone on tone 5mm window pane. In darker colours even coming into summer. COVID has pushed suits in our market back towards the cleaner look, with textured shirts and a little more fun with ties. Saying all this though it’s super dependent on where you are in the world and where you associate yourself in the corresponding circles.  So tldr: shrug*

text:Why Did Bottega Veneta Delete Its Social Media Accounts?	labels:All these thinkpieces serve to do is mystify a transparent marketing strategy dovetailing neatly with the ethos of the brand. As a brand Bottega Veneta is fashion's equivalent of your friends on social media who announce to the world that they're going to be moving in silence from now on  – a brand for those who want to be lowkey, *but not really*.  Social media makes sense for brands like LV for whom the core ethos is in your face flaunting, as Instagram is both chief flex medium and ultimate marketing tool to an aspirational public. Bottega Veneta's courtship is a bit different. If I'm BV I don't even want to be seen as attempting to court that customer, and so the retreat from social media makes sense considering the brand's appeal to aspirational customers who want to be perceived as more sophisticated than those of LV. In reality BV is every bit as accessible before (just type it into the search bar) but it's the *illusion* of withdrawal which is key, both in attracting more aspirational customers and retaining your seasonal clients, for whom discretion – especially in LVMH's major growth market of China – is key.  I don't have any experience in marketing or the luxury sector but what this tells me is that LVMH believes either that a social media presence was a waste of resources or that this'll help cultivate a fake sense of "in the know" among their growth demographic, particularly with COVID exposing the full extent of income inequality's social rot.  Considering influencer fraud, flexing, and the danger of being mixed in with the bland minimal luxury aesthetic running rampant on IG, it makes perfect sense for them to pull back.  &#x200B;  TL;DR: It's just good marketing. The brand will still be very present in all the relevant outlets that actually generate sales.
text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:It’s less about the value of the item and more about the stars aligning perfectly.  I wear a size 12-13W shoe, plus other things that make my feet really hard to fit, so I am used to buying formalwear to match the one maybe two pairs of formal shoes I own at any given time.  So when I was 17 and going to prom in 2006, my mom tried really hard to help me find shoes, any shoes, that were suitable. But we could only find casual flats or runners, and I realllly wanted to dress up nicely for the first real time in my life. So she said “you know what, let’s buy a dress and then we will just have to find a way.”  So I picked out a black and pale pink dress that just made me swoon, and I figured black heels would be easiest to find. Lol I was so young and stupid.  Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn’t find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I’d just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 15, 2021	labels:# How acceptable are tailored shorts really as you get older?  I am reconsidering my outfits for my planned summer vacation in Italy.  I had planned for the daytime white, light blue and light pink slim-fit polo shirts, paired with light blue, pale red, and pale yellow tailored shorts. Boat shoes and Espadrilles for footwear. Basically my tried-and-true combos for hot weather vacays.  But as I reach the tail-end of my late 30s, **I wonder if shorts are appropriate at all anymore**. I always strive to look extremely put together, rarely wear anything without a collar, no denim, etc.  Shall I just wear my night-time outfits (pants and long-sleeve button-down shirts, both in linen or linen-cotton mix, in white and light pastel colors) during the day also?  Looking forward to feedback mainly from well-off guys my age or older.
text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:Don’t forget to check out thrift stores. This is where I stock up on cashmere sweaters for a few dollars a piece, wool skirts, kilts, sweaters, vests, and cardigans, and amazing wool blazers and coats. I’ve found mint condition mohair and camel hair 3/4 coats for as low as $10, black cashmere sweaters for $2-3 and up, and cable knit pullovers for as low as $4. It’s amazing what people get rid of, not realizing how expensive it all is new. I also loooove wool in the fall and winter, and so this has been a super affordable way to build a dream cold-weather wardrobe.   The only thing wool I buy new are socks for the most part, everything else I’ve found at estate sales, garage sales, and thrift shops. When/if you go, definitely go through the boys and men’s departments, too. A bit of tailoring can make anything look custom like some of the pieces on Walker Slater maybe.

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Lifestyle and body changes will take place and impact your wardrobe and style needs a few times over the course of your life, and 20s is sort of when most navigate this for the first time. The most important thing to determine is what if anything in your current wardrobe can work for you now, including your work looks, and what look you want to have with your style for work. This should fit into your industry and be appropriate, but it can still be 'you' (your vibe, etc.), it just takes some thought and planning. Clothing is 100% the wrapper so to speak we all wrap around ourselves, and can reflect who we are, where we are at in our lives, how we feel about ourselves, and alot of other aspects about yourselves. Aim to tie it as closely to you, and what your life needs are. That is how it has been effective for me here.

text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:Absolutely. I’ve gotten much better at buying for what I’ll actually wear vs aspiring to look like how the models (or influencers) look. I spent a fortune at Anthropologie from 2005-2010 and gorgeous dresses, most of which i never ended up wearing. I never really wore makeup.  From 2010-2012, I moved into Urban Outfitters basic-ness, trying to be a bit more edgy. This is when I started wearing winged liner every day.  From 2012-2016, I was all about Banana Republic, because of wanting to appear professional, but was so bored with my wardrobe. I toned down my liner but added neutral eye shadow.  From 2016-2018, I almost exclusively wore athleisure because of my work switching from business casual to casual. I was comfy af though. Minimal makeup all the way.  From 2018 on, I’ve limited myself to second hand shopping. My look is much more eclectic now, but I find the items I buy feel more like treasures to me. I wear everything in my closet and I’ve got a much more streamlined approach to shopping. If it’s not made of a natural material, I don’t buy it. If it’s not black, white, grey, blue, burgundy, or yellow, I don’t buy it. If a skirt isn’t an A-line silhouette, I don’t buy it. These hard stops have prevented me from making the same fashion mistakes over and over again. I’m a more efficient shopper and my wardrobe stays cohesive.   I’ve definitely experienced a glow-up with makeup, though. I feel like I’ve really nailed down the look I like and I wear it every single day - tinted moisturizer with SPF, neutral satin eyeshadow, winged liner, peachy blush, eyebrow pencil, and tinted chapstick. It takes me 5 min in total to do this look. I never get bored of it, either. When I have to do a presentation, I’ll wear bold red lips and that adds enough variety for me to feel like I’ve spiced it up.

I have a very rectangular body, bog shoulders and chest and am 5’9” and get most of my clothing from them. As others have said, great return policy but the videos of the models wearing the clothes is the best bit. You see them move and how long they are. And you can tell if they look cheap or like they wouldn’t fit your bust/back etc. I love dressing all my friends and if you would ever like some clothing advice feel free to message me. I’d love to give you some tips.	episode_done:True
text:Is anyone dressing up this year for Halloween?	labels:I usually go to my local goth club on Halloween, dress up ridiculously and dance all night. That is absolutely not happening this year, so I have opted to dress up ridiculously and drink for free at home.    2020 has been a complete wash as a year, but I haven't put on makeup or heels in 8 or 9 months. I'm hoping dusting off my vanity will cheer me up at least a little. Last year I wore a very involved angel costume, but since I'm not going out I'm just going to put on my much more comfortable bunny costume.

Also if you’d like to see the clothes specifically please message me, thank you.     I’ve been seeing reviews that shein has been doing some sketchy shit but see I really like some of the stuff on there and it’s really cheap so if someone can message me with some reliable cites that would help or if someone wants to message me so I can show you what the clothing looks like that would also be great thank you.	episode_done:True

text:Sweatshirt: I'm shocked by my purchasing decision from yesterday and needed to share	labels:Since the logo seems embroidered on you can buy a seam ripper from a store like JoAnnes Fabrics (Or most stores like Krogers that have small sewing sections will also sell these). Then you just pick the stitches by cutting them with the seam ripper and pull out the strands by hand or with a tweezer.	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:OP, my boyfriend's mother was tested allergic to blue dye in polyester and nylon, so she can only wear natural fibers. You should probably get it checked if those fibers are bothering you. Maybe you have an allergy with some chemicals used to dye or process these fibers. The allergist will help you figure out the category of clothes you can and cannot wear.  In my bf's mom's case, she only wears 100% cotton, wool, cashmere, and silk fibers.	episode_done:True

First one saved my sanity, second one might have robbed me of some of it again, but she's just a baby so she gets a pass.)	labels:	episode_done:True

And to address the people asking "why are you dressing up?" Don't worry about it! Just answer honestly: "I really like this blouse! Or: "I love to look nice!" Many people really appreciate nice dressing. I'm still in school, and though I can appreciate a cute sweatpants fit I'd be ecstatic to see a nice skirt and cardi combo.

text:General Discussion - December 23, 2020	labels:Oh trust me, I will gatekeep because it’s proved to be the only way to ensure the existence of standards.  And I don’t care about what you say you are. Fedoras/Dusters/Capes/whatever is not just clothing. It’s an entire lifestyle and subculture that you are unlikely to be privy to or even fit into if you lack the euphoria and pedigree. That’s just the reality.  You’re probably one of those people who believes anybody can be anything yada yada yada. Sorry to break it to you, but no matter how much I want to be, say, a gentlesir, it simply isn’t going to happen. I can don the wolf shirts all I want, but it doesn’t change the fact that because it isn’t who I was born, it’s something I’ll never be. The same goes for most of the people on this subreddit who, by most accounts, even detest and reject the trappings of class that can not be divorced from euphoria. It is a style of, by, and for the American lower basement class and below, and nothing you say will change that.   It’s literally a costume for most of the people on this sub, and frankly, it’s subversive and I despise it.

text:General Discussion - December 08, 2020	labels:Yesterday we had in here a brief discussion on the potential impending resurgence of square toes (niche designers -> celebs -\*> big designers -> fast fashion -> regular people).  (\*you are here). Lurkers gonna be *mad*.  Upon reflection it really highlighted to me how downright insane the discourse of 10-years-ago-MFA was. Taking the square toes as examples, we had all this "teaching material" about how they were wrong, unflattering and just an all around horrible idea. With the implication that the people who make and wear square toe shoes simply don't know what they are doing.  Yeah, right. The people running one of *the* most profitable and most competitive markets simply didn't know that square toes "don't flatter your foot". They needed randos on the internet to find that out. *Insane*.
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:I've found that cotton is best, with up to 5% spandex. It's not a sexy look, but cotton flannel pyjamas are very comfy and cause no skin issues for me. I also have a couple pairs of cotton-stretch joggers from Amazon for home wear, and a pair of truly ancient 100% viscose leggings (they're basically see through now, which is probably why they're so soft). Honestly I usually wear a cotton dress around the house though - I find anything tight-fitting on the legs can cause trouble.  For tights, Falke has always been more comfortable than average for me. I buy a size up, which seems to reduce the pressure and itching.	episode_done:True
text:Has consulting a stylist really been a revelation to you?	labels:I had a workshop with a stylist a few years ago. It was really helpful. She taught us about warm and cold colors, about clothes that fit our body types, about different styles and we had this test with warm- and cold-colored fabrics where she told us which colors suited us best. I tried to stick to cold colors (which suit me best) for a while, but then I got bored, and now I wear warm as well.	episode_done:True

text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:I've completely stopped buying from Amazon and actually feel ill when I see anyone buying from them - which is everyone I know except my husband. Even people who are verbal about how shitty of a company it is still can't resist the "convenience." I think it takes practice. The longer you abstain from certain things, the less you want to go back.   I've also been a lot more conscious of the companies I buy my clothes from. If it seems too good to be true (i.e. cheap,) then it probably is. A beautiful top listed for $10 might seem like a deal, but you have to really think about why that garment is so cheap in the first place. I've gotten to the point where I can push past being seduced by a low price and look into the company itself. I read about their business practices, and if they seem fishy, I don't buy.  I'd rather thrift my clothes and feel more confident that I'm not buying in to fast-fashion. I'd be content wearing the same clothes forever and just reworking them through the years with my own hands, as opposed to buying from a company that treats people and our environment badly.	episode_done:True

text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:Skiing is a strenuous sport, often done in a dangerous alpine climate. I wear technical gear: bright loose waterproof jacket and pants for visibility and mobility, wicking warm base layers, balaclavas and goggles to protect my eyes and skin, a helmet, and a backpack or fanny pack with an emergency kit.   After skiing, I strip off the outer layers and walk around in uggs, tights, and turtleneck.   You know what? I 100% blend in. I don't look better or worse than the hundreds of other people who have just come down from the mountain. This is why people specifically wear bright colors. Your party will be able to identify you at a distance from the specific colors you're wearing.   I think ski/apres ski style is to skiing what cottage core is to farming/homesteading. It's an aesthetic for people who don't actually do it.   If you like the look and aren't interested in skiing, then look into some New England heritage preppy looks. The bean boots, scandi wool sweaters, thick stretchy stirrup pants, fluffy trimmed accessories, and parkas may appeal to you. Uniqlo has some cute stuff in their recent collab that has that cozy lux vibe. Moncler and Gorsuch are some OG European ski fashion wear companies. You could look into those for inspiration.   But definitely don't try to go skiing without a waterproof pant and jacket combo. You will have a terrible time, given how much you will likely fall. (Assuming that you're a beginner.)
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 30	labels:Does anyone know any “normal” sized male fashion influencer on Instagram that I can pull inspiration from?  I’m 5’8 and used to weigh 100kg. I’m now 78kg and my face, my arms and my legs definitely look thinner and I guess “normal” for my height. My waist and thigh area is still a bit thicker than how I would want them to look like. I wanted to show off my new self by also leveling up the way I dress although I’m not really that good at styling myself. I was trying to find male influencers on instagram that have a similar body type so I could pull inspiration from them or maybe find the pieces that they’re wearing, but I couldn’t find any.

text:Advanced Fit Pic Techniques	labels:- Focal Length: 50mm (on an APS-C sensor). That’s pretty long and I basically have my camera set up at the other end of the room.  - Aperture: Usually f/4.  - Lighting: midday at a north-facing window. Gives a very bright, blueish hue that brings out black clothes quite well imho.  - Background: just what I have in that corner of the room. The wall there happens to be painted in a metallic blue which might help with the lighting. I’d prefer white, but I’m not going to repaint for taking fitpics.  - Angle: I keep the lens pretty much at navel height. I think that gives the most neutral representation of the fit.  - Editing: The camera is sometimes having trouble computing the correct exposure for an all black fit (I have it on shutter priority because lazy). I usually play with the curves tool in post to get the textures right.  FWIW, my camera is an ancient Nikon D90. It still outperforms a modern smartphone, but it’s getting pretty close.	episode_done:True

text:Style rut: Pinterest vs reality	labels:Okay, so people are heckin' rude. What inspires us can be unwearable on our particular bodies, and we're not obligated to wear it. Or maybe we don't want to wear that exact item, but some part of it excites us. It's okay to translate what you loved in a picture into something you feel fits into your everyday life. What gives with your "friend"?  Now, if you find yourself unable to do that -- you're STILL okay. And if you need help, obviously that's why Daily Questions etc exist. Because we weren't any of us born knowing how to style.
text:But the second question is where to buy second hand from? For example near me we have the Salvation Army and a church thrift shop. I used to live next to a giant Salvation Army donation center and loved it, but after learning about their philosophy and some of the shady things they’ve done I no longer feel like I can ethically support them! Then supporting the local church thrift is also problematic given their stances on social issues! When I lived in California I was able to find some thrift stores that actually gave to causes I support (out of the closet etc) but now that I’m in the Midwest there aren’t any of these! I just want like a thrift store that donates to something like education or food banks without the religious/social aspect.	labels:In my part of Canada, basically the only two thrift stores are Value Village (for-profit company which donates a portion of its proceeds to a diabetes charity), and Goodwill By Salvation Army (non profit/charity I believe? With a history of discrimination against LGBT community and poor treatment of workers with disabilities)   The most common reaction I get, when people say "where did you get that sweater" and I say "Value Village", is  "ewwww, didn't you know that's a for profit company! You're wasting your time buying used, you're so foolish thinking you're a good person when you're just supporting some *corporation*, that's so gross, you're just as bad as me so don't pat yourself on the back for shopping there, you capitalist!"   And like... Really?? Wtf is up with that response? I'd rather support a for-profit used clothing store, than a for-profit new clothing store like Walmart or Forever 21. Isn't doing something better than doing nothing? Or, as the saying goes," don't let perfection be the enemy of good?"    (especially when my only alternative to value village is... Pretty much the last charity I'd want my money going to)	episode_done:True

text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:Do you feel the black Friday sales better or worse than usually this year? Is it worth to buy clothing you won't wear until next year?	labels:Coming from a person who works for a fashion company that never really participated in BF or CM sales, we are actually going forward with it in a big way this year!  We have core items on sale that have never traditionally been able to be less than 10% off.  It’s only for 2 days but we think our main customer base is going to be thrilled.

text:The best running shorts — 12 pairs tested (full post in comments)	labels:There is no reason to get a pair of $160 running shorts   If you want to go for a nicer pair of shorts in terms of looks and function than tracksmith is great. VC, session and twilight are all great options that look good and feel good running and at half the cost. Still pricey but compared to other high end tunning shorts by nike or Adidas they are comparable   But you can also get great shorts for $20 by new balance, brooks, nike, adidas, saucony and so on that are great comfortable and look decent. The main difference I've found between a 20 dollar shorts and a 80 dollar pair is durability. The 20 dollar pair still will last 3-5 years of serious running but the 60 dollar pair is forever	episode_done:True

text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession). I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession 🤣

text:FAQ: What is the difference between off the rack (OTR), made to measure (MTM) and Bespoke?	labels:**Off the Rack / Off the Peg / Ready to Wear**: You go to a store. You see a thing. You buy it. You can tailor it afterwards if you want to.  **Made to measure**: You have your measurements taken. Your measurements are sent somewhere. The thing you buy is made according to your measurements and specifications. Options may be limited, or... not-so-limited, depending on the company you work with.  **Bespoke**: You go to a tailor's shop. He measures you. He makes you a pattern, and then a suit, with his own hands, with his own shears. There are multiple fittings. He will do anything as long as he wants to do it -- you can ask for any fabric, any detail, and as long as it fits the house style and he doesn't think you're an idiot, you'll probably get it.  Edit: okay, so bespoke can be outsourced. The technical definition is that the pattern from which the suit is made. For made to measure, there's a standard pattern, and they adjust a number of measurements to fit you better. For bespoke, they make a pattern just for you from scratch. What this actually means for fit depends on a lot of specifics, including house style and how many measurements the MTM shop is willing to customize.  Generally, the difference between MTM and bespoke is complicated, and only stands out if you really know what you want and what the MTM shop can't do -- high-end MTM will usually fit very well and come with a lot of customization options and very hig hquality.	episode_done:True

text:Overhauling my wardrobe with lasting pieces	labels:Not to steal /r/mruzzy's glory. But Outlier.   Not all of their stuff is as durable as you're looking for. Even the founder said that when someone asked a similar question on /r/Outlier.  If you want durable bottoms: Futureworks, New Way Shorts, and StrongDungarees cannot be beat. Sometimes you can grab overshirts in the same materials these are made of, and they should hold up well.  They are scaling back their insulated jacket offerings due to various reasons, but the Slash Fortress is a tank and a half. It literally weighs five pounds and I don't know how you would destroy it.  The merino stuff, while I've never had issues with it, isn't going to be as durable as you want. You'll want to look at Wool and Prince (just one example) for core-nylon merino. Even a little bit of nylon makes a huge difference. Or go with heavy cotton (not my thing) or synthetics (which will be an exercise in finding something that doesn't look like you're...exercising).  If you're looking for a shell jacket (which are super useful), ten years might be hard to make. Especially in your price range. Regardless, if you can find a 3L jacket in your range, they will last the longest. Even though I've been sold on anything-but-Goretex, they do have the most experience in creating shells which should lead to your jacket lasting longer. Combine that with a lifetime warranty from Arcteryx (or Veilance if you have the money to look stylish and warm), you can't lose.   Sweaters/cardigans: Mission Workshop (lifetime warranty) and SNS Herning both makes super nice stuff that should last a long time. I'm pretty limited in range here but that'll give you an idea.

text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:Whoa... I am an adult woman with ADHD and I never thought about this somehow. I have MAJOR issues with restrictive clothing. Winter coats feel like a straitjacket, turtlenecks \*literally\* made me vomit when I was younger, and anything that's even slightly itchy or makes a weird noise (like a swishy windbreaker) drives me insane. I can't wear bracelets or watches because the sound of them clicking on my desk grates against my soul.  I usually live in American Eagle jeggings (soft joggers as soon as I get home), comfortable shirts, soft and loose sweaters/cardigans, comfortable ankle boots/Converse, and sometimes a well-fitting skirt with tights.  Interestingly, I have no issue with wearing tights, which I know a lot of women find uncomfortable. I don't mind wearing a bra, either.
text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:Ease the transition with chinos, which still have the same sort of feel as jeans but are a step in the direction of "dressier" (please take that with the biggest grain of skepticism, it doesn't even feel right to type).  And then from there, straight-legged or skinny dress pants are just one more step.  I only tend to own my dress pants in black or navy blue, I think I have one single pair of a light grey checkered pattern but I have to be in some kind of mood to wear those.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - February 13, 2021	labels:The existential crisis of purchasing dope outerwear I really like and then having to debate whether to size up to allow layering or stay true to size and risk a bit of tightness if I choose to layer or just not layer at all.  It's a real exercise to getting to know myself and it turns out I still don't know myself ㅠㅠ  Such is the journey I guess.
text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:My personal two cents:   I don’t think I could ‘enjoy’ wearing my purchases if I bought them with the intent to resell, I’d feel like I had to be careful and baby them to preserve their value and that outweighs the potential recoup in money. Even worse, what if I babied them and stressed about keeping them pristine and STILL couldn’t sell them later on?  In the past when I’ve gotten lucky with recouping costs on items sold, it’s always been an unexpected surprise and on random contemporary brands like Aritzia and LL Bean (??). Meanwhile my HE stuff seems to park forever.
text:Indochino VS Local custom clothier (HM Cole). My fair review.	labels:Indochino is only decent if you live in a city with a showroom. It's better if you live in a city with a "flagship" showroom. I've been to the showrooms in Calgary and Ottawa and they can't do measurements nor alterations. Vancouver, one of their "flagship" showroom, is amazing.

text:BoF: J. Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:i just feel like their price points are so high and the quality can be kind of mediocre. they’re stuck in a weird place where their pricing is too expensive for the average consumer who’s trained to expect bargains and too cheap for someone who buys luxury or higher end pieces.   even with their random extra 50% off sales, it’s still above what people expect to pay. but then again, madewell is thriving. (though i think that has more to do with being able to capture an on-trend aesthetic.)
text:Nice Laundry No Show Socks Are Terrible!	labels:Just try to exchange again and don't say you washed them?	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:I know that legitimate IG shops exist. But for me personally, any IG shop I've "discovered" has clearly been either a scam or uses drop-shipping. I simply refuse to shop on IG all together.  I really recommend thrifting and organizing clothing swaps with friends (if/when safe, of course!) and/or using online alternatives like Poshmark, as someone else suggested.	episode_done:True
text:Closet Organization By Color	labels:I have my clothing organized not only by color but by similar hues and tones. Like I don't just throw all my pinks together. Light muted pinks go with light muted pinks, baby pinks go with baby pinks, and so on.	episode_done:True

I really like everything so far and seems good quality (all purchases were online). I adore them a ton.	episode_done:True

text:How do you tell when discounted items were never full price?	labels:It doesn't matter if they were sold at a higher price, plenty of crap is marked up regardless of quality. What matters is if they are a price you're willing to pay.  Also try checking other websites good the same item to see price variances.
text:Can we talk sleepwear?	labels:I’m a big fan of a silk nighty if it’s a little warmer outside, but I will get cold too if I try to wear that into winter!

text:lol for real though those LL Bean canvas totes will make it through anything. we have a big one that got frozen under a dock all winter (I LIVE IN NEW ENGLAND OKAY) and came out good as new. you could perhaps perform a nuclear test on New England and then pry our LL Bean canvas totes out of our cold, dead hands, and then keep them for yourself.	labels:The mid-nineties to mid-aughts Land's End canvas totes were the same way. Then they got crappy. Wish I hadn't lost mine in a move.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have any visual guides for how clothes should fit	labels:The Palmer/Pletch Complete Guide to Fitting and Kenneth D. King’s Smart Fitting Solutions are the classics on this. They’re meant for sewing, but the fit principles apply to RTW as well. I’ve never used King’s book, but Palmer and Pletch have lots of photos.   You should be able to find them a library, but if not they might have other fit guides meant for sewers in that section.  Edit: I should add, the key to fit is you shouldn’t have any weird puckers or gathers anywhere. If you do, that means the item doesn’t fit you properly: either it’s too big somewhere, or too small. The puckers usually kind of point towards the area(s) where the fit problem is, like if they point towards your crotch on a pair of pants it usually means either the front rise is too short or or the trouser hip is too narrow, or both.   If you know that rule, it’s usually pretty easy to google videos about that particular fit issue, although with ready to wear it can be difficult as it usually means either you get the thing tailored or you keep shopping (or you live with the problem).
text:What’s your everyday purse?	labels:Mine’s a simple crossbody Kate Spade purse. It’s big enough for my wallet, keys, phone, hand sanitizer, spare mask, and sunglasses, but small enough so I’m not lugging around extra junk I don’t need. It’s perfect for my needs!
text:I'm fortunate enough to have turned a hobby into a job, using what I studied. There are days when it sucks but most of the time it's enjoyable. And my role isn't static enough to necessarily ever get boring.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:I have always been pretty comfortably middle class, but yes lack of physical access has changed my attitudes to shopping at least.   I grew up on a super remote island, and literally the only place to buy "new" clothes was the thrift store, so everyone was walking around in each other's clothes. I never associated second hand clothing with poverty until I moved to the city, so I still have an attitude of "I don't want this dress anymore, but it would look great on my friend so I'll offer it to her" which some people find very weird.   The lack of access to shops has also affected my attitude to shopping. I can't fathom shopping as a past time or getting much enjoyment out of the act of shopping. Clothes shopping (besides the thrift shop) was something we did on one day a year as part of our annual holiday off the island. Mum would drag us around hundreds of shops, trying on clothes and shoes and it was exhausting and high stress and built so many terrible memories that I now hate clothes shopping with a passion.	episode_done:True

text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:I also hate wearing pants. Don’t know how cold we’re talking but up to around  40 F, I would pretty much wear any autumn-y skirt/dress and rely on my wool tights, knee high leather boots, and a long wool coat to provide warmth for my lower body. Personally, most of the skirts I chose to wear were 100% cotton denim, leather, or suede!
text:clothes that you've made or altered significantly by hand that you're particularly proud of?	labels:I've made a bunch of masks. It's definitely more time investment to see them by hand, but I don't have a sewing machine so I don't have another option.	episode_done:True
text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:I very recently purged my wardrobe majorly. I ended up getting rid of lots of items that I loved in college, but they simply don’t suit me any longer as I’m finishing law school and beginning a professional career.   I kept asking myself, as I went through piece by piece, “does this have a place in my future? When I envision myself as I wish to be perceived, does this article of clothing suit that version of myself?” I don’t mean it to sound super deep lol but that helped me a lot as I navigated trying to nail down a personal style.   I got rid of SO much, and I feel great. My closet looks so nice and less cramped and chaotic. I have been slowly incorporating some versatile basics, but before I make any new purchase I make myself think out three to five different ways I could style the piece with what I already have on hand. I’m also trying to make a point to cut out most acrylic and purchase higher quality fabrics that will (hopefully) last for many years.	episode_done:True
text:What’s the comfiest material you can put in a washing machine without fuss?	labels:Columbia makes super soft and cozy 100% cotton knit sweaters that are machine-washable.   I actually find my merino sweaters faster to hand wash. I use Eucalan, which doesn’t require rinsing. Soak them in the sink with Eucalan for a half hour, wring out, roll in a towel to take downstairs to the drying rack, dry flat. It takes the same amount of time as finding the mesh delicates bags, washing on delicate, being nervous that I’ve ruined them, and drying flat.	episode_done:True

I did some research and there are a lot of conflicting views on how the Ashby fits. Some say it’s big so go a size down - some say it’s a slimmer fit. For my frame and style again, some conflicting views when searching.   I normally wear medium or small for jackets and like a tighter fit. I’m 190lb and 6ft tall.   Does anyone have one in a small? How does it fit/ can you share pics plus your weight and height?  I also checked the pit to put and length vs one of my current jackets. It’s the same as one of my Jean jackets, which seems good.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 08, 2020	labels:Yesterday we had in here a brief discussion on the potential impending resurgence of square toes (niche designers -> celebs -\*> big designers -> fast fashion -> regular people).  (\*you are here). Lurkers gonna be *mad*.  Upon reflection it really highlighted to me how downright insane the discourse of 10-years-ago-MFA was. Taking the square toes as examples, we had all this "teaching material" about how they were wrong, unflattering and just an all around horrible idea. With the implication that the people who make and wear square toe shoes simply don't know what they are doing.  Yeah, right. The people running one of *the* most profitable and most competitive markets simply didn't know that square toes "don't flatter your foot". They needed randos on the internet to find that out. *Insane*.
text:I agree 100% with this! A great coat can speak for itself. I enjoy pairing a statement coat made of quality material with well-fitting basics, and it easily elevates my look. You can save money by thrifting some vintage coats, which can help you set apart your personal style, and pair them with trendy pieces in your closet too. Easy to do even on a college budget!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Are there any actual fashion trends in 2020?	labels:we must be living on different planets.   lingerie as camisoles, fur trim everything, distressed tops, denim skirts, sweater vests, low rise pants, straight leg replacing skinny jeans, patchwork jeans, patterned tights, flared leggings, corset tops, fur lined boots, super tall platform shoes, juicy tracksuits, animal prints, tie dye, hand and leg warmers, fluffy bags, all were super popular trends last year. this has been the most trend heavy year in my memory, I could barely keep up.

text:FAQ: What are the different use cases of boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes, and loafers?	labels:Been wearing driving loafers for about 10yrs. I'm 40, and a car enthusiast since my kindergarten days. I initially found some Puma driving shoes to wear. These were great, because I wear a 16 and the tighter cut of the shoe helped me just do things normally. Good feel for my pedal modulation too.  I needed something more professional for business casual dress at work however, and driving loafers were perfect. Steve Madden & Kenneth Cole got me started, and I've had some Cole Haan & Rockport as well. Different price points, but they've all been great.	episode_done:True

Some of these, if I saw in the wild, I would think looked kind of accidental (like I was wearing a jacket and then decided I needed another jacket) but I love your comments for each picture. It made me look at things in a more runway mindset, "Why is this outfit interesting?"  I have a request, if you're taking requests (no pressure though, this was great)  a summer album? I feel like in the summer my style is more constricted or more basic because I wear fewer pieces, and it's easier for me to have weird & cool proportions with jackets and sweaters.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 01, 2021	labels:Hi all! I think this is the place for my comment/question. I've always been told my magazine and fashion outlets that dressing for my bodytype (atheletic boyish rectangle no stomach hips or boobs lol) that I needed to focus on creating the illusion of having curves and wear aline or circle skirts and frilly tops that put emphasis on my boobs. It works and I feel good, but when I take it off I start to feel like a fraud. Like I'm selling a body or image that isn't me and feel bad about it. I know its all about self love but I want to start dressing for MY body and feeling good not dressing to create a body I don't have

text:Shitpost Saturday: Beauty is Pain	labels:Okay, so there are these totally beautiful shoes. Like they are absolutely to die for. The biggest problem I have is that they don’t fit me. They are just the tiniest bit too small for me. My mom’s solution was actually really simple. Just cut off a part of your feet! Long story short, I did that but the guy I am interested in, totally saw that and is now completely grossed out and it also kinda ruined the shoes. So now I cant stand on my feet without being in agony and I am single. On the upside I can now fit in my stepsisters’ shoes.
text:DAE feel they made incredibly ODD fashion purchases, this year in 2020?	labels:I’m usually a bigger shopper but since covid hit I haven’t bought a single item of clothing beyond face masks.

I dont think anything I own is trendy by today's standards cause anymore I tend to look at fit, rather than style, if that makes sense. I used to walk by shops and be unable to decide which items I wanted to take home cause i thought everything was cute, and then end up with a closet full of stuff I hardly wore or felt embarrassed by later lol. Ive become much more selective and comfortable with the pieces I do choose to invest in, and dont think much about whether or not it's in style.  I still get compliments from younger and older people so I don't *think* I look outdated or backwards, but I dont care if I do, either, haha	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - October 28	labels:Work has been in emergency mode for like a month now, and it's likely to continue for at least another month. I'm burned out af.
text:what are your fashion flaws?	labels:I simultaneously buy things I like regardless of having the occasion to wear them and also have a tendency to "save the good stuff" for these nonexistent occasions, which has resulted in a practical overabundance of clothes that are just a little too dressy for my lifestyle, and that this year I have literally had no reason whatsoever to touch...  I also don't know if it's just me but I'm constantly hooking parts of my clothing (belt loops esp) on cabinet handles?
text:“I'm all locked down with nowhere to go – but that hasn't killed my lust for fashion”	labels:I have one suggestion, get dressed and take pictures. It doesn't have to be for Instagram/facebook. It can be for just yourself. If you really like an outfit, remember it with a picture. You can take it in a park, or at a location that is memorable for you, with your SO, or with your cat. You should at least get a few good pictures with you pet in the 10+ years they reside with you.  It's actually a fun learning experience, on how to use the cameras. I am interested in photography and usually use a dslr, but for selfies, dslrs are not as good. With an iphone, I think it's an entirely different genre of photography. You have to use completely different lighting system, etc., to use it to its full potential.
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:Colorful skirts are good options to try out. I also have a mostly neutral wardrobe, but I discovered that I can pair basic white shirts with a more colorful skirt.  It looks fun, but still "safe" because I don't have to worry about what color suits my skin tone.	episode_done:True

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:Hi! As a stylist I get this question ALOT. For starters don't get rid of too much before buying replacements. What ends up happening is we get rid of everything without establishing what pieces we actually need.   Start with establishing your personal style. What do your want your closet/style to be? What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping! Now that you have a moodboard and list of things you need you can shop to fin in the gaps and more importantly you can shop with intention!   &#x200B;  I hope that wasn't too much and was helpful haha. I'm always happy to help.

My parents were so angry I spent all the money I had on one single clothing item but I still have the sweater about 10 years later and it continues to be a staple item

(Edit: I also meant to mention the Everyday Style podcast. I can't remember if she does it for all episodes but in earlier ones she gives "homework" exercises that could be relevant.)  Anyway, they're some options that could be useful alternatives if The Curated Closet is tricky to get a copy of.

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:Echoing a few suggestions here re: accessories and shoes with some examples I’ve done this fall/winter.  My standard fall/winter wardrobe is also a sweater, jeans and ankle boots. Some variations I’ve tried:  I saw Pinterest inspo of statement red socks with Oxfords and I usually only wear oxfords in spring/summer because it feels too cold in fall winter. I bought a pair of red/burgundy cashmere socks from j crew and wore those today with my black oxfords, black jeans and white sweater with black stripes.  Wearing “dressy” sneakers. I bought some MOMA vans, I have a out of burgundy suede and tweed new balance sneakers I wear to work and I want to get a basic black pair of adidas shoes. Similar goes for slip on sneakers, I have a pair of Kate spade leopard print Keds and a red leather pair of Olukais with a pretty floral design.  I have an amazing blanket scarf and even wearing a very thin black sweater or long sleeve t shirt with the blanket scarf I always get compliments even though that’s my comfy outfit. It’s not a chunky sweater but it’s still warm.  When I want to look a bit dressier I really do love wearing sweater dresses or just thicker regular dresses and tights/leggings with ankle boots as well. For slightly thinner dresses throwing a long cardigan over top.	episode_done:True
text:Honestly one of my favorite things about it (and Star Wars in general) is the costuming.   I realized when that calamari dude was wearing the fisherman sweater, it struck me as being out of place.

Everyone just wears whatever they want or whatever suits their lifestyle, and no one else pays it much mind. Dude walking around in shiny battle armor?

text:General Discussion - December 23, 2020	labels:Oh trust me, I will gatekeep because it’s proved to be the only way to ensure the existence of standards.  And I don’t care about what you say you are. Fedoras/Dusters/Capes/whatever is not just clothing. It’s an entire lifestyle and subculture that you are unlikely to be privy to or even fit into if you lack the euphoria and pedigree. That’s just the reality.  You’re probably one of those people who believes anybody can be anything yada yada yada. Sorry to break it to you, but no matter how much I want to be, say, a gentlesir, it simply isn’t going to happen. I can don the wolf shirts all I want, but it doesn’t change the fact that because it isn’t who I was born, it’s something I’ll never be. The same goes for most of the people on this subreddit who, by most accounts, even detest and reject the trappings of class that can not be divorced from euphoria. It is a style of, by, and for the American lower basement class and below, and nothing you say will change that.   It’s literally a costume for most of the people on this sub, and frankly, it’s subversive and I despise it.

text:Thoughts on Shein?	labels:Controversial opinion, but, they aren’t that bad.   Let’s have some empathy for a moment: it is an absolute privilege to be able to shop at a sustainable store and/or to be able to buy secondhand. Imagine being someone who hasn’t bought new to them clothing in years because they can’t afford to and then fast fashion prices are waved in their faces on clothing that fits them and is their style. I’m not going to tell someone to not buy clothing from a place they can afford. I’m absolutely not doing it.   People demonize fast fashion because they look at it as black and white and don’t understand that, if you’re shopping at SHEIN, you likely can’t afford the more sustainable sources/you can’t find what you’re looking for secondhand. I’m plus sized. I can’t fit into and afford a lot of the sustainable brands out there. And, people buy out the “fashionable” plus size items in my local thrift stores to sell on Depop, so, I don’t blame people for shopping on SHEIN.  I’ve bought SHEIN secondhand and I’ve had items for years and I haven’t had any issues. I haven’t bought first hand from them in a long time but when I did, I never had any long shipping times or anything, either. I found the same defects I’d find at Target, like, a long thread here or there that I can easily snip off.   This goes for fast fashion in general—if you take care of your clothes and wear the appropriate size, you can make them last. It’s not like they spontaneously rip apart, you have to do something to make them do that. Steam your clothes to get out wrinkle. Tumble dry, hand wash, etc.

text:I appreciate your comment and understand what you're saying. Like I said in the post, I have tried many aesthetics and styles through out the years and I really do think I know what I'm talking about when it comes to dressing well. I have no need to prove anything to you but in my own social circles I've always been the stylish one and most of my friends come to me for advice or do the exact thing that I'm doing here, which is ask me where to go to find certain items.  I just don't really understand the fascination with people wanting to tell me that what I'm looking for is wrong, and forgive me if I'm misinterpreting this, and then I should stop and look for something more mainstream and appropriate? I mean to me, isn't that part of fashion? To step out of your boundaries and try new things?   If all your comment is is a warning that I may look like a cosplayer,  then I appreciate it. But funny enough, I am also a cosplayer and I think there is a fine line between items that will look like everyday clothes vs costume pieces and I'm doing my best to find those.  And either way, you won't know until you try it :)	labels:> If all your comment is is a warning that I may look like a cosplayer,  then I appreciate it.  That's all it is. There are plenty of people who try e.g. the Rick Owens aesthetic and fail to pull that off because they don't have a feel for what works and what doesn't. Confidence is also a huge deciding factor in whether you're pulling it off or not. I'm not saying it isn't possible, just that you really have to know what you're doing in order to be successful with it.  Like the other guy who replied to me said, if you have to ask you probably shouldn't.  > I just don't really understand the fascination with people wanting to tell me that what I'm looking for is wrong  We get _a lot_ of people coming through here and asking our opinions on wearing cosplay gear. Some items are asked about so frequently that they've become huge in-jokes in the community (BR2049 coat, Drive scorpion jacket, Bloodborne trench coats) so the first assumption people are going to make, particularly here, is that you're another one of those people. When someone comes here asking if they can pull off a Bloodborne-style coat the answer is almost always no. Not in the contexts in which you want to wear it, not in the outfits you intend to pair it with, not if the quality is terrible, not if you don't have the confidence to not care what the majority of people will think.  There's nothing wrong with doing this if you know what you're doing. If you're sure that what I'm saying doesn't apply to you then I really hope you find what you're looking for.   I genuinely look forward to any posts you make in WAYWT because I'd love to see someone successfully pull this off! If you have any inspiration images for complete outfits perhaps you could put an album together and post it here.

In reality or inventory is just slightly down but we just aren’t getting in new-ness as often and a lot of it is just a bit too late (getting in summer dresses only a few weeks ago, got shorts in July rather than March when we were closed, etc). We work so so hard to make the store beautiful and feel full with limited resources and it sucks to repeatedly here: it’s not the same!!! And 2) you’re going to close and probably lose your job because I feel like it’s not exactly the same as BEFORE A LITERAL PANDEMIC.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 12, 2020	labels:I’m looking to buy an Aran sweater. If you aren’t familiar with them they’re traditional Irish knit sweaters with the intricate designs woven into them. I was hoping someone might have some more experience with them than I do, especially since it looks like I’ll have to buy online. I’m looking to buy from an actual Irish shop if possible. Would like to support small business. However, I’m in the US.   1) first, Is anyone familiar with a good place to buy them? I was looking at Aran Sweater Market and they seemed reasonably well priced at around $100 USD. I know you can go all the way up to $700 for a super fancy one but that’s not really an option for my budget. I could probably go as high $200 if it’s something I know will be worth it.   2) Any recommendations on the fit? When buying most shirts I have a problem with getting the right size with a shorter body (about 5-8) and a larger chest. I’d say for a normal shirt I’m right at about the lower end of large, can usually get away with a medium if I don’t eat a lot of salt. But with these I obviously want something a little more loose but not sure if XL would be too big.   Would really appreciate any help on this.

I tried it once with a men’s peacoat and brought it to the best, most experienced tailor in town, and even he really struggled with it. In the end, he could not take the shoulders in far enough without ruining the structure of the coat.

text:Winston & Co. Shawl Collar Cardigan Review (But mostly preamble)	labels:This is good stuff. I think the important takeaway is that there are really not likely going to be shortcuts here - you are likely going to find scratchiness at lower price points, and moving up the pricing ladder, you may find that the ply numbers align with price = wool sweaters whose weight is in pounds not ounces are going to cost $XXX not $XX.  Also, if you do value horn versus leather buttons, you are further slicing your options - there is a strong correlation with Scottish knits with "tradition", and that means the default tends to be leather buttons. In fact, years ago I was at NMWA when a S&C order came in... with leather buttons. I think that meant they had to ship back a few cubic yards worth of cardigans

text:The issues people have is with how the fur is obtained, and a large portion of CG's fur is obtained through trapping. And trapping is generally looked down on as the animal can remain in the trap for days or even weeks at a time suffering. Are coyotes extremely overpopulated in a lot of areas of Canada and need to have their population culled? Yes, absolutely, and anyone trying to argue otherwise is a fool that doesn't understand the negative effect coyotes have on local animal populations. But allowing these animals to suffer for so long isn't the way to go about it. So the main crux of the issue is that yes, the fur is technically obtained legally and from a severely overpopulated species, but the way that it's obtained isn't ethical and shouldn't be encouraged.  This being said, CG has pledged to switch to "reclaimed fur" (whatever that means) starting in 2022.  Oops, kinda glazed over the down part. I've personally never seen anyone slate CG for how they collect their down, it's the fur that's the issue. Apologies for misreading at first. Though apparently it took them until the end of 2019/start of 2020 to become 100% RDS (responsible down standard) certified so maybe there were issues I haven't heard about...	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I love dusty pinks and mauves.  I cannot express how badly those colors look with my skin. I've had *strangers* ask me if I was ok because they assumed someone who resembled a corpse that much must be actually nearing death.   I love heels and very sleek business casual as well as what I can only call ho-fits. I have bad ankles fr from working on concrete floors too many hours, and take public transportation. It's too much of a risk I could sprain my ankle from how much I walk, and I can't afford another sprain. My office is not business casual or sleek, but a no fuss "just don't wear t-shirts with slogans or anything" type of place. I am decidedly over my ho phase, despite my continued love of the clothes.   My fantasy of wearing heeled booties with a structured fashion blazer over a mauve dress is not any less real just because I have the common sense to not go through with it.

text:Not familiar with kohl’s as I am in Canada. What other brands would they be akin to ? Dress like that sounds amazing!	labels:Kohl’s is a low to mid tier department store. A bit like Target without the food/toilet paper stuff, and lower end than Macy’s. Fancier than Walmart. But it is like the unhip middle age mom suburban store - so you are supposed to be embarrassed to shop there. 🤣🤣🤣  Now in retrospect, I might have actually bought this dress when I was still in my 20s, barely! And now I am 42.   They have a wide mix of “exclusive” brands, and mass market ones like Levi’s, Nike, and Lee.   The ones I have the best luck with are the Elle brand (like Elle Magazine).

text:This. Get a cashmere cardigan and it will keep you warm. The buttons in the front give you some options for how warm you want to be, and it is easily taken off compared to a sweater in case you’re inside somewhere where the heater is on too high. Keep in mind that cashmere ranges in quality these days. Price is not always an indicator. Check how soft it feels and check the blend % (try to avoid polyester blends). I recommend trying to snag a high quality one during Black Friday sales or at an outlet.   You could also get a collared button up fleece shirt. You can wear it on top of a long sleeve shirt (unbuttoned/buttoned), it’s also easy to take off indoors, not to thick or much volume so it’s easy to throw into your briefcase/backpack, and if it get’s colder you can wear a cardigan on top of it all.   If it gets cold enough to where there’s ice on the roads and you feel like you’re freezing to death whenever you step outside, Uniqlo has some “heat tech” thermal pants that you can wear under normal pants, and nobody need notice. It makes all the difference in freezing temperatures.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I hear you. I specifically only shop during sales or for vintagey brands.

It's not the best if you're looking for a specifc piece, but I always sort by my sizes and then matierals and have found some cool funky stuff.
text:This is so inspiring! I’ve always been sort of hesitant about wearing certain clothes and styles (eg.

But what you said about improving ourselves and how that relates to fashion is such an uplifting outlook. especially since I’m working on growing as a person and what to adopt more traits that I associate with the styles that I admire like confidence and a more laidback/spontaneous outlook.

(I can't get much information from jeans and basic t-shirt)   Do you have a small waist? (this question goes towards if pants/jeans that fit you in the butt and thighs have a wide gap at the waist)   Are your legs "too long" for normal-sized bottoms? (regarding if you need tall sizes for jeans)   With your chest and shoulders, do you often have the issue that you need to size up to have correct shoulder hems but then the clothing item will be too wide in the chest/belly area?  Once you answer, I can give you some suggestions.
text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:I buy a lot of my stuff on Depop or Etsy. I've found that the easiest way to do it is know what you want and have a lot of strict rules for yourself. If you're just looking to browse and buy whatever catches your eye like you would in a store, it's gonna be harder. So recently I've been buying a lot of jumpers. These are my rules:  * no fast fashion brands * under £20 * must be "buy it now" because I can't be bothered with auctions * must be at least 50% wool * must show a photo of the label stating the materials used * body of the jumper must be at least the same length as the sleeves because I don't want a cropped jumper * must have a picture of the front and back of the jumper * Nothing that has a brand name or logo outwardly visible  so my search terms are things like "wool jumper size S" "vintage wool jumper" "Ralph Lauren wool jumper" etc. which narrows it down massively from just searching "jumper".  Then I filter by "used" and "buy it now" (on Ebay)  Sometimes I then sort by Price - Low to High, sometimes I don't bother.   Then because of my rules, I know quickly wether something meets my criteria, so I'll open like 20 tabs that meet the criteria without looking closely at them.   When I've got about 20 open, I'll actually go through them and decide if I like / want any of them.	episode_done:True

text:I hate pants unless they’re leggings, so I never wear them. I have all kinds of dresses, but for something like Thanksgiving I definitely prefer a looser dress.

Mostly I live in shorts and skirts, but there is also something comfy to me about wearing something longer and which kinda hugs your body. But when you're celebrating a holiday that revolves around eating a huge meal, it's pretty much the worst thing. Everyone in pants just sitting around being uncomfortable after the meal until they leave Grandpa's house and finally get to undo their fly. Lol. A loose dress does sound a lot more pleasant.  While I transitioned years ago, I usually see conservative family on the holidays, so I still try to dress up en masc, and it's a little ridiculous. Will be nice to have a smaller gathering with just close fam this year (siblings and my mom only, all of whom live together).	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else have “irony pieces”?	labels:A long time ago, a friend at work told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheapo pantyhose.  I looked down at my crappy nylons and actually felt cheap. I went to Nordtroms that night and bought presentable nylons and wore them to work the next day. She nodded in approvement and then told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheap sweaters. I then bought a wildly pretty ivory cable knit sweater and wore it to work and feeling quite exactly like 1000000 bucks AND i had fancy nylons too. She told me no one would take me seriously with my unkempt shoes and that's when I learned the power of a shoe shining kit.  The next day I wore crappy slacks...and, well you know how the story goes.  To this very day I wear natty clothes and shoes so shiney they can blind fleet of Greek warriors.  The only real irony is no one gave a tootie about nylons and yet I still wear them despite all evidence to the contrary....and she threw al hers away after our company got bought out by another and they were no longer required. (I point at my perfectly appointed knees).
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:I’m using swopped (UK version of Swap Society) and it’s good if you can’t sell your clothing or you don’t want to donate to charity (as it may end up in land fill). The items you send in gets assessed to see whether it’s in fit condition to swap. I’ve tried to do direct swapping on Depop but it’s hard to just find people who have similar tastes to your style or just the imbalance value of clothing offered. It’s a great way to get new clothes if you don’t want to spend money neither.	episode_done:True

text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:My perspective is from someone who got interested in wearing sport coats, ties, and “professional” clothing at 17. I just turned 24 and only now do I feel like I have a solid grasp of fundamentals to try new stuff after 8 years of taking clothing seriously.   To me, it all depends on what you want to communicate to others. If you’re only dressing for yourself, you can wear whatever. If you’re more conscious about what others will think too, then there’s an element of “dressing your age” for societal acceptance.   The reason why people shit on 50 year olds wearing hollister is because it’s so apparent that they’re trying so hard to recapture their youth rather than accepting their age and what positives come with it. In the same vein, 17-year-old me wearing ties and sport coats was me trying to shed my youth and move too quickly into professional adulthood. Both have to do with fighting against what we’ve been given rather than working with what we’ve got in a natural way.   The issue may be one of standing out from the crowd being frowned upon, but I think it has more to do with the underlying mentality and reasons why people chose that look.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:<rant>  If I said "Wear cropped jackets so you look taller" I'd be laughed out of the room but somehow "Short people shouldn't wear long coats" is a valid thing?   Also what's defined as short? If someone is 5'7" do they get to wear long coats? What if they're 5'7.5"??  It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering". If you care so much about these gender norms, masculinity and being ~ flattering ~ then sack up and wear the clothes you like.   That whole thread is just people saying that someone else told them they couldn't *wear a coat* so what should they do? Oh idk. How about tell them to fuck off and wear the damn coat.  </rant>

text:Sock It To Me: Novelty Sock Appreciation Post	labels:My mom loved kooky socks! They always make me think of her. I love them aesthetically, but actually don't really enjoy wearing socks, so I only kept one pair of hers after she died. They're lime green with pink flamingos, and she bought them to wear while officiating my roller derby games (non-skating officials are affectionately called flamingos because they used to mostly wear pink.)  I also bought a pair while I was mourning immediately after her death. My husband made me go "hiking" at garden of the gods in Colorado springs and we stopped at a gift shop by one of the trailheads. They had these blue socks with sloths holding donuts with pink sprinkles. I fucking love sloths and pink sprinkle donuts and they're exactly the kind of thing she would have bought for me.  I have a few pairs of socks she gave me: baller sloths with gold chains. Otters holding hands. Sushi and sashimi. Silver glitter balloon animals. Some extremely tall ones covered in beer glasses.  I don't really like things touching my lower legs unless they're really soft or smooth. I guess the skin on my shins is super sensitive. So I mostly only wear ankle socks that don't really show, but I always make sure to buy cool ones. My favorites right now are pale pink with rhinos that say Party Animal. The rhino's horn is a party hat.	episode_done:True
text:**Disclaimer**: *I don't doubt your experience in the least bit and I believe an appropriately designed study would likely support everything you're saying.*  This article was torn apart in r/science because it didn't test other races in the same clothing as a control group. This poorly designed study can't be used to conclude anything about race because it's not possible to demonstrate a racial disparity when there's no comparison to another race at all. Other research has shown effects of clothing on impressions by strangers for other races as well, so this doesn't tell us anything we don't already know. It would need to be re-tested with controls in order to presumably show a difference in the strength of the effects for different races.  I support the message they're trying to get across, but their methods were shoddy. It is a serious topic and it deserves to be explored correctly and supported with methods that are actually sound.	labels:	episode_done:True

I just read Nicole Byers’ book and now I want to brave a bikini for the first time in nearly a decade.

text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:Oh god. I'm instantly reminded of the embarrassment I felt whenever I showed up to a pregame for a frat formal and then realized it was SEMIFORMAL. I was there in a long red gown and everyone was in minidresses... I already felt out of place because I wasn't in a sorority, just was dating a guy in the frat. Thankfully I begged my bf at the time to bring me home before the formal and I changed to a better dress.  Anyway, I tend to be an overdresser. In college I felt more comfortable dressed how I wanted to rather than in big tshirts and athletic shorts or leggings. At the office, I work with a bunch of old dudes that are wearing polos at their dressiest lol. I'm perfectly fine being the odd one out there.  I think it's mostly rude to overdress whenever there's a stated dresscode. Like in my first example, I wouldn't call it "rude" but it definitely looked off.

text:Bernie's shlumpy look is so goddamn endearing. It's like, here is a man who doesn't give a fuck about *anything* other than doing his job and representing his people as best as he can.

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:In my experience, lower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose) and spending more tends to lead to a more noticeable improvement in quality up to a certain point. That's painting with a broad brush though... leather dress shoes and boots scale much better than sneakers or sandals, where mid-range options are going to be good enough for most people.  T-shirts, dress shirts, denim, and accessories in low-to-mid-range are generally good enough from a quality perspective IMO and I've only really paid more in those categories for a design I like rather than because I think I'm getting something higher quality. There's nothing wrong IMO with buying something because you like the way it looks even if a similar quality alternative exists at a lower price, but that's harder to do if you're shopping on a budget.  I'll also add that for all of the above, your dollar goes a lot farther if you're willing to shop used. Sites like Ebay, Grailed, reddit/styleforum B/S/T threads, etc. have made it a lot easier to buy preowned clothes without having to set foot into a thrift store.  TL;DR When shopping on a budget I'd focus first on having a high quality pair of shoes and jacket. Consider buying used clothes to stretch your budget further.
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:If you aren't married to the idea of capsules:  Buy seasonally appropriate basics and rent fancier work clothing or special occasion garments from Rent the Runway (or another rental brand). It's a good way to take your time with building a wardrobe you like while trying out trends you may be curious about but hesitant to pull the trigger on. It's worth noting that your wardrobe is never really done. Things get worn out, fall out of favor, stop fitting your lifestyle, or you just stop liking them. I think if you have a solid foundation (jeans, slacks, a few blouses, sweaters, t-shirts, undergarments, a few pairs of black and brown shoes) you can find flexibility with styling beyond that without feeling that you have not enough clothing or a million things and nothing to wear.	episode_done:True

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I require a relatively formal work wardrobe that includes suiting and tailored dresses.  After years of wasting time and money at the dry cleaners, I decided to rationalise my work wardrobe in a similar way to you some time ago.   Some brands, including Emporio Armani, Joseph, Me&Em and Norma Kamali, make very high quality machine washable polyester suiting and dresses that don't look remotely cheap or plastic-y. You can get suiting in machine washable wool from budget-friendly brands including Marks & Spencer and Next, but surprisingly designer brands don't seem to have taken up the opportunity. Wool or cashmere knitwear (any brand) can be machine washed if you invest in a modern machine with a wool setting and a specialist detergent. While deeper coloured cottons will eventually fade, it is otherwise resilient to machine washing and probably the best choice for shirts.  I would avoid silk. Even if it's washable, the colours will eventually fade, and it's hard to remove stains without damaging the fabric.	episode_done:True

The one day I can let blatant consumerism release my inner bloodlust and relinquish all inhibitions to get the last boxy crop top sweater in the scrap. To combine those old self defense Tae Kwan Do moves and Rollerderby bodychecks so I can grab a purse so small that I can only fit 2 rolled up dollar bills in them.  Both items will then sit proudly in the back of my closet with the tags on them until I Marie Kondo that shit, because winter exists and I actually need to carry around more than coke utensils.

text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:These are all pretty much dropshipping the same cheap clothes from Ali.

I would highly suggest the used market for affordable ethical clothes. threadup and poshmark are my go tos. But if you want to buy new Universal standard and Pact are good. Its also worth remembering that a lot of 'ethical' brands are really just greenwashed so who knows.	episode_done:True

Most of the fine jewelry I own is actually passed down or gifted to me. All my eclectic pieces I own are more along the lines of fashion/costume jewelry and purchases by myself for casual wear.  As for vendors I like, here are a few names I follow: Ochre Objects, Vrai, Caysie van Bebber (really expensive and I don’t own anything from her; I just like looking at her work, haha), Liesel Love, Aurora Designs, and Social Value (this one is great for affordable diamond jewelry).  For nice, eclectic pieces, I like Local Eclectic.  For old estate pieces, I follow ChelseagirlNYC, Zacharysjewelry, and Ivy & Rose.  Lastly I do like to look at Blue Nile. Sometimes they have good deals!
text:Do you feel the black Friday sales better or worse than usually this year? Is it worth to buy clothing you won't wear until next year?	labels:Maybe this is just the stores I'm looking at, but it seems like the new stuff that I'm actually interested in isn't on sale this Black Friday, but everything else that's not as good is 40% off. It's annoying, because splashing a big number like that ("30-50% off the whole site! \*exclusions apply") draws me to their site, but the items I actually want aren't a part of the sale.  The only exception being Levi's because I've been waiting for this 40% off sale to get a pair of Wedgie jeans.   Not going to lie, I did buy quite a few bits from the sales this year but with the intention of returning 90% of it because I don't feel comfortable going into stores to try stuff on. Best to buy everything I want to try on at sale prices then return what I don't want to keep!

Good thread on the SLP teddy, but just about nothing in there is surprising. Is it well-constructed? Duh, it's SLP. Does it have little refinements all over, compared to everyday varsity jackets? Yeah, that's kind of the point. Is it "worth" $2,000? No, obviously not.   Like...at some point we need to acknowledge that these efforts are misguided, even if well-intentioned. You're buying SLP because it's SLP (or Ackermann, or Dick Ovens, or whatever your thing is). *That* is the justification. And that's a fine justification in and of itself! An analysis of the materials and construction is unlikely to throw up surprises that'll make people go "damn, that really makes it worth the obnoxious price tag!"   (This observation does not apply to bespoke clothing, where the justification genuinely is that you get something more or less customized for you, and you alone.)  What do people think?

text:100% on privilege. Over the past few years, I’ve slowly transitioned much of my wardrobe to natural fiber clothing (with the exception of athletic wear - but now there’s recycled options at least!). And I know it’s a privilege to do so, now that I’m further in my career. A $300 slow fashion, locally produced w/ fair wage, pasture raised wool sweater simply isn’t accessible for most. And even secondhand, it’s not cheap by any means. This is why as problematic as Everlane is as a brand, I won’t judge someone for buying a much more affordable wool cardigan there instead of from babaa, if it better fits their financial needs.  However, trends are for sure more physically accessible now than before with e-commerce and social media, for better or for worse. It’s interesting - I’m in my early 30s, so our generation was in jr high / high school just as e-commerce was starting. We were one of the first Facebook user cohorts. I grew up in a sleepy suburb that was ~2 hours from a large city. We had an OK mall, Macy’s was our fanciest department store. Whenever a girl wore something from Nordstrom’s, everyone oohed and ahhed because not only was it more expensive, but you had to be fairly privileged to travel to the city to go shopping.   I still remember our family visiting my older brother in another major city, and he took me to an Urban Outfitters store for the first time. I thought all the clothes were _so cool_ and how awesome that the people had local access to that store?? And now it’s both visually and ‘physically’ accessible through the internets (with their problems as well). In that sense, I do think it’s great - but the trade-off is the exacerbation of fast fashion with trends cycling through and consumed at lightning speed.	labels:Wow this takes me back to the first time I went to an Urban Outfitters! Still have the graphic shirt I bought from there, now with holes and no print left on the front. Hell, even Forever21 was a brand that was intriguing to the girls in my hometown because you had to have the money and time to be able to drive two hours to the mall!	episode_done:True

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:kind of all of them? It seems like you have to pay pretty steep prices now to get the quality of clothes that mid-price mall brands had in the 1990s and early 2000s. It seems that most stores have switched to a model of selling poor quality pieces at huge markups with the expectation that they will sell most of the stock at clearance prices. The GAP used to have quality staples, and J Crew was "fancy." Now GAP is really the same quality as Old Navy, and don't know what J Crew is anymore. The quality has certainly dropped, but I also don't get what is up with the designs since you can't even get a reasonable women's suit there these days. Madewell is not made well. Anthropologie used to sell unique pieces with really good construction, now it's roughly the same as other fast fashion, though I do appreciate that they added petite and plus sizing and carry some high end brands too. Levi's main line is terrible now, and to get the heritage quality, you need to get the Made and Crafted line, which is really expensive!  I mostly shop secondhand because I can't afford the stuff I like. When buying new, I try to wait for sales and avoid buying anything "final sale" or with complicated returns unless I know it will work. Clothes that I used to get at Anthropologie, I now get from Sezane, Ulla Johnson, Doen, and Samantha Pleet. I started buying vintage jeans over Madewell/Levi's or expensive craft brands—my 1980s Chic and Gitano jeans were probably sold at K-Mart/Target but are better quality than anything I have gotten from Madewell. I don't wear jeans/denim enough to justify craft denim prices. Patagonia is still very high quality technical wear; I just scope out the Tyler sport outlet and secondhand for deals. Shoes are hard because I don't like to get them secondhand. I switched from Adidas to Veja and Diemme for sneakers (you can find Diemme shoes for huge markdowns on Yoox during the winter and summer sales—I don't think they are worth retail price).

text:Crazy theory here - but has anyone noticed that sometimes stores say the item is now sold out? I’ve done this a few times only to come back and the item is gone. But when I sign out it magically is there. I feel like there are a few retailers that use this as a tactic to not “wait too long.”	labels:The "almost gone! Only two left but three people have it in their cart! Sale ends in 01:03:29" types of messages are in fact just marketing. They're designed to create a sense of urgency and fear of missing out, which then triggers the impulse to buy without further evaluation.   Remember how you used to see furniture stores with "going out of business" sales that never seemed to actually go out of business? It's the same thing: people think they have a limited time to take advantage of a "deal" that might never return and are more likely to buy. That particular problem was so pervasive that U.S. law changed to ban that as a bait and switch/false advertising scam.  There are tons of ways that businesses use psychology to entice consumers. Everything from the color of the walls to the height of a shelf is done with a specific purpose. Same thing applies to websites.

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.

Of course it's impossible to get an exact body double from just 3 measurements, but that's what the standard is, and that's what I could reasonably expect the average person to know about themselves. I have to make sure that the barrier to entry is very low. The more people can join this index, the more useful it is. Please remember that I offer this tool completely for free, that I don't work in the fashion industry, and that I don't have any background in the industry (fashion, data, or web design). I just wanted to do something helpful for the community.

text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:IMO there is \*almost\* no such thing as classic and timeless.  Just buy the things that you like, it's fine if you like trends and your style changes over time.  The idea that you become and adult and you must ditch trends is an internet myth, if you look at actual people (adults) that have some interest in style/fashion - they are following trends.  Maybe not in the same way or timeline as teenagers but they are not just wearing white buttons and trench coats all the time.  And even if they were, white button downs and trench coats are not exactly the same now as they were ten or twenty or thirty years ago.	episode_done:True
text:The Terribly High Cost of Cheap Goods	labels:Don't believe companies when they say something domestically produced will cost tons more. They lie! It's pure green. Unfettered capitalism. Maximum profit, minimal expense. I've discovered many high quality brands that have their goods made ethically and away from China! They do not cost a lot more and I'm happy to support locally made. No I'm not rich. The problem is that big greedy companies have the marketing budget to promote their cheaply made crap and thus make it hard for smaller independent brands to compete. But we have reddit which has been super useful in discovering such independent brands.

text:Shitpost Saturday: Beauty is Pain	labels:Everyone knows that true beauty is inner beauty, so over the past year, I've really focused on psychological pain and suffering. My top three habits include:  - Putting on a cute outfit every day and wearing a full face of makeup so that I'm not only slightly uncomfortable all day, but I'm also reminded of the fact that I haven't seen another person in over 10 months, so no one cares what I look like.  - Every Saturday I make myself a cocktail and put on one of my formal dresses to reminds myself of how much weight I've gained since I last attended a fancy party.  - I cut my own bangs  I'm pretty sure I'm at the brink of a nervous breakdown, but my *soul* looks radiant over zoom.	episode_done:True

text:Do you feel the black Friday sales better or worse than usually this year? Is it worth to buy clothing you won't wear until next year?	labels:The sales are about the same as last year. The difference IMO is they’re starting earlier. I think you should only buy if you actually have a need or function for it.   I’ve bought the Sheertex tights so far. Looking forward to never having to replace these black tights ever again.  I’ve been in the market for a camel coat and black leather jacket for a couple years, but haven’t found the perfect one to pull the trigger on either yet. I may just save my money and buy Max Mara next year.
text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:I wear one statement item with simple, high-quality basics.

If you’ve got fit and quality right, your creativity looks classy. If it looks cheap or sloppy, then you’re more likely to get judged.	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday- Call for Submission	labels:\- Your clothes are ruined by a house fire, but you have no budget to replace them. Which charred scraps will you wear? Which singed item is now your favourite? Which molten accessory will you pair with your outfit?   \- Your new crush is only turned on by food. Which delicious, home cooked/prepped/baked outfit will you wear to seduce them? How does your outfit represent their food choices (chocolate addict, vegan, lactose intolerant)?   \- You are visiting your mother for a few days, but somehow your clothes got lost. Which items from her wardrobe will you wear? Do you end up looking like your mom or are you able to wear something that represents your own style? Bonus question: how would your mom like if the situation was reversed?   \- You get a last minute invitation to a party. The dresscode says only 'Christmas'. Alas, you do not own anything Christmas themed. What outfit can you come up with (using only non-Christmas themed items) that is still Christmas-y? Beginner level: it is winter. Expert level: it is summer.  \- Your friend(s)/colleague/whatever asks you to help them find an outfit. You thought they would never ask! This is your chance. What outfit do you think they would look great in? How different is it from their regular outfits? Why have they never thought of this themselves?   \- Society as we know it has changed. Nowadays, everyone on Earth wears the same, neutral outfit. The only way you can express your individuality is through your shoes. Which ones do you wear to represent your style, interests or personality? Which (hidden) message do they convey?

text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:Hot take: nothing is really original anymore, and most everything has been done before or inspired by someone or something else. For the luxury brand to automatically claim ownership simply because it's *designer* is bullshit imo.  We all know that quality differences will be present. A $3k coat isn't going to be on the same level as a $100 one. If someone wants to spend the extra money, cool. If someone likes the look but wants polyester instead and can only spend a lot less, cool. If the designer coat is really that great, there will be a market for it. If tons of people are buying the knockoff and no one is springing for the expensive version... Well, maybe you misjudged your market or overpriced your item.  I don't have a problem with knockoffs because they appeal to different crowds. Not everyone can afford a multi-thousand dollar handbag. Why should a struggling single mom who likes the design of something be relegated to a plain black bag? If she finds a similar style at Kohl's, she should be allowed to buy and enjoy it. I feel holding designer items as being superior, and then looking down on knockoffs, is classist. End of.
text:General Discussion - December 07, 2020	labels:Some wholesome news.

Our nups will be *toit*.  edit: thanks all :)  edit: also thanks all who asked about pronouns etc. I am A-ok with male pronouns, "dude", "my man" etc.
text:>crocs   Lol if you compare it with crocs I would definetly not get it...I am just trying to understand as to why people think it's not fashionable or dorky/nerdy? I am not saying it is or isn't, but I definetly don't want to come as this scinecy/bookwarm/fashionista type  and tbh I am not that bothered from sun, like I hate it sure, but never had a sunglass and never really complained, so technically I can buy prescription sunglasses, just want to know as to why so many people think it's nerdy/dorky exaclty	labels:Weird, I’ve also found them weird most of my life. I can’t quite describe why I think they’re dorky but I will say that most people I see wearing transitions just aren’t very fashionable people. To stereotype a bit, these people mostly fall under the dorky/nerdy types and tend to be older people as well.  Of course, it could simply be that people who like transition glasses tend to be less concerned about appearances and value functionality more. If you’re confident about your overall look, I don’t think transition glasses would look bad at all.   Now if you’re a so-so or horrible dresser, transition glasses become more of an eye sore.	episode_done:True

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.

text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:I’m not a saint - I am great about follow through when there’s also an detriment to me or when I feel “betrayed.” For example, if a brand is marketed as “high quality” and I pay premium (but not luxury/designer) prices and am disappointed by the quality, I am able to follow through on ditching the brand very well because of the financial detriment. Similarly, if a brand is “ethical” or particularly supportive of women and minorities and it turns out to abuse its employees, I feel more betrayed than say if I buy a pair of Nikes.  I do buy some fast fashion and non-ethical fashion but I like “knowing what I’m getting” so to speak. I think it’s the false pretenses and hypocrisy of well marketed but not actually ethical/wuality etc. brands that get to me and cause me to have a lasting bad taste.  To this day though, I buy a new pair of Nikes every year or so for my runs even knowing that they aren’t great ethically because the design, function and price are perfect for me. But I also feel like Nike doesn’t pretend or charge an overboard premium	episode_done:True

But, theyre seasonal - chances are that a few more will be released as Christmas and New Years get closer.
text:Formula for a put together outfit that works for most aesthetics	labels:I think this strongly depends on your natural features. E.g. I have an hourglass figure with noticeable boobs, so if I'm wearing something fitting it's already like 4 points, lol, even if it's a simple black dress. If I'd put 7 more "points" worth of accessorizes and stuff that would turn me into overly feminine very much in your face type of appearance. So I usually have my outfit - fairly simple but fitting, some makeup on the face, and everything else is a bit toned down, e.g. simple jewellery, maybe a pendant or earrings, simple hairdo, etc. If I had less prominent features, the "blank slate" model look I feel I could push further with adding scarves, bags, more jewellery, etc. But being curvy even red lips become kind of a provocation.	episode_done:True
text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:A well fitted black wool coat in a cut that flatters you. It goes with any outfit.

text:How to wear nice casual clothes with a cotton allergy?	labels:Have you tried looking for clothing made out of hemp or linen? You can find casual tshirts and whatnot that are 100% hemp fabric. You can also find causal shoes that are hemp (i have an older pair of Adidas that are 100% hemp fabric uppers). Plenty made out of leather as well.  Do you have a budget for clothes? A lot of companies that use these alternative materials are considered "premium" brands and carry their price tags accordingly.

text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain?

I can never understand why everyone says they're more comfortable than mid-rise jeans. And because it's in fashion, it's difficult for me to find a jean that looks good but isn't high waisted. Maybe it's because I was a teen in the 90s. I'm glad I'm not the only one!  And amen to the bra situation! I don't want to have to buy a new type of bra just so I can wear a certain type of shirt or dress.	episode_done:True

text:Has consulting a stylist really been a revelation to you?	labels:A few years ago i was feeling badly about myself following the end of a 4 year relationship. I decided to find a local personal shopper to go through my closet and help me decide what to keep/donate. She also provided me with ways to wear what i already had. From that, she created a list of things she thought i would need to add to my wardrobe according to my lifestyle and wants/needs. We then went to the mall a few days later and she brought in tons of things to try. The rule was that i had to show her everything, but i had the final say as to what i wanted to get. This was great because it also provided me with an opportunity to get more styling tips on items i don’t currently own but might consider moving forward.  Since then, i have felt so much more confident in how i dress and i constantly receive tons on compliments. I would 10/10 recommend this to anyone who wants to change their style or learn more about what looks best on them. I figured the $400 i spent on her was equivalent to how much money I’d spend on items i would never actually wear, and in the long run became an investment :).

text:[Inspo & Commentary] Rings	labels:Super interesting read. Appreciate the effort. Have saved links to anything that sounds up my alley and will be scoping them all out eventually. Can't have too much to choose from or too much inspiration.  The details about materials are cool too. I can't remember the name right now, but there was a company here in Aus that I was looking through and loving a bunch of years ago. They were aimed at men and produced rings in alt materials you don't normally see in mainstream jewelry. It was interesting cause the materials were the kinda stuff us dudes specifically might find intriguing. Alt metals like titanium where they burned in colour highlights like you see on high end aftermarket exhausts. And other stuff that's tough, totally overkill in terms of the strength of jewelry, normally used to create components etc. But they were interesting in that they had these industrial finishes, very matte and other non-metallic colours so they cut them in ways that could be geometric and have a totally different vibe etc.  I'll try track down who they were.	episode_done:True

text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I am a teacher that went back to working in the building at the beginning of September, so to be fair I was only wfh for several months in the spring, but it still drastically changed my style, or my perspective on my style.   Pre-Covid my work style (and general style) had morphed over the years to become very, very minimal and neutral. Lots of Everlane and Eileen Fisher. This was both because I wanted to be taken seriously at my job (I read very young) and because it also seemed like what was in style to me.   Returning to work in the fall, I realized I really f*cking hated all of my sensible, plain, go with everything black and grey clothes.   I still really prefer earth tones and blacks and greys, and I still wear some pretty simple outfits somedays, but I went on a small spree on The RealReal after I had my realization. I bought myself some louder statement pieces that feel more me, including an embroidered Happy Sheep sweater, a knit Missoni sheath dress, a multi-colored leather and fur purse, platform oxfords, and a couple of geometric patterned silk shirts and dresses.   For me life is too short to try so hard to be timeless and professional. I’m not knocking the look, it just isn’t ~me~ I want to love the clothes I wear and the clothes I love are fun knits and patterns.

text:How many handbags do you have and which one is your most used?	labels:I’ve recently downsized my collection but I still love bags, just have limited space and get decision fatigue! I have a lot of tote bags too that I’ve mostly been using lately. But yes I have five: one black everyday bag (Lo & Sons Pearl in saffiano leather), a straw bag with leather straps from J. Crew, a black croc shoulder bag (the Rachel from By Far), a vintage Coach cognac leather camera bag that used to be my mom’s and a small Chanel flap. The latter comes out only on special occasions, but my mom’s bag means more to me.	episode_done:True

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:I recently lived in Paris near some of the the biggest tourist attractions, and I would spot Instagram influencers daily. I’d say I’d see them change into heels about half the time. Some folks just commit, but it always stood out as unusual. Paris is not stiletto friendly. Although it’s seen as a formal city, compared to any American metropolis, footwear is casual and out wear is practical. That being said, a 2-3 inch heeled boot or bootie was not uncommon and along with sneakers, the norm.   My most memorable influencer sighting was a very glamorous woman in a tiny yellow dress and heels on a 40 degree (Fahrenheit) day taking pictures on a windy terrace, only to see her minutes later coming out of a public restroom in weather appropriate and casual attire.   I feel like this stuff is dependent on your own lifestyle, and the context of the city. My own comfort level with heels has changed significantly over the past decade, from wearing a heel everywhere, everyday to now owning one pair for parties.  As for non-heeled influencers: there are so many! What kind of style do you gravitative towards?

text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:It starts with your personal style. If you don’t have one or you don’t know what it is, than your shopping habits will show that.   What I used to do was take photos of myself wearing the clothes I liked that I already owned, and when I’d shop, I’d try on clothes and see if they were fitting in a way that would both accommodate my style and also the other clothes. It helped me choose clothing that wouldn’t go weeks together in terms of length. I also used to take photos of my closet so I could avoid buying things I may have forgotten about.	episode_done:True
text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:Oh man I frickin love hats. I feel like I see beanies all the time (doubt these will ever go out of style completely), and berets become popular every few years. Sun hats are kinda like beanies, I think they’re always in for the summer.   I wear beanies all the time in fall/winter and have quite the collection. I recently have gotten into berets. In the summer I have a few caps, but I don’t wear them as often as I do my beanies.   Personally, I keep my hats on everywhere. No one needs to see my hat hair.	episode_done:True

Even though I'm home all by myself and the only person who ever sees me is the Amazon delivery guy who I wait for by my window because *oh my god, I need human contact,* I'm still putting on a full face of makeup, doing my hair, and wearing spanx, a push-up bra, a sheath dress that fits like a second skin, 4" heels, and perfume.  I'm doing it for *me*, you know, because feeling sexy while I'm all by myself is much more important than being comfortable. Sure, it's easier to get coffee and cheeto stains out of my bathrobe than a 100% wool dress, but cheetos aren't sexy either.   For Christmas, Fashion Santa is going to bring me a brand new dress for every zoom event I have scheduled in 2021, because I would just die if people saw me wearing the same outfit week after week, which is definitely the kind of thing people are thinking about these days.
text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers. Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:I live in MN so practical artic weather gear is what I go for. Here’s my winter gear list with my opinions on it.  The North Face Chilkat boots- keep my feet warm even with thin socks on, also have great grip for ice and snow.   Columbia Lay D Down II coat- light weight but warm enough to wear in below zero weather, nice big pockets, but wish the hood had strings to adjust width. When I put the hood up on a windy day I can’t adjust it so it just gets blown back down.  Artix snow pants- warm and can take a beating, very durable. They have survived lots of sledding and other winter activities, and they keep me dry.	episode_done:True

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:Personally, I don't feel constrained because I feel like heels have kind of fallen out of style. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they're unstylish -- I just feel like nobody wears them and so I'm not drawn to buy any. I personally prefer sneakers on any outfit. And even if it's a fancy outfit I'll wear flats.	episode_done:True
text:This is the highest comment right now, so I just want to point out to other casual jewelry owners that fine jewelry holds value. It's highly unlikely that freshwater pearls you buy at retail are going to resell at a similar price, vs AAA Akoya pearls.  >Goes to show how easy it is to farm them  Farmed pearls aren't as valuable as natural pearls - similar to natural vs synthetic (aka lab) diamonds. The rarity of a natural pearl drives/retains its value.  >if you're savvy about how to shop and willing to compromise on quality, these items are all affordable.  This... really confuses me in a thread about investment grade jewelry. Store of value investments typically don't suddenly become more affordable; they aren't considered sound investments if this is the case. (There are exceptions, like copper, whose value is tied to demand for construction, but that's different than gems.) This statement is like trying to claim you can buy a blue chip stock on sale. Happens with recessions or a major event, but the majority of the time it can be counted on as a stable store of value.	labels:Fine jewelry really does not hold its value, I certainly wouldn't say (as a jeweler) that "the majority of the time it can be counted on as a stable store of value". Buying jewelry as an investment is like buying a car as an investment. You aren't going to get anywhere close to a full return on it unless it's a particularly rare or sought-after piece, which is the vast majority of cases. You might get what the materials are worth but that's going to be notably less than the retail value you paid. This is especially true for diamonds, which are relatively abundant and artificially marked up. Other gemstones like emerald, ruby, and sapphire hold their value better but even then, unless you have a truly remarkable one I wouldn't hold your breath about seeing a return on it.	episode_done:True
text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:The clothes on the runway are designed to represent, as closely as possible, the idea and sentiment that the designer is using to inspire the new line.  It's analogous to the Platonic ideal. Because the ideas can be so abstract, so too must the clothes. In fact, you can think of it as a series of progressive dilutions, from the designer's mind, to the runway, and then to the clothes that you wear in your day-to-day.

text:The wildest thing to me is that Madewell has really consistent sizing and I'm able to order online with confidence about what will fit. I have ordered a bunch of things and haven't needed to return or exchange a single one. By the end of last year, J. Crew was the most inconsistent sizing of any brand I think I've ever encountered. I could take 15 items of the same size into a dressing room and all 15 of them would fit like shit in totally different ways. It means online shopping is essentially unavailable to me - in this economy, no less. They've maintained those price points while spiraling out re: their supply chain.	labels:I feel like JCrew *used* to be more consistent. I used to have faith that a size 6 Perfect Shirt was, indeed, a perfect fit for me. I owned three of them in white alone. That hasn't been the case in recent years, and it's a shame.   Besides inconsistent fit, there's also just been some bizarre merchandizing decisions. Last March, right before all this (gestures at 2020) went down, I went into a JCrew looking for work pants. I did not find a *single pair of full length pants.* I mean, I can understand gearing up for spring, but ... no pants? at all? Some decisions just don't make sense.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 11, 2020	labels:How do Artisan Lab Essential's profile compare to CP? Seems like side-by-side comparison photos for these are pretty hard to find.  I already have Greats Royale which is decidedly chunkier than CP, and I'm hoping to get a pair of white sneakers in slimmer profile similar to CP.  Kind of considering Beckett Simonon but I'd prefer having actual lace guards instead of BS's more minimal "holes on a plain sheet of leather" look. Also would prefer smoother looking leather than BS's leather with visible pores (not sure if they're pores, but similar texture to orange peel).  In the end, Artisan Lab seems the closest barring CP, although AL's heel part doesn't look as good as CP imo. I think that's worth sacrificing for a cheaper price, but if they're visibly chunkier than CPs, then I may as well just pay that CP premium (although I'm never paying full price lol)	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I started in 2017 and just finished this year and I am very happy with how my closet looks now!  First, I got rid of everything. I was transitioning from a cheap college wardrobe to a semi-professional one (I teach kids). I wanted to strip my closet down to the bare bones, keeping only what I truly wanted, and then building on top of what I had. I did a Marie Kondo type thing, almost. I kept a few things that were of higher quality or that I really liked, and donated the rest.  Then I got the absolute basics: a few neutral blouses, jeans and black pants, replaced some of my most worn out shoes that "went with everything." Then I built from there.  After that, then came the dirty work. Hours upon hours of Pinterest-ing, reading style books, saving money every month and then teaching myself to be ok with spending that money, successful and unsuccessful shopping trips, plenty of thrifting, scouring online sales, swapping with friends, cataloging everything and building outfits via the app StyleBook. I did a lot of online shopping this year and there were some truly awesome sales so I was able to truly round out my closet for much of this year. I finally have it in a good spot.  My style skews very classic and preppy and timeless, so a lot of what I have in my closet will be in style for years. I couldn't be more happy with how it looks; it's easily mixed and matched and because I spent over three years building it slowly, much of it is also tailored and bought thoughtfully. I will add little things here and there, but for now, and for the first time ever, I am content with it!	episode_done:True

text:Feeling self-conscious with changing style around family - anyone relate? Tips?	labels:My family always comments on what I wear if it’s not super casual. My dad will comment if it’s revealing and my mom will comment if it’s fancier than the occasion calls for. And usually this will be done with a sarcastic question like “where are you going?” or similar when obviously I am not going anywhere because we are quarantined, and heaven forbid I decide to put on a nice outfit to boost my mood. I’m lucky that my family is at least a real-pants-in-quarantine family. If I couldn’t even wear jeans without getting a comment, I’d be sad.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else always hesitate to buy what they truly love because they don't have a social life?	labels:Outside of Covid,  I am perfectly happy to wear fancier than necessary clothes to work out while running errands.    What I really want and can't justify is a floor length formal gown. I don't think I have ever gone to a black tie event.  Why don't people have fancy parties anymore????? I just want to wear a ball gown once a year,  is that too much to ask?
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:My advice is to notice what people around you are wearing.  Take notes!  Are you in school?  Glance around the classroom to get ideas.  Do you have a job?  Are your coworkers wearing mostly jeans, or something else?  You can balance that with what you see on pinterest.  I was in a similar boat in that my family was super poor growing up, so I just had to wear whatever was given to me.  It took me a while to figure out what to buy, I would end up in situations where everyone else would be dressed one way and I would be dressed another -- like, say, wearing jeans and a sweater while everyone else was in dressier attire.  It also helps to notice what you find yourself wearing a lot.  For example, if you start with two pairs of shoes, heels and sneakers, and you notice you wear your sneakers way more, then you've learned: you should own more sneakers than heels.	episode_done:True

text:Handbag conundrum: lesser know (and lesser seen all over the place) or standard luxury designer bags (think the usual Gucci, YSL, LV, etc.)	labels:Definitely buy what makes you happy. The fact that you have looked at the high end, well known brands and came away disappointed indicates that (this season at least), they aren't for you.   To answer your question directly: for me, personally, showing my own style is 1000% more important than showing the status of a luxury brand. Do the two sometimes overlap? Yes, and that's fine. But I don't personally get buying something *just* because it is a certain brand. Who are you trying to impress? What are you conveying with that logo (wow, you're well off? What kind of message is that, on its own?) I just feel like people who are super into labels, not the design or the style or anything else, just come across as kind of immature? The truth is, anyone worth spending much time with isn't overly concerned with what logo your bag has. (Now! I will concede there is a difference between showing off luxury brands and having higher end items, in some circles. Like, there could be some tension if you're hanging out with super millionaire socialites and everything you wear is from TJ Maxx...but in that case, I'd still say its important to focus on personal style first. And knowing about smaller higher end designers, rather than designers you can buy at a mall, is a whole different thing too...)

I try for all three and manage about a third of the time (second hand item from an ethical producer that looks right and fits). For other things I give up on one, i.e. raincoat that fits the first two categories but is new and therefore £££, or underwear that doesn't fit great but is ethical and moderately priced.      On the plus side, in theory they'll last longer than an item made to a lower standard, so less time spent buying in the long run.     You don't need to be in love with the item for it to be the right one though. It's nice when that's the case, but for many things lowering the bar a bit to functional+ethical is probably more achievable.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 08, 2020	labels:Yesterday we had in here a brief discussion on the potential impending resurgence of square toes (niche designers -> celebs -\*> big designers -> fast fashion -> regular people).  (\*you are here). Lurkers gonna be *mad*.  Upon reflection it really highlighted to me how downright insane the discourse of 10-years-ago-MFA was. Taking the square toes as examples, we had all this "teaching material" about how they were wrong, unflattering and just an all around horrible idea. With the implication that the people who make and wear square toe shoes simply don't know what they are doing.  Yeah, right. The people running one of *the* most profitable and most competitive markets simply didn't know that square toes "don't flatter your foot". They needed randos on the internet to find that out. *Insane*.
text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:IT depends on you.  What is your lifestyle (be realistic)?  When determining this, keep your area's climate in mind as well as your workplace (or school) dress code.  Also know your hobbies because a hiker is going to need vastly different attire than someone who likes clubbing.  IF your work environment is casual, then you don't need a closet full of business formal clothing.  If your workplace requires a uniform, then you don't need a wardrobe full of work clothes (unless the uniform is a dress code like black pants/white shirt).    If you're living in Miami, then you likely don't need a down parka.    That said, no matter your lifestyle, I'd have one outfit in your closet (could be the same thing or separates) to wear to a job interview, wedding (guest, not wedding party), and funeral.  Be prepared ahead of time should those occasions arise.    My other recommendation to learn color theory and the color seasons.   If you are unsure, try and find a celebrity that has similar coloring to you and study their wardrobe and what colors they wear on red carpets.  Know what colors look good on you and which ones do not.   I'm a clear winter, so my colors are jewel tones, icy pastels, and crisp colors.  Muted tones like olive, khaki, mustard, off white, etc look terrible on me.	episode_done:True

text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:Just dropping in to say that I find it funny that a 14 year old is afraid of looking older than their actual age. When I was 14, all I wanted to do was to look like a college freshman. People look down their noses at teenagers, (especially teenage girls) and so I tried to fake maturity and experience, because I thought it would be beneficial to me. But then again! I only enjoyed my early twenties for a few blissful years, after which I discovered that I should apparently be grateful for stuff like getting carded (ohmygawd you guys, I'm so happy this stranger thinks I look too young to be legally drinking!!). So I actually get that someone would panic at 14 years of age, if they were aware of the small window of time in which women are allowed to feel satisfied with their looks.   However, there's no way someone is going to mistake you for being in your 20's just because you're dressing "old". You could dress like a truly old woman complete with all the muted/pastel colors, curly short hair, and kitten heels you desire - people would just think you have alternative style.   The reason some people worry about dressing old, is because once you hit your mid-20's, people start aging at much different rates than they did before. So, 35 year old woman could be mistaken as someone in their early 40's who just looks good for their age, because of styling alone. But you are way too young to be worrying about this.   And dark academia isn't even an old-ish style - it reads as slightly naive (mostly in a good way) to most people who actually went to university. In fact this look has more to do with private schools than uni.	episode_done:True

text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I've never been interested in anything home related (to the point where I will likely never own a home, by choice) as I spent every weekend of my childhood on some home project.  Enough is enough!  While I'm now WFH (so what I wear does not matter) I've noticed that fashion as of late is simply butt ugly.  The oversized boxy neutral aesthetic is just blah to me.  THe last time I really liked some of the trends was around 2014-16 when things like skater dresses/skirts (you know things that actually had a shape to them that was not a paper bag).    Now the trends remind me of that scene in The Little Mermaid when Ariel first becomes a human and they dress her up in an old beige sail and make it fashion.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:>I've started to notice a trend which I can only describe as 'no substance' and how this has become more and more common  YES and it's not just in fashion, but blogs and vlogs in general. So many blogs are exactly the same, it's like they're all just copying each other. So many posts are just ads. I don't mean they *have* ads, I mean the entire post is just an ad for something.  I can only assume they've witnessed other influencers' success and are trying to replicate that for themselves. They don't understand most OG influencers worked for years to add value and build a following before they ever saw a cent. They're trying to skip to the end by following proven formulas and packing their content with as many ads as possible. That's my theory, anyways.	episode_done:True
text:Can You Wear a T-Shirt Under a Blazer and Not Look Like an 1980s Leftover?	labels:This look working is dependent on a couple of things. The fit of the shirt and the jacket has to be on point. The fabric of the t-shirt should be higher-end cotton or similar material, can't be your run of the mill t-shirt. Most importantly though is the person wearing it, you've gotta be in shape to pull this look off or you look like a sloppy neckbeard.	episode_done:True

I’m losing weight (retail workout/anxiety diet) and my taste is getting really forest gothy. I don’t have time or energy to sew right now but I have dyed a lot of my fancy fabrics black and hung them all up. I love seeing all the tonal and texture variations.

text:I feel one of the issues is that in this subreddit we have:  1.  A group of people who genuinely want to know why people make large purchases (people just getting into fashion, hearing about spending more to get better quality leather/materials). I was in this group for a while.  2. A group of people who are looking for the absolute cheapest way to get into fashion, they often take pride in getting things for cheap and some even get a sense of superiority for getting the same look without spending as much as "suckers" who buy designer fashion.  3. Hobbyists who have the money to spend on exact items they want.   I genuinely think that one of the issues that causes people to butt heads in this subreddit is when the hobbyists feel they need to justify their purchases when confronted with the question "why?"  Getting the exact item they have searched for is a valid enough reason, and trying to invent other reason to "justify" a purchase often causes confusion for people who are trying to get involved in fashion and are genuinely asking "why is this item worth it?" When I first was looking for new footwear, the number of times I was told that $500 boots were worth it because how long they would last was absurd.	labels:>when the hobbyists feel they need to justify their purchases when confronted with the question "why".  Agreed. It's this justification that I think is ultimately pointless, even after explaining all the little details that make it special.	episode_done:True

text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:I think start by looking at pictures online on Pinterest or Instagram of styles you find aesthetically pleasing and create a little dashboard with outfits that catch your eye. You can also think about some of your favourite actors or singers that wear outfits you like and try to save the pictures you find. After that i would go window-shopping online on websites that fit your budget and look around trying to find pieces similar to any outfits you saw. fyi; i would browse on a website first and then go to the actual store to try out what you saw online, it gives you an idea of what you’re looking for.  I think imitation is the easiest way to start finding your style. Once your comfortable in a type of style you can start experimenting with it and picking more personalized pieces. Good luck :)

text:What clothing items have you reverted back to since WFH/quarantine?	labels:I've really been embracing dressing more youthful. I'm in my early/mid 20s, and now that I've worked a couple years at the same place, I'm wearing more what I want than boring professional. I also started caring about what I wear and planning my outfits. Velvet shoes, corduroy overalls, rainbow prints, sequins, bold colors. Who cares? I've been called out for dressing "fancy" before, but I've stopped giving a shit in correlation with my confidence in my abilities. I'm a teacher...if anything, I'm showing the students it's okay to be yourself and take risks.

The faux leather ended up “peeling off” or something like that.

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Zara | January 30, 2021	labels:2012 through about 2014 I was out of college, unemployed for stretches, underemployed for others, and underpaid for the rest. After being unemployed post-college in 2012 and living with my parents, and then my entire annual income in 2013 was about $13,000 while I was living on my own, and somewhere around $20,000 in 2014. I had some freelance gigs here and there where I could pull in $500 or $1000 bucks outside my reported income, but I was ostensibly "living in poverty" for a few years.  Zara was honestly kind of a godsend in that period, I needed somewhat fashionable clothing but had basically no money to spend on it. I work in the contemporary art world and dressing well is literally part of my job. While Zara isn't exactly highly respected, I was able to get some decent looking clothing on the cheap.  Today I find it easy to criticize Zara, whether it's the stolen designs, or the fast fashion model, or the inconsistent sizing, the sweatshop labor, and so on, but I admit that for a moment in my life they were a really useful utility. When I didn't have money for clothes but I needed decent looking clothes, Zara was one of the best options available to me. There's a lot of better options in the world if you have time and money, as I do now, but I'd be a hypocrite to ignore the benefit they provided me when I had neither time nor money.  Also while they're not exactly a "buy it for life" brand, their clothes didn't fall apart on me either, so, I'll give them props for that. Everything lasted an appropriate amount of time for the price.

If your suit is hot pink or darker - I love mustard and bright pink. It is a really fun combo. Green is pretty classic. As is grey. Cobalt blue can be nice with a saturated pink. You could do tone on tone with another pink top.

That way I can see if it actually looks good on people who aren’t tall and thin or if it’s one of those things where it’s designed specifically for that fashion model body type.

My father is ironically a fine artist, that’s how we live as a family, Off his art. I’ve grown up knowing the work, dedication and talent you have to have even to even make a living off fashion.

Dm me tell me what you think.	labels:A lot of people live and breathe fashion and say it's all the think about. One of the downsides of an industry that is also a hobby for many, is that there is no shortage of people who desperately want to work in it. That means that: 1.) there is an oversupply of applicants; 2.) it can be a race to the bottom just to get in (unpaid internships, low wages); and 3.) your passion is not enough to get by.   Good luck on your future, and always remember that a job is still a job. And sometimes, it's worse when it's also your hobby.   If your dad is the first result for Liepke then I actually follow him on IG and really admire his art.

It was always exciting when something fit someone else better than the original owner. I still have several pieces from those swaps.   Now that we’ve scattered across the country, I haven’t done a big swap in a while but when I’m cleaning out my closet, I do occasionally set aside an item or two that I know a friend would love or look great in. I know a few things have even been handed down to friends of friends - especially a lot of first office job clothes I bought at H&M that have made their way through 3 or 4 people now.	episode_done:True
text:I've taken 566 outfit photos over 4 years (my style from mid-20s to 30)	labels:Thank you for making so much effort to document your relations to fashion. The mark that you have left for others will ripple into the way all of your readers will spend time with their own style. It means a lot to me to see someone who cares about where there clothing is sourced and that their habits related to shopping were not always perfect. This was relatable. Inspiring.  Also, your messy hair is always so chic. Your outfits seem to tell a composed and thoughtfulness that you don't see on fashion models or bloggers. This was truly great. Bravo.  Also, if I may ask where your black jeans are from in the second photo of 2020 going left to right. I saw you linked a boot cut pair from NA-KD. Are these the same?	episode_done:True

text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Poshmark might work well for you once you find your ideal clothing measurements. Good sellers will either list measurements in the listing, or will gladly measure the clothing for you if you ask. This is awesome because you are getting the measurements of the EXACT item of clothing.   If you find a piece of clothing that fits well, you can use that as a baseline measurement for similar styles. For example, if I have some dresses that are a perfect length, or shorts that fit perfect in the hips, etc, I’ll search for similar brands or shapes and try to match the size and measurements of the item I have at home.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:I think you have to have one element that “fits.”  Like of you have the oversized thing, pick one thing that fits a little slimmer (e.g a straight pant over a wide pant).   Or make sure the shoulder fits for that oversized top - vs a drop shoulder - if the whole outfit is looser.   I also think you can be intentional about revealing a little bit of well chosen skin. Wrists, ankles, calves, collarbone. So you are not just overwhelmed by fabric.   And of course you can always just wear what you want and not worry about it.	episode_done:True

text:I think it has a little to do with it! A lot of teenagers can only really afford to thrift/buy fast fashion.  Whereas now that millennials are getting older, we ofc have to buy more professional clothing, but we also have the funds to buy clothes and accessories made out of better quality fabrics and materials. I think wearing polyester vs cashmere sweaters makes a big difference in style   Def not saying one is better than the other and that ALL millennials spend a lot of money on clothes, but it’s def a trend	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:So, look, I don't want to tell you _not_ to do this, but if I've understood correctly you're looking at creating a bloodborne-inspired victorian/traditional wardrobe. There are elements of that style that have mainstream appeal today, high-waisted wool trousers being one example. However, when you take them in context with the more "interesting" elements you picked out it gives off serious cosplay vibes. Perhaps you should take the fact that the only places offering this sort of clothing are Etsy/cosplay stores as a hint that you should reconsider this idea.  You might be thinking, _what about the cyber goth vampire Rick Owens fits I see on this sub?_ It's a valid question. The key difference is that the style you're going for here has _such_ a strong association with cosplay and videogames and so little mainstream appeal that the number one association people are going to make is that you are cosplaying. Doubly-so if you're wearing cosplay-quality clothes from cosplay vendors. While the Rick Owens aesthetic may not have mainstream appeal it _is_ very accepted within fashion circles and _doesn't_ have that strong cosplay association.  So with that said my advice is to take what you've got and tone it down. Treat it like a high-fashion runway show and take inspiration from it instead of trying to recreate it 1:1. High-waisted trousers, great. Gaiters? Maybe just get some actual boots. Bloodborne-style woolen collars/scarves/hooded shawls? Wear a regular scarf that has an interesting shape or texture, or a shirt with a more exaggerated collar. Maybe the fact that you can't find retailers selling this kind of stuff is the limitation you need to make it work in the real world.  Or maybe I'm just talking complete shite and someone smarter than me can help you more. I hope that I've at least broken the ice and said what needed to be said so that people can try to constructively help you.

text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:I love love the concept of "Capsule wardrobes". Maybe other people find it restricting but I find it liberating. I get easily overwhelmed with too many choices (I also tend to feel guilty when I see a piece I haven't worn for a long time like I wasted my money and that it is harmful for the environment). I have put an effort in buying less but buying a quality piece (for the environment ya know) so all I need is 20 pieces of clothing.  I usually include a couple of trendy pieces. a leather jacket. a fur jacket. a nice tan color wool jacket. another beige wool jacket. 2-3 high-waisted trouser/tailored-pants. 1 denim jean. 1 white blouse. Sometimes I include dresses and skirts depend on the season. I usually don't include skirts and dresses though because they are not as versatile but I tend to keep a beige silk wrap skirt.  Since I own less, I am able to care for each item more. Each piece is very loved.	episode_done:True

About $1500 gone.

text:A Vontade Fall/Winter 2020	labels:Standouts here are definitely the trousers. So many nice textures
text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it’s typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it’s a bottom, they no longer “stay up”. This usually happens with leggings or panties after about 5 or more years of regular wear with caring for the items properly.  I also had a faux leather jacket wear out after 6 years of regular wear. The faux leather ended up “peeling off” or something like that.

text:Thank all of you	labels:I'm so glad you were able to experience well-fitting shoes!  Allen Edmonds used to be the default recommendation back on MFA and GoodyearWelt, but they've fallen by the wayside in favour of places like Meermin which offer more absolute value.   One thing that I think people really don't take into account though is how vital AE's customer service is for someone just getting into good dress shoes – they're not going to have a good understanding of how a dress shoe should fit, and the staff at AE are really great at getting that across as well as finding the right size.  Once someone has gotten some experience, then they're more equipped to try better value brands with an online-only or foreign presence. But that initial guidance is critical and in my opinion, worth the "premium" that AE charges over Meermin

text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:I have clothes divided by sections of "cold" and "warm", then within that group they're color coded (rainbow) and within each colour subgroup they're divided by lenght. I do believe some prefer it better to be sorted by lenghts over colour, but I ahve too many clothes.  The exception are (foldable) tops and jumpers, which I seasonally store away in vacuum bags, and seasonal boxes for elaborate tights. It was a forced decision because I've "ran out" of space (more like, my mother did, so she occupied my wardrobe's top shelves against my will).  I am reasonably strict, because while I'm quite an organised person, I'm also quite messy (they're not the same) and I have too many clothes. So if I facilitate in any way, my wardrobe becomes an absolute war zone. It has happened too many times.  As for dirty clothing, I usually don't wear summer tops more than once because I sweat a lot. When I do wear them more than once, I place the hangar backwards. Everything backwards and jumpeers are washed at the end of a season, then either hung back or stored away.	episode_done:True

text:What am I supposed to do with my head post-chemo?	labels:I have straight hair and usually wear it in an undercut with the sides pretty short, or I use a side part. Depending on your line of work and your confidence a good felt hat can do wonders. I wear a Stetson Stratoliner with a cattleman crease and a flattened brim. Looks a lot like a Stetson Open Road. They are smaller than a cowboy hat, and can look good with a variety of clothing from jeans and a tshirt up to and including a suit.	episode_done:True
text:Fashion Favorites	labels:I absolutely love funky button down shirts! The sillier the print probably the better. It's a new love from last year that I now have flamingos, lobsters in sunglasses, dinosaurs, and plant shirts among others already that I wear all the time to work and I just would love more.. I was just daydreaming of where to find more options on another tab actually.. I'm really short though so I've been shopping in the little boys section. Tuck one of those bad boys into a nice pair of pants or longer skirt and I'm living my modern Mrs. Frizzle dream.   Also love bell bottoms! Those are hard to find though for people under 5ft. lol

I used to overload my suitcase with special pieces or statement pieces, and I would wear them once each (if that). It took me a long time to realize that, for me, a trip is not the time to use unique pieces. I need combine-able things that look cohesive.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:As someone who makes a decent amount of money casually flipping niche designers, it's become a bit of an arms race of bots/scrapers/market data warehousing for finding true steals.   Focusing on one or two designers (monobrand4lyfe) and learning the market well enough to flip items and pay for your retail purchase of what you _actually_ want is almost more reliable than hoping you find what fourteen seasons past item in your size in good condition.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:Clothing doesn’t fit most people off the rack.  Each brand has a fit model and proportions in mind that likely do not match you.  Clothes should fit you. You shouldn’t need to mold yourself to fit them. So with that in mind - find ways and places to get the fit adjusted to suit you.   1. The way if fits off the rack isn’t the end all of the fit journey - tailoring is your friend. Many things can be adjusted to fit you and your proportions  2. Figure out what you want to accentuate and deaccentuate.  This will guide you on to shapes to start with as a base.  3. Some brands will be a lot closer to fitting you than others.  And one brand that works for pants might be terrible for shirts and vice versa. Trial and error is important.  4. Find a body twin to get inspiration from.	episode_done:True
text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I'm a fan of combining bold pieces with more bold pieces. They say less is more, but I believe the inverse is true too: more is less. Meaning that when a piece feels like it's "too much," it can often help to add other "too much" pieces to balance it out and create a more intentional look.   The pink suit would rock with a base layer in red, light pink, tan/brown, or even a print or stripe if the mood strikes.
text:Is anyone dressing up this year for Halloween?	labels:I’ll be Princess Leia (again). I have a great costume from a work Star Wars event that I look forward to wearing.

We’re really lucky to have nice weather today when it’s often pouring rain.

text:Yeah it takes a little effort but a polo can work. I've been wearing them a lot lately for work from home since the collar is enough to make people think I'm not just lounging in my PJs but more comfortable than a button-down.

Joel with the really cool tonal look and signature flares, and Kunle with a bold power play wearing neon pink shoes with a suit and I LOVE it.

I just recently purchased two pairs of clay earrings from a local ceramic artist at our farmers market, however, I’ve already dropped and shattered one of them already.  Every clay set of jewelry (earrings and pendant necklace) I’ve ever owned has eventually broken - baring this last set of yellow earrings I’m now handling with extreme care.  They are beautiful and I’ll probably buy more because I love this girl’s work, but I just have to know going into it that this is not something I’ll most likely be able to keep forever and pass on, so I keep that in mind regarding price when purchasing them.	episode_done:True

I would recommend Asket if not for the fact you wanted a grey hoodie.

They have historically done a lot of contract work for more fashion forward houses like Trussardi.      While " the death of the suit" may rightfully be cheered on, Zileri and some of these other brands offer  tailoring that very much defies the norm of stiff fused navy blue uniforms, instead offering  beautiful patterns, textures, fabrics and detailing along with very craft oriented construction.   I hope these brands and the craftsmen behind them will endure.	episode_done:True

I didn’t mean to imply otherwise.  I picked ‘normal’ to differentiate from all the instagram models and fashion models I follow on Instagram. Not that they’re abnormal, but they do have body measurements that are out of the norm statistically. I once read some data that said typical model measurements can only be found in <0.1% of the population.  Secondly, as you mentioned, there’s the other factor of airbrushing, perfect/professional posing, light etc. that is also special to typical Instagram models.

text:General Discussion - January 03, 2021	labels:Done a lot of thinking about my wardrobe and the amount of clothes I own and I think I’m gonna go through and pick a bunch of clothes to donate tonight.   I think it’s time I let the thrifting and g r a p h i c t e e life go for a bit. I own way too many band shirts and shit that I just don’t wear anymore. I need to suck it up and start investing in my wardrobe to get it to a place I want it to be instead of buying a ton of shitty bandaids for 8 bucks a pop at thrift stores. Time to be a big boy and learn to go for a few expensive pieces instead of a ton of cheap ones.   Wish me luck lads.
text:What are your go-to basic fall tops? I’m talking long sleeve tees, sweatshirts, turtlenecks etc!	labels:I'm not sure Aritzia and Reformation quality is what you're looking for.

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:> This would not be such a problem except the outfits they are posting oftentimes do not look good without heels, especially for people that are short like themselves! Midi skirts that hit at an awkward spot, long billowy trousers, etc.  This may sound like blasphemy, but I'm a genuine shortarse and I wear *both flats and heels* with those things. And usually lower, blockier heels because I don't want to break my face on the pavement.   If I could take a decent selfie I would be all about that fashion blogger in flats life. Alas.	episode_done:True

text:Reigning Champ - Construction Quality of Pima Jersey T Shirt vs. American Giant	labels:That's not fraying lol.  They're literally fuzzing up because of the extra long staple pima cotton.  The reigning champ one looks more like a standard cotton fabric, usually made with a blend of short and long staple cottons.  Both are good quality but if you wanted the qualities of pima cotton, well, there you go. Plus "finer" quality fabrics are often worse in terms of durability. This sub has a serious issue with quality =/= durability.	episode_done:True
text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I am a teacher that went back to working in the building at the beginning of September, so to be fair I was only wfh for several months in the spring, but it still drastically changed my style, or my perspective on my style.   Pre-Covid my work style (and general style) had morphed over the years to become very, very minimal and neutral. Lots of Everlane and Eileen Fisher. This was both because I wanted to be taken seriously at my job (I read very young) and because it also seemed like what was in style to me.   Returning to work in the fall, I realized I really f*cking hated all of my sensible, plain, go with everything black and grey clothes.   I still really prefer earth tones and blacks and greys, and I still wear some pretty simple outfits somedays, but I went on a small spree on The RealReal after I had my realization. I bought myself some louder statement pieces that feel more me, including an embroidered Happy Sheep sweater, a knit Missoni sheath dress, a multi-colored leather and fur purse, platform oxfords, and a couple of geometric patterned silk shirts and dresses.   For me life is too short to try so hard to be timeless and professional. I’m not knocking the look, it just isn’t ~me~ I want to love the clothes I wear and the clothes I love are fun knits and patterns.

text:I want to be that bada*** biCTH (Ik it's spelt wrong, it's meme bro lol sry. Plus idk if we can swear, I don't post) tl;dr at the end cuz I tend to rant :)	labels:I'll start with #2. I started shopping for my own clothes around 16/17 . My family don't really care what clothes I buy with my money as long as my closet wasn't bursting at the seams.  I sometimes get the "are you really going to wear that/buy that" when they see me in something new. I remember buying a pair of wide legged, long jeans, and wearing sports bras as tops. Maybe it's because they saw how happy and comfortable I was in them that they didn't try to put me down for wearing stuff like that. What I buy is with my own money anyways, which does give me more confidence in some ways and probably helps them accept it too.  I know you mentioned ripped jeans -- I know some ripped jeans can cost, like, $150-$300 a pair. My advice would be to buy it with your own income (if that's possible, I know you aren't even 18/21 yet) and purchase things that you want to wear AND feel confident in wearing. It really sucks to spend money on items that sit around collecting dust.  My story with #3 is that people around me are either 1. creative energy or 2. dress with a similar vibe to me. I try to play a game -- if I'm going out in something "basic"/very messy, it's to blend in and likely not to talk to anyone that day. If I'm going out in something I love wearing, it's because I love it and I want to share it with the world. So I welcome the stares (and the questions). I try to match what I'm wearing to a purpose or mindset for that day. I value my own productivity more than how I'm being judged for something so shallow: my outfit. So my advice would be to find a purpose for what you're wearing, a purpose that is strong and way more important than how others might judge your outfit.  Honestly, I found that finding and building my style (which is really just a collection of stuff I will wear often) was a combination of having some financial independence and buying pieces that I loved to wear. Best of luck to you!	episode_done:True

text:Well, but bespoke tailors can do anything. They all have a house style, and maybe the Haute Couture brands do something a given house won't replicate, but unless theres' something really unique happening, you'll probably be able to find *some* house that can make you at least as happy. Probably.  The real issue with Bespoke is just the amount of time it takes.	labels:In theory, but I suspect that the number of bespoke tailors who are 1) willing to do fashion-forward contemporary designs, 2) able to understand the 'source code' and styling of those designs well enough to capture the details of what makes a particular piece special, and 3) able to procure the exact materials needed to do so is likely vanishingly small in practice.  I've seen examples on fashion fora of people asking bespoke tailors -- even talented ones -- to replicate designer stuff, and the results are usually a poor approximation.	episode_done:True

text:As I wait to hear if I have to evacuate due to CA wildfires, here’s a hypothetical I had to do: you have time to prepare before your evacuation and pack up your car. What clothes do you bring and why?	labels:Last year, we had to evacuate in the middle of the night with almost no notice. I was in charge of the basic necessities and while I had plenty of clothes and things for my son (5mo at the time), I just randomly grabbed an armful of clothes from the closet for my husband and I, and for some reason the entire contents of my husband’s sock drawer. I forgot to bring him any pants, but I brought every sock he owns. 🤦🏼‍♀️ So... it’s a great exercise to think of all this before you have to evacuate lol (ETA: also in CA, we couldn’t go home for a few days but our house and our stuff were thankfully fine)	episode_done:True

Maybe start by looking at what you find yourself picking out of your current wardrobe for casual days and days you feel like dressing up and see how you would want those styles to evolve since you’re a young adult now! I follow a lot of fashion you tubers as well and there’s a variety of trendy (bestdressed)/minimalist(Gemary)/ grunge(Sarah Hawkinson)/tomboy(madeyoulooks) style channels.

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:Honestly, I feel like the best way to be sustainable is to just buy less. I try not to buy much and attempt to not buy from companies that seem particularly egregious, and I do thrift, but I’m also still paying off student loans and hardly raking in the cash.  Is it better to buy your one shirt every 3 years from a sustainable brand that treats its workers well? For sure! But I’m typing this my iPhone with a Macbook in front of me and to be honest, so are a lot of people that claim to only shop ethically. Do what you can, absolutely, but let’s not let perfect be the enemy of good.
text:What's the greatest length you've gone to obtain a much coveted fashion item?	labels:When I was in middle school, I saw a sweater on a fashionable outfits Twitter page. I reverse googled the image to find it came from a shop in the UK (I’m in the US). Forgot about conversion and I ended up paying over $60 just for the sweater, not including shipping. My parents were so angry I spent all the money I had on one single clothing item but I still have the sweater about 10 years later and it continues to be a staple item

text:Why 14k vs 22k?	labels:Some reasons could be:   Gold is a soft metal. 22k gold will become damaged easier. Usually more important factor for rings that are worn everyday. In some countries, jewelry is made 14 or 10k gold. Some people prefer the color of 14k to 22k. The color difference is the other metals added to the jewelry.	episode_done:True
text:How do we feel about see-through totes?	labels:I work in a pharmacy and am not allowed to bring anything in unless it's see through so these may actually work well for me in this circumstance!

I don't see men getting hassled for the amount of electronic waste their hobbies produce.   I doubt every fifth post in the Funko Pop subreddit is about curbing consumption and how they should be rethinking their involvement in a plastics based interest.   Personally, I think they're wasteful as shit, but I'm not about to roll up into their space and shame them for it.  I'm so over the handwringing, guilt, and joylessness about fashion in this sub sometimes.

text:I partially agree with you. But the company still benefit from second hand purchases.   The second hand price is based on supply/demand, buying the unethical brand even second hand shows demand and increase public perception of the brand then prices go up. That’s why some brands are still more expensive than others even in thrift store.  Yet if you like an unethical brand, like you said, buying second hand is better.	labels:It depends on where you shop. Your local charity thrift shop is not giving a kickback to the first buyer, but a consignment store is.
text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:The present always feels “neutral”. I think if you watch any reality show from the early 2010s, even as late as 2014-15, you’ll see a big difference from what was considered “no defining silhouette” then. things like just a tshirt change slightly in cut and shape over time.
text:No matter where people buy, buying a certain product increases its demand which in turn increases the price and perception of the product.  So even if the shops don’t give brands any money, it stills benefits them overall through better perception and free branding.	labels:I agree with this, and think reformation is a great example on Poshmark. So many people are buying from reformation with immediate intentions of reselling it at full price. I feel like buying from their brand secondhand would still be supporting them in this case.	episode_done:True

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:T shirts and jeans are a great staple and can be totally changed up. I basically only wear t shirts and jeans too, but I’ll change it up a bit with different shoes - Chelsea boots, sneakers, timberland boots, loafers.   Also, different Jean types, tops and jewelry can change up your look while still maintaining the “t shirt and jeans” style.   I love to wear (and make) chunky gold jewelry that are cool accessories to laid back looks.	episode_done:True

text:Yes, I even considered this. It is possible that all the fuss associate with a MTM may just create work and not contribute much to the overall fit. I'm kind of build weird though...rather "wide" with a 36 inch waist, but not pudgy at all. My legs and arms are really thin, so I look like I am completely swimming in most OTR jacket sleeves and trousers. My SS OTR trousers I have do fit well, but not as well as the perfectly tapered MTM ones.  I failed to mention that I own an OTR SS Sienna as well, which I bought online and had altered. The MTM one fits much better, but it's mostly sleeves, shoulders and trousers....so basically all of it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Anyone like wearing traditional clothing from you culture?	labels:I also love wearing my cultural wear! I was born and raised in the US, but my parents are from Vietnam. Our traditional dress is the áo dài, and I just think it’s so beautiful. It’s such an elegant piece of clothing and literally makes any girl look good, no matter what size or shape you are. I’d love to wear it as part of everyday wear, but it looks a bit formal for most occasions. I have seen some more modern versions and a bit trendier versions, so I’m trying to get my hands on that. As for now, I just wear my cultural dress to church on Sundays, which is a more appropriate setting.  But I wouldn’t worry yourself about what your mom has to say about it. If it you like it and it makes you feel good, then why not wear it? I bet you look amazing in them, it sounds so cute!

text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:I've taken a couple of laps before writing this comment, but up-front I think aesthetics section should be split, because I think the most basic question, which is answered aesthetically but not functionally, is what do you want your clothes to **do**? Giving off a vibe is mentioned, but there's an even more functional level of "are these clothes sensible for how I live my life?" Are you buying lots of hawaiian shirts even though live at the north pole, or buying down parkas when you live in Hawaii? Do you regularly find yourself cold and wet because you don't own any raincoats, or find that your fishnet sleeves keep getting caught on the mill in the machine shop, or that your raw denim really doesn't give you the flexibility you need to dance?   I think what the clothes do should meet you where you do what you do, and at the most basic level that's physically enabling you to do things, and you can build a vibe from that.
text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:I think there might be some correlation. First of all the older we get the less likely we are to try new things and I am sure that affects clothing too. But that does not mean that 40 year olds can't wear trends just because some of their age group don't.   I remember my mother sometimes saying that certain things have a grandma vibe for her or look dated. But for me it was something completely different, because I was not around when those styles were popular the first time (or I was a litle kid) so they don't remind me of that. And it's also obvious that I could not have bought it at that time and just never threw it out, because I am too young. So I guess some pices might look dated on a 40 year old, but not on a 20 year old.  On the other hand, I have no problem with older clothes if they are paired with other pieces that are more trendy. There is no reason to throw away your favorite sweater just because it's older than 5 years. Some pieces are classics.	episode_done:True

Buy less clothing and go to the gym instead." He was right.
text:Canada Goose Workers Allege Unsafe Working Conditions in Winnipeg Factories. “Before I came to Canada I was in Qatar and then Dubai and it’s the same here in Canada Goose: No humanity.”	labels:How does CG charge such a massive markup on their goods and not invest any of that into treating their employees fairly? I can buy a better jacket from Moncler or Patagonia for half the price.
text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:I think the pressure is to not be "strange/unaware of your appearance" or more likely not to look "poor/can't afford more clothes." Some people do notice, and the rude ones point it out. This perception starts young. Growing up, there were teachers and other school staff who repeated outfits and other children loudly pointed it out.  I repeat outfits as much as possible if I'm not seeing the same people (my household doesn't count). The internal pressure is strong to not repeat within a few weeks of seeing the same people to avoid potential comments.
text:True, but I think people also need to be smarter about where they shop. OP seems to be shopping at either crap brands like H&M or way overpriced/luxury brands, or she doesn’t know what sales are. Because I can find cashmere sweaters from luxury stores like Bloomingdales or Bergdorf Goodman year-round for $100 or even lower.   Edit: I did a quick search for women’s cotton sweaters at Nordstrom and they have many 100% cotton styles on sale in the $20-30 range...	labels:I can't remember if that is one of the brands that is made by forced labor (Uyghurs) in concentration camps (western China). If so, another reason not to buy from H&M.	episode_done:True
text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:I don't think there's anything wrong with preferring dresses and leggings and it doesn't inherently signify that you are somehow unworthy for pants or "letting yourself go".   The thing is, historically speaking, dresses were actually far more practical for a woman's body due the cyclical changes we all experience, from menstrual bloating/cramping, to minor weight fluctuations, to pregnancy and breastfeeding (historically there wasn't much choice about the last two but obviously now there is), cuz you could cinch up or let out your dress depending on how you were doing.   It's only now that stretchy fabric is truly mainstream that pants have truly become as practical and cost effective in that they can tolerate a lot more cyclical size changes, which are *normal*.  Edit: not to mention all the times people would gain and lose weight due to the availability of food.   I'd say I have a pretty confident mindset and 90% of my non work wardrobe is dresses and skirts/shirt combos. I wear undersummers in the spring and summer, leggings and sweater tights in the winter and I've gotten SO MUCH MORE USE out of my dresses... They lasted me up until my 8th month of pregnancy, I barely had to buy maternity clothes.  I have been able to wear the same knit dress/leggings combo at 180lbs prepregnancy and later at 210 lbs post partum and still look cute.  What pair of pants could pull that off? Almost none, I tell you.  Saved me a lot of $$$.   No matter what I weigh, I always have a bit of a belly, so most pants dig into that anyways, which isn't comfortable. Only truly high waisted stuff feels ok, but I don't want to wear that in the summer.   It sounds like disordered thinking is creeping up on you, and you may have to consciously remind yourself that there's nothing wrong with enjoying comfy clothes that don't restrict your abdomen.

text:I bought these very popular aritzia melina leather pants..an inspo album and fit pictures	labels:The fit from the knee down does not do the pants or you any favors :/ the way it sits on the top of your foot makes all the outfits feel dated instead of trendy.

The claim he did his based on a quote from an interview that is about his objection to an actually existing piece of legislation that he worried would be used to criminalize homosexuals. He viewed the law as a break from history of ‘prohibition of acts’ into the classification of people as ‘bad’ and feared it would be extended to criminalize not ‘homosexual acts’ but gay people themselves, inherently.   Not personally a hill I would ever die on, but I’m not a gay man in 1970s France.	labels:The claim that he supported pedophilia is a actually based on the fact he signed a petition calling for the decriminalisation of all pedophilia.

text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:Don't worry! You're most likely not going to look any older. Clothes do much less for your age than you think. Just imagine a middle aged lady that dresses like a teenager. She's not fooling anyone. If dressing like another age worked to look another age, we would all do it 😂 just enjoy clothes and experiment with fun looks, it's easy to pull most things off while young.	episode_done:True

But before it gets to those super extreme sad months, I like wearing a short fitted puffer jacket with a winter down miniskirt over leggings and doc martens.  The short jacket makes me feel like I still have a shape and the down miniskirt keeps my bum warm and looks cute.

text:General Discussion - January 16, 2021	labels:A dark and surreal week for me:     Accidentally went to the wrong floor for a meeting this week and stumbled across a sweatshop right here in beautiful New York, New York (the city so nice they named it the big apple), so this is your friendly reminder that "made in the USA" doesn't necessarily mean shit when it comes to ethically made clothing. Reported it to the DoL but I don't expect them to do anything about it.     In unrelated but equally bleak personal fashion news, In my search for some VERY obscure soviet-Czech trainers I accidentally stumbled across a sketchy forum of people selling battle-worn combat uniforms, complete with burns, bullet holes and blood stains. It's always fun to imagine you're living in a Blue Ant book until you actually start living in a blue ant book and life becomes very depressing! The first rule of the forum is you are not allowed to ask how these things were sourced.     Lastly the embroidery studio i work at was contacted for a large order of Rhodesian flag patches. I contacted the client to see if it was for a film or something and he was very cagey about their purpose, so I cancelled the order and refunded his deposit, which lead to me getting chewed out by my boss, who is apparently fine with making White Nationalist memorabilia if it's obscure enough to not get him in any trouble.

text:Knit Tie Inspo / Lookbook	labels:I picked up a black knit tie and a navy knit tie at the same time. While for normal woven ties, I'd usually reach for a navy over a black, with the texture of a silk knit, somehow the black knit tie just looks better than the navy knit in so many outfits.   This might be a function of bias because I've read articles extolling the virtues of the black knit tie, but I think the texture of the knit helps to offset the starkness of the colour

I...actually wear heels in my casual life all the time lol, including when I run errands.  But never stilettos!  I'm in my 30s and wear a lot of block heels and kitten heels.  It makes me feel better/more powerful, and evens out my proportions in a way I appreciate.  Maybe that's why they're so common in influencer photos?  That said, I think certain flats can look really sharp if the rest of the outfit is tailored well.  In my mind, flats make good tailoring even more important as you aren't adjusting your proportions with your shoes.  When I wear flats, I'm hyper-vigilant about the proportions of the rest of my outfit.	episode_done:True

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.

I had a baby last year and form-fitting shirts just don't look good on me anymore. But I couldn't find anything else that worked so I spent the warm months wearing t-shirts. (Which turned out to be fine since anything I wore ended up covered in spit up anyway)  So I'm really hoping that by summer at least, pandemic numbers are low enough that I can actually go out and try new clothes on and find stuff that works for me. Otherwise... I guess it's t-shirts and jeans again. :/	episode_done:True

I wear sports bras instead of regular bras because they are more comfy.  On weekends, I put on a stretchy pair of jeans and wear the same top for any activities outside, because I give up.  Sometimes I wear a Fancy Hoody.  I haven't out on more than tinted chapstick and a quick swipe of mascara in months.  I did get myself a cute new pair of duck boots from Costco. On some girls they look cute and stylish.  On me, it looks like im a middle age mom of 3, who has just tromped around the muddy dog park. Because I am and I have.  Santa.

And if OP said between entry level and 2k his point would be very strong.  And I don't have anything against that, I have a limited edition 104 I wear a lot, it goes for 2.6 and I bought it at 2.4 or something. I also have a GS but it's like 7k or something because it's a spring drive GMT.

Usually acrylic and polyester fit me perfectly in that size.  Pure cotton frustrate me sometimes. I'm never sure whether to buy them to fit or not. Sometimes they're preshrunk sometimes they're not. And most of the time it's not mentioned on the label. Feels like rolling a dice when it comes to fit. Any ideas?
text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:The clothes they are wearing are actually the least important part of them looking elegant.  Ignoring genetics (it's a lot easier to look elegant if you're tall and thin, imo) there's a few things that can help someone look elegant regardless of what clothes they're wearing. Also ignoring the fact these three probably have teams to help them look how they want ;)  First off is how you carry yourself - how you walk, how you pose for photos, how you sit and stand etc. It helps to have a friend, a good sized mirror, or to record yourself - then watch how people you see as being elegant move and hold themselves, then copy them and practice.  Second would be presentation. The instagrammers you mention have long, clean, shiny hair in simple styles. More neutral colours for makeup - but be aware it takes a lot of time and product (and practice!) to get their kinda looks. Clean, well manicured nails - they don't have to be too long but no chipped polish, dirt under nails etc. Clothes that fit (find a tailor if you can afford to alter clothes for you, or learn to do it yourself) . A cheap shirt that's been altered to fit you will look better than a more expensive one that fits badly.  And thirdly would be mindset - this also ties into the first because no matter how much practice you've had, if you feel clumsy and nervous you will find a lot harder to pull off looking elegant.	episode_done:True
text:How to combine colors	labels:The easiest thing one can do is to just look at online clothes shops or catalogs. Look at how the outfits are put together with other colors. Also, if your primary goal is to see which colors match, don't limit yourself to looking at male clothes, women's section are often bigger if not more extensive than the men's selection; thus they're bound to have larger varieties of color coordinations. The H&M website is good one, since they often show the whole model head to toe.	episode_done:True

text:Hats - discussion	labels:I think "hat energy" is just the confidence to wear one. My ex used to visibly cringe whenever I tried a hat on and so I believed I was too ugly to wear a hat. After I divorced him, I started wearing hats regularly and now have a wall dedicated to my collection. I needed a little time to get used to seeing myself in a hat and I prefer wearing them with large sunglasses because it looks more stylish to me.
text:Good suggestion! Thanks	labels:I'd try to avoid AliExpress (and Shein etc) for jewellery (or in general) because they shamelessly rip off designers and artisans' own original designs and then sell them at a pittance. I also avoid buying from sellers on etsy/depop/eBay who are using AliExpress charms for similar reasons. It's not always easy to know whether something has been stolen (Etsy is flooded with AliExpress-type stuff)  but ruling out places where this is the actual business model is a start. Especially if you don't want loads of pieces you may as well spend the few extra ££ supporting designers, or at least not harming them.	episode_done:True

text:Your 2021 trend predictions?	labels:The style of 2020 was so much more feminine and romantic than the trends of the previous couple decades, so it'll be interesting to see how this rediscovery of feminine softness will influence things going forwards. As others have said I think there will be more focus on beautiful and dainty ornamentation paired with simpler slightly more fitted garments of natural fibre. Pants and skirts sitting on the hips bones rather than being high waisted. Floral and nature inspired patterns and jewellery, I'm thinking the painting of Ophelia by Millais. But maybe at the same time there will be a swing away from this sweet, innocent look with more psychedelic, rave culture, lsd and 1960s art nouveau appropriation poster aesthetics emerging. I think this kind of psychedelic combination of delicate "nature goddess" looks with more vivid colours, trippy prints and interesting details will start to emerge.  Honestly I'm hoping some of the slow fashion, "timeless", ethical (and expensive) clothing that has been cool for the last 5 years will finally start to mean that people actually do buy less stuff and the fast fashion cycle will slow down with changes being more in the realm of accessories and hair than in buying tonnes of clothing itself.... But probably not right...   On another note: nike AF1s (and vejas) are surely done by now, and maybe this is wishful thinking but I feel the cool sneaker trend cycle might fizzle out a bit, with more trad leather and cute heels and basic canvas shoes coming in... Anyone here got speculation on what the new cool shoe will be?

My eye doctor has me wearing progressive lenses now so the price has gone up significantly on my everyday glasses so I don’t have the same selection I used to.

People would literally go crazy and it truly would be the roaring twenties. Dresses of all types, miniskirts, sparkle and glitter, heels for days, fun fabrics, bolder colors, leather pants, blouses with impractical sleeves, statement earrings – women would really be dressing to the nines *and* wearing bold lipstick colors to compliment.

text:Southern hemisphere ladies where do you get inspo from?	labels:I had the same dilemma when I moved down under 2 years ago! To be honest, I just started following popular brands on Instagram - Zimmermann, Bec & Bridge, Camilla & Marc, Dion Lee, etc. The algorithm took care of the rest, lol.   So I guess my advice is to look around at what the popular brands are in your locale, follow them on Insta and trust Zuckerberg’s algorithm to lead the way.
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 07, 2020	labels:Losing my mind trying to remember this company—hoping one of y’all can help.   Basically they’re a small company that only makes one type of jacket per season. I think I found them through an Instagram ad.

text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:Earth tones are a BIG winner if you're trying to reach outside of the standard dark tones like Black/Blues. The next ring up from White is most definitely a CREAM/OFF-WHITE shade. Grab an assortment of camel/chestnut browns too. & then find some mute shades of Green (not emerald or teal), but more like green shade that are within range of a Matcha green color....and voila! The start of an awesome color range.	episode_done:True
text:Do you guys default to a set of a few pieces even though you own a ton?	labels:Yeah. I definitely have a set of clothes that get worn every week or multiple times every week. Things like dark slim-straight jeans, Indy boots, Patagonia baggies, some flannels, Barbour jackets, grey crew neck sweatshirt etc. I think it’s totally natural to gravitate towards a set of specific items as the “core” of your wardrobe and in general it’s worth spending more money on those piece. And then the rest of my stuff gets worn way less frequently. That stuff kind of fits into two categories in my mind: 1. Items that fill the same niche in my wardrobe as another item which I prefer either due to fit, style or details.  2. Items that are unique in style, color, or fit and thus only work in a narrow range of situations / outfits.   For me, the difficulty is avoiding items that fall into that first category and instead looking for more interesting stuff that would fall into the second	episode_done:True

text:This I think is where I am and thank you for the thoughts.   I need at least six pairs of shoes for daily wear. With that requirement I will soon have one pair of shoes that’s even the right size. So buying a stable of AE’s to get started seems reasonable.   I doubt I will ever really be a collector, and the idea of spending $1,000 for a pair of shoes still feels insane. But owning a base line of shoes that don’t hurt sounds well worth replacing my current shoes with AE’s even if there are other good options out there.	labels:check out preston on elegant oxford where he links a ebay sellar who lists AE for a fraction for what you would pay in store. Look secondhand since there is plenty of options there which are barely worn.	episode_done:True

text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:Echoing some other comments: only follow instagram accounts that inspire you and make you feel good. Let go of the social media comparison game. Follow accounts from people of all different shapes, sizes, and ethnicities while you're at it.  I am not a fashion icon, but my one piece of advice to avoid being overwhelmed is to focus on one single clothing item or accessory you'd like to improve, and pair it with easy basics. For example, I wanted to improve my sneaker game a few years ago. I bought (over time) a few pairs of sneakers I LOVED and paired them with my basic black tee shirts/jeans. It was so much easier to focus on wearing cool and fun sneakers without feeling like I needed to overhaul my entire closet. Another example: I figured out how to do my hair one particular style that I really like. No matter what outfit I'm in, my hair makes me feel cute when I style it that way.   You don't have to do all the fashion at one time. Everyday fashion is not a contest, I promise. You have your whole life to learn what you like and lean into your personal style.	episode_done:True

text:This is an absolutely valid comment. I've bought and sold a lot of my mid-range brand pieces (stuff that costs ~200 - 600 USD new) in the last couple of years. Unless something is super popular, it can take MONTHS to find a buyer, and usually to a heavily discounted price.   And keep in mind, there are a lot of jerks. You'll end up arguing with a buyer sooner or later that you can't take returns because it didn't fit them, that the condition was indeed as described etc. Oddly enough, my most hassle-free things to sell were used branded jewelry.   Buying new and hoping for a high re-sale is a lost cause for most things. 2nd hand shops in my country will pay about 0-10% of the original price when you send/bring them your stuff. And that's for a good condition and no obvious signs of wear.   Even popular brands don't yield much. I've sent in a new with attached tags & packaging Tatras coat (costs ~900 usd here) and they offered me 240 USD. This was the most popular model of this brand.  For 2nd hand, you'll mostly win by buying second hand what you hopefully enjoy yourself. Buying something at 20-30% of the original value, use it for as long as you like, then donate/sell it for anywhere between 0-10%	labels:I totally hear you on the pains of resale. I agree that the situation is a little more hopeful if you buy secondhand to begin with, but from your and other's posts, there are still too many other variables that can make it difficult to "re-resale" so to speak.	episode_done:True

text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:Don’t forget to check out thrift stores. This is where I stock up on cashmere sweaters for a few dollars a piece, wool skirts, kilts, sweaters, vests, and cardigans, and amazing wool blazers and coats. I’ve found mint condition mohair and camel hair 3/4 coats for as low as $10, black cashmere sweaters for $2-3 and up, and cable knit pullovers for as low as $4. It’s amazing what people get rid of, not realizing how expensive it all is new. I also loooove wool in the fall and winter, and so this has been a super affordable way to build a dream cold-weather wardrobe.   The only thing wool I buy new are socks for the most part, everything else I’ve found at estate sales, garage sales, and thrift shops. When/if you go, definitely go through the boys and men’s departments, too. A bit of tailoring can make anything look custom like some of the pieces on Walker Slater maybe.

text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:<rant>  If I said "Wear cropped jackets so you look taller" I'd be laughed out of the room but somehow "Short people shouldn't wear long coats" is a valid thing?   Also what's defined as short? If someone is 5'7" do they get to wear long coats? What if they're 5'7.5"??  It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering". If you care so much about these gender norms, masculinity and being ~ flattering ~ then sack up and wear the clothes you like.   That whole thread is just people saying that someone else told them they couldn't *wear a coat* so what should they do? Oh idk. How about tell them to fuck off and wear the damn coat.  </rant>
text:Clarks agrees £100m private equity deal	labels:I only know Clarks from the USA. I have had a few pairs of these and have liked them. Not high fashion, but comfortable and durable.

I've always liked their kind of Euro-dorkness.	episode_done:True
text:Inspo Album: Vintage Wool Sweaters Need Good, Loving Homes	labels:Awesome that they are still around. A testament to the durability and quality of real wool. I’m 75, so this kind of sweater was all we had to stay warm in the winter when we were young. I knitted quite a few as well. When Polar Fleece became available the woolies were less used. However I still appreciate the warmth of a real 100% cashmere or the feel of an Icelandic cardigan knitted in the natural colors . As a knitter I love to see the hard work in a wool garment and the lovely colors that you can find in the older handmade sweaters. They need some care(laundering by hand and blocking to keep their shape, air drying) store away from bugs in the off season ( mothballs!) and kept folded on a shelf or in a drawer not on hangers when in active use. You’ll also find wonderful interesting buttons on the vintage (yikes that’s my childhood years!) items. Lovely sweaters that deserve to be enjoyed by a new generation ❤️ Buying vintage? Look for stains, moth holes, odd shape from improper laundering, missing buttons. These are major faults.

text:Women who have moved for extended periods of time on 1 or 2 suitcases only, how did you do it? Here's the beginning of my process	labels:How permanent is the move? If it's only a couple of months then you could also just bring a couple of basic items and leave space in your bag to buy new clothes in your destination. This is what I did when I studied abroad for a year. The clothes are then also a nice souvenir for yourself.   If it's a long term or permanent, again just bring the things you absolutely love the most then buy things there. You can also have your other closed shipped to you in a parcel if you really can't do without them. Obviously if it's a permanent move the issue of fitting everything in a suitcase to bring home isn't really an issue.   Depending on what climate your moving from and to you might find you don't have enough clothes for said climate. For example, I moved UK to Japan, and I absolutely did not have enough clothes for the hot, humid summers here.  The same goes for culture. Many of my friends ended up having to throw away all of their tanktops and lowcut blouses because they're not culturally appropriate here.   It's also really common to change size when moving to another country because of diet and lifestyle changes. So you could find that all the clothes you bring no longer fit you after a few months.  The only longterm move situation where it's better to bring everything is if it'll be difficult to find your size where you're moving. For example if you're 6' and moving to east asia you'll have a hard time finding clothes

Answering those questions may help someone give you advice regarding jewelry. Prescriptive "everyone should own" lists are completely worthless.

Not sure if it's cause I need to go a size up to a 9 or get 8 1/2 wide or stick with the ones I got and maybe they just need to be broken in. I still feel a lot of room between my toe and end of the shoe though, the heel is the only part that rubs once I put it on and walk in it, it feels a lil tight top to down wise too kinda like a glove like feeling. I attached some pictures of the fit, my toe hits at that rounded lip line near the end so about .75 of an inch or so of space so I don't think going a size up would help. What do you all think?

text:Favorite brands to thrift?	labels:COS, some ted baker, allsaints, I generally find loft very boring but I have thrifted some nice loft coats, I usually don’t pay too much attention to the brand through	episode_done:True
text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:My policy is that I refuse to buy anything that I’m not absolutely sure that I’ll love. I see a lot of people fast fashion shame by saying that “people never wear those things more than once or twice” but while I try to avoid fast fashion now for ethical reasons, there are definitely things I’ve purchased from shein, H&M, etc. that I wear all the time.	episode_done:True

I’m a 38D and even if I have no problem wearing a bra, I chose not to in my everyday attire now because it’s more freeing and comfortable for me. If men can go out and not wear undershirts/go shirtless I public, I should be able to not wear a bra and not be criticized. I’ve been out and sometimes my nipples show but who tf cares? My breasts aren’t inherently sexual, they’re just a part of my lovely body and the world should realize that.	episode_done:True

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:I get this so much. I have two boards on my Pinterest because of this. I have my "things I like to look at apparently" and one I actually called "My look apparently". For the second I started pinning items I actually own and wear a lot, and really filled it up with those products and "looks" and have been surprised at how many relayed pins are coming up with looks of things I own (or close) but styled in a way I wouldn't have thought. The other board is eye candy	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 20	labels:I’m trying to follow the capsule wardrobe program by having less clothes to give more more looks. Right now my wardrobe consists of:  -	Solid tees in colors that match my skin tone (warm skin tone, green veins) -	gray cardigan -	1 gray hoodie -	1 Carmel colored flannel -	2 striped tees -	1 set of black joggers -	2 pairs of jeans (one straight cut Levi’s unwashed and a slim fit -	gray quarter zip Patagonia -	leather bomber jacket -	Stan smiths -	Iron Ranger boots in the reddish leather -	chukkas in brownish leather  Right now it seems I’m only really able to layer creating new looks with my cardigan and my flannel. What other kinds of top layers could I add in to create more looks?  Side note: I work in tech, at home right now. But shorts are acceptable in the office so I avoid formal clothes.

text:General Discussion - December 13, 2020	labels:The long comment thread below got me thinking.   I feel like we live in a time where dozens of fashion subcultures are able to exist at once. I've never seen so many designers and brands across several "genres" all thriving so well.  Saying something isn't "in fashion" just seems wild to me right now. Because honestly I think what's "fashionable" is exploring your own personal style and aesthetic. Being yourself is what's currently cool, and I think that's dope.

text:What pieces would you love "backups" of?	labels:An incredibly soft flowy black shirt, with roses embroidered like they were planned to highlight my collar bones.

text:Funny question	labels:Brocade frock coat. Offbeat and a little old-fashioned.	episode_done:True
text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:This isn’t a direct answer to your question, but I’ve found I have a ‘hopeful’ sense of style and a ‘realistic’ sense of style.  Hopeful-me will think about buying a teal floral wrap dress because it’s gorgeous. Realistic-me knows it will sit in my closet untouched for 3 years because I don’t wear teal!   I’ve learned to differentiate between the two while I shop, at least. If I was a celebrity suddenly, maybe I would lean towards hopeful-me’s style, but for now I am normal and realistic!
text:Black is Beautiful, Braids are Beautiful, Bald is Beautiful: Ayanna Pressley as an icon of feminine professionalism	labels:Wow she looks like what I think a real queen would look like.

Their sucks are tougher wearing so last longer than what I had been wearing before. Plus any time they wear out you just return them for another pair. Eventually my socks were all darn tough. And if you want very thick socks, look at the hiking section, that tends to have the most heavily cushioned options.	episode_done:True

text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:I'm hoping those "Is it Wine o'clock?" shirts (or anything involving  women drinking wine to deal with life) you find at any mall store/Target directed towards adults.   Perhaps it's because I can no longer pass as a youth and will no doubt get thrown into the demographic these companies sell to, but it's always painful when you start to see a trend in clothes and you hate it, and it lasts YEARS.
text:Thoughts on jumpsuits?	labels:I’ve had one since 2015 that I bought secondhand and have been wearing it since. I don’t think it’s going out of style anytime soon, but I wouldn’t recommend making your wardrobe 100% of something. Anytime I’ve done something drastic like that I’ve come to regret it. Why not buy like 2-3 of them and go from there?	episode_done:True

text:oh he *STRONG*	labels:	episode_done:True
text:No worries!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls” catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your “fashion house designers” but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I’ve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.
text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I've been working on construction sites for for years, and I've found that my work wear influences my fashion sense more than my fashion sense influences my workwear  I'd say the only influence fashion has on my workwear is cut. I wear skinny carpenter's jeans and make sure that my shirts, jackets, and high viz vest are all fitted at the waist. This is mostly so I don't look like a child, though, and less about fashion  I wear quality boots to work every day, so now I tend to buy my fun shoes from places prioritize comfort, weatherproofing, and sole grip. Less ASOS, more Sorel  I love Dovetail jeans, which have taught me the joys of a pocket for every tool. Now, my favorite purse is a crossbody wallet from Duluth because it has slots for all my cards and cash and two pockets that are perfect for my phone and my facemask.  Basically, construction has taught me to prioritize dressing practically so I can live my best life without digging for shit deep in a massive purse while dying in uncomfortable shoes. I've got shit to do and my belongings are not gonna hold me back!	episode_done:True

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:I keep most of my wardrobe relatively similar.  My work outfit is one of five pairs of pants, a button down, or a tee with a blazer.  My weekend uniform is athletic wear or jeans with a tank or tee in one of like five colors.  Mostly everything is black, gray, white, light blue, navy, with some camel and tomato red.  Only dresses really deviate here.    I play with shoes, makeup, and sunglasses to mix up my basic wardrobe.  And my bikini collection is relatively extensive, I have more bikinis than pairs of pants.	episode_done:True
text:Category is: Pants on the Runway - Inspo Album	labels:Imagine getting into an elevator with those Loewe pants... "sorry, elevator's full" 😂	episode_done:True
text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:I think a lot of people here that say their clothing falls apart quickly aren't properly caring for their clothes. Growing up I learned to wash everything together on cold. As an adult I had to read articles and watch YouTube videos on how to care for my clothing. I recommend everyone learn how to properly launder their clothing.
text:You raise good points, but I’m going to respectfully disagree - I don’t think there’s ever any valid excuse to buy from a company who openly profits from exploitative third world labour. We can all do better.   Sustainable fashion is expensive, yes. But *usually* buying quality clothing is cheaper in the long run than buying lots of cheap stuff (I know this is easier said than done for people living hand to mouth).   Secondly there are options that don’t exploit people. Namely second hand shops and Depop. I guarantee - no matter what the item is - someone’s already bought it or something VERY similar and wants to get rid of it. Even when I have money I buy from there because... why wouldn’t you?   The “what about poor people” argument always gets made but it just doesn’t sit right with me. What about the people who are being paid 40p a day in sweltering and unsafe Bangladeshi factories? Factories that are dumping toxic dyes into water sources? We all have a responsibility not to perpetuate the monolithic success of these horrible fast fashion conglomerates.	labels:I guess if you haven't been on this situation it is hard to see.  For years I couldn't even spend 10€ on a t-shirt nor a jean more than once a year. Literally all my clothes were a few (or a lot) years old or given by the neighbors (so they fitted me badly or weren't to my liking but I was appreciative either way). Not only they were old, but they absolutely *looked* old.  So yes, when I discovered Aliexpress, I did some shopping there. Not a lot, but at least I could finally get some new shoes and pullovers and not look miserable anymore. I could finally buy panties and some bras (even though I never found any bra that fits). Now that I can afford it, I try to be more sustainable with my shopping decisions, but until two years ago, it was impossible.  Also, higher prices doesn't necessarily mean more sustainable. Fast fashion is everywhere and I kid you not, I bought a pullover on Aliexpress that had a Zara tag and a few weeks after receiving it, this same pullover was sold on Zara for thrice the price. Even self-proclaimed sustainable brands have done some shit in their production.  Some people can't spend more money on clothing. If you can afford it, yes, try to avoid fast fashion as much as possible, but let's understand that this is a privilege not everybody can afford.	episode_done:True

text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I would recommend, first of all, assessing your goals and trying to make rules that are fair to you, and which can be adapted into life long habits.   Flexibility is important, especially when it comes to something you will eventually *need* to do, like purchasing clothing.  Not buying a single thread of clothing for an entire year was a failure waiting to happen (because, y'know, shit happens,) and it isn't even that helpful if it just results in binge periods before and after.      What works best for me is keeping a system of criteria for shopping.  If you actually *need* something, buy it guilt-free, and then budget out the things you don't need.  *Always* assess potential purchases critically: Ask yourself it it suits your wardrobe, if it's practical, if it fits well, it it's well-made and if it's something you are likely to wear a lot.   If helps, reserve nonessential purchases for use as a reward when you complete major tasks.  Try to avoid shopping altogether if you know you're not supposed to be buying stuff.  If you feel like you can't stop shopping, there's almost definitely *something* else you can be doing that scratches the same psychological itch.
text:I had to write an essay on diversity for my vet school applications. It was honestly really tough because I wanted to say something meaningful without just being like "I have a black friend" ya know?	labels:Yeah, it's tough not to do just the ritualistic/performative thing. I'm not exactly on board with asking for such dedicated essays on a grad school level, there just isn't very much to talk about. It's mostly about testing whether you have thouroughly reflected on the topic, came to the "right" conclusions and perhaps put some of them into action already. I'm sure you did well.	episode_done:True

While the album primarily depicts men, women and individuals whose sex and gender are unknown to me also make up a fair proportion.

text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism? I love it, but how do you do it?	labels:I think I'm in between here. Not minimalist, but not maximalist. The one maximalist thing I'll do is with either accessories (scarf and jewelry and a hat and funky boots) or one bright/bold piece like a colorful jacket. Like, I have a mustard, navy and pink paisley jacket that I'll wear with jeans and a navy top, but I don't really have the stones to wear pink shoes and a green hat *also*.  Maybe try this on a smaller scale instead of attempting a full-on look?	episode_done:True

Uniqlo was a big part of the beginning for me, I really like their airsim and heattech lines. How can my clothes work for me? I really took on a evolutionarily perspective lmao, like I need Shelter from Rain, Insulation in Cold, Sweat Wicking in Sun. It got me to pay attention to fabric choices more, which meant I was pickier, which meant I was buying more expensive items... so then I started to care about the quality of stitching and longevity of the piece.  I had IBS for a year and there were some clothes I could really NOT wear with that, so I had to learn to make adjustments too. I like high-rise bottoms, but I can't have an elastic cutting off my intestines all day, so I get something with a zipper instead.	episode_done:True

They get baggier with each wear and start to look sloppy on me.

text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I think they’re like jewelry accessories. They range from wild to professional. If you style a very plain item in a wild way, it’s no longer a plain item. Like hair colored bobby pins used to sculpt your hair into a helicopter. I think scrunchies can be great with a sleek bun or a lovely scarf as a head wrap and still look professional. A headband with horns may not fit in all offices, but maybe that’s a vibe of an office that works.	episode_done:True

Fluid, full, and fitting just so on the waist. Styled classic for work with an equally full and fluid washed silk shirt, rolled up sleeves and tucked in with a patent waist belt. For brunch dates with a bateau neck tee that fits like a second skin, and for evenings with a low backed long sleeved version of the same. A chunky, cropped length fisherman’s jumper if theres a chill on casual strolls

text:Me too! I'm 30. I honestly think they extracted my fuck giving bladder when they yanked my son out. Then at 3 months after birth, my hair fell out literally in clumps. I can't say I felt too bad about it, because I was kinda busy with a nursing 24/7 baby.  However, now that it's starting to grow back, I fit into my clothes better, and my son turned one and rejected them boobies all of a sudden in one day, haha!.. I feel inspired!   Fashion wise, somewhere in life when I focused my very least on fashion, is where I found my true joy for clothing. Not shopping, just.. Matching and organizing my closet and appreciating all that fancy stuff I hadn't used in years. I just feel more confident and better looking than ever before!  And yes, I have a pair of skinny high waisted jeans 🙄 They're not out of style, guys. At least not in Scandinavia.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else wear one brand only?	labels:I realized recently when I put all my clothes in an app (called StyleBook) and looked at statistics that a disproportionate amount of my things are J. Crew. I didn't try, it just... happened. There's basically a J. Crew item in every outfit I wear. But my style is preppy and classic, lots of interchangeable basics too, and J. Crew fits that idea perfectly so it isn't too surprising!
text:Whats with all the "stretchy mens pants" startups I am seeing all of a sudden?	labels:Have you ever worn a pair of Lulu's warpstreme pants? The hype is real.  Edit: Not sure why this is controversial. Lulu's men's pants have been hyper-successful for casual office attire, and other brands are trying to capitalize on it by making a lower-priced alternative. It's that simple.
text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I WFH permanently now, but when I worked in an office I wasn't able to escape dry-clean-only clothing; there are some things that just need to be dry cleaned. However, I used Dryel to great effect (awesome for things that aren't stained or stinky and don't really need to be pressed). I will also say, many many clothing items that say "dry clean only" can be washed either by hand, or in the machine on a delicate setting with wool wash or other gentle low-suds detergent. (My dry cleaner, of all people, actually advised me to start washing my cashmere sweaters rather than bringing them in for cleaning - she said dry cleaning dries out and breaks down the fibers and washing them at home would help them last longer. I am still wearing my cashmere sweaters and so far, she's been correct.) If something is very structured or has an acetate lining I never try to wash it, but I have washed other things that were poly blends or wool blends and were marked "dry clean only," and as long as you hang them up to dry, it works fine.
text:General Discussion - January 19, 2021	labels:I never thought I'd become this person, but man, shipping costs really can fuck up my desire to buy something. I was just about to commit to buying another pair of sneakers and it's probably the best deal I'm going to find on them, added to cart, shipping info entered, billing info entered... $20 for the cheapest shipping option. No shipping codes available, no threshold I can cross to get free shipping. $20 period, no exceptions.  It's a $300 pair of sneakers discounted to $180, I guess should be able to rationalize that at $200 (including shipping), I'm still getting a better deal than what's available anywhere else online (only a few select retailers got this colorway, and all but one are sold out in my size), but still, $20 shipping feels *wrong*. My brain has been trained from years of online shopping that there should always be some way to get around paying for shipping, or otherwise, shipping should be cheap.
text:Influencers with Jobs: A Brief Collection	labels:Style Apotheca on Youtube is a pharmacist!   I definitely prefer to keep up with influencers who have real jobs for a few reasons.   Firstly, I don’t love when every other post or video is an ad. It makes it difficult to differentiate between actual personal style content and what’s just an ad for a company I’m not interested in shopping at. I don’t like being Sold something every time I watch a style video, and I find you get that less from influencers who get income from day jobs.  Secondly, as you say, there is a bit more realism in what they’re posting. Style doesn’t happen in a void, it has to happen in our daily lives. I don’t wear four-inch heeled boots to work, and I don’t like watching a college-age girl try and make Work Relatable content by making “Work Outfits” with four inch heeled boots. Influencers who have day jobs understand what it is boring office employees like me are looking for in a work outfit 😊 sure, maybe because of their “influencing” work they spend more money buying high-end clothing items that I’m simply never going to justify buying, but I don’t tend to follow people like that for very long.

Some ways to look ‘effortless’ - be confident, don’t constantly adjust your clothes - make sure clothes are fitting properly - choose a simple silhouette (fitted top, loose bottoms or vice versa) - wear clean shoes - make sure your clothes are flattering — tuck in loose tops, etc.	episode_done:True

Classic coat for the gravitas of the moment, proudly black hairstyle for dignity in her heritage, that beautiful shimmery gold eyeshadow for youth and modernity. I cried during her performance. What an incredible young woman.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Some websites (department stores, ASOS) have a true fit tool where you put in your measurements, body type, and well fitting item of clothing and that information is used to recommend sizing.   It’s also a good idea to know your measurements in general if you’re buying secondhand as many sellers will list the measurements of the garment.  But overall sizing can be so wild within one brand, much less across multiple that I dint think there’s much of a rule of thumb.
text:I had this coworker. She was Ukrainian and looked amazing every day. Told me I was so pretty but why were my nails bare? Hair not done? Clothes all black? You are a WOMAN, she said.   She always seemed so impressed by each individual change that I kept going. Weekly manicures, nonblack clothing (I discovered that I look great in red!), tasteful makeup. People around the office were gossiping that I was trying to find a man. "No, a man is looking for HER!", she told them.   Then suddenly she disappeared. Quit over the phone and changed her number. I like to think she was an angel in a very impressionable time for me, but I think she might have just had issues with her work visa.	labels:I fanfictioned for myself that she was a fabulous spy a la “The Americans.” But while she was here, she made a side quest to hype you up.

text:The quote circulating here as evidence is from an interview about the petition. It’s explicitly noted in the Wikipedia for the petition, so you didn’t even have to look that hard to find the justification for the petition which I just laid out above:   > They believed that the penal system was replacing the punishment of criminal acts by the creation of the figure of the individual dangerous to society (regardless of any actual crime), and predicted that a "society of dangers" would come.  Again, definitely not a hill I would die on but the complete flattening of what Foucault was actually arguing into ‘he supported pedophilia’ is ahistorical nonsense.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:This is a perfect list, I would also add that you should not be afraid to break out of any style rules that you have. One thing I do when making myself break a random “rule” I made up for myself is to buy a realistic version (a color/fabric/style I already like/own) and wear the new/weird thing somewhere easy. I just forced myself to buy and wear a kimono top/jacket this way. It was a matching set and I had already bought the pants and had worn them, but didn’t buy the top because I just don’t wear kimonos.   So I bought the kimono top and wore the outfit to my sister’s house first for just a regular hang out, and then I wore it “publicly.” (It’s not really public rn but I wore it to see someone in my non-fam bubble LOL.) After wearing it around at my sister’s house I felt comfortable in it and it no longer felt like a weird thing to wear.   This doesn’t always work, sometimes I just won’t like something, but if I’m drawn to it and the only reason I’m not getting it is because of some internal rule I made up, it usually works.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:You gotta take your measurements. Sizing can change even within a brand.

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:From 2001-2005, clothing I wore as a high schooler/college kid: low rise bootcut jeans, fitted graphic tshirts, fitted polo shirts, fitted shirts in general (shirts were so tight- maybe that’s why we layered??), always layering shirts- and shirts were super long and over your hips, but tight- never tucking them in, cutoff denim skirts, cotton shorts (like soffees) with words on the butt, necklace with my first initial on it, platform flip flops, dresses with Hawaiian prints (like flowers or surfers etc), hoop earrings, fitted hoodies. That’s what I can remember.

text:What’s your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:Mine is flannel so I might not be much help lol  But on a serious note - thin undershirts that are not cotton t shirts for when you don’t want to do the bulky layers thing. I have a silk weight “capilene” patagonia one for when it’s really super cold and I’ll be outside and some similar ones that tbh were army issued, so I’m sure you could find the same sort of thing without going to patagonia levels of expense. It’s kinda shocking how much warmth you get from them.   If I’m not anticipating being outdoors much, I’ve got an assortment of cuddlduds, thin modal tees off Amazon, and some bamboo ones. If I want to wear a lighter more fashionable blouse or thinner sweater or something I can put a layer underneath and still be warm without making my shirt too tight (and they are thinner/more snug/less spongy, as well as warmer, than a tee).

I enjoy Mulberry’s designs too and will probably get my next bag from there as their bags are relatively affordable compared to some of the bigger designer names. I love Chloe bags too but I think those might be a little too trendy and blingy for me.  Totally agree with you on Bottega, I think it’s overrated, especially the dumpling looking bags.

She does get noticed for it, but even at her job (when she was going in person) it was just kind of known and accepted that she had a funky style and it was appreciated as part of her personality and beauty.	labels:I completely agree - context is everything.

I’m looking for some ‘transition’ clothes, so I can start trying to find my style without ‘showing off’ my fat, if that makes sense. I’m not really sure how to explain this lol.  Are there any brands that are good w/ baggy clothes, if not what are some inspo sources that have sweatshirts, baggy clothes, etc.  I’m in the US, and have a budget of around $100, maybe $150. I’d have what you call a ‘Baby Face’, very uncooperative hair (which is always in a side part, just naturally), and zero self confidence lol.   TL;DR - overweight, hate it, have no self confidence and want to start finding my style without showing off fat. Need suggestions on styles w/ baggy sweatshirts, t shirts, or styles that are okay at hiding fat while I lose weight.  Mods, if this isn’t allowed here please let me know where to post it!

I fucking love the pieces, and you definitely channeled the essence Cassie so well with every outfit.   Truthfully I think there doesn't have to be a line between cute and sensible. I just make sure that I cater "cute" to my setting- like what's "cute" at the club, isn't going to be "cute" at work and vice versa. In terms of sensibility, fuck it. As long as your outfit is appropriate for your setting, and the heels aren't hurting your feet too much,  don’t worry about sensibility.   I typically like to interpret edginess into softer looks with significant color contrast, thoughtful accessories, and statement pieces. Like for instance, a soft colored dress with dark colored, edgy shoes and a bag to match the shoes. But statement pieces and accessories are the easiest way to give a cutesy, girly soft look some edge.	episode_done:True

Been slowly replacing my closet with a lot of Todd Snyder and don't know how to feel about it lol, always wanted a "cool designer" closet but from a cost and functionality stand point it's not very doable. Good staples just get more wear in my closet, got to pick up more stand out pieces so I don't feel boring!

text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:<rant>  If I said "Wear cropped jackets so you look taller" I'd be laughed out of the room but somehow "Short people shouldn't wear long coats" is a valid thing?   Also what's defined as short? If someone is 5'7" do they get to wear long coats? What if they're 5'7.5"??  It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering". If you care so much about these gender norms, masculinity and being ~ flattering ~ then sack up and wear the clothes you like.   That whole thread is just people saying that someone else told them they couldn't *wear a coat* so what should they do? Oh idk. How about tell them to fuck off and wear the damn coat.  </rant>

Though, I do smell a bit like a barnyard now.

text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I think hair accessories in the workplace are fine as long as they're deployed thoughtfully. Nice scrunchies and those slightly high profile headbands can work pretty well when combined with a polished outfit and subtle jewelry (or more creative outfits and jewelry if your office is more casual). I work for a nonprofit that straddles a few different different fields (economic and business dev, higher ed, entrepreneurship, etc) so I interact with a wide range of dress codes and dress code interpretations.   I'd love to wear more headbands but I'm a whiner with a huge head and they pinch too badly to get through a work day; I love the look of the almost turban-styled headbands though and don't think they're automatically off limits for a biz caz office. But then I've worn a black scarf scrunchie to work on a sleek ponytail with a sleek turtleneck and skirt outfit, and I semi-regularly deploy interesting clips (geometric, tortoiseshell, or single jewel bobby pins).	episode_done:True
text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:Don’t forget to check out thrift stores. This is where I stock up on cashmere sweaters for a few dollars a piece, wool skirts, kilts, sweaters, vests, and cardigans, and amazing wool blazers and coats. I’ve found mint condition mohair and camel hair 3/4 coats for as low as $10, black cashmere sweaters for $2-3 and up, and cable knit pullovers for as low as $4. It’s amazing what people get rid of, not realizing how expensive it all is new. I also loooove wool in the fall and winter, and so this has been a super affordable way to build a dream cold-weather wardrobe.   The only thing wool I buy new are socks for the most part, everything else I’ve found at estate sales, garage sales, and thrift shops. When/if you go, definitely go through the boys and men’s departments, too. A bit of tailoring can make anything look custom like some of the pieces on Walker Slater maybe.

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:This is probably opposite of most of the advice here, but I advocate for buying *exactly* what you want and not worrying about sales/price etc (assuming it fits your budget). I'd rather a few garments I love than many that are ok/fine.  Edit: NB that this is with the caveat that you have a good understanding of what you like and what works for you. If you're new to the idea of dressing well or with intention, it may be worth holding off on springing for things.

text:I know “fashion” but people of minorities are always forced to try better. Some Insights	labels:As a black man I'm not surprised by this at all. I don't think I'm as affected as most because my clothes are overtly fashionable and often feminine, and that tends to disarm any preconceptions of "dangerous" and "violent". But I see it all the time, and I do notice a difference on the rare occasions I just dress plainly. Before Covid, if I walked home from the gym at night in sweats I wouldn't put my hood up or my hands in my pockets because I walked by one of campus police's favorite sitting spots. We only need to look at Trayvon Martin for confirmation. One note about the study:  > While it is tempting to tell individuals that how they dress can evoke negative biases, this avoids addressing a bigger issue … In fact, directing individuals to change what they wear places the burden of mitigating stereotypes and associated prejudices on the wearer. Instead, we need to consider how we can change the perceptions of those who hold and use such stereotypes in harmful ways.  I agree and I appreciate the sentiment, but I'll be dead before we change racists' perceptions on this. It's not a burden I or any other black man should have to carry, but realistically it's a lot easier for me to change my clothes than for a racist to change their thinking.  ETA: Black women have it way worse. They get to have racism **and** misogyny!
text:General Discussion - December 30, 2020	labels:hey all. it's been at least 3+ years since I've looked at this subreddit. Lost my old account, but remembered this place exists. What happened? I remember WAWYT threads and the front page being super active, now I see posts with barely any comments and posts from 3 days ago on the front page.  This used to be *the* subreddit to be on with over 2 million subs. Maybe it was because I was most active from like 2012-2016 where hashtag menswear with clark desert boots and americana was huge, and a cultural shift of men wanting to learn how to dress better was occurring. Stuff like the MFA uniform coming out, comments of how people outside of California or NY were labeled as gay because they wanted to dress better lol.   Now it seems as if most men want to look good and dress better. And there are more resources besides this subreddit to help people dress better? It's less of a niche and now a societal norm? Or maybe it's just because it's 9 am where I live and people are still waking up lol.  What are your thoughts? Am I out of touch? Am I just too early? I've seen /r/malefashion is a lot more active.
text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items are my Native American Turquoise jewelry and my cowboy boots. Just purchased a huge $900 squash blossom necklace and have worn it constantly. My boots range from $30 for a secondhand pair to $750 for custom made and none are worn more or less than the others.  When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was “saving for good”. Ironically, “good” apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I’m just out running errands.

text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I'm short, and one of the fashion guidelines I tend to read say to create long lines - this means avoiding ankle straps on shoes. I LOVE ankle straps on everything - heels, flats, sandals, etc. I definitely ignore this rule! Another rule I saw was to avoid the midi length since it can sometimes be too long but not long enough to be maxi. I wear my midi length skirts high-waisted so they fall at the right point and I love them. IDC if they make me look short, they're gorgeous!
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:I looove this aesthetic, it's my actual workwear, and funnily enough I dress this way because it does make me look older.  To stay age appropriate, the key is accessories. Socks that fit the aesthetic but are more playful, bows are great, and fun jewelry. There are so many looks, like plaid skirts, that I like but would never wear because they're better for a younger look. Also, if you don't already look older than your age it's probably not going to be a problem. If it does have that effect, it's not in an inappropriate way so it really doesn't matter.	episode_done:True

If your style is more gothic/steampunk inspired then maybe look for items that feature velvet, zippers, or black damask print. Or if you’re feeling more ethereal you could try some lace or satin.  You might also be able to get away with fun accessories as long as they’re not distracting.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else have “irony pieces”?	labels:A long time ago, a friend at work told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheapo pantyhose.  I looked down at my crappy nylons and actually felt cheap. I went to Nordtroms that night and bought presentable nylons and wore them to work the next day. She nodded in approvement and then told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheap sweaters. I then bought a wildly pretty ivory cable knit sweater and wore it to work and feeling quite exactly like 1000000 bucks AND i had fancy nylons too. She told me no one would take me seriously with my unkempt shoes and that's when I learned the power of a shoe shining kit.  The next day I wore crappy slacks...and, well you know how the story goes.  To this very day I wear natty clothes and shoes so shiney they can blind fleet of Greek warriors.  The only real irony is no one gave a tootie about nylons and yet I still wear them despite all evidence to the contrary....and she threw al hers away after our company got bought out by another and they were no longer required. (I point at my perfectly appointed knees).
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I'm a too femme to function lesbian and stereotypical queer fashion always leaves me feeling left out in the cold. I don't like how I look in flannel and doc martens. I really do like how I look in an embroidered satin maxi skirt.  Going back in time, I used to feel like I had only two options : butch or look straight. It was not a fun choice. Neither was right for me. I spent a lot of high school looking way more masculine than I really felt comfortable with. It was partway through college that I realized that I had a third choice. Perform the hell out of stereotypical feminity. Embrace the chiffon and satin but do it on my own terms.  I don't look exactly like your average straight woman these day. It's subtle but there's a difference. Well there's also the fact that I dress like I'm an escapee from a Victorian brothel. I play with feminity. I wear petticoats beneath skirts and dye my hair blue. It's not the same kind of feminitity as a the average straight lady. It's a conscious performance of femme and not an uncritical acceptance of gender norms. It works for me.	episode_done:True
text:Brands can hire their agents and thus have some say in the source of their labor though...  I tend to disagree that "it's business" is a reasonable response to unjust labor practices.	labels:The brand buyers and sourcing officers negotiate price, delivery, quality etc etc with the factory boss/owner. Time and time again the factory owner doesn’t pay or short pays the factory workers and blames it on the foreign buyers...the story is old and will continue for years to come...
text:Awesome to hear all these memories and perspective from someone who came up when these sweaters were still the primary option!  I also feel lucky that we're still in an era that all these are available as vintage.  Of course there will always be wool sweaters, but i do think vintage options will of course change over time.  I have a big wool chunky Aran sweater I mail ordered from Ireland years back.  That thing is indestructible and not a single pill or pull.  Though you make good points about the care of wool sweaters - I have made the mistake of putting other wool thru the washing machine lol.  My grandmother is a knitter and she taught me the basics, I can knit rectangles and have gone as far as knitting some simple hats.  But she has done some really complex sweaters- yes it gives a whole other perspective for what goes into making one by hand.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:I would say start looking into what specific fabrics do and how to clean and treat them. You can invest quite a lot in a good cashmere sweater, but if you don’t wash it properly no amount of money will safe it. Same goes for a skirt from a fast fashion retailer, is it worth the x amount of money if it is made from an acrylic fabric? Wouldn’t you rather pay less at a budget retailer for the same quality?	episode_done:True

Perhaps it's because I can no longer pass as a youth and will no doubt get thrown into the demographic these companies sell to, but it's always painful when you start to see a trend in clothes and you hate it, and it lasts YEARS.

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.
text:TheRealReal x Gucci	labels:It’s not generous. $1 for items priced $300-$15000? They have a huge margin.

I’m sure people can find deals from time to time but I’m not a fan of the site.

It gets below 32F here (US South East) often, even down into the 20s & teens.  My clothing currently consists of blue jeans, chinos, and some high top black & white converses. Would love something I could wear with both. I've looked into bomber jackets and pea coats. Not sure what all else I should look into. I know I like fitted clothing rather than bulky. My family keeps suggesting the big canvas carhartt jackets, but they are a bit big and bulky to be wearing with chinos on my way to work.  As far as price goes, I'm not sure what decent jackets/coats (or any clothing for that matter) go for. I'd like to stay under $100 though, but would go a little more for the perfect jacket that would last me a long time.  Any advice would be very appreciated!	episode_done:True

text:Yup I love Rayon and it does not have the shedding microplastics issue since it's made from plant material	labels:Each material has their own downside. Rayon uses a lot of trees (deforestation) and the chemical process to manufacture Rayon is pretty toxic for the environment.  Meanwhile cotton is a water hungry plant that kills the dirt's health. Plastic creates micropalstics like you said. It's almost like you can't win. But if you buy secondhand or deadstock new, it slightly better cause you're not putting new money into deforesting, pesticides, toxic chemical processes and such.  Linen / flax / hemp is technically the better choice to buy new. The plants require less water than cotton and doesn't have the plastic problem. Although any farming industry that gets big enough will eventually harm the environment one way or another.  It's really the insane commercialization of any manufacturing process that's bad for the environment. There isn't really any one magic material that's not going to harm the environment when it's mass produced for millions of people to consume.	episode_done:True

How) But I basically decided that I think I need to spend more time studying and gathering wardrobe inspiration, and taking care of basics. I also went to my local Fleet Feet and got fitted for proper walking shoes and a sports bra, so I can start exercising for my health. All in all, it's been a mix.	episode_done:True
text:DAE feel they made incredibly ODD fashion purchases, this year in 2020?	labels:I bought more designer clothes this year (AllSaints, DVF) because of the covid sales and I can definitely see a difference in quality compared to my usual clothing purchases. I think going forward I’ll save up for the right thing instead of settling for the “ok” choice with clothing.	episode_done:True

I have some other random pairs too that I wear less, like black glittery pumps from a wedding I was in, black velvet pumps, thigh high boots i hardly ever wear, etc	episode_done:True

text:What are you most comfortable clothing items (cute or not)?	labels:Nothing is as comfortable as an oversized tshirt and loosely fitted panties PERIOD.
text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I definitely went through a lot of style changes too!  Middle School- I wore what was “in.” Tight t shirts from Aeropostale and sweatpants from Abercrombie.   High school- I geared more toward my current look. Jeans and t shirts, or dresses and leggings/tights if the weather allowed. I was very much an Ann Taylor/Loft fan because of their petite sizing. Sometimes I wore slacks and t shirts because slacks are more comfortable than jeans imo.  College (right now.)- I wear a lot of things similar to what you described as your current style! Not nearly as often as I’d like due to weather and dresses aren’t always practical. I did just get a bunch of new stuff from Collectif if 40s/50s vintage inspired clothes are up your alley. They have a big sale right now too! I also would check out shoes from American Duchess and Remix Vintage if they’re in your price range	episode_done:True

text:How do I feel sexy at home in winter?	labels:If you try on like 5000 long sleeve shirts and sweaters, you might eventually find a few that really really flatter you. That’s what I do.	episode_done:True
text:What is something you've heard as fashion advice that isn't worth following?	labels:I don't think any fashion rule should be followed. You should take heed of them, but there just general guidelines and tips not the holy word of the lord. If you are self conscious of your wide hips, then it's a good thing to be aware that a lot of horizontal striped will exaggerate this. Doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't, just that you should be cognizant to check before buying any horizontal stripes. Pretty much every fashion rule *can* be broken, but it takes you understanding why the rule is the rule before you can understand how & when you can get away with breaking it   I think *most* attempts to inject color theory into style advice is overly reductionist and doesn't quite work for most people (*especially* for non-white people)  I also think that most shoe advice and recommendations should be ignored. If you do not like heels or are not good at walking in heels, than no, 2 inch wedged are *not* a "laid back summer look for a garden party". You're gonna look fucking ridiculous clomping around. On the other hand, if you *love* platforms and know how to rock them, then there's very few circumstances where you can't figure out a way to make platforms work. Plus, people don't pay nearly as much attention to shoes as you'd think anyway. For most people, it's not in our eyeliner of what we look at when we look at a person. So just wear what you like regardless of the kind of shoes deemed "appropriate". I think that with "Personal style", shoes are substantially more personal than style compared to other items.	episode_done:True
text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I really don't like uncomfortable clothes.  Sometimes I buy a few copies of my favorite pieces in different colors.  I search online for clothes with my favorite fabrics.  Modal cotton is one.  It's easier to be elegant and get away with repetitive clothing when you're wearing neutral colors and accenting with jewelery.

text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:Nah. I bought into that, and bought the dress. And honestly never used it.  The idea of having one dress forever is ridiculous. Styles change, bodies change, tastes change.   I’m not saying buy a dress that only fits one occasion but if you buy a dress you actually like regardless of colour or style/occasion you’ll probably get more use out of it.	episode_done:True

text:“I'm all locked down with nowhere to go – but that hasn't killed my lust for fashion”	labels:I'm still lusting over pretty fit and flare dresses even though I already purchased a couple of them online during the height of the lockdown last year. It's not like I'm going to be attending any events anytime soon. But I miss getting dressed up for stuff. It's too cold to wear dresses just for grocery shopping. I can't wear them around the house with a rambunctious nine month old kitten running around getting into constant mischief. But that doesn't stop from me from wanting to buy a couple more of them.	episode_done:True

text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I see business casual as an opportunity to express yourself a bit more. My casual Friday go-to is jeans (because I don't normally wear those M-TH) and a trendy sweater or blazer w/ men's type shirt under-- coordinating belt and accessories are a must for me no matter what day. Pair this with casual flats or boots. My Friday looks are less stuffy than my M-TH attire. I work in higher ed; it's not suits level attire M-TH, but managers on up shouldn't be wearing jeans during the week at my place of work. Friday is where I show a bit more of my personality. I never knew I had so much to say about casual Friday attire. lol	episode_done:True

I have a few thoughts on how to participate in the "spirit" of this theme:  • Fits that demonstrate a heavy amount of structure and "solidity," (i.e. a minimum of flow) while suggesting internal human movement (your fit is a building, with a person or people in it); an example of this a loose sweater or shirt layered under a heavy coat  • Fits that include details that suggest buildings and architecture: thick materials like leather and wool, metal jewelry (silver, stainless steel, etc) or wood jewelry  • Large caps, boots, tightly-tied scarves  • literally tie bricks to your shoes lol	episode_done:True

text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:Big plus one on filtering! I have a saved search of my favorite brands in my sizes in new or like new condition that I check periodically and more targeted searches like “wool and cashmere sweaters from 3 brands I like” that I use more often. Size filtering and material filtering can be the most helpful, as can brand filtering. Setting up a brand filter can take the longest but a big saved search of brands you like can help a lot in browsing.  Also plus one on payout—payout percentage increases with the dollar value of the item, and it’s so much lower effort for me to sell through them than through Poshmark. Poshmark takes forever and you have to spend so much time putting together good photos, detailed descriptions, and offers to potential buyers (plus then there’s the whole expectation of making you package cute with tissue papers and whatever to get good reviews). My time is just worth more than the additional payout I get from them. Thredup also will donate and recycle items they can’t sell, which turns it into a one stop thing for me. I will take my higher end items elsewhere for a first look, but if my local high end consignment shop won’t take it, I’ll let Thredup have a pass at it. Love the convenience factor.	episode_done:True
text:Wow thank you for that reply :) that really made me feel better. I guess the stranger thing isn't something to care about honestly, you're right.

Honestly I really appreciate other strange people's cool outfits when I see them on the streets. So, wear what you feel comfortable wearing, and if anyone shits on you for your choice of clothing, they don't really deserve your niceness anyway, they're not accepting how you want to express yourself and that is fucking shitty, but if anyone does, then wear whatever you like proudly just to spite their asses, likely they envy your boldness and your style anyway	episode_done:True
text:I’ve actually thought a lot about who I’m trying to impress with the logo and the short answer is, I don’t really know. None of my main circle would care either way.

Show myself I worked hard for it and was able to attain it because I wanted it? I don’t know it’s a tough question which is why I struggle on if the bag is worth the cost even if I can afford it.	labels:The best part of being able to afford something is that you can also afford to not buy it and just wait until you fall in love with a bag.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:Short of getting a bit of insider info, I think the only way to really have success at those stores is to browse them at least once a week (probably twice).  My aunt tends to go every other day and finds some amazing stuff…because she goes *every other day*.  She says it doesn’t take her long because she’s so familiar with their stock, but it still seems exhausting to me.  (As opposed to spending three hours scrolling through Poshmark in bed every night…)

text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it’s typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it’s a bottom, they no longer “stay up”. This usually happens with leggings or panties after about 5 or more years of regular wear with caring for the items properly.  I also had a faux leather jacket wear out after 6 years of regular wear. The faux leather ended up “peeling off” or something like that.

text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:Don’t forget to check out thrift stores. This is where I stock up on cashmere sweaters for a few dollars a piece, wool skirts, kilts, sweaters, vests, and cardigans, and amazing wool blazers and coats. I’ve found mint condition mohair and camel hair 3/4 coats for as low as $10, black cashmere sweaters for $2-3 and up, and cable knit pullovers for as low as $4. It’s amazing what people get rid of, not realizing how expensive it all is new. I also loooove wool in the fall and winter, and so this has been a super affordable way to build a dream cold-weather wardrobe.   The only thing wool I buy new are socks for the most part, everything else I’ve found at estate sales, garage sales, and thrift shops. When/if you go, definitely go through the boys and men’s departments, too. A bit of tailoring can make anything look custom like some of the pieces on Walker Slater maybe.
text:General Discussion - December 09, 2020	labels:God the shade towards fashion students in that thread was annoying.   I don’t mind if people didn’t like what Burberry did, but why shade fashion students **in a fashion sub**??   Do they not realize these people are working to be the same people that designed clothes that ultimately trickled to the blandness they wear?   Not only does it reek of typical tech-bro toxicity, but so reminiscent of Andy in that Devil Wears Prada scene about the cerulean blue sweater.

text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:As I gotten older, my weight has mostly gone to my thighs. So my emo/scene skinny neon jeans didn't really fit. I've also kinda changed how I view myself in general. So I've kept the music but changed the pants. I wear a lot of high waist loose/straight leg pants now. Most of my pants aren't jeans either. I've really gotten into other fabrics.	episode_done:True
text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:I wouldn't get too hung up on how to describe your style. I think social media pushes this idea of having a defined aesthetic, but in reality most of us have a mix of styles in our wardrobe and a lot of the images we save are more aspirational than practical.  It might help to think about why you don't dress more like the style you like - is it not practical for your life? Is it hard to find in your budget? Not translating well onto your body type? Lack of confidence?   There might be ways that you can work elements of the alternative style you're drawn to into your current basics. Shoes, accessories, and nail polish can be an easy place to start.   Or you might realize the style you like most just isn't a good fit for your daily life and decide to embrace it for special occasions instead! For example I love skirts and dresses but also enjoy getting down on the floor with my dogs and don't enjoy dealing with chub rub. So I don't bother with them at all most days, but you better bet I wear the heck out of them for nights out and parties (pre pandemic, of course).	episode_done:True

However it has an older look which may not be what you want. I wear my 40s one with crewnecks and jeans/sneakers and I think it looks fine, even more high end!  But yeah u/eon_of_love a few brands make them now in updated cuts. I don’t know off the top of my head but try Abercrombie, Suit Supply, and Jcrew.
text:Shitpost Saturday: Fashion is dead. This is now a house plant subreddit.	labels:I'm sorry, but you /buy/ house plants? Because i only make my succulents out of the finest silk thread I can find. Trendy and it will live longer than my cold dead heart.  In all seriousness, I'm super excited that my tomato plant decided it wanted to produce now instead of 2 months ago when the mosquitos were every where and I didn't want to go outside 😅	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:Short of getting a bit of insider info, I think the only way to really have success at those stores is to browse them at least once a week (probably twice).  My aunt tends to go every other day and finds some amazing stuff…because she goes *every other day*.  She says it doesn’t take her long because she’s so familiar with their stock, but it still seems exhausting to me.  (As opposed to spending three hours scrolling through Poshmark in bed every night…)
text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:Thrift / consignment stores are fantastic for jewelry shopping! Thrift stores usually have cheaper stuff like you’d find at F21 or H&M, but consignment stores have authentic pieces for fairly reasonable prices. If you’re really feeling the fancy stuff, I bought my high school graduation ring (white gold, green sapphire and diamond) at an antique store for about 100$ USD.	episode_done:True

Thing is I have the uniqlo airism short sleeves so whenever I wear a crewneck, my arms go into contact with the wool. :(	episode_done:True
text:Hot Southern Gothic Summer / Inspo album / Because we needed another for 2021!	labels:Oh lord. As a Southerner these clothes make me feel very hot! I’m a fan of poet/bishop style tops in gauze, cottons and linen. Airy high waisted skirts. Stetson’s Santa Monica straw fedora. Chantilly lace. Painted hand fans. White slip dresses in the vein of Liz Taylor in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. And the film Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 14, 2021	labels:I’ve been having some trouble lately trying to update my wardrobe. I am no fashionista but I know what looks bad and want to avoid it, hence coming to MFA maybe 6 years ago and developing a pretty solid BB wardrobe.   I’m trying to broaden my horizons now and get a more mature style, however I’m finding a slight mental stumbling block because looks now are the polar opposite of what was cool when I was 18.   Wearing doc martens with shorter cropped, loose fitting jeans and showing your socks would have been social suicide a decade ago when I came of age (skinny everything, trainers with everything). I like the look but I feel uncomfortable when I wear it - any advice on getting past this? My head knows it looks better than wearing them with my skinny jeans but my heart says “you will get bullied at school (work)”  TL;DR bought some docs, like them, but how do I stop feeling like a dork?
text:How do you guys find your style if you can’t try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:Little Old Lady here.  Comment on another post called my style "artsy androgynous".

Never aimed for a style my whole life I don't think, but this is how I ended up, clean, warm/cool, comfortable.	episode_done:True

text:Thoughts on jumpsuits?	labels:I drink water constantly and a few cups of tea a day so anything that is that difficult to take off is a no for me unfortunately.
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:So what works for me is whenever I'm getting dressed and there's an item I wish I had to complete the outfit I mentally note it. Make sure to think of the category of item Ex Black Cargo pants, Brown hoodie w/ no drawstrings and no logo, white chunky sneakers. Etc.   Then as time goes by, the categories that come up over and over are the most important to grab first and would improve the most outfits. I add them to a list  If I'm shopping and I want something but it's not on my list then I try to pass on buying it. When a deal pops up and it's something on my list it's a no brainer instant purchase.   I try to be patient and wait for items that meet all my picky criteria. If I'm not in love with it I don't buy it. If even one thing is not right, I pass.   And final thing is I aim high whenever I buy for these categories in quality and spend time hunting. Ex: If I have $250 for a jacket I try and wait till a $600 jacket goes on sale for $250. You can find investment worthy designer for near regular retail prices and it's worth the extra money.	episode_done:True

If you like their marketing of transparency and sustainability then Everlane makes a difference.

text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Don’t jump on trends...everything falls in and out of fashion if you wait long enough. Find a store/brand that you like the fit and cut of clothes on you and try to build a capsule wardrobe. Once you see what you like, you achieve a timeless look that doesn’t look trendy or dated. From there, feel free to incorporate fun pieces that can be easily added to other outfits like accessories or shoes.	episode_done:True

At least, they stopped asking me if I was getting married any time soon.	labels:Yes totally. And at least to me it feels like you planned it and you know exactly what you're doing.

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:I'm becoming more and more disappointed with JCrew and will only buy their basic t shirts at heavy discounts. Eventually, the tops always end up with a hole and stretch out quite a bit.  I've not shopped at GAP in over a decade, but I still own a pair of sweatpants from them that are now 20 years old. Yes, That's how well they have been lasting. I doubt that the current ones would hold up that well.  Anthropologie pants also always end up with holes and stretched out. The tops always feel very cheap to me when I look at them in the store. Even buying on sale is becoming not worth it.  I have tried Sezane recently and am very pleasantly surprised at the quality from the feel of it. It remains to be seen how well the pieces hold up. If they do, I'm ok with spending the extra amount if it's  going to last a decade.	episode_done:True

text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I casually browse AliExpress when I'm really bored, so I've got a really good eye for catching dropshipped products. This is why the only fast fashion sites I tend to use are SHEIN when their items are on sale. I've only bought 1 full price item from them because it had super good reviews.    Other than that SHEIN is basically dropshipped clothing that I *could* buy from AliExpress, but after shipping fees it would be about the same price and would take a month or more to arrive if it doesn't get flagged in Customs.	episode_done:True
text:Ellen McArthur Circular Economy Report: by 2029 Resale is expected to be bigger than Fast Fashion	labels:I hate to say it but it’s unlikely to happen any time soon especially in fashion. I mean in the first world we can’t even recycle the plastic we put out for recycling each week.   What’s the problem you ask? The cost of labour, energy and co2 omissions in first world economies.

I paid $30 to have them re-soled with leather in 2012 and my mom was so shocked because that's how much she paid for them in the first place.

I do adjust what I wear with it- reds or oranges can look overwhelming- but still dress pretty brightly! I stick to cool colors + neutrals (white, black, grey) so nothing clashes overmuch with the hair, and try not to wear the *exact* shade of purple as a shirt or dress (then I look like a crayon).  Wearing just black and white tends to glam me up a bit, at which point the hair acts as a bold accessory.	episode_done:True

text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:I kind of ran into this problem since I purged most my summer wardrobe last year, and the core of the rest of my wardrobe is dresses, which I just don’t like as much in summer.  I do think that if you’re just not going to choose separates over single pieces, foregoing them entirely is completely valid, once you’re not handicapping yourself.  What worked for me, since I ended up with a ton of midi skirts I really liked, but felt apathetic towards tops, was to just go the solid colour, traditionally flattering route (which I think is the smartest way of tackling elements of clothing you don’t care that much for.)  If I’m wearing separates, I’m always going to choose my bottom first, so not having to think much about what to pair them with is nice.	episode_done:True
text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:I think you're thinking either avant garde or couture runways? These are different from regular season fashion shows. Mainstream labels like Gucci, Versace, Tom Ford, etc show very wearable pieces in their regular fashion shows IMO.  Now designers like Iris Van Herpen and Guo Pei do very couture almost avant garde fashion that is not meant for daily wear. These fashions are more for their high end clients who want to be inspired and who may place orders for their pieces as a COLLECTORS piece.

And then we broke up, as one does with their teen boyfriend, and blah blah blah, after a while I was like, "wtf do I do with this?"  I was *never* going to wear it again and selling it felt a little mercenary.   I ended up giving it as a gift to a girl I babysat/nannied for when she turned 18. It was nice because it was a way for me to give it to someone I cared about and I was able to give her a much nicer gift than I normally would have. And now when I think about that particular piece of jewelry, I don't think about my imploded relationship with my ex, but my relationship that I had with this girl as she grew up.

I'm *so* tempted to buy a Ted Baker coat or dress as my first expensive single item, but they're especially unnecessary due to the pandemic. There's no point in spending that money when I'm losing weight and have nowhere to show it off in the meantime. I'm totally tossing some savings away for splurging later though.	episode_done:True

Once you have a board try and find similarities between the pins (for example ruffles, silk, strappy backs etc) and start searching up those things at stores that are within your price range.  In terms of comfort, look for materials you like and what silhouettes you’re into. If you tend to do tighter tops with more volume at the bottom then look for dresses that match that for example. If you know you like cotton blends look for those.    Also look for stores that carry petite sections or find a tailor in your area  Don’t go crazy trying to push yourself too far out of your comfort zone. Look for things that are your style but that you’ve never worn before.

Lots of thrifting and also cheap fast fashion. Doc Martens and other platform shoes. Very 90s/early 2000s. Long acrylic nails, false lashes. Really fun and can be a really “hot but trashy” style   Millennial fashion is more professional/better quality/structured. Linens, trousers, heels, sandals, etc. Frankly I think it has to do with millennials having more money. Low key hair, nails and makeup. Neutral colours and patterns. It’s a more mature style   I’m 25 so I get to do both 😎 woohoo	labels:Millennials have jobs and have moved up, gen z are still finishing college or are at school.

I bought some things that are comfy and I actually want to put on without actually just wearing my pyjamas or sweats all day and that’s helped a lot.

text:How to find non-custom tailored clothing for short men (under 5')	labels:Hey I'm a 5'1" man (not trans or anything, just have short parents) who had previously found myself in a similar situation. I now get most of my clothes from brands that have XXS. Uniqlo has been one of my go to brands, the sleeves are a bit long (maybe by 1") but that I get it tailored so that the fit is perfect even if it costs me an extra $15. Banana Republic's XXS size also fits nicely. That should get you through all tops, dressy and classy. Get the slim fit if it fits you better.  Outerwear like jackets I get from Uniqlo. JCrew XS back in the day was pretty good.  As for suits, I have so far gotten them custom made in India. Let me know if you find something that works for you and I might check it out.

I didn't see the issue and thought it was ludicrous to get rid of an entire closet of clothes that were still intact and fit me well, until I started getting more serious about my career as a professor and realized my "professional teaching clothes" still read as "student attending an award ceremony."  Starting over the summer, I began weeding through my closet and donating anything that didn't make me happy or I couldn't imagine myself wearing in front of a classroom of college students or colleagues (except for my loungewear and workout clothes.) I felt A LOT of guilt at first, because I realized how many pieces I held onto for the nostalgia or just because they fit. I had to invite one of my closest friends over to help me make the tough decisions and she didn't let me talk myself into keeping a piece I initially put in the donate pile. That really helped my perspective, and now I can make more objective decisions without needing a cheerleader.   Once I got rid of about half of my closet (spring/summer and fall/winter wardrobe combined,) I gave myself permission to buy a few higher-end pieces that are much more my style but also fit both my daily life and professional needs. Neutral colors and versatile silhouettes. I feel so much less stress and guilt when I open my closet now, it really feels like I've moved into a new chapter of myself. It's my dream to have a 10-15 piece capsule closet, but one step at a time.  I'm so sorry I just went on a big tangent. It's been an enlightening quarantine for me obviously lol.	episode_done:True
text:I second this! I made a note in my phone with all of my measurements and it's saved me a lot of time and money. Before I buy anything I compare my measurements with the websites size guide (I do it for each individual item) and select whatever size *they* have listed for my measurements.   These are measurements I keep personally:  Height Bust Band Waits Hips Hollow to Hemlines  Hollow to floor  Inseam:   For some of these (mainly bottoms) I jotted down my true measurements using a tape measurer and also took measurements of jeans that I already had that fit well.	labels:I did that too, but I don't have all of these.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 16, 2021	labels:Is there a reference for how Uniqlo U t-shirt colors look online vs. in person?  I've bought one before and while it was listed as orange (and looked as such in photos), it's really more of a brown.  I love the color but I'd rather see what they actually look like first.    There's a few examples online right now where a color is listed as blue but looks grey, or dark orange that looks like wine red.  Is there somewhere where people post what color (i.e. 29 dark orange) with a photo of the product?    Cheers!	episode_done:True
text:There is no unmarked woman	labels:Thanks for posting this, it’s given me some gender presentation things to think about.   Like, I am a trans man on r/femalefashionadvice and not on r/malefashionadvice specifically because I prefer “marked” fashion choices. The mfa subreddit is all so safe and subtle. Fashion from that approach seems to be more about price and posturing than the sort of things that interest me—cut, color, silhouette, textures, prints, all these aesthetic considerations are largely absent from male fashion.  I agree with u/sunmoonnife that class definitely plays a role here, and with OP that queer identity definitely changes one’s ability to go unmarked and adds some nuance on how marked clothing will be interpreted.	episode_done:True

text:Scene / Emo / Goth fashion in 2020	labels:Aside from graphic tees (which I've learned to make on my own now, but its a money sink unless you can find buyers to supplment it) almost everything I and my friends did in our youths were DIY. We added our own studs, spikes, zippers, straps, belts, etc. Obviously adding a pocket would require a little extra but it was possible and within a few tries you'd be golden. Adding patches, fabric strips and other misc. items and using fabric inks went a long way. One of our friends even started fabricating her own jeans.  We were into punk fashion though, so not sure how much of this advice applies to what you're looking for.  The best way to get what you want is to make it. Though there are some elaborate apparel items (like a victorian-inspired goth coat) that would be better off buying... but DIY will be a LOT cheaper and produce exactly what you want if you're capable.

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:From 2001-2005, clothing I wore as a high schooler/college kid: low rise bootcut jeans, fitted graphic tshirts, fitted polo shirts, fitted shirts in general (shirts were so tight- maybe that’s why we layered??), always layering shirts- and shirts were super long and over your hips, but tight- never tucking them in, cutoff denim skirts, cotton shorts (like soffees) with words on the butt, necklace with my first initial on it, platform flip flops, dresses with Hawaiian prints (like flowers or surfers etc), hoop earrings, fitted hoodies. That’s what I can remember.
text:THIS. I have been working on a lot of \~self improvement\~ this year and part of making my goals for 2021 has been distinguishing "the person I aspire to be" from "the person I am willing to be" from "the person I can afford to be."   I too have been on a journey to live a budget life of luxury especially when it comes to things like matching lingerie all the time and sleepwear and what I've realized is that I'm not actually interested in luxurious sleepwear. I'm actually interested in being the person that has two hours to unwind every night, takes a warm bath in a massive tub with a v expensive lush bath bomb, does a full face care routine, brushes her hair out, has little tinctures on her vanity to apply just a bit of perfume, puts on a silk gown, lights a candle, reads in bed, and turns out her lamp at a generous 9:30pm.   The truth is that the desire for the sleepwear is really a desire to have more silence, more time spent on me, and more time doing things that look and feel good simply because I like them and not because they serve any kind of real function.   I have moved away from using old t-shirts because I like the idea of dedicated sleepwear but I usually just go with a solid color cami / tank top / shirt and either some shorts or some sweat pants depending on how cold it is. They're cheaper but still look thoughtful.	labels:I think we may be the same person!	episode_done:True

text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:In this hypothetical I'd go with haute couture. In your friend's situation I'd keep looking until I found a designer I liked. Bespoke would be my last option for a couple of reasons. Your friend wants contemporary fashion, but most bespoke tailors make traditional clothes for a typically older crowd (you're in NYC though so there are some bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd; make sure you look for them specifically). The bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd don't have designs as good as high end ready to wear IMO. Tailoring and designing are different skills, and there's a reason Louis Vuittion, YSL, Dior, Gucci, etc pay their head designers millions per year. Of course some $4000 coats are worth more than others, so it would be good to know a bit about general quality.  Personally, I prioritize design over fit. I can deal with a less than perfect fit if I love the design of a piece. But I won't wear a piece if I don't love the design, even if it fits well.   The middle ground option is made to measure, or MTM. MTM for outerwear isn't as common for suiting, but it's out there.

text:Tips for feeling confident when wearing stylish clothes around family?	labels:Ease into it slowly. Start with a few blouses that are more your new style preference, and wear them with jeans/leggings. It'll instantly add a bit of polish without looking too different. In the cool weather now, sweater dresses are sexy and stylish but also not too far off from a hoodie. long sweeping cardigans over sleeveless blouses/tops and leggings means that you can probably wear that same top when it gets warmer without the outer layer and people will already be used to it.     Also, Chances are there will still be days you want to wear that super comfy soft hoodie so keep some of your favs (take it from someone who found themselves owning zero sweat pants at the beginning of quarantine and had to walk live around in "dressy" pants for a few weeks). But also, there's nothing quite as comfy as a baggy hoodie on the weekend or if you just want to run out to do a quick errand without getting fully dressed up.	episode_done:True
text:Do you guys default to a set of a few pieces even though you own a ton?	labels:yeah. i think once i figure out which 'default' items I tend to reach for.. i end up getting rid of the infrequent stuff, and buy more colors of the default thing.   lately im defaulting to turtleneck sweaters most of the time in cold weather... so I plan to buy 2 more colors.  probably get rid of the polo neck sweater or the long sleeve henleys.	episode_done:True

text:Black is Beautiful, Braids are Beautiful, Bald is Beautiful: Ayanna Pressley as an icon of feminine professionalism	labels:I think people just now are starting to really see the beauty in blackness, not just in fashion sense, which has always been apparent, but also in human terms.  I mean, black people or people of black skin color have been painted in very ugly and negative terms for hundreds if not thousands of years.  And that has been done by people of light skin color.  I have not seen a lot of examples of people of dark skin color vilifying people of white skin color, just based on their skin color alone.    This stuff has been around for thousands of years.  I think it really started with the Romans and the great lie they have perpetrated to steal the identity of Christ, because they could not contain the spread of Christianity despite the persecution of Christians after Christ's death.    The color black in fashion has always been wildly successful.  However, that success has never translated to black people or people of black skin color because of the concerted effort that has been done throughout millenia against them.  Black beauty is a light within which had been hidden from the world.  Despite efforts to reverse this coming to light, or as I would call it Black Enlightment, it is undeniable that this trend too is unstoppable.  Justice for All...	episode_done:True

text:+J/UNIQLO SPECIAL COLLABORATION: What’s the verdict?	labels:the outerwear is all spectacular and i think much nicer quality than regular uniqlo outerwear.  i thought the sweaters were a bit thin, which was slightly disappointing.  all the cotton items are pretty standard uniqlo cotton (maybe slightly smoother) but the cuts were fun. the silk items felt nice, but not as nice as more expensive silks (obviously). the silk knit shirts were less soft than the bow blouse but i think that's just the nature of knit silks?  the wool items were all fab. i got trousers and the skirt and love them both.  also EVERYTHING WAS SO BIG? i know some of the items were supposed to be oversized but the sizing wasn't consistent. i was my usual size in skirt/pants and sweaters/shirts, but i had to size down in the oversized items because they were too big. the hybrid down coat which i got in a M (my usual uniqlo outerwear size) fit like a L or XL. the cotton shirtdress which i also got in a M (for non-outerwear i am usually between a s/m in uniqlo sizing because i am tall, and generally go with a M for sleeve length) fits like a L, but for that one i can make it work by styling it differently. if they had it in a S i would have gotten that instead, tho.  generally i am pleased with what i got. i think for the price it's not bad, and i like the cuts of the pieces and higher than usual fabric quality, although some pieces felt more worth it than others.   i do NOT think it is worth buying at a markup tho. none of the pieces were particularly unique (except maybe some of the outerwear) and you would be able to find similar pieces from other places at a similar price point i think.

text:Indoor layers	labels:I have these thoughts almost every Fall. My inspiration Pinterest boards are filled with photos typically taken outside with individuals wearing amazing outerwear. Last year, I bought a camel coat (faux wool, because I couldn’t invest until I knew if I REALLY liked the look). I loved the look with the coat and I was so sad and torn to remove once indoors. So I guess that’s the TL;DR, I remove my outerwear indoors. Unless I’m quickly stopping in somewhere. But it was always a bummer to do because I love the look.  Aside from outerwear, I try to achieve other interesting layers in the form of either mid length structured cardigans, chunky scarves, slightly oversized tunics with tight sleeves (Free People-Esque), and/or bomber jackets that I’m comfortable leaving on indoors.	episode_done:True

text:My Wardrobe Post: Based on what I currently have, what should I wear with what? And an essay reflecting on learning to dress better.	labels:Christ you’re gorgeous and you’ve really put a lot of thought into this.  I looked at your albums (HS til work, and the wardrobe) and perhaps I might’ve missed it but I think you’d look great with a plain tee + button up (tucked in, unbuttoned 1/3 ~ halfway). Maybe roll your sleeves up too?  I also really liked the sweater + collared (I assume a button up) outfit, but I guess the Texas weather ain’t great for that—but I’d love to see you in smart casual. I’m curious how’d you look like with glasses in these types of outfit—it’ll lean towards the nerdy side if that’s your thing. I also think a plain white button up for work would be nice—although it’s common and boring if you wear it right it’ll look great.  Try cardigans? I only skimmed through your future purchase so if you were planning on getting it, oops.  And the Adam Driver resemblance is uncanny—I can’t tell if I prefer you with long hair. You look great in both the work/WAYWT length hairs.  Korean men fashion is somewhat similar to the Japanese fashion style but I think there’s more so if you wanna look into that too.   I know very little about men’s shoes but I think finding more (semi) formal (?) options (leather... etc;) would benefit your outfit in the long run.

text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:I think a lot of people here that say their clothing falls apart quickly aren't properly caring for their clothes.

text:General Discussion - November 27, 2020	labels:Hot take: speaking from experience, fetishistically optimizing the most basic of basics (e.g. "the best plain white t-shirt") for maximum imagined value is not a meaningful nor worthwhile exercise. Your wardrobe is not more interesting because your white tee is better than another white tee, and by the time you've found the 'perfect' piece either the prevailing trend or your own preferences will probably have changed.  'Perfect tee' threads are usually highly-upvoted, but the answers have drawn from the same pool for the last goddamn decade:  - *Vintage/workwear (generally heavier, boxier, shorter):* 3sixteen, Buzz Rickson's, Lady White Co. - *Streetwear (generally lighter, slimmer, longer):* Reigning Champ, wings + horns, John Elliott - *"Normal" (somewhere in the middle)*: Naked & Famous, Arket, American Apparel when they still existed - *Edgy goth shit:* Rick Owens mainline for lighter and DRKSHDW for heavier, Kazuyuki Kumagai Attachment, Voidthebrand when they still existed - *Budget*: Muji, Uniqlo, Everlane, Bella+Canvas, etc., but no one really cares  It's functionally a solved question. You can pick one from the applicable list for your style, and it'll be *fine.*

text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:I almost exclusively online shop. I wouldn't say that I am a trend setter or anything, but it is so much easier to look at photos online of people who have the same body shape as me whose fashion I admire, compare those photos to what I have in my closet, and purchase what is missing to make the outfit work all in one place. It sounds like a lot, but I find this so much easier, less anxiety-inducing, and less time consuming than brick-and-mortar shopping. Plus, usually returns are just a drop off somewhere with a digital reciept rather than waiting is line at a customer service counter with a paper receipt that I have lost twice, ripped, and had to tape back together. A little tidbit: the biggest trick to online shopping is to KNOW YOUR MEASUREMENTS!!! A cheap measuring tape works wonders.	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:I came to that realization a few years ago too, I used to be really into Zara and H&M and all that bs. Basically I've found a few specific brands and stores I really like, (Reformation, Realisation Par, Anthro, and Rokit Vintage to name a few) that I follow, focusing on sustainable/vintage/consignment shops. I get a lot of ideas from social media, my friends (I'm lucky cause they're mostly art students so they're always looking cool), movies (old and new),  and also just people watching. Like if I'm on the subway and I see someone wearing a great coat, I think about what I like about the coat (fit, color, silhouette, etc.) then I might go thrifting and try to find a similar piece, or a piece that has an element of whatever I liked about the inspiration piece. I did a wardrobe overhaul recently and I started with basics I loved and just built my way from there. It's hard to avoid trends entirely, but if you focus on what you really are attracted to you're bound to find your style. There's a lot out there, just keep looking for it!	episode_done:True

text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:Depends on what the day is like for me.  I have the Madewell Medium Leather Transport Tote currently as my daily go-to and I normally have my phone, keys, wallet, some basic toiletries (chapstick, eye drops, ibuprofen, candies in case blood sugar gets low) in a small zipped bag, and more often than I'd like there are some random receipts and other things that should be cleared out.  When I'm traveling, all the extra space in the bag is used for things like carrying a light cardigan, small water bottle, headphones, small notebook, and other necessities for the day. It's been great for it's versatility.  I've thought about the idea of getting a higher end purse, (I think the Neverfull Tote from LV looks nice) but I honestly can't seem to confidently justify spending 10x more on basically the same thing (large tote bag) I currently have. Would like to hear more on why people buy luxury items and their experiences!

Oh well I guess I'll just have to make sure I can return the next pair I buy
text:What are your go-to basic fall tops? I’m talking long sleeve tees, sweatshirts, turtlenecks etc!	labels:JCrew tissue turtlenecks are great for layering. Also, if you search for "supersoft yarn" on JCrew, they always have a couple of pieces in supersoft yarn in Fall/Winter and it is heavenly. I would stick with JCrew, JCrew factory is like Old Navy plus $20.	episode_done:True

text:[Inspiration] Jewelry	labels:Cool stuff. Looking at this got me wondering.  Every outfit there is definitely on the casual side. I’m always curious to see how it would look with business casual and business formal wear, without being over the top.  Working on Wall Street, the only jewelry I’ve seen are cuff links, watches, rings, and occasionally wrist beads or bracelets. There was one stylish black man who would wear diamond studs with suits but that’s about it.  Curious if anyone has examples of subtle jewelry with suits and business casual outfits.

Best I’ve come up with is Vessi but not a huge fan of the aesthetic. A bit technical looking for me.	episode_done:True
text:Who are your fashion idols?	labels:I would highly recommend Justine Leconte. Not necessarily for what she wears or designs, but I love her YouTube channel for the way she describes things and I feel like she has a good, practical approach to fashion. She is my idol for actually talking about color, shapes and styles for different people and how to get things that flatter you, not the model on on a shopping website. She also has a good, no nonsense approach to basics and I think her methods of building a wardrobe are easily adaptable to anyone’s personal style.	episode_done:True

I really just turned what was normal normal fit and maybe a half-size big to more of a tailored look and the actual, correct size.   I’ve also felt more confident which has led to slightly different looks. I’ve always been a little more of a conservative dresser but now I’m incorporating a few more styles into the wardrobe. Really nothing major but a few tweaks that I really love.   Side note: it is super frustrating that tailored clothes look off as soon as you lose weight. I had to completely rebuild my formal wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:Not a lot of people still wear hats, but I keep hearing that many people *wish* they were still stylish to wear... so please feel free to help make hats fashionable again!  Typical etiquette for hat wearing is that if it's a very small decorative hat--something that stays close to the head--you may wear it indoors, but if it's a larger hat, you take it off indoors.  With something like a cloche or beret, which isn't exactly tiny but also isn't oppressively huge, it follows nearly the same rules as a coat:  If you're just popping by on an errand, it's fine to keep it on, but if you're planning to stay a while, you should take it off.  This is especially true if you're visiting a place of hospitality--a friend or relative's home, for example, or a restaurant--where somebody is offering comfort and relaxation, keeping your hat/coat on might be seen as a rejection of their hospitality.

text:Stealing her style: Nicole Kidman as "Grace Fraser" in "The Undoing"	labels:Thanks for writing this - really nice to see both the why and the how of someone's style - the way you have styled is so awesome.  For me the two amazing stand out pieces are the purple skirt and the way you've styled those colours overall together. Even though the skirt is the statement and the colour should be overwhelming, it all comes together beautifully.  Also coloured tights :-)  Then the red skirt is similar - a stand out colour that is offset by the browns (love the boots - that's what drew my eye initially - I obviously have a boot problem :)  ) - and then you accent it with that goreous, contrasting green scarf.  I love Nicole Kidman's red/burgundy leather skirt and in the next picture in the series I find myself wanting the luxe skirt.

text:How would you style or rebuild your wardrobe around your holy grail fashion piece?	labels:I'll just start with the holy grail item, which is high-end denim that fits both my ass, waist, and thighs. I have an athletic build - big thighs, an ass, but not an enormous waist (but not hourglass, I'm rectangular by all definitions), and finding jeans that fit or even come close to fitting is a challenge. I don't want skinny jeans and am just fine with a high waist, but when I sit I need to not feel constricted and they need some stretch to accommodate my legs and butt. I went to my favorite denim boutique for a personalized shopping experience and tried on just about everything in my size. I bought some jeans, but they're still not what I was looking for. My favorite is my husband's old ass sevens that have a huge hole in the ass (that I still wear out in public because why not), but they're not super flattering, just comfy.	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite outfits to wear with white booties?	labels:I have white doc martens and I wear them with absolutely everything.

text:You were Cinderella!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:Yes, I do think our age definitely affects what looks dated to our eye.   I’m noticing that some younger men are wearing some strange iterations of 80’s color-blocked track suits that to me look very Golden Girls. Also, I’ve seen shirt and shorts sets on rappers made out of wild print fabrics exactly like the ones I made for my toddler 25 years ago.  I’m older, so I’ve seen a lot of trends come and go. We are now at the point where they are starting to repeat and are designated as “Vintage”.  I have cultivated my personal style over many years (boho/western), and have seen it done well by Ralph Lauren and most recently Christian Dior in 2018(?) and enjoy the idea of wearing the beautiful things I’ve collected until the end of my life.

text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:Kinda depends what you’re looking for. I love vintage, so small, local thrift shops in smaller towns can be a goldmine.	episode_done:True
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Also, this is a common rule, but no clothing that requires anything special to wear it - eg a shirt that only works when you switch around the bra straps of your convertible bra, a dress that requires shapewear to look how you want it to look, a wrap blouse that has to be pinned into place after you put it on, a shirt that requires another shirt underneath because it’s see-through - all of those are a no for me. If it doesn’t work with just my regular underclothing (except for choosing nude underclothing for light pieces) I won’t buy it - I just know by now I’m not going to make the effort to wear it when I could just put on something easier that I like just as much.
text:What was the last addition to your wardrobe in 2020 and what was / is going to be the first addition to your wardrobe in 2021?	labels:The last item of 2020 was a camel colored Sherpa sweater from Aerie.   My first purchases in 2021 were leggings, joggers, new sports bras/bralettes, and soft t-shirts. We were unsure for a while at my office how long we'd be working from home, but it looks like it's going to be through at least early summer, so I wanted to beef up my lounge wardrobe since I've basically been rotating through 2 pairs of pj pants and a bunch of ratty 10-year-old t-shirts.	episode_done:True
text:I don't find that at all. I watched a video where 4 women with different body shapes all tried styles that weren't supposed to be flattering. At the end of the video, the opinions hadn't changed.  I do see how that can be limiting & believe that people should wear whatever they want regardless though.	labels:Right sometimes the rules make sense.  I was scrolling through Pinterest and looking at vintagey fashion rules, where they would actually tell fatter women “HEY don’t wear this - you will look like a refrigerator”.  I am all about wearing whatever you want and defying every “rule”. But it’s kind of fucking annoying when I want to dress to look my best and most flattered and every resource out there is saying “YOU GO GIRL you can rock ANYTHING YEAH”. It’s almost an EXCUSE to not have to do any research or have any design knowledge.  Honestly the whole “wear whatever you want” kind of ignores fatter women - like, oh I realize literally everything that’s “in” right now is not flattering on you because it’s made for a straight thin body - but IDC - fend for yourself. But I will hide this thought process behind “THERE ARE NO RULES - you’re beautiful and can wear ANYTHING”.   Tell it like it is. God I wish someone had told me to never wear mom/boyfriend jeans.	episode_done:True

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.
text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession). I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession 🤣

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:New Orleans is super humid all summer. Dresses, shorts, and athletic/moisture wicking fabrics will be your best friend.   You’ll be able to get by with one coat that you may never wear. I have pictures of me at Mardi Gras (in February) in short sleeves and jeans, perfectly comfortable.   Light cardigans for going inside are a great idea for southern summers. They have to blast the AC just to control the humidity.   It’s also important to consider what that humidity will do for your hair!
text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Expand your definition of "statement piece" to include texture, pattern, silhouette, and x-factors instead of just colors vs neutrals. A shiny pant makes a statement even if it's black. An oversized blazer makes a statement even if it's tan. A snake print bag or skirt  makes a statement even if it's shades of brown or grey.   Some other ideas that might help: make color decisions based on seasons - if you have a lot of winterwear you love in a certain color scheme, start there and weed out what doesn't go with those faves, and so on with the other seasons. Make pinterest boards with the colors you're considering. Take pictures of combinations you like. Consider what colors you like best on yourself.	episode_done:True

text:> on the flip side, why do bowls of pho or hand-pulled noodles cost severely less?  Same reason why, in popular culture, food from France, Italy, etc. continue to be considered atop the hierarchy of global food while food from India, China, Thailand, African countries, etc. are not.   Not that that's the only reason, but it is one of them.  >why does a plate of carbonara cost $20 in LA and NY?  You'll also have to consider that restaurant pricing in places like LA and NYC will just be higher on average, in addition to the dumb prestige-premium associated with ordering "French food" and "Italian food."	labels:	episode_done:True
text:The Very Useful Black Sweater	labels:>And black leathers don’t acquire the  patina that makes a pair of well-polished, well-worn brown leather  shoes so handsome. In fact, giving up square-toed black shoes in favor  of more anatomically correct brown ones became something of a rite of  passage for well-dressed men.   This is quite a reach. But then again it does feel quite reminiscent of nearly MFA where brown red wings were the best choice a man could make.
text:No clue about winter wear. Please Help!	labels:As most other commenters have already provided recommendations on coats or sweaters, I'll just touch on the layering aspect. You don't need to size up to account for layering; most base layers such as undershirts, thermal shirts or long johns are already designed to be close to the skin so you can have a dress shirt, trousers or sweater over top.   Just buy TTS and will be fine. It may seem a little snug at first but that's also to make sure you get that extra warmth.   One thing to consider is getting a beanie to protect your head from wind and the cold. This can range from Acryllic, wool blends to cashmere but really depends on your comfort level to certain materials. Some people find acryllic to be very itchy so you'll need to try a range.	episode_done:True
text:Sewing your own clothes	labels:Definitely worth the time! Aside from producing clothes that you want and that fit you, you are developing transferable skills like manual dexterity, decision-making and problem-solving.   Not sure what you mean by lounge clothes, but if you mean clothing made from stretch jersey, you need either a machine that does zig zag stitch or (ideally) an overlocker machine. If you try to sew stretch fabrics with a standard stitch, you will either end up with puckering or a garment that doesn't stretch at the seams, or more likely both. If you have the right machine, it is no harder than sewing woven fabrics once you get the hang of it.
text:General Discussion - December 02, 2020	labels:Spotify basically confirmed to me that I don’t have any taste in music. Apparently I listened to over 400 different genres. Listened to the same song 300 times in three days (I remember writing a 15000 word paper from scratch that week). I do tend to use music for its psychoactive properties more than anything else.  Fashion: my partner noted that most of the stuff I bought this summer looks like stuff they still own from 10 years ago. Checks out.
text:inspo album for city boys: popeye magazine	labels:I always find it interesting how Popeye take a classic item or style from one place and frame it or style it in a Japanese way. Usually looks good but when it’s a look that comes from the same country as me it can be pretty hit or miss. They did a football (soccer) style sample with English football shirts and scarves and just looked ridiculous to me. Sometimes the same with Barbour and how it evokes the country/ shooting crowd on the UK.   Anyway, not sure where that came from, but great inspo man!	episode_done:True
text:How to Combat Fashion Apathy?	labels:I just went through my closet earlier today and pulled out a bunch of stuff that I won’t wear anytime soon and bagged them up. I realized that since I won’t be going back in to office for 3-9 months, that this is just the tip of the iceberg. By the time things are semi-normal all my clothes will be out of style. I hadn’t purchased much over the past couple years since I was pregnant and then I slowly lost weight. So my wardrobe that fits now is circa 2016. I could probably get rid of 90% of my clothes and not miss them.	episode_done:True

text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:I feel that a lot of how to be fashion forward comes down to confidence and fit. You should never feel pressured into wear something you feel uncomfortable in. Sometimes having well-fitted T-shirt and jeans can make you look put together.  With colour, I find that you have to find the right colour that suits your skin tone. And tat involves a lot of trying on different colours at the shops. I used to hate wearing colour until I found the right shade of warm fuschia that really made my skin glow. Since then I've tried on loads of different colours and find that loud warm colours tend to suit my skin tone. I usually wear the bright colours on the tops and wear neutral bottoms (black, navy, grey etc.) so I don't have to think about matching colours.	episode_done:True
text:What was your first 'expensive' fashion purchase?	labels:It was 2009, I was on a business trip to a place that had the first Tiffany store I'd ever seen. I'd just gotten my tax refund and I was positively salivating over an oval tag Return to Tiffany necklace.   I was 25. I rented my very first rental car, printed out my map quest directions, and set off in the direction of the mall.   Entering the store, I had the distinct feeling that I didn't belong there. Everything is so SHINY. Fuck it, I took my time and drank it in. A very coiffed woman asked me if there was anything she could help with. I made my move. I ordered up my dream luxury necklace. She was polite, but skeptical.  It was laid out on a display board, so close to being mine- its little Tiffany blue bag set neatly beside it.   Wrap it up- I'll take it! I'll be passing on my cheap knock off oval tag, it's the real thing, baby!  $330. I'd never spent that kind of money on anything. My rent was $400, FFS.   Guess who forgot to tell the bank I'd be traveling? This girl. STRAIGHT UP DENIED.   The looks of "knew it" as I left the store penetrated my soul. I've had walk of shames that were way less shameful.  I called the bank and eventually got it sorted and went back for my necklace.   I haven't worn it in probably 8 years at the least. Don't even know if they still make them.	episode_done:True

text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I mainly thrift, but I'm a stickler for trying things on in store and since I don't feel comfortable shopping in person anyways, I've finally sucked it up and tried out Depop.  It's been about 5 years since I last did any online clothing shopping, but I've had pretty good luck with it so far, but I've got a good eye for what shapes are gonna work for me, and I always message the seller about something before I buy.  I probably would have picked up a couple of things for Asos, but they don't do video anymore, so I'll probably try and tackle Poshmark next for some of the more fun pieces on my list.	episode_done:True

text:Thank you.  I used Eucalan wool wash on the Richmond Knitwear cardigan, it's a no-rinse wash with added Lanolin. I found the itchiness was somewhat mitigated after adding back some of those natural oils. The cardigan took 4 days to dry, but it was worth it. I'm a lot less sensitive to itchy wool than most people I know, so I'm already at an advantage though.  There's no point in having a garment you don't like wearing, so if the itchiness is such that you can't abide it...keep looking. As I said the Winston & Co. is very soft, but the quality of the wool is excellent and the final wash contributes to the soft handle.  Scottish waters are renowned for being balanced, so when rinsed they allow for a nice finish without damaging the fibres. Often times wool can be treated as part of its finishing process to soften it, but this treatment will degrade and shorten the lifespan of the yarn.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:Personally I try to avoid maxi dresses. I just feel that because the wedding party is often wearing floor length dresses I don't want to look like I'm trying to be part of the wedding party when I'm not. For this reason I also don't wear whatever the wedding colors are. So I would try to get a few different colors of dresses so that way you can try to avoid looking like you're trying to be part of the wedding party.  Also don't get too short or revealing, you don't want to look like you're trying to take away from the bride's attention. Also don't wear white for this reason.	episode_done:True
text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:A well fitted black wool coat in a cut that flatters you. It goes with any outfit.

text:Has anyone lost their wardrobe creativity as they’ve gotten older? How do you get it back?	labels:Read the Curated Closet if you want to really hone in and define a personal style and how to wear it. Great tips about how to buy clothes purposefully, how to accessorize, how to identify quality, etc.   As far as the aging thing goes - I’ve found I just become more myself. I don’t buy into trends now. I know I won’t wear a color that isn’t navy so I don’t bother buying it. No velvet. No shorts. Etc etc. I just have less time for navel gazing and bullshit. Maybe because I’m a nurse in a pandemic who is also in perpetual grad school. Or maybe because I finally have money now to buy what I really want? Either way. No real advice but just a question to think about what you actually want to wear for who you are today. Not an imaginary person who doesn’t live your life with your budget and your body and your friends, ya know?
text:Do you think fashion or style has age restrictions?	labels:I'm 35 and wear crop tops and high waisted jeans. Why do so many people on this sub care so much about what others think about them?

I don't want to discourage you, just my two cents as someone who had a very similar thought process  I went back to tank tops and sweatpants and I find I appreciate them a lot more now. I make sure they fit properly and don't have stains or holes so I still feel reasonably put together.

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "How to Determine Your Body Type" and "On Dressing Your Body Type"	labels:So, I'll start. I definitely fell into the trap of both not really understanding my own body and trying to look like a tall slim hourglass all the time (which is not my body.)   Taking the time to really understand silhouettes and how to adjust them for my body was a huge breakthrough for me, as well as readjusting my thought process toward "what do I want to emphasize?" vs "Is this flattering?"   Being more thoughtful and critical about the difference between something looking good and something emphasizing the "tall slim hourglass" was also really helpful. So much of fashion that we feel is objective is actually about our eye and what we train our eye to perceive as good. Getting away from that, and training my eye to see the tall slim hourglass as one silhouette among many, really helped me wear things "I couldn't pull off."	episode_done:True

text:Naked and Famous Raw Denim Review/Fit/Experience	labels:It's a bit pricey but one option is having jeans altered to fit. Either by a competent tailor who is willing to **alter from the inseam** (and preserve the selvedge outseam) or a speciality shop like Railcar Fine Goods that you can mail your jeans to. RFG lets you take in the waist by up to 2" and you can specify your preferred thigh, knee, opening, length down to the quarter inch. I'm a guy with meaningful waist and hip/seat divergence, though not nearly a 10" difference like many women, and have relied on RFG to fix some issues. There are other shops in the U.S./Canada that do similar and similarly good work. RFG also carries women's cuts.  Just want to note that with 100& cotton / non-stretch fabric, you won't be able to have a super narrow leg opening since it'll be impossible to put your legs through. Relatedly, it's not the same, but maybe you can get your raw denim fix in the form of a jacket? Potentially not a Type 3 depending on your chest measurements but various other jacket iterations might be easier to size for.	episode_done:True

text:All things K-Fashion!	labels:I love k-fashion and tbh it’s the biggest inspiration for my style. I got into Korean things in elementary school so it’s been a long time. There is (or was) a huge kfashion community on tumblr which I’m a part of. I’ve collected a list of 100+ stores through the years but some of my favorite brands are the big ones like stylenanda and chuu. When I think of kfashion, especially in the past 5 years or so, I think of very minimalistic in terms of color pallets with interesting silhouettes. What you see in most kdramas isn’t necessarily what’s trending on the style blogs and online stores.	episode_done:True
text:Matching shoes & purse	labels:I don’t think fashion has any rules anymore unless you’re royalty or it’s cultural.   I personally don’t like matchy matchy bag and shoes unless I’m going for a monochrome look. I tend to match tones rather than colours. I like a patterned bag (say Gucci dionysus or Fendi zucca or LV canvas) as opposed to patterned clothes because I find they blend in well with a variety of outfit choices.   If I do colour, I will make sure the tone matches. I can’t stand mixing warm times with cool tones. Eg I have a cool tone lilac paid of heels that I love wearing with my cool tone magenta bag.   You can also do opposite sides of the colour wheel with shoes and bags like a green bag and a purple/magenta pair of shoes. But again keep to the same tones. The key with fashion is the tone of colours, and that includes neutral colours too. I would always suggest everyone does a colour/tone analysis and then stick to buying items in that range. It makes mixing and matching easier.

But when I get home, I still have stuff to do (take the kid to the park/play, go to the store, chores, etc...), so I can’t just slip on pajamas and call it a day (as much as I'd like to).  So, I’m looking to find out the men’s equivalent to yoga pants... that is, active wear that I can chase after the kiddo, and/or run to the store and not look like a total schlub... and maybe get my ass checked out periodically, lol.  If it helps, most weekends, I’m in jeans and a button down, maybe hiking pants and a technical shirt.  Thanks!

text:Where do you get good quality, legit wool sweaters that won't rip/shrink after washing?	labels:My woolllies are Benetton's. Most of them came from Italy and they are 100% wool, sometimes mixed (a bit of cashmere, angora). I have a couple from NZ - these are 100% merino and not Benetton's. I also have a few handamde so they don't count here.  They are old, though - or vintage.  Apart from my Kiwi jumpers, as said here alteady, which can be machine washed (but in cold water, delicate cycle and inside a mesh bag), you cannot wash them in the washing machine. They may not rip if inside a laundry bag, but they will certainly felt. Somebody told me the spin cycle is what destroys them, but my machine spins while rinsing as well, so it's a no-no anyway.   Using Woolite is enough to make them last for many years. Good quality wool jumpers will last a very long time if well cared for.  Having said that, I must confess I absolutely loathe washing anything by hand. So my woollies don't get worn a lot anymore....  They are > 10 yrs old btw  Good luck!!	episode_done:True

text:I think actually the issue is they went from being family owned private businesses to parts of conglomerates who are publicly traded. Growth is king. So they need to sell a lot more product or be more expensive or both to increase revenue and profits.  Luxury has become trend driven and decreasingly focused on craftsmanship to keep up with the quarterly numbers and growth targets.   Handbags, makeup, sunglasses, and perfume are very profitable and open the door to lower end customers.   The street wear trend is a boon because manufacturing and materials costs are very cheap, design needs are minimal, and it sells for a huge markup.	labels:>Family owned private businesses   Oh how this can come back.	episode_done:True

For example: “To be elegant is first of all to know oneself, and to know oneself well requires a certain amount of reflection and intelligence. Consequently, a woman who is utterly stupid will always find it extremely difficult to become truly elegant.”
text:Let's talk about sneakers	labels:Probably depends on where you live.   When I was in elementary school in the 90's, the chunky adidas were popular like the superstar. In middle school, the nike AF1s high tops were really popular and also the K Swiss sneakers and the Phat farm ones (throwback). But they resembled the classic adidas stan smith/superstars. In high school, I remember wearing really chunky "skater" sneakers and slip-ons. I remember wearing DCs. In college it was the chucks. Then after I graduated it was those suede vans, and the slip on vans as well as the keds. Now I see a lot of stan smiths, superstars, AF1s, chucks, common projects and those adidas NMD / yeezy. I have yet to encounter more than a hand full of people wearing those big chunky sneakers at all. Only a few who were tourists.  TBH it just feels like everyone just wears whatever the popular sneaker of X company is, and since all of the above are still around, and because social media bubble aesthetics influence groups of people to choose whatever shoe suits them from whatever popular company, the outcome is that all of those sneakers are still very much alive and kicking....	episode_done:True

I had a reminder set to skip and so most months I didn’t spend any money, but one month I forgot and got charged. I was so mad that I cancelled right away (which was easier than I worried it would be). In hindsight, I don’t like this set up and wouldn’t sign up for another rewards service that has a risk of being charged. I just want to buy (or not buy) things when I need them and not have it be dictated by needing to get something by a certain date.

text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:I helped teach my mom self love! She grew up without a mom (fuck cancer) and always struggled with depression, eating disorders, and self esteem. When I was growing up she tried but didn’t know how to teach me to have self confidence, and I picked up a lot of her insecurities. She eventually encouraged me to go to therapy (for other reasons) and I helped pass on a lot of the tools I learned for self love. My entire childhood she almost exclusively wore my father’s clothes, who was much larger than her, so none of the clothes fit and she never picked them out for herself. She still doesn’t care too much for fashion but she now buys clothes for herself that make her feel good, instead of just wearing clothes to be clothed.	episode_done:True

text:Totally.  To me, Gen Z is a lot of clothing that isn’t work appropriate but super fun. A lot of crop tops, bra tops, spaghetti straps, usually some tummy showing, and then some baggy pants. Lots of thrifting and also cheap fast fashion. Doc Martens and other platform shoes. Very 90s/early 2000s. Long acrylic nails, false lashes. Really fun and can be a really “hot but trashy” style   Millennial fashion is more professional/better quality/structured. Linens, trousers, heels, sandals, etc. Frankly I think it has to do with millennials having more money. Low key hair, nails and makeup. Neutral colours and patterns. It’s a more mature style   I’m 25 so I get to do both 😎 woohoo	labels:It’s certainly a great time to be in your mid 20s rn (well apart from COVID...) 😺	episode_done:True
text:How do you separate your laundry? I’ve been separating it by “type” but everyone I know does it by color. Now I’m starting to wonder if I’m doing something wrong, but washing black underwear with black jeans just bc theyre the same color sounds so odd to me	labels:I always have my whites separate because it keeps the white 'crisp'.  I've found that washing whites in a mixed load can make them go dull or a bit grey looking. Sometimes I will put one or two light pastels in with them if I need to make up a full load- but only if I know they're colourfast.  I don't separate out all my other colors though.

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:If I picture my mom's typical winter outfit it was a sweater with snakes wearing sombreros and margaritas embroidered on it, a burgundy "sweater jacket" with fringe, and a pink/orange/green bucket purse.*  So I guess she taught me "fuck it, wear what you want", but it did take me a while to adopt that attitude.   *tbf, this was a look for moms in the 90s

text:What “statement pieces” are you looking forward to wearing this fall?	labels:My wardrobe is almost entirely different pieces of black clothing, so I picked up a pair of faux leather flare pants at the beginning of summer and can’t wait to finally wear them! I’m typically an avid leather jacket-wearer in the fall and winter months so I’m excited to incorporate the material in a different way this year.  Also just mixing and match different textures is something I love doing this time of the year considering I live in a relatively cold place (Colorado), so layering a bunch of different cozy fabrics is something else I’m excited for!	episode_done:True
text:Recent Purchases - January 03, 2021	labels:Prada - Men’s Nylon Crossbody Bag. Quality is good however, it seems Prada have started outsourcing to China.

Cole Buxton T-Shirt - Simple staple for the wardrobe, quality is impressive. Cotton has a heavyweight feel.   Roger & Gallet L’Homme Menthe - Recently smelt this as a sample with an order from a beauty website. A nice clean masculine scent. A nice stand in aftershave for everyday use. Comes in 100ml and is relatively cheap  Arte Antwerp - Purchased a scarf from this company, we made piece, nice and thick perfect for walks in Jan & Feb	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:You don't have to make your own clothes, but learning to do some basic repairs (reattaching buttons, patching a small hole or fixing a split seam with needle and thread, maybe using a sweater shaver/depiller or waterproofing your leather shoes) can be really helpful in making things last and look nice longer - so maybe your 2 pound shirt lasts 3 years instead of 2, which means you don't need to buy as many in the long run.	episode_done:True

And people never ever shut up about how it was a selfish, childish 'fuck you' but never stop to think that it was THEIR project to do whatever they fuck they wanted with. People don't respect artistic and non-traditional business endeavors so they will never understand the issue with handing it over to someone else or compromising on the voice or vision of the project.

text:This is super important. When people talk about "making sure a suit fits" they're usually talking about how it *looks*, rather than how it *feels*, but both are important.   One of my first "adult" suits was a really basic, cheap OTR suit I got when I was about 22. It technically fit my body and when I asked others for their opinions on the matter (including fashionable friends), they all agreed that it fit me well, and I looked good in it. There was always some nagging issue with it though that I could never put my finger on. I only realized after owning it a couple years that the pants rise was about an inch lower than the rise I wear on my jeans and chinos. It wasn't "low" mind you, again, it technically "fit" fine, but it's not the rise I'm used to and the rise I like the *feel* of on my body.  Some issues with "fit feel" can be fixed with tailoring, but others can't. If a rise is too high you can probably get it shortened- if it's too low, there's probably nothing you can do about it. Always worth keeping in mind that a little extra fabric can be reduced, but if something is pinching, pulling, or hugging you a little too close, you might have the wrong garment on.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I wouldn’t call it a uniform per se, but I think I’m a very “formulaic” dresser when it comes to everyday workwear and casual wear.   For a work day, it’s always black loafers + black pants + simple top, whether it be a sweater or blouse. I work in a very conservative industry but my office is usually pretty casual, so I find this formula is best for most days and I can throw on a blazer or heels I keep in my office if needed. I would hate to be in a situation where I have to run to a meeting short notice, which happens more often than I’d like to admit, and look like a sore thumb in terms of casualness compared to the other women in the room, who are usually a lot older and more advanced in their careers than I am. I pretty much only wear the same jewelry everyday for work too.   For going out and weekends, it’s usually fun shoes + jeans + nice top + a fun element, either a statement bracelet or statement earrings.   I think my style can get a bit predictable in that I own the same pair of black pants 4 times and 3 pairs of very similar loafers, but I have fun items like cheetah ankle boots I’m obsessed with to make it fun, but can also get away with for work. I echo previous comments about fussing over tops though with this formula, and the idiocy of men copying Zuckerberg or Jobs with the uniforms... don’t they realize that they don’t/didn’t look particularly good??	episode_done:True

I have the greatcoat, boots, belt, Ruby holster, splatter mask, ARS-17 gas mask & gas mask carrying tin, and an Adrian helmet. I just tried it all on, and I'm really liking how it looks. I'm a bit too old to go trick-or-treating, so I'll be giving out candy in it if any kids come to the door. I can also hide my real mask under the gas mask, which is cool. The only major piece I'm missing is the pants (the greatcoat covers a lot of the legs), and I would also love to make a pair of vienot lenses for the gas mask, which are those spider-web eyes that stop the lenses from blowing inwards from the concussion effects of explosives.	episode_done:True

text:Help needed for buying jeans online! All advice is welcome!	labels:I finally bought a pair of 501s from the Levi's site.  After hours of scouring size charts and online fit testimonials, I *still* wasn't sure about size/inseam. So, on a day with a good sale, I actually bought SIX PAIRS and returned five of them. I regret nothing! If you have the disposable income to pay up front and wait for the refund to be processed, I highly suggest getting all your options so you aren't left wondering if you really have the right size or ordering another pair to try on.    Edit: as /u/fartymcfly22 pointed out, you might want to check that the company doesn't just throw away their returns before ordering duplicates like this!

text:Wish we could just ban people for this shit  Any conversation around "you have to be attractive/tall/skinny to pull this off", when taken to its logical conclusion, is just people saying that people that don't fit Western beauty standards look objectively bad *at all times* regardless of what they're wearing or doing  Like I've seen people say that if you're short or if you're overweight you can't wear "x", but the "x" is basically everything, and they never seem to reach the point where they admit that they just think that the best certain people can hope for is inoffensive or unnoticeable, which disgusts me	labels:I've talked about this before but a lot of these "rules" that people talk about like "don't wear $thing if you're $characteristic" have to main parts to it:  1.

text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:In art school, we learned about finding out own aesthetic. Finding it involved copying others' work for a while (never for profit, btw). We learned how to develop our own hand in this process, what worked for us and what didn't. In turn, our aesthetics became really a combination of several other artists.   I think fashion and style is the same. There's influences of who we follow, but the more we try and experiment, determining what works for us and what doesn't, is when our unique style will emerge - and it'll still even then be a combination of several other styles. Experiment, figure out what's important to you in your own style. It takes time and intention.	episode_done:True

text:How many handbags do you have and which one is your most used?	labels:I also have 0 essentially.  Well not totally true, I have a convertible Ebag laptop backpack for work, and I have an old The Sak of my mothers for when I have to carry a purse, that I hold in the direction that does not show the stain.  I'm not trying to be those people who chime in on a fashion sub all like "I hate fashion" lol.

text:What pieces would you love "backups" of?	labels:This is pretty uninspired, but I have a lot of basics that I wish I had bought in duplicates, but didn't buy in duplicates, because I figured they were basics and I could always just get more.   Alas. The styles changed just a bit, and now I can't find the plain white tanks and tees I want because the sleeves and the neckline and the length are all just a tiny bit off. Thank you for reading along, this not-a-real-problem is very frustrating at times.
text:Future of fibers?	labels:Personally I don’t find it very difficult or expensive to shop for clothing made with natural fibers — if anything it’s gotten even easier to do so with online shopping and websites showing fiber content right in the product description. I don’t have to seek out brands that specialize in natural materials either — my clothing is mostly from Madewell, which doesn’t really market itself as being all that environmentally conscious or sustainable, and is definitely not a high end brand, but they have tons of options for clothing made of cotton, silk, etc.   I will say it’s gotten harder to find sweaters made of 100% wool over the years, however. I have several wool sweaters from mall brands that I bought just a few years ago. I gained some weight since then and have been looking for replacements from the same exact brands and it seems like they don’t even bother with 100% wool anymore, all of their sweaters are now made with acrylic, nylon, polyester, etc. That’s the only natural fiber that I feel has all but disappeared from the mainstream for some reason.   I will also add that I don’t think man made fibers are necessarily “cheap”, either. We’ve come a long way from man made materials of the 80s and 90s. When I think of man made fibers of today, I think of technical clothing and gear such as outdoor or sportswear. Patagonia for example is the poster child for environmentally friendly brands, but most of their clothing is made from man made materials, and their products are far from cheap. Partly because it performs better for its purpose, and partly because it’s supposed last a lifetime.  Which leads me to my last thought — IMO man made materials aren’t necessarily bad for the environment. It’s really our habits that are bad, and the industries that cater to these habits. If we all bought a few items of clothing that were all man made and lasted our lifetime, that is arguably *more* environmentally friendly than if we were constantly buying and throwing away natural fibered clothing.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 16, 2020	labels:Every time I purchase dress shoes, they have lacing that is quite odd, and I am trying to figure out why they are that way. The lace comes out of the top right eyelet, but the other side does not come out of the top left eyelet (across from it) which is needed for tying the shoe. Instead, the second lace comes out of the bottom eyelet on the left side, meaning the a lace exits from top R and bottom L. This has happened with multiple pairs of shoes now, and I am wondering why the stores sell the shoes like this. Any ideas? Do I just re-lace? Is there a reason for this?

text:Wolf vs Goat Fonzie Goes to India t-shirt Review and Fit	labels:I’ve been looking for the perfect white T-shirt for a while. It’s almost an obsession at this time.  Right now the only T-shirt that checks all the marks, except for price, is Velva Sheen.  Wolf vs Goat seems too gimmicky to enter the list as of yet I tried these brands:  Velva Sheen — perfect but too expensive. Not very soft but I don’t really mind it since it holds its shape/fit is the perfect thickness.  Everlane heavyweight cotton — good but too long.  Naked and famous — too long and expensive ($50)  Uniqlo Supima cotton — too thin, shows my nipples  Taylor stitch heavy weight — too thick for the summer  Taylor stitch hemp cotton blend — too thin, shows my nipples. Nice fit though   Random Amazon heavy weight cotton — too long and loose  Next one one on my list is Kuwalla because they have the same barrel stitching construction as Velva Sheen but much cheaper at roughly $25/tshirt, and it will likely be the last one before I bite the bullet and go full Velva sheen for my tshirts.  Edit:  Just noticed WvG is based in DC. Going to give them a try.

text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:I'm a Sagittarius with a Taurus moon, so my formula is just abject chaos but make it luxe (ie. I wear a flat gold herringbone chain, gold or tortoiseshell earrings, a little gold watch, and a gold signet ring + my engagement ring at all times, even if I'm wearing leggings and a sweatshirt to play Stardew Valley all day).   More seriously, my jewellery basically never changes (see above), so I guess that's my formula? I wear that combo whether I'm wearing a dress and heels to go out (in theory, who even remembers going out?) or jeans and a sweatshirt to go to the grocery store (in theory, we just do pick up orders now). I did just get a new big-girl job, so maybe this will change as I'm able to better afford the wild 1940s wardrobe of my dreams?	episode_done:True

text:I stopped taking him seriously after I saw how many undershirts he had and how he threw some out after less than 20 wears and throws out shoes after 50 wears	labels:Author here. I understand that. As to the 20 wears for underwear T-shirts, I might note that I always (have to) wear an underwear shirt to protect whatever I wear on top of it. Most of the time, it is a button down shirt at work. I wash the underwear t-shirt after each use. It may be due to my exceptionally high metabolism, but they really start being rather shabby after 25-30 uses, some after only 20 (especially if worn on hot summer days).   It actually really bothers me that I cannot make them last longer in my work context. When i divest they, I do continue use though as sportswear or garden work or whatever where it doesn't matter that they are a bit shabby.  As of shoes, that one pair that lasted only 50 days were really falling apart.
text:When will I be "too old" to look cute, cool, hip, whatever?	labels:36 year old here, grinding my teeth at you for asking this question at 22.  This is my constant internal monologue, but I think that it is always appropriate to try and present yourself to others in the best possible light.  I can't tell you how things will change for you, but I have found that my tastes have developed and age has sanded off the fringiest edges of my fashion interests.  I used to want to (relatively) keep up with trends, and now my aesthetic goal has shifted into a desire for a more timeless look; probably because at 36 I would also like to be timeless.  So at the end of the day I hope to dress like someone that wears quality clothes, with a flattering fit, and they indicate that I care about my appearance.  And I don't think you're ever too old to fit that criteria.  The fact that you're asking the question probably means that you are introspective and will adjust your style as well.

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.

I actually find the egirl style pretty cute and I don’t think there is anything about being a fat WOC where the style wouldn’t be cute on you!  As for your family, this grinds my gears so much!!!! I’m old enough to be your mother and it makes me so sad when adults crush the creative expression of their children. You don’t have to ever fit in the box they want you to. As long as it makes you happy and you aren’t hurting anyone else, it’s your life to live and they are just clothes. If you can muster the courage to do it, have an open conversation about how your family makes you feel when they trash the style you like. Tell them it hurts and makes you struggle with self confidence in a world that already does that to fat WOC every day. I think if they get that it hurts you, they’ll stop being unsupportive.

Ten ish years ago you might have a vneck tshirt and boot cut mid wash jeans, five years ago probably skinny jeans in a darker wash and a slim crew neck, and now maybe a square neck bodysuit with light wash straight jeans. But on the other hand if you have some kind of, I don't know, cool bomber jacket, it doesn't really look out of date especially because thrifting is in right now.	episode_done:True

Takes maybe 15 mins total and you don't destroy your clothing. You can even spin it again once the water is out to speed up drying if you let it air dry.

text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:I wouldn't say I inherently hate the brand but I think Champion is an example of a brand that exploded a few years back/to now basically all because some celebrities or whoever wore it- and everyone who wears it now is most likely a ding dong hypebeast type or the VSCO type girl or whatever. Like I'm old enough to remember it being bottom tier Wal Mart level shit you'd get borderline made fun of for wearing- but now all of the sudden it's enjoying this moment. So it's just that perceived inauthenticity and collective pivot in peoples' minds to a fashion name to people rather than just athletic apparel that irks me somehow.  However though, the Todd Snyder Champion stuff is PHENOMENAL- it's not the mainline stuff. You don't see any of those assholes rocking that.
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:I'm in a ambivalent state of mind right now. For a like over a year now I have been into streetwear. Baggy, oversized clothes with lots of prints and branding. This was my first period of taking clothing serious and feeling "fashionable". But one can only see so many of the "same" outfits.  I grew really tired of streetwear in the last couple of weeks but I'm scared to leave my comfort zone. I'm 20 years old but feel like dressing like a teenager. I really really like graphic tees if the prints are well done and If I would imagine dressing like lets say Tim Dessaint for example, who is not into graphics/"crazyness" at all, It would feel too "mature" for my age if that makes sense.  But at the very same time, I feel like im dressing too childish when wearing cargo pants + graphic tee.  Am I overthinking this?
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I’ve had decent luck with my targeted ads. I almost use it to my advantage now. If I’m looking for something, I’ll spend 5-10 minutes searching Google and browsing sites - then wait a few days. My Instagram will pop up with lots of places that I wouldn’t have necessarily found off Google but I am their target market.   Then I stalk. Check out the product reviews on their website, do a product review. com check, go into the tagged photos on Instagram to see people who are wearing the product and their feedback. Search comments! Companies not worth shopping with will have complaints under Insta photos or fake responses to their customers. Worse is no response to questions.   You can also find discount codes from their influencers on the tagged photos page that they wouldn’t necessarily share on their main page.   I’m a very cautious buyer. I need to have a good return policy if I’m shopping online from a company. So yes, I have a good experience but I put in a lot of prep into preparing my parachute before I jump.	episode_done:True
text:Fall 2020 Fit Battle - Round 2 - Discussion	labels:Too lazy for a full write up, but BeneficialMovie vs. Salutatorian was the hardest match up for me so far. BM's killing it with the cord suit and earth tones, but I really loved Sal's layering. Super tough.  Shout-out to Rariora for having my favorite fit this round, really spectacular colors and immaculate fit on every piece.	episode_done:True
text:Has anyone just said screw it and focused more on fit than color scheme for your outfits? What's an unlikely color combination that you ended up loving?	labels:That's kind of the point of fashion. Try whatever appeals to you and see if you like it or if it suits your needs. "Unlikely combinations" are what drives fashion forward.
text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:Here with you. I've started getting dressed and putting on makeup just to stay at home all day and it helps my mood for sure, but the times I do get to go out I get *so* excited for. I'll dress up just to for a fire in someone's backyard. But on the upside, getting dressed just to sit at home gives me a lot more confidence to try things I wouldn't have tried before and hopefully will be more comfortable wearing when restrictions lift.	episode_done:True
text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:I miss getting dressed a lot. I don’t really have lounge clothes, just exercise, so I was really struggling with clothing at the beginning of this.   Additionally, I just graduated my masters program, and my job during the school year essentially had a uniform, so I was really excited about graduating and starting a new job to get dressed again. And then here we are.   I also miss getting dressed for occasions. I already had my graduation outfits picked out, and had three weddings this summers that I was looking forward to wearing dresses to. Going to the grocery store is now the only time I can put on clothing and I’m just really sad. I know there’s a lot of people who are like “just wear your clothing in your house!” Which yes, I can definitely do that. But part of the joy of getting dressed for me was the “going somewhere” part. Picking out my outfit felt like I was putting on a costume to play a part for the day, which I loved. I know I am so so fortunate that I can safely work from home; but I really miss my “characters”. Wedding guest, or fancy date night, or professional worker in winter. All those roles have been reduced to WFH and grocery shopper now and I’m just really sad about it.	episode_done:True
text:+J/UNIQLO SPECIAL COLLABORATION: What’s the verdict?	labels:I got the silk turtleneck is grey and black. I never see turtlenecks made of 100% silk so it intrigued me. The material is very thin as expected with silk so I skipped the white one. The standout of the silk knits would be the grey. The grey has a nice sheen to it and looks so luxe compared to a regular cotton turtleneck. They are so soft and warm and I can see myself wearing them for many years. I also got the double breasted wool coat in black. I had no intention of buying this but decided to try it on. I am a short gyal and this coat fit me so well I snatched it up right away. I was in the market for a new coat but was thinking of buying an Aritzia one but this one fit me much better. The thing I noticed with this coat is that the arms are cut in a way that it curves with the way that your arms fall on your body. It also has two inside pockets. I’m very impressed! I also tried the cashmere coats but I didn’t like those as much as I wanted something with a little more weight and more structured.

text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:I have to say, I had never heard of Amy Smilovic before, but I am glad to have been introduced!  Her style and the Tibi style are really not anything that I would wear, and yet I find a lot of her advice really useful.  In particular, I watched her 'closet cleanout' story, and her "blocks" as ways of categorizing clothes make a lot more sense to me than the basics/statements dichotomy. She divides it into WOFs (WithOut Fails), I&Os (Ins & Outs), and HTHs (Had To Haves).  In this way, an item can be bold and colourful and still be a staple in my closet (a without fail), or it could be very simple and basic, and still fall into the In & Out or Had to Have category.  I guess in my mind, basics are usually black or a neutral colour, but statements are colourful, but that's not really how my style works. A head-to-toe black outfit isn't necessarily made of basics, and one that is full of colours isn't going to be garish if it's done right.  As long as a Had to Have is paired with many Without Fails, it will still look cohesive and "you".  I also love how Dione describes something that's matchy-matchy as being "lady" haha. Note taken.
text:Share what are your quick tips to always look polished !	labels:I have 2 pups and have accepted that I will always have dog hair on me.   Back when I wore more business clothes, I would have separate at home and work clothes. Changed out of my work clothes as soon as I got home and into sturdier/less expensive outfits.   Also recommend keeping a lint roller in the car.   To generally look polished: add an accessory like a scarf, earrings or a necklace.   I’m also a fan of tucking shirts/sweaters.

Seriously, it's the liberation that you deserve.	episode_done:True
text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:In this hypothetical I'd go with haute couture. In your friend's situation I'd keep looking until I found a designer I liked. Bespoke would be my last option for a couple of reasons. Your friend wants contemporary fashion, but most bespoke tailors make traditional clothes for a typically older crowd (you're in NYC though so there are some bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd; make sure you look for them specifically). The bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd don't have designs as good as high end ready to wear IMO. Tailoring and designing are different skills, and there's a reason Louis Vuittion, YSL, Dior, Gucci, etc pay their head designers millions per year. Of course some $4000 coats are worth more than others, so it would be good to know a bit about general quality.  Personally, I prioritize design over fit. I can deal with a less than perfect fit if I love the design of a piece. But I won't wear a piece if I don't love the design, even if it fits well.   The middle ground option is made to measure, or MTM. MTM for outerwear isn't as common for suiting, but it's out there.

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.
text:Favorite brands to thrift?	labels:Harder to find in stores around me, but I love ebay shopping for J Jill items.

text:Good quality men's jeans?	labels:> * The crotch tearing (this one's a reoccurring theme) * The dye running onto white shoes (probably the cheapest pair I've had has done this) * The jeans losing their shape/fit and turning loose  1. This happens when your thighs rub together and there's not enough fabric slack there. You may want to try sizing up at the thigh. Also, get a few pairs and rotate so that each pair only sees a third or a quarter of the wears instead of one pair getting it all.  2. This is called crocking, where indigo flakes off/falls off when abraded against something else. That's part of indigo, whether you're talking about jeans, jean jackets, etc. You can help remove excess dye with a wash and try a magic eraser on your shoes.  3. That's normal. The warp/weft weave will stretch out like a sweater after each wear, becoming noticeable in time. Wash them when they get too out of shape.
text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:I spent like two months investing in a bunch of nice wool sweaters that I could wear through the winter, put them in a separate laundry bin after wearing so I could launder them myself, but my ex washed and dried them on high heat and they all shrunk so badly that I couldn't even fit them on my dog. About $1500 gone.

text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:Coach has really upped their game the past few years and you can get a really good quality genuine leather bag that could last a long time. They also have relatively good sales around holidays!  I personally wouldn’t dip into the Michael Kors / Kate Spade of it all unless you get it from the outlets. I’ve found their bags can sometimes be made with cheaper materials and don’t last as long.  I do really like the Rebecca Minkoff bags I’ve had.
text:Revisiting Fall/Winter Favorites: N1 Deck Jackets pt2	labels:These are so sick but between owning a Levi’s Sherpa, a vintage M-65, and a vintage tanker style jacket (that I recently discovered is a helicopter pilot jacket) there’s no way to justify me owning one of these hahaha especially with the price point.    Totally understand the lack of style diversity though as these are hard to come by and expensive as all get out. Good album Hiroki :)	episode_done:True
text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I love it, personally. Sitting here in a grey leopard print cardigan as I type! I used to have a similar perspective on leopard print (mid-20s here), but after seeing a few pieces I liked over the last few years, I decided to own it.   I typically don’t wear more than one animal print at a time, and my loudest piece is probably a cropped vintage leopard-print fur jacket. I used to be terrified of color, and while I’ve made strides in that area, for a long time animal print was how I kept it interesting while wearing 5 shades of beige or grey.   My frequent fliers are a zebra print skirt, snake print pants, snake ankle boots, the aforementioned jacket, and a cheetah print sweater.	episode_done:True
text:Rick Owens Wearing Rick Owens	labels:I don't own a single piece of his clothing, and I probably never will, but one of the quotes attributed to him that really stuck with me when I first started browsing mfa was "No outfit is going to make you look or feel as good as having a fit body. Buy less clothing and go to the gym instead." He was right.
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 08, 2020	labels:I'm looking for an alternative to a blazer that's casual enough to attend school with.

text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I just did a very similar thing with a pair of boots I got for $7 at the thrift store. They’re a beautiful shade of light blue and were faded, stained and creased. I just knew I could clean them up though. Well, they came out looking almost brand new with a little leather cleaner and a LOT of conditioning! I was even able to iron out all the toe creases, which was a whole new level of satisfying
text:What does your shoe wardrobe look like? What are your shoe essentials?	labels:FYI I work from home.  I also have smaller but wide feet so shoes are sometimes hard to find.  Going out is now a thing of the past (thanks Covid) and I won't feel safe at bars, etc until a vaccine comes around.  My essentials  (\* means seasonal)   1) Athletic shoes-- usually a name brand (Nike, New Balance, etc) purchased at TJ Maxx or the like.     2) Slip on sneakers-- surprisingly Walmart has some that fit well and are semi cute   3) Flip flops\*   4) Chelsea Boots-- The ones I have now are Primark brand\*   5) Knock off UGG velvet boots.  So comfy and I can't wait until the weather allows me to wear these again.\*   6) Tall riding boots\*   7) Winter boots that can survive the snow\*   8) Ballet flats   9) High heeled shoe.  &#x200B;  I have other shoes but for the most part I don't deviate too far from the above categories.  My offices have been shut down permanently so I don't have to worry about work dress from the bust down anymore.    As some of my shoes wear out, I do not replace that particular pair.	episode_done:True

text:Anyone like wearing traditional clothing from you culture?	labels:I also love wearing my cultural wear! I was born and raised in the US, but my parents are from Vietnam. Our traditional dress is the áo dài, and I just think it’s so beautiful. It’s such an elegant piece of clothing and literally makes any girl look good, no matter what size or shape you are. I’d love to wear it as part of everyday wear, but it looks a bit formal for most occasions. I have seen some more modern versions and a bit trendier versions, so I’m trying to get my hands on that. As for now, I just wear my cultural dress to church on Sundays, which is a more appropriate setting.  But I wouldn’t worry yourself about what your mom has to say about it. If it you like it and it makes you feel good, then why not wear it? I bet you look amazing in them, it sounds so cute!

text:Dress shoes EEE trouble	labels:I can relate with you quite a lot because I too must wear eee shoes and have searched for brands that fit my desired style choices and budget. Alas, my recommendations are likely not to be too budget friendly; my favorite company is Alden and my second choice is Allen Edmonds. Both are made in America brands (with AE having some exceptions) and offer a great array of width options ranging from A to EEE.  I have worn AE for nearly three years now with my favorite last being the 201 and the 1757, both of which offer more generous toe boxes and insteps: However, my favorite shoe of all time is the Alden 405 (and the 403) because the last perfectly contours to my natural foot shape. This detail is essential because my right foot is slightly but noticeably wider than my left foot. Of course, none of these suggestions are cheap.   After I graduated from university three years ago I went to my local AE store and was properly fitted. I then searched on Ebay for a proper fit and found a decent pair of AE shoes in my size hoping to buy a new shoe later on to make sure the AE salesperson's great customer service did not go unthanked ( eventually I bought my Dalton boots from her). Then last year, I stumbled upon Shoe Mart's Alden Seconds program, reached out to their customer service team to figure out what my Alden Tru balance size. Soon after, I purchased the Alden 405 and instantly fell in love with it. The arch support is great, the ankle support is superb, and most importantly, the toe box fit like a rugged glove.  I hope my personal experience is of some help. Just keep in mind that buying used is not a bad thing if you put in the effort to properly clean and sterilize each purchase until you save enough to buy a new pair.	episode_done:True

text:Let's Talk about hats	labels:There is hat etiquette from the days of yore. Here are some of the conventions that were adhered to:  A lady does not remove her hat when indoors or for the national anthem. This is in contrast to men, who are to remove hats when indoors and for the anthem. However, if you‘re sporting a baseball cap at a ballgame, I would remove it for the anthem, whereas if you were wearing a more formal outfit with hat then I would not remove it.  A hat is a daytime piece in most cases not suitable for evening wear. The fascinator is an exception to this rule, but is more of a Commonwealth/British thing.  A lady does not wear a hat in her own home, ie when receiving guests, and as a guest in a friend’s home a lady would remove her hat.
text:Shitpost Saturday: Let's talk about Fall!!!	labels:I put on my Doc Martens. If there aren't any crunchy leaves yet, I put coffee beans or dried pumpkin seeds in my boots to feel the cronch.

You can also buy some decent quality sneakers from Amazon too, just make sure it's from a reputable seller and from a recognized shoe brand (Adidas/New Balance/etc.).  &#x200B;  However, for stuff like jeans, jackets, boots, and knitwear, I'd look elsewhere. I've bought jeans from Amazon in the past that came with low-quality buttons and ripped after 2 months of wear, so I don't think the quality is quite there. My recommendation would be to search on places like Uniqlo/Carhartt/Champion or even thrift stores to get better quality jeans/jackets/knitwear that can last you a lot longer than whatever you'd find on Amazon for a comparable price.

This was common at every price point from discount to mid-range.   Now the mid-range is terrible quality. And the brands know for basics focus on neutrals and 1-2 seasonal colors.   As for your comment on Velvet dresses? Those tend to be pretty seasonal - for holiday parties.

text:20 Sweaters for Less Than $150, So You Can Achieve Peak Coziness - Esquire.com	labels:In my experience, sweaters are one of the few garments where there's a noticeable increase in quality as you spend more money.  Cheaper sweaters are noticeably thinner (both the threads and the sweater itself), which don't keep you as warm and don't last as long.   The good news is that there are some great options for getting high quality sweaters at low prices if you're willing to shop secondhand. For $150 you can find a gently used sweaters from Ines Meain and IMO that's a much better purchase than most of the cotton and fine merino wool sweaters listed in this article.
text:She wasn’t a billionaire back then when she first used nylon. In fact, it was a risk and it didn’t perform well at first because factories weren’t configured for such a fabric and people had difficulty accepting a fabric common in workwear and industrial uses (parachuting) to be anything luxurious. So yeah in a way it was a statement against bourgeois taste.  Most natural fabrics today are cheap to the point where priced competitively to synthetics. Just because it’s affordable or synthetic doesn’t make it less luxurious.	labels:imo you shouldn’t have replied to them.

I also bought a few clothing items that is taking forever to ship though. I might cancel some of them and wait out the rest.

text:Matching  metals is not a thing,  except in men’s tailoring where you match your belt buckle, to your cufflinks, to your tiebar. It doesn’t apply to jewelry or watches both of which come in two-tone varieties,  making it impossible to match in those circumstances.   Matching leather is a little more nuanced.  With men’s tailoring you should match your shoes and belt pretty close. Same with the upper levels of business casual say blazer and/or tie. It also doesn’t apply to watch straps or accessories  Anything below that level, getting it approximate is close enough. I like to match brown to  brown but don’t worry about the shade all that much.  if I’m wearing oxblood shoes I wear a brown belt.   For actual casual outfits; jeans and iron rangers or streetwear etc,  it doesn’t matter at all	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Brooks Brothers's Future Looks a Lot Like Menswear’s Past	labels:* Less SKUs. The amount of stuff BB sells is overwhelming.  * Do away with there weirdly named fit system. Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.

text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Hitting up thrift stores to experiment with new looks is an easy entry point for a lot of people. I'm sorry your mom talked you into returning things you were excited about! That's a bummer.  I try to remind myself that realistically no one will remember what I wore. Or at least they won't spend time thinking about it. If I put together an outfit outside my comfort zone, I can take it off at the end of the day and it's like it never even happened. Same way makeup washes off, clothes come off in an instant too. The stakes aren't as high as they feel.  I used to feel boxed in by what I describe as "school picture day mentality," meaning I felt that every outfit had to be *just right*. It had to represent me perfectly as if that's how I would be preserved in other people's minds forever. But that's so goofy, idk why I thought that. Every day is a new opportunity and every outfit is temporary. I hope you can have fun and tap into your confidence!	episode_done:True
text:Fashion "fantasies" coming true years later?	labels:There are items that I fell in love with when I was a teenager/student, but could never afford. Now that I’m an adult and making decent money I’ve actually purchased a few of these items second hand on Vestiaire Collective or Vinted. The top two are an Alexander McQueen silk skull print scarf and a Mulberry Alexa bag. Certainly not the trendiest of items nowadays but I am thrilled with them and younger me is so happy I finally own them after all these years of wanting them.
text:Learning to dress better	labels:First, I'd like to echo other commenters sentiments and say that investing in a good hair cut is absolutely worth it. Finding a good barber, hairstyle that you feel compliments your hair type and face shape, and that you feel good about are all worth it. I've never regretted putting in the time to find a good barber. Also, don't be afraid to try things, it is just hair after all. I'd also like to say just be patient with yourself and give yourself time. I started figuring out I cared how I dressed when I was in university, but my sense of style is very different now from what it was then (a lot less band shirts). So don't be afraid to try things and explore different styles to figure out what you like. Thirdly, basics (as other people have mentioned) are worth investing in. You cannot go wrong with a clean t-shirt and a pair of well fitting jeans. Fourth, shoes are worth investing in. I wish I would have learned that earlier. You can get most basic wardrobe needs for relatively cheap through places like uniqlo and they'll hold up decently well. But a good pair of shoes will last you a long time. I bought my first pair of really nice, high quality boots last year and it's a totally different experience. It's awesome that you are realizing you want to dress better, just be patient.

Unless we’re talking about crippling debt or something you can’t pay off within 9-12 months while still living comfortably, there’s no reason to cut all spending. Just scale it back and make a small shopping budget for yourself.   Consistency pays off debt better and faster than trying to bite off more than you can chew.

text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:Do  * Know your measurements * Check size charts. Know the difference between body measurements and garment measurements. * Check return policies * Ask others with experience with the brand * Compare to things you already know fit well  Don't  * place too much stock in letters or photos of models. * assume that one of the sizes available is going to fit you well * buy something that you know won't fit because it's a "good deal." * Place too much weight in measurements. They're very helpful, but garment measurements are taken from the outside of the garment, so the thickness of the garment factors in, structure factors in, your layers factor in... there are a lot of variables, so again, be aware of the return policy.	episode_done:True

text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Hi! Former stylist.  1) Pay attention to the fit of things and figure out what cuts and shapes look good on you. Paper bag pants and some joggers have similar fits. Some mini skirts and shorts hit the same place on your legs and can have the same waist height. Find your sweet spot and don’t be afraid to buy multiple things in silhouettes that work for you.   2) Get some statement pieces that you would die for. If you are wearing a pair of jeans that fit well and a t-shit purchased within the past 3 years with some awesome earrings you going to look and feel great. If you are wearing an amazing dress and simple white sneakers you are going to look and feel great. Don’t overthink things but try and wear at LEAST one piece you are excited about at a time.   3) Don’t buy things just cause they are on sale, you saw your friend wearing it, or you feel like you “need” something in your wardrobe. You should love everything in your closet in its own special way unless it’s workwear and you hate your dress code for work. Something as simple as a T-shirt has so many different factors like cut, material, neckline, sleeve length. Purchase what feels good and don’t bother with the rest.

And a single red bodycon dress that's made its way into the regular rotation.

I make up for it by having a colorful home.	episode_done:True

text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:Yes. I’m kind of somewhere between an hourglass and an inverted triangle shape, and only 5’4. So many outfits online have like 4 layers on top and then my shoulders look huge and it’s not cute. Or I look like a big blob because they billow out over my round hips/butt rather than draping all pretty like the stick thin girl I saw the look on online.   I wouldn’t say I have “solved” it but I’ve found a few ways to imitate the looks I like more successfully. Finding a slightly cropped version of a blazer or sweater I admire is helpful given my height, and also because I have hips and a round butt, long sweaters and blazers tend to look boxy and strange on me. I have also been learning about and experimenting with tucking shirts and sweaters a lot. Finally, minimizing layers or choosing blazers and sweaters that don’t have dropped shoulder seams helps keep my top half looking sleek. Unfortunately dropped shoulders seem to be all the rage everywhere I shop 🙄  I know you’re pear shaped so it’s different but I think you can look at the “vibe” of an outfit and imitate it in a way that suits your body. Mainly I try to look at a few outfits I’m drawn to, and figure out what elements they have in common or what it is that I’m liking. Maybe the colors, textures, silhouettes, etc. I like to save them on Pinterest and make note of what I want to find when I shop to pull those elements into my wardrobe.	episode_done:True

Until then I’m also in the oversized T-shirt camp.

text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:Most designs are not unique imo.  Designs and inspiration is a grey area.  There are some situations where I can see blatant copying but they’re pretty rare.  Like if a unique pattern on the fabric is copied or something.  I’m all for affordable options when it’s not plagiarism, I love fashion but it can be overpriced and elitist.  And accessibility for people who don’t want to spend ridiculous amounts on designer clothes is a plus to me, I know that’s controversial.  Honestly some of the most heinous and shameless theft of ideas often comes from big designers.  I don’t think that first top is even something original enough to be stolen.  It’s a v backless ribbed bodysuit, right?  Common, simple fabric/pattern.  The sweater is *slightly* more unique but imo just a few common trends put together.  And the other sweater doesn’t really look much like it imo.	episode_done:True

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:I spent like two months investing in a bunch of nice wool sweaters that I could wear through the winter, put them in a separate laundry bin after wearing so I could launder them myself, but my ex washed and dried them on high heat and they all shrunk so badly that I couldn't even fit them on my dog. About $1500 gone.
text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I’ve had internships in both a manufacturing capacity and R&D and I’m back in mostly R&D now (but working from home haha). In manufacturing I wore a combo of jeans, corduroys, and some more casual leaning dress pants with sweaters most of the time and switched between my trusted Chelsea boots and safety shoes depending on what area I was working in that day. For R&D I was able to dress more “fashionable” based on whether or not I was working in the lab. Lab days mostly focused on sweaters and casual dress shirts with sleeves I could easily roll up/down, jeans or dress pants and a variety of closed toed shoes (Chelseas, heeled black booties, in the summer I could get away with sperrys). Non lab days I liked to wear dresses, long skirts, and my nicer dress pants.   Looking ahead I’ve been trying to combine my work wardrobe with every day/weekend pieces. I focus a lot on getting sweaters that I actually enjoy as opposed to ones that are designated for work (love a good turtleneck and actually cute cardigans). I’ve also been looking into more natural fibers but getting them secondhand so the price isn’t so crazy (also so I don’t feel too too bad if they get messy at work)! I also try and avoid “only work shoes” so my dressy shoes are ones I could wear to an interview/presentation but also out to a nice dinner. There were definitely a few times at work in the past where I felt more dressed up than my colleagues but I don’t think it was ever looked down on. I think dressing to your personal style is a great way to express yourself at work as long as it’s appropriate for the sitch and safe for you and your colleagues in a lab/technical setting!	episode_done:True

text:+J/UNIQLO SPECIAL COLLABORATION: What’s the verdict?	labels:the outerwear is all spectacular and i think much nicer quality than regular uniqlo outerwear.  i thought the sweaters were a bit thin, which was slightly disappointing.  all the cotton items are pretty standard uniqlo cotton (maybe slightly smoother) but the cuts were fun. the silk items felt nice, but not as nice as more expensive silks (obviously). the silk knit shirts were less soft than the bow blouse but i think that's just the nature of knit silks?  the wool items were all fab. i got trousers and the skirt and love them both.  also EVERYTHING WAS SO BIG? i know some of the items were supposed to be oversized but the sizing wasn't consistent. i was my usual size in skirt/pants and sweaters/shirts, but i had to size down in the oversized items because they were too big. the hybrid down coat which i got in a M (my usual uniqlo outerwear size) fit like a L or XL. the cotton shirtdress which i also got in a M (for non-outerwear i am usually between a s/m in uniqlo sizing because i am tall, and generally go with a M for sleeve length) fits like a L, but for that one i can make it work by styling it differently. if they had it in a S i would have gotten that instead, tho.  generally i am pleased with what i got. i think for the price it's not bad, and i like the cuts of the pieces and higher than usual fabric quality, although some pieces felt more worth it than others.   i do NOT think it is worth buying at a markup tho. none of the pieces were particularly unique (except maybe some of the outerwear) and you would be able to find similar pieces from other places at a similar price point i think.

Long: I came across a Facebook ad for some clothes I liked and quickly realized it was a Wish-esque outlet from China. Would be fine but I've heard bad things and the sizing is always off. Buggy website, too.  Problem is, the algorithms picked u on it and I keep seeing ads for exactly the clothes I want, but they all reveal themselves to be clones of the same outlets as the same items and site issues appear.

text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I'm autistic, and yes, it sounds very familiar. I second the sleeveless undershirts or camis to put into the waistband of my pants or skirt. I also buy some extra if after a couple of times wearing something turns out to have a great fit. I have some pants in different colours, but with the same fit, and that helps with not always wearing the same but still knowing they will fit just right. I also have some basic, tagless black shirts and longsleeves, so that I can put a cardigan or blazer over while the shirt kind of blocks the tags or fabric of what I wear over it - that only works when it's not superhot, but that doesn't happen often here anyway.  The main thing is, have some basic skin-layers that feel just right, and put something over to give your outfit that bit of extra without it touching your skin (much).	episode_done:True
text:Of course people like Chanel because of the status quo the brand gives off but Karl impacted it to greater heights which we have seen today. It was a dead brand before Karl joined.	labels:The brand was huge before Karl, Coco was alive until 1971, and it was a major luxury brand at that time, before and after. He joined in 1983. But he did a great job at getting the mainstream aspirational consumer and young wealthy into the brand, which is what it needed. I know women who are in their 60s and 70s who have Chanel from way back when. There was a time after WW2 that the brand struggled a little, but so did nearly all luxury European brands at the time. Overall though it's always been a key brand in the category.

I'm hoping dusting off my vanity will cheer me up at least a little. Last year I wore a very involved angel costume, but since I'm not going out I'm just going to put on my much more comfortable bunny costume.

I’ve bought a couple of absolutely lovely dresses over the years that I never wear, but will reach for my favorite Everlane t-shirts and comfy sweaters over and over again.	labels:I call it clothes for my fantasy life, Think shoes I can't walk in or stand in for too long. Black tie things. Pant suits (my office is casual)....	episode_done:True
text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I'd get a really nice piece of outerwear, either a coat in a quality material like wool or a leather or shearling jacket. If you live somewhere with colder weather during part of the year, outerwear is something you'll be wearing all the time so it's worth investing in a piece that's great quality, keeps you warm and makes a statement. I think an amazing jacket or coat will elevate even the most basic outfit, whether it's a more classic piece, something utilitarian like a puffer jacket or something more extravagant. Personally I think Acne, Chloe and Tibi are brands that make great high-end outerwear in a variety of styles.

There are a couple guides if you search them, but if it were me starting over here is what I would do.  **Bottoms:**  Light wash jeans, Navy Chinos, Sand Chinos, Khaki chino shorts **OPTIONAL:** Dark or black wash jeans  **Tops:**   **T-Shirts**(no logo no graphics)**:** 2x white, 1x Navy, 1x Light Grey **Optional:** Offwhite, Charcoal, various pastels, short/longsleeved henleys in any neutral colors.   **Button Downs:** light blue oxford, light pink oxford, **Optional**: gingham button down (light blue or navy), flannel shirt (black and watch or buffalo plaid), White oxford, university stripe oxford.  **Outerwear:** Light Grey crewneck sweatshirt olive anorak (for rain), tan/brown/navy quilted jacket for winter   **Shoes:** White leather gym shoes, brown leather boots or chukkas (pants only) **Optional:**Tan/light brown loafers, brown camp mocs, snow/rain boots (bean boots or hunter mocs)  &#x200B;  Obviously feel free to make it your own, but I would start trying to build solid basics like that that are 100% interchangeable.
text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:Growing up in a small town and then moving to a bigger one, fast fashion was a whole magical thing to me. After a few years I learned more about how terrible it is and shopped there less, but that's hard to do when you're poor. I discovered thrift shopping and have been addicted to it ever since, although I realize I'm privileged in that I'm easily able to find my size at any thrift shop. Now I'm a little less poor, but still unable to afford local fashion so I keep thrifting. I support local designers when I can by going to their sample/warehouse sales and recommending them to others.   I find the hardest part to be shopping for basics. When I need a plain black tank, I go to Target because I know exactly what I'm getting.	episode_done:True

Although I still think the way he's communicating is strange. I think he means tonally neutral, bland, desaturated colors. "Cold" is a really strange way to say that, whether or not the term is technically ambiguous.

text:Could you say more about why those systems are unsubstainablr?   I'm not very rich, I would struggle to afford a house in my expensive city, but I have dropped a few thousand on a suit - made with good materials by a local bespoke maker.  I think extreme wealth gaps are unsustainable, for sure, but dropping a few thousand on a suit every couple of years isn't much more than people spend on a computer, out drinking, or on games and gaming systems. For me, it's a hobby I get to wear.	labels:One decent suit in any closet is always a must, a couple of times I got the job I was interviewing for simply because I wore a suit and tie to the interview.   Sustainability and changing trends are another can of worms which depend on the individual. Contemporary vs Classic, $300 suit which can be altered by a tailor vs $4,000.00 fitted suit.

text:“I'm all locked down with nowhere to go – but that hasn't killed my lust for fashion”	labels:I have one suggestion, get dressed and take pictures. It doesn't have to be for Instagram/facebook. It can be for just yourself. If you really like an outfit, remember it with a picture. You can take it in a park, or at a location that is memorable for you, with your SO, or with your cat. You should at least get a few good pictures with you pet in the 10+ years they reside with you.  It's actually a fun learning experience, on how to use the cameras. I am interested in photography and usually use a dslr, but for selfies, dslrs are not as good. With an iphone, I think it's an entirely different genre of photography. You have to use completely different lighting system, etc., to use it to its full potential.

All my husbands tshirts are fine though, it's only mine getting ruined.	labels:> But a few has instantly lost inches in high and transfererad it to width.   I think that's an issue with construction.

Outfits always cute, but accessible/not over the top

text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I'm just... still getting dressed up. This has actually given me a nice opportunity to try new combinations of outfits and pull out pieces that I wasn't sure about before. The routine of getting dressed and feeling put together is really important for me with regards to getting into the work mindset.
text:General Discussion - November 12, 2020	labels:I ordered a new saddle for my bike.  Immediately after ordering, I saw a promotion for 15% off my first order.  I sent a request within 5 minutes for that promotion to be retroactively applied (processing change, price adjustment, partial refund, cancel and reorder, whatever), and they basically said "no".  Returns are free.  I am going to ship this goddamn thing back across the Atlantic and they are going to lose out more on shipping than they would have just giving me the discount, plus the cost of a sale.  EDIT: I should be naming and shaming, it's Brooks y'all.

text:How many pairs of jeans and pairs of shoes should you own?	labels:Women can have things they enjoy having without being concern trolled about how much they really need it.   I don't see men getting hassled for the amount of electronic waste their hobbies produce.   I doubt every fifth post in the Funko Pop subreddit is about curbing consumption and how they should be rethinking their involvement in a plastics based interest.   Personally, I think they're wasteful as shit, but I'm not about to roll up into their space and shame them for it.  I'm so over the handwringing, guilt, and joylessness about fashion in this sub sometimes.
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:I would maybe get a dress for each season. You don’t want to go to a winter wedding in a summer dress and with so many weddings coming up there’s bound to be one in each season.

text:Shopping my own closet for the perfect tee	labels:I'm a big fan af this. Every time I clean out my closet, I find hidden treasures, but I also discover how much of it I really hate, or how much of it seems tired to me and sort of depressing.   I tend to only have items that I love the most in my closet, (I ideally strive for 14 days worth of wear) and then put 7 days worth of clothes some other place, that I don't exactly love or hate. Stuff you'd move furniture or do spring cleaning in. Sometimes I look at these clothes and decide that I missed this or that, but most of the time, it gets cycled out after a while and donated somewhere.   I live in a very small apartment, though, and I dislike the extra work that comes with too much clutter. A lot of people like to hold onto their clothes, because trends cycle so quickly and unexpectedly
text:Hell yes	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I WFH permanently now, but when I worked in an office I wasn't able to escape dry-clean-only clothing; there are some things that just need to be dry cleaned. However, I used Dryel to great effect (awesome for things that aren't stained or stinky and don't really need to be pressed). I will also say, many many clothing items that say "dry clean only" can be washed either by hand, or in the machine on a delicate setting with wool wash or other gentle low-suds detergent. (My dry cleaner, of all people, actually advised me to start washing my cashmere sweaters rather than bringing them in for cleaning - she said dry cleaning dries out and breaks down the fibers and washing them at home would help them last longer. I am still wearing my cashmere sweaters and so far, she's been correct.) If something is very structured or has an acetate lining I never try to wash it, but I have washed other things that were poly blends or wool blends and were marked "dry clean only," and as long as you hang them up to dry, it works fine.

text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:I regret buying boots too small. Make sure that when you try on boots wear the kind of thick warm socks you’re going to want to wear on cold days. I often even double up socks if I’m going to be walking around a lot and my current boots are a full size larger than my normal shoe size.   Also, other people have mentioned it, but a thermal base layer is a must, especially for your lower body. I don’t use my thermal tops that much, the upper body gets your sweaters and your coat, but if the only thing standing between the elements and your legs is jeans you’re gonna be COLD.	episode_done:True

Don't buy them too tight - it's tempting to ensure they don't fall off your head but they'll leave red marks on your forehead.  Remember to wear forehead sunscreen if youre wearing a backwards baseball cap or you'll have a very, very strange tan line. Thats not from experience at all...

I got quoted something ridiculous like ¥30000 (about $300 I think) and the dress was only £30!!

text:Handbag conundrum: lesser know (and lesser seen all over the place) or standard luxury designer bags (think the usual Gucci, YSL, LV, etc.)	labels:Definitely buy what makes you happy. The fact that you have looked at the high end, well known brands and came away disappointed indicates that (this season at least), they aren't for you.   To answer your question directly: for me, personally, showing my own style is 1000% more important than showing the status of a luxury brand. Do the two sometimes overlap? Yes, and that's fine. But I don't personally get buying something *just* because it is a certain brand. Who are you trying to impress? What are you conveying with that logo (wow, you're well off? What kind of message is that, on its own?) I just feel like people who are super into labels, not the design or the style or anything else, just come across as kind of immature? The truth is, anyone worth spending much time with isn't overly concerned with what logo your bag has. (Now! I will concede there is a difference between showing off luxury brands and having higher end items, in some circles. Like, there could be some tension if you're hanging out with super millionaire socialites and everything you wear is from TJ Maxx...but in that case, I'd still say its important to focus on personal style first. And knowing about smaller higher end designers, rather than designers you can buy at a mall, is a whole different thing too...)

text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:So I did this for a week once as a social experiment.  I was sick of putting together new outfits everyday and was curious if people would notice. I wore the same blouse, blazer and pants for an entire work week (yes I washed them). I don’t remember if I changed my necklace or shoes at all. Hair and makeup are always the same for work so that wasn’t a factor.  Nobody commented or seemed to notice throughout the week. On Friday afternoon I asked people if they had noticed anything about my appearance and they said no, and when I told them about my experiment they seemed genuinely surprised!  The biggest surprise for ME was how bored I quickly became. I basically felt like a cartoon character and was excited to wear my other clothes again.  So no, I don’t think it matters, but if you plan on doing this long-term I would recommend buying multiples of the same item to eliminate excessive laundry.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - October 23	labels:I gotta say, as an American, it's really surprising that there's class connotations to rugby shirts. On paper, rugby should be an "everyman" sport like soccer, basketball, football, baseball, etc. with the barrier to entry just being a ball and a field. Seems really out of place for it to be paired up with golf, tennis, and horse-related stuff.

text:Your favorite ___ for $___: Henleys	labels:I bought this henley that I've loved so much that I hung on to it long after it was dead.   It's a shades of grey brand henley.   What made it different was the way it was made. It was knitted and with fine details in the collar and buttons. The sleeves had a shape instead of just being tubes and so did the torso.  I can post a picture of me wearing it if anyone has suggestions for similar Henleys  I got it straight from the designer years ago when he had a sale	episode_done:True
text:That's a good recommendation. I tried those! They are nice jeans with androgynous styling and good construction, but didn't quite fit the way I wanted.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it’s typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it’s a bottom, they no longer “stay up”. This usually happens with leggings or panties after about 5 or more years of regular wear with caring for the items properly.  I also had a faux leather jacket wear out after 6 years of regular wear. The faux leather ended up “peeling off” or something like that.
text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:Oh god. I'm instantly reminded of the embarrassment I felt whenever I showed up to a pregame for a frat formal and then realized it was SEMIFORMAL. I was there in a long red gown and everyone was in minidresses... I already felt out of place because I wasn't in a sorority, just was dating a guy in the frat. Thankfully I begged my bf at the time to bring me home before the formal and I changed to a better dress.  Anyway, I tend to be an overdresser. In college I felt more comfortable dressed how I wanted to rather than in big tshirts and athletic shorts or leggings. At the office, I work with a bunch of old dudes that are wearing polos at their dressiest lol. I'm perfectly fine being the odd one out there.  I think it's mostly rude to overdress whenever there's a stated dresscode. Like in my first example, I wouldn't call it "rude" but it definitely looked off.

text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I used to follow the outfit challenges and posts on the blog Putting Me Together and I really like her approach - instead of specific items, it’s more like categories of items. Long drapey necklace. Statement necklace. Short necklace. Neutral dangly earrings. Statement earrings. Stuff like that! That way you can find what suits you within the category so it can be classic and something you will actually wear!
text:Plants and Fashion: A Marriage of Obsessions	labels:I love plants, and really enjoy leaf as a print in addition to florals. I think it’s nice to pull from nature besides flowers. However, I can’t stand the prints of monsteras on everything. To me it feels a bit lazy and literally just sticking it on because they know plants are popular now. the monsters pieces I’ve seen have not seemed thoughtful in the pattern choice. Anyone else feeling that?   I think a lot of it will burn itself out as a fad, but hope the fun prints with leaves and different florals stick around a bit longer.

text:Women who have moved for extended periods of time on 1 or 2 suitcases only, how did you do it? Here's the beginning of my process	labels:I'm an Australian who moved over to the other side of the world to London in January, and I was only limited to a 30kg suitcase, a small cabin suitcase, and a backpack.   I'm not much of a minimalist person either, but I brought all my basic t-shirts, a few skincare products that I couldn't live without (I'm a skincare junkie, and my skin breaks the fuck out when I'm stressed so that was important to have for me), and I also brought my summer clothes over. Why? Because Australian winters are quite different to UK winters, and I didn't think my Australian winter clothes would hold up in a UK winter, and I figured that buying winter stuff in London would be better than buying winter clothes in Australia and bringing it over to the UK.  The UK isn't as cold as I expected, but I don't regret buying my winter stuff in London. If I was gonna blow my money on new clothes, I'd rather spend it on winter clothes than summer clothes, since the UK doesn't really have long summers.  I also brought a couple of shoes over: black heels, black flats, my Docs, one pair of fashion sneakers, and my running shoes. I ended up buying Chelsea boots in London for work, and a pair of sandals during summer.  Try to make sure your stuff is as versatile as possible when you first move, because chances are, you'll be too busy to shop in your first week of moving!

text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:men’s fashion is like a glacier- moving in one direction, not fluid, extremely slow moving- and women’s like an ocean, fast moving fads, extremely fluid, moving in all directions. Also men don’t go shopping as often, so if their clothes give out before they are due for another shopping trip, men will perceive the product’s quality to be bad. I feel like brands know these things and so they make what appeals to their consumers. They don’t need to sell women quality because most of their customers want to buy something new before the old wears out. Men don’t buy that way, I would imagine.	episode_done:True

Make myself wear said item 3 additional times during the year.  For all of the next occasions.  Like my b-day dress will be the wedding outfit. And going out outfit. Any for going to a play.

text:Depending on where you move to, there may be local thrift stores in your area that carry high quality second hand coats for significantly less than full price.  I think most of my favorite winter gear has come from second hand stores, including multiple winter coats, fleece and wool layering sweaters, heavy duty winter boots, etc.   My favorite cold weather brands to keep an eye out for when I’m thrifting are: - Patagonia (jackets and fleeces) - Sorel (winter boots) - Marmot (jackets and fleeces) ... my current winter coat is a knee-length puffy Marmot - Mountain Hardware (hats and gloves) - REI (fleeces) - The North Face (jackets and fleeces)  Edit: Just because these are my preferred types of items from these brands doesn't mean that their other items aren't worth checking out as well! All of these brands produce solid cold weather gear, and if you're ever in doubt you can google a specific item to see what people are saying about it online.   Also, as u/BeeVoltage pointed out, be cautious about going second hand for your waterproof layer and try to stick to items with tags still on them or that were released recently as waterproofing does wear out over time.	labels:Second this! No such thing as bad weather, just bad clothes.   Make sure to check FABRICS when buying secondhand. Wool, Cashmere, down (not polyester fill) for sweaters, hats and overcoats, cotton, silk, or long underwear made for underclothes. You will want hats, gloves, scarves and good socks, and sturdy shoes. All can be cute and fit any aesthetic.   I moved from southern west coast Canada to interior Canada and learned that layering was my friend. Long underwear camis, cotton tights, jeans, sweaters, usually a ultra thin down with a wool coat overtop, hats, scarves, and gloves. Cover that skin!	episode_done:True

text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:It’s less about the value of the item and more about the stars aligning perfectly.  I wear a size 12-13W shoe, plus other things that make my feet really hard to fit, so I am used to buying formalwear to match the one maybe two pairs of formal shoes I own at any given time.  So when I was 17 and going to prom in 2006, my mom tried really hard to help me find shoes, any shoes, that were suitable. But we could only find casual flats or runners, and I realllly wanted to dress up nicely for the first real time in my life. So she said “you know what, let’s buy a dress and then we will just have to find a way.”  So I picked out a black and pale pink dress that just made me swoon, and I figured black heels would be easiest to find. Lol I was so young and stupid.  Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn’t find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I’d just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.

text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:Your “style” is basically what you are comfortable in. If you are not comfortable browsing the mall for hours then it’s obviously not your thing. Although what we wear do play a factor in how people perceive us we cant really let that affect our style, because at the end of the day literally everyone has their own opinion and you cant make everyone happy. You can only make yourself happy so do whats best for you. Other than that if you do want to experiment with various aesthetics but Don’t wanna spend time at the mall just shop online, or maybe try thrifting (just give everything a wash first).	episode_done:True
text:IMO - the quality of the fabric does not justify paying the retail price. The construction is on par with all other high fashion brands and I often find no loose construction threading which is indicative of good QC. Whether that justifies the $500 upcharge vs a quality denim brand would be up to you to decide.   I find they make an excellent  taupe, pebble, and white five pocket that works well with tailoring. I would not suggest getting their indigo or washed colorations.   My suggestion would be to purchase their casual bottoms second hand which are routinely found for sub $300-$400 on eBay in 9/10 condition or BNWT.	labels:Any eBay sellers you recommend?
text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:If not going to use real leather, then great quality fabric is a better, more stylish option, than pleather/ fake /faux leather in my view. Oiled canvas, linens, weaves, neoprene, canvas, polyesters etc, look great, and are often combined with leather or other kind of handle or strap details. Longchamp set the standard for these kind of bags.

text:Can someone tell me where people get their outfits that we see during Seoul Fashion Week?	labels:A lot of people who go to these things are SUPER into fashion and most likely have been collecting clothes for a long time.

Third picture has a Lady Dior that runs about 4000-5000+ new. I'm not familiar with any of the clothing but some brands you could look into as a first step are Undercover and Comme des Garçons (and its various lines).  For the affordability issue, I second going on Yahoo! Japan and other resale sites but you need to know what you're looking for and have some idea of what might be a fake. This is also good if you're looking for past season clothing and other rare pieces. For more current stuff, you can also try SSENSE during their sale seasons.	episode_done:True

text:I think Marilyn was very conscious of what she was doing here. She carried a folksy persona, deliberately catering to working men and women, and had that "What do you mean by suspecting I'm dressing sexy by wearing dresses so tight they have to be sewn on, I can't help that I'm CURVY! It is those who think it's on purpose that are truly lewd!!"-vibe all the way through.   Basically, she tried to be as sexy as possible, but because that wasn't really allowed due to misogyny, she tried and mostly succeeded to pass it off as pure innocence. Here she is saying "I just want to please you guys, it's only natural - why do you judge me for being feminine? Men like feminine women bla bla" in an attempt to make the media be less judgmental about her livelihood.   She wasn't treated respectfully even though she was a huge star, because even though Holywood wanted a woman who was first and foremost sexy, they also judged and shamed the stars for trying to be exactly that. No wonder she was defensive about it - she lived up to the ideal the most, so she also had to be the spokesperson and defender of it. She was very much aware of her image.	labels:I think I didn’t properly explain what I meant. Her saying that “only women criticize what I wear” is very similar to the things that “oh I’m not like other women”  or “I only hang out with the guys” type of women say. Women like this tend to have internalized misogyny that they are not conscious of, and they continue to contribute to this societal problem by trying to put down other women while elevating themselves.   It’s sad because she suffers from exactly the problem that she is contributing to. I don’t think she had some “evil” thoughts or “connived” behind the scenes - in fact I believe from her personal life (and from people that knew her), she was a very sweet girl who was quite naive (which you can kind of tell based on how her relationships often went).   Also I don’t believe she had control over what she could wear while on set or that very famous JFK dress. Her stylist probably styled her and she had little to no input into her outfits.

text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:I’ve also dealt with suitsupply twice and like you had two very different experiences.   In the first - a blue suit - I had a very clear idea of what I wanted and ordered it shipped to store so that I could just do minor tailoring. They took full measurements on every aspect of it, and asked what I wanted for each measurement too. Ie Do I like a wider pant opening? Or more tapered? Length of sleeves, etc. felt very much like a whole rundown of the entire suit.   The second was... bizarre if im being honest. I went in wanting to shop for a dark grey suit. I didn’t have a clear idea of what I wanted, but I was assuming I’d go the fully customized suit route and had toyed a bit with that on their website. I went in to the store to see fabrics and stuff in person before I made my purchase. I told them what I was planning and they basically took my chest measurement and then pushed me to not do the full customized, but instead buy off the rack. And for my color options, I was browsing the whole rack, but they straight up pointed me at only the grey tones they had in store at the moment in my size. When I asked about other shades I saw they basically said “yeah, we don’t have that one in your size” and stared at me. It was like the concept of ordering a fabric/color combo I liked in my size was a foreign concept to them. Measurements were weird too. They only measured and marked one pant leg and one sleeve for tailoring. I asked why he wasn’t doing the other sleeve/pant leg or any other measurements and he just said they weren’t necessary. I overall felt pushed around by the process, and rushed, and definitely don’t think the suit is as personally tailored to fit me as the first I bought.   Nevertheless, now I’m looking at getting a new blazer and again I’m looking at SS because the quality and fabrics are quite, quite good, and I don’t have many other MTM/customizable suiting options in my area.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 13, 2020	labels:Slacks are the most comfortable items in my wardrobe short of sweaters. Why do so many men hold the sentiment that “dressing up” equates to being uncomfortable? I just went to a Christmas service at an employee’s rural church where everyone wears jeans or other 5 pocket pants and oxfords. No problem with that at all, but 4 or 5 people made comments about my slacks/shirt/tie/bomber jacket/boots(he said be casual...I still over dressed with the tie) with things like “man I’m glad someone can wear those”.   Who hurt these people? Are teenage men being put in some awful $99 suits and being traumatized? I have never worn less than a decent department store suit so maybe I am blind to struggles of others, but even a $300 department store suit is quite comfortable. Nothing compared to 100% wool tailored pants that feel like amazing pajamas, but still comfortable compared to jeans.

text:Coveteur: An Ode to the Striped Shirt	labels:I have...entirely too many striped shirts.   I am a sucker for them. I was always told to wear vertical stripes because it would make me look slim. Growing up, I was a beanpole. no boobs, no hips, just enormous feet. So I started dabbling in horizontal stripes to make me look a little less scrawny.   then in my 20's I got my boobs done. those horizontal stripes now made the new boobs look absolutely vulgar and *I loved it*. I still do.  wide horizontal stripes are great for toning them down, thinner horizontal stripes really bring out the wow factor. I have a few tops that are a little baggier, with stripes, and I find that those are the perfect way to wear a casual tee while still being like LOOK SHE HAS A SHAPE!	episode_done:True

I paid £5 entry and came away with a Temperley skirt with a boat print that I am planning on getting tailored (waist is a smidge too big).  ETA.

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I catalogued all my clothes in an app and track what I wear. If I want to wear something different\~\~\~ then I look at the category of "unworn" clothing and pick something to make an outfit with. It's really helped me make sure I wear as much of my clothes as possible (obviously the black cocktail dress is going to see less use than the everyday pink sweater but it helps with more unique items like my t shirt with applique parrots lol). If you don't want to catalogue your clothes and put this much effort into it (lol) you could just move your clothes to another part of your closet after you wear them or reverse the orientation of the hangers after wearing. Try to move as much of your clothes to the "worn" side of your closet as possible. And when you pick a lesser worn item don't give up and just make an outfit of it! Who cares if it doesn't match perfectly, you'll do it better next time!	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have any visual guides for how clothes should fit	labels:I think part of fitting issues are not necessarily visually seen, but can be felt, or worst only show up when you wear an item.  First thing try to look at how a garment fits as if it were just lines and curves and if there is anything there you would neaten or straighten or erase in photoshop. This can be things like something fitting uneven (might be too loose on top, or a skirt might be too tight and pull up at the back on the waistband), or button lines not laying flat , doing this () rather than this ||, or wrinkles under the armpits (too tight), or cameltoe.  Then there is wear, something might look right on the mirror, but turn out to be too tight or too loose or too short or too long when you wear it and walk around. Skirts and dresses slipping up, or you stepping on their hem when walking up stairs. A mistake I do despite that I  should know better but do not, I buy too big in he shoulders tshirts or blouses and then their neckline slips around during the day making it look a bit askew or showing bra straps.  Then there is aesthetics, what is one person's right fit might be another's too tight or too loose. I have mentioned I do not like when the buttons of tops do this () but some people do not mind. I once mentioned that I think a leather jacket or trend, even if meant to be worn open always has to be able to close properly or it looks visually too small, like the flaps even open look wrong - that comment got downvoted a bit  so clearly there are different opinions	episode_done:True

text:Yeah, exactly. Like I would say the most fashionable t-shirt cut a few years ago was a v-neck with capped sleeves. Before that, a very long v-neck with longer fitted sleeves (think American Apparel). Now I would speculate that it's either a fitted cropped crew-neck or an over-sized unisex t-shirt. I'm not saying people only wear those types of ts at those times, but that's what is and was most current.     I do think that trends are changing more quickly and thus fewer people can (or bother to) keep up so wearing the exactly what's in vogue right this second is less important than it used to be.     I also think that younger people tend to prioritize being on trend more. Teens in particular are usually still growing so they need new clothes more often anyway. As you get older and spend more time around other older people, your definition of "current" changes. More formal clothing tends to be more timeless too, so once you're wearing work wear 5 days a week the definition of "current" seems to shift.	labels:I agree with this. I work downtown in a casual setting and no one I know follows the latest trends (earthy tones, wide legged pants, etc). I’m probably the trendiest person in my work place and I’m not that trendy. But when I go out to restaurants or other settings frequented by people in casual wear, like a farmer’s market or the shopping district, the young people are wearing lots of the latest trends. I also wonder if trends are carried by teens and college students because their shapes are changing a lot and they’re new to buying adult clothes. I still fit into my clothes from five years ago so I’m not going to get rid of something just because it isn’t trendy, that’s wasteful. A college student might need new clothes due to building their wardrobe or weight gain/weight loss.	episode_done:True
text:There was a reddit shower thought awhile back about how Dads are like time capsules because they wear whatever was popular / in style when they had kids... as if they just stopped buying clothes and keeping up with trends once they had the first kid.  It seems like mid-20s/early-30s white guys in tech are the same. Based on what they're wearing, you can tell when they first started paying attention to how they dress. And they're all convinced that whatever they wear is timeless or classic, without recognizing that they just bought in to whatever was trending at that time (menswear, minimalism, streetwear, etc.) and that they already are starting to look dated.	labels:I agree. I just think that this partially resulted from how we used to "teach" fashion by some sort of quasi-scientific approach, with all the infographics etc. on how "clothes should look like". Everyone got a dose of post-hoc rationalisations on why the fashion of the day is "right" and it is difficult to move past that. Cf. the whole thing about slim fit being the right fit.
text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:Yes and no.   I have been wearing way more loungewear - and all day loungewear. I have been going to my workout class and it feels silly to change clothes midday to get ready for an afternoon class. I would bring a change of clothes before of course.   One of my fashion goals for this year was getting better at separates. I am practicing this! In the before times I wore more dresses. I haven’t been doing it as much because my desk area is a little chilly. I have a few looks I am happy with and should translate nicely.   I did wear some of my dresses during the summer. But more solid ones vs patterned ones. I have been also experimenting with solids this year.   I have been wearing way more pants so that will likely translate in the future. Surprisingly. I have avoided pants a lot in the past.   I can’t wait to get back to my fave shoes and the dresses I have missed - that feel a little wrong for sitting at home. My wardrobe has gone through a massive shift over the past 5 years when I started biking for errands.  This means I mostly buy items that are bike friendly. And that works well for sitting at home as well. I have snuck in a skirt or two that may not work on my bike - and jeans which I hate biking in - but one the whole that rule serves me well.	episode_done:True

text:Winter staples?	labels:Depends how cold it gets, and how much time you plan to spend outside! I'm a city girl and a bit of an "indoor cat," so my main winter activities involve navigating public transit, dealing with puddles of slush, and an occasional walk on icy sidewalks. We don't plan to drive or live in a detached house any time soon, which cuts out a whole category of winter chores.  So for me, staples are long wool coats, wool turtlenecks, wool socks and shiny black rain boots or sturdy shearling lined Timberland boots. For extra warmth, I wrap a wool pashmina around my head and layer silk thermals under my clothes. Mittens annoy me so I usually just wear leather gloves or keep my hands in my pockets. I find this is the best compromise to stay warm without too much bulk or any technical garments. If the pavements are dry, I'll even switch to heeled leather boots.  I've walked up to 30 minutes at a time in weather around 10° Fahrenheit in an outfit like this, with the scarf pulled up over my nose and mouth. (The normalisation of face masks will make this even easier now.) But it would *absolutely not* be sufficient for extended time in temperatures below 0° Fahrenheit, winter sports, or even for things like shoveling snow or scraping a windshield. For that you'd want taller insulated boots and a proper down jacket.	episode_done:True
text:How does one incorporate haute couture into everyday work outfits?	labels:real haute couture should be treated as an art piece, first of all if you can afford to buy a piece of haute couture chances are that you not only need the money to afford it but also the power and most pieces are only made for events such as the oscars. if even that you still have the money and the influence in the fashion industry to be able to have haute couture in your closet, I wouldn't wear it for work tbh appreciate it	episode_done:True

Obviously being rich isn’t a bad thing, but pushing it in people’s faces is.  At my last office when I wore nice heels and cardigans I’d get attitude from other women basically saying they were more evolved or had more important things to do in their lives so they didn’t bother with heels, or implying that I was anti feminist. Some people made comments about my “not understanding challenges, etc”. I’d also get extra attention from men which is great, but not at work. To be clear I’m not even talking about my usual over the top style. I’m talking about office friendly Zara and Uniqlo with the pieces put together in a thought out way. It was a toxic office but, some just are.  A lot of people paint dressing down as something you do for comfort because you’re practical, hardworking, have important things to do, more than your appearance, modern, not shallow, etc so sometimes the criticism is that you’re not those things if you like to dress up and that can be really damaging.  In college I dressed nicely to class for a few semesters. It was a small school and when I had difficulty in a subject, it was heavily implied that I was having trouble because I was too focused on my appearances (I wasn’t. I just was thoughtful in my purchases and find dresses more comfy). Started wearing leggings and jeans and T-shirt’s and was taken more seriously when I said I was working hard.  When I went to the doctor dressed up they wouldn’t take my symptoms as seriously as when I dressed down.  It’s stupid and judgey and goes to show how many people don’t know anything about clothes. (Ie. It takes no effort to dress well if you’re thoughtful in buying them) but it’s a sentiment that exists in some places and it’s challenging to deal with.
text:Yearly Aesthetic Goal Setting	labels:Organizing Pinterest boards by year rather than like "dresses" or "fall outfits" is brilliant tbh. Far less tedious than manually deleting pins from my closet inspo board as they no longer suit me.	episode_done:True
text:THIS. I have been working on a lot of \~self improvement\~ this year and part of making my goals for 2021 has been distinguishing "the person I aspire to be" from "the person I am willing to be" from "the person I can afford to be."   I too have been on a journey to live a budget life of luxury especially when it comes to things like matching lingerie all the time and sleepwear and what I've realized is that I'm not actually interested in luxurious sleepwear. I'm actually interested in being the person that has two hours to unwind every night, takes a warm bath in a massive tub with a v expensive lush bath bomb, does a full face care routine, brushes her hair out, has little tinctures on her vanity to apply just a bit of perfume, puts on a silk gown, lights a candle, reads in bed, and turns out her lamp at a generous 9:30pm.   The truth is that the desire for the sleepwear is really a desire to have more silence, more time spent on me, and more time doing things that look and feel good simply because I like them and not because they serve any kind of real function.   I have moved away from using old t-shirts because I like the idea of dedicated sleepwear but I usually just go with a solid color cami / tank top / shirt and either some shorts or some sweat pants depending on how cold it is. They're cheaper but still look thoughtful.	labels:>part of making my goals for 2021 has been distinguishing "the person I aspire to be" from "the person I am willing to be" from "the person I can afford to be."   I need to frame this and put it on my wall.  Love your bedtime routine. Also want to mention that I have decided that decent black panties (like the 6-pack from H&M) match all the bras.
text:Recent Purchases - December 09, 2020	labels:Dropped some weight over quarantine -- had to get all new pants. For office pants, I went with a bunch of different colors (Brown, Olive, Beige, Navy) in Rag & Bone Fit 2 chinos. Anyone have thoughts on their chinos?	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else always hesitate to buy what they truly love because they don't have a social life?	labels:Outside of Covid,  I am perfectly happy to wear fancier than necessary clothes to work out while running errands.    What I really want and can't justify is a floor length formal gown. I don't think I have ever gone to a black tie event.  Why don't people have fancy parties anymore????? I just want to wear a ball gown once a year,  is that too much to ask?
text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I purchased a gorgeous silk baby pink button up. I thought I bought it in a petite small but I accidentally got a petite large. Too big! Just a couple of weeks ago I decided to sell/donate it. Afterwards,  I went to shop at goodwill...I found the exact same blouse in a petite small! For $4!!!!!	episode_done:True
text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:My 20s were spent wearing fast fashion as business casual! The really cheap brands (e.g. F21, Fashion Nova - this was before SheIn) did NOT work well for me - the low-quality was obvious in the fit and drape of the fabric, plus it was pretty difficult to find office-friendly pieces in the first place.  H&M and the Banana Republic/J Crew Factory Outlets (they're online!) were a lifeline, and I still wear many items!  You may also have luck with resale sites like Poshmark and ThredUp.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: what does your shopping process look like?	labels:I have two processes  A 1. I decide I need a thing. For example, flared pants. 2. Narrow it down: pick  a color/ wash, rise ect. 3. I have a go- to shop for that where the sizing is consistent. I go there and get said item. that's it.  Scenario B is where I can't find the item I want easily. I browse the website/ wander aimlessly at the mall, than I get something completly unrelated. Sometimes these items turn out to be favorites, but more often than not I end up not wearing them. Cherry on top, sometimes I feel bad about having unworn clothing. I proceed and attempt to DIy them, destroying them completly in the process. I should really quit doing that.	episode_done:True

text:I was just watching a bunch of Seinfeld episodes with my kids and took some mental notes on Jerry’s style. He kind of has a uniform consisting of a baggy OCBD (often in unusual bold or pastel colors) tucked into slim-fitting jeans. The current oversized trend doesn’t really replicate what Jerry is doing with his shirt fits, as his button-down is generally too big all around — his shoulder seams often extend well past his natural shoulder and his pit-to-pit is a full 4 inches or larger than his natural chest. Check out the J. Crew 1994 line, which uses patterns from around that time period and can capture that billowy silhouette. The jeans are probably just Levi’s.  For outerwear, LL Bean and Eddie Bauer capture the vaguely outdoorsy casual vibes he usually gives off, things like barn coats and parkas. You never see him in a sleek wool topcoat.  When Jerry is performing, he’s usually in a loose-fitting sportcoat with big shoulder pads — your best bet there would be to look at vintage Gucci from the 90s on the secondhand sites.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Knit Tie Inspo / Lookbook	labels:It's rather unique I have never seen this style before. I feel that it looks best with a sweater and jacket over it. Also it needs to be a tight knit not loose like grandma scarfs.	episode_done:True
text:Do you think fashion or style has age restrictions?	labels:I'm mid-30s and I still wear that stuff on weekends! There is definitely stuff I avoid, but honestly, reflecting on it right now, that might be more my personal style at play than my age. I avoid anything too tight or clubby, and I  tend to go for block heels or pumps over stilettos or platforms. There was a whole going-out-top-nice-jeans trend in the 2000s that makes me avoid anything satin- or lace-based. But I think that Vans/Converse or crop tops/high-waisted jeans are definitely still in play if you're 30. And if that changes soon, I'd guess it's because the trends change rather than what is appropriate age-wise!
text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:How much hanging space do you have available? I might start by separating formal/informal, and then micro-categorize from there! And I'd loosen up the boundaries for categorizations to jackets/coats, sweaters/cardigans, dresses/jumpsuits, tops, and bottoms, just for ease. Then I'd organize each category by color.  As for storing clothes that are in-between wears...I usually just dump those on a chair and re-wear them throughout the week until they need to be washed tbh.	episode_done:True
text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I got my first fancy bag after calling off my wedding lol I figured it cost around the same amount as the dress I wouldn’t ever wear so why not? The woman at the LV store thought I was on drugs ... “are you celebrating something?” And I’m like as a matter of fact, yes, yes I am. I just lost a ton of money on a wedding but I dodged a bullet and left that POS. All she said was “well you can always make more money” anyway, I’m getting a Chanel bag for my next milestone birthday. Not sure which one but it’s gonna happen soon.
text:Down Jackets	labels:It's with noting that down doesn't handle moisture well. At all. If you're going to be somewhere where it rains a lot you'll want some kind of waterproofing.  As a hiker I just carry a light waterproof jacket, but if your not going to layer up, either stay dry, get waterproof, or go synthetic  It's also with noting that I'm an idiot who didn't read the stuff op quoted where it says exactly this	episode_done:True

text:Yeah - I wouldn't skimp on denim and footwear. A nice pair of boots that will last years and grow patina, same with denim fades. You can skimp a bit on the rest -    for example today I'm wearing: $300 Samurai Jeans, $x00 boots, $x00 vintage watch - but paired with an $8 Hanes cotton/poly sweatshirt from amazon and $5 generic khaki hat from walmart.	labels:As much as I love denim, $300 for a pair vs a brand like Uniqlo that you can get for $49 is absurd to me.
text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I work in an office and am supposed to dress business casual.   My entire closet is work clothes and while some of it is cute it’s mostly boring and safe.   I feel like my personal style is edgy and fun. I’m working on curating a weekend wardrobe and not focusing on work outfits until I have just as much weekend  and after work clothes. I’m thinking fun  Art teacher and also colorful mom clothes but we will see I also like basics a lot like jeans and a black top .
text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I'm just... still getting dressed up. This has actually given me a nice opportunity to try new combinations of outfits and pull out pieces that I wasn't sure about before. The routine of getting dressed and feeling put together is really important for me with regards to getting into the work mindset.

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:From 2001-2005, clothing I wore as a high schooler/college kid: low rise bootcut jeans, fitted graphic tshirts, fitted polo shirts, fitted shirts in general (shirts were so tight- maybe that’s why we layered??), always layering shirts- and shirts were super long and over your hips, but tight- never tucking them in, cutoff denim skirts, cotton shorts (like soffees) with words on the butt, necklace with my first initial on it, platform flip flops, dresses with Hawaiian prints (like flowers or surfers etc), hoop earrings, fitted hoodies. That’s what I can remember.
text:Is black tie comfort fashion a thing?	labels:Yes I call it formal pajamas. Brands like Johnny Was, Citron Santa Monica, and Eileen Fisher (her silk, velvet, and silk georgette). Plus the $$$ designer versions of these. A draped  band collar top in a brocade, and matching loose pants isn't quite black tie but it is formal!   For absolute black tie, I'd say maybe...Donna Karan Urban Zen + major jewelry. something like that. Like a full length avant guarde kaftan in shockingly expensive silk with shibori tie dye or something.  However perfectly fitted vintage clothing + sensitive skin likely isn't happening.   But you can translate aspects of that to your style---like for example you can get a full length ruched parachute silk skirt with granny boots and a draped lace top + a "mourning coat" for a funky "Magnolia Pearl" lagenlook formal style.	episode_done:True

text:Lugged boot trend	labels:I adore platform chunky shoes. My late 90's early 2000's teenage self is VERY onboard for this. The boots might be a bit much for me- I'd love to be cool enough for Doc Marten Jadons but I can't imagine where I'd wear them. I can't even think of the last time I've been somewhere where I'd just look cool and not like I'm trying too hard.   My forte, however, is flat form sneakers. I had a pair of Sketchers Whompers that I got on clearance for $1 at a Marshalls when I was in HS. The world had moved on to those 3 inch platform flip flops by then, but I wore the absolute shit out of those Whompers.   I won a credit on Poshmark and ordered some checkerboard platform vans that I've coveted for years. Booyah.
text:General Discussion - November 27, 2020	labels:Hot take: speaking from experience, fetishistically optimizing the most basic of basics (e.g. "the best plain white t-shirt") for maximum imagined value is not a meaningful nor worthwhile exercise. Your wardrobe is not more interesting because your white tee is better than another white tee, and by the time you've found the 'perfect' piece either the prevailing trend or your own preferences will probably have changed.  'Perfect tee' threads are usually highly-upvoted, but the answers have drawn from the same pool for the last goddamn decade:  - *Vintage/workwear (generally heavier, boxier, shorter):* 3sixteen, Buzz Rickson's, Lady White Co. - *Streetwear (generally lighter, slimmer, longer):* Reigning Champ, wings + horns, John Elliott - *"Normal" (somewhere in the middle)*: Naked & Famous, Arket, American Apparel when they still existed - *Edgy goth shit:* Rick Owens mainline for lighter and DRKSHDW for heavier, Kazuyuki Kumagai Attachment, Voidthebrand when they still existed - *Budget*: Muji, Uniqlo, Everlane, Bella+Canvas, etc., but no one really cares  It's functionally a solved question. You can pick one from the applicable list for your style, and it'll be *fine.*
text:Derek Guy: The Crown’s ‘Balmoral Test’ Barbours Are Not Just Jackets	labels:Its a wonderful jacket, a Barbour.

text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:It’s less about the value of the item and more about the stars aligning perfectly.  I wear a size 12-13W shoe, plus other things that make my feet really hard to fit, so I am used to buying formalwear to match the one maybe two pairs of formal shoes I own at any given time.  So when I was 17 and going to prom in 2006, my mom tried really hard to help me find shoes, any shoes, that were suitable. But we could only find casual flats or runners, and I realllly wanted to dress up nicely for the first real time in my life. So she said “you know what, let’s buy a dress and then we will just have to find a way.”  So I picked out a black and pale pink dress that just made me swoon, and I figured black heels would be easiest to find. Lol I was so young and stupid.  Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn’t find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I’d just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.
text:Are there any actual fashion trends in 2020?	labels:we must be living on different planets.   lingerie as camisoles, fur trim everything, distressed tops, denim skirts, sweater vests, low rise pants, straight leg replacing skinny jeans, patchwork jeans, patterned tights, flared leggings, corset tops, fur lined boots, super tall platform shoes, juicy tracksuits, animal prints, tie dye, hand and leg warmers, fluffy bags, all were super popular trends last year. this has been the most trend heavy year in my memory, I could barely keep up.
text:What were the fashion finds that made you cry of happiness?	labels:I'd wanted a nice pair of Nike shoes for a while, but the ones I liked were way out of my price range... One day while I was shopping in a shoe store I found the exact pair of shoes that I wanted and they were $40 off! It was a gift from heaven. I still to this day can't believe I found them and at such a good price!	episode_done:True

I don’t like that at all. It also feels like he’s trying to buy a new identity and while style can help with that, you can’t buy a new personality from Gucci.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 02, 2020	labels:Thanks heaps to /u/dai_due' for selling me one of his Uniqlo +J hybrid down parka! finally received it and love it. Can't believe size XS actually works on me (normally medium in uniqlo stuff). Still has enough room to layer and somehow still has that oversized look. Amazed!  Also, after about 6 months of wear, I can confidently say the Auralee seamless tee is my favourite one that I own. I immediately knew it was gonna be my favourite as soon as I received it but I wanted to see how it was after many wears. One of the best features about it is that it's so soft but still drapes so nicely. And any wrinkle it develops after being folded in the closet basically straightens itself out after being worn for about 10 minutes. Shit! now i'm looking for more in different colors. A bit expensive at retail price but I've seen them on sale for around $50 which is doable for me.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 13, 2020	labels:Slacks are the most comfortable items in my wardrobe short of sweaters. Why do so many men hold the sentiment that “dressing up” equates to being uncomfortable? I just went to a Christmas service at an employee’s rural church where everyone wears jeans or other 5 pocket pants and oxfords. No problem with that at all, but 4 or 5 people made comments about my slacks/shirt/tie/bomber jacket/boots(he said be casual...I still over dressed with the tie) with things like “man I’m glad someone can wear those”.   Who hurt these people? Are teenage men being put in some awful $99 suits and being traumatized? I have never worn less than a decent department store suit so maybe I am blind to struggles of others, but even a $300 department store suit is quite comfortable. Nothing compared to 100% wool tailored pants that feel like amazing pajamas, but still comfortable compared to jeans.

text:What’s your everyday purse?	labels:I do a capsule wardrobe and typically keep these purse types out and ready for action, I just swap out which one based on the wardrobe's color scheme so I can spend time with all my bags :)   A black minimalist "hobo bag" for errand running or going to a friend's house. It's split into two sides with several small pockets. Holds a water bottle, my iPad, fidget toys, phone wallet keys or and some reusable grocery bags with room to spare. Could hold a laptop. This is the bag things can get lost in. I could use it for an overnight trip if I really needed to. It's the biggest purse I've owned in a long time, but I'm really loving it.   A mini backpack for bike riding days or hiking with friends. Has a mesh pocket inside and can hold phone wallet keys a sandwich and headphones. Athletic type material. I have this in black, beige and fuschia.   A canvas satchel/messenger bag for doctor's office type visits where I'll have to wait or errands that need less stuff brought along. Has a few compartments and can fit my iPad, kindle or an 8x5 book with phone wallet keys, lotion, probably some makeup if needed. I have this in brown, purple and charcoal because it's such a good bag.   A small black pleather half-moon crossbody with gold accents for quick stuff like the gas station, taking a walk or some type of event where I have to look nice. I have a similar green one and a Togepi one that can be swapped out, but I love this one the most.  I talk too much. Yay.

Even though I prefer natural fibers I have definitely eschewed linen pants from target because it's low quality, see through, and scratchy. I also hate how sometimes a cotton tee warps after washing because it wasn't prewashed prior to being cut and seen but that has more to do with the production of the garment rather than the fiber content, but it's still an example that not all natural fiber items are great (if not made well).	labels:	episode_done:True

I’ve learned to differentiate between the two while I shop, at least. If I was a celebrity suddenly, maybe I would lean towards hopeful-me’s style, but for now I am normal and realistic!

text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:In my earlier 20s I dressed Sustainably, or at least LOOKED like I did. Big, oversized linen shirts with roomy pants. I only bought basics, and neutrals, but the clothes themselves were pretty boring and uninspired.   Then I went back to black, wore some Phillip Lim black trousers everywhere and a fitted top. Still very basic and safe, but I knew about designers and trends. I had more money to spend on clothing, but not enough for the clothes I really wanted (thank god i didnt have the cash to drop on some jesse kamm sailor pants...-_-)  This past year I've come more into my own, and I feel way more comfortable with myself. So now I'm finally developing my own style (which ive honestly been doing for decades...) and buying pieces that aren't so basic. Colorwise....it's a lot of black. But it's mixed with fun accessories, anime keychains on my bag, and innovative fabrics (eg Pleats Please) My reservations around feeling uncomfortable in my clothing, or sticking out too much, has really dwindled. I'm leaning into avant-garde designers while still incorporating my leftovers from my Sustainable phase.	episode_done:True

I liked the variety of clothes I was able to wear and enjoyed "dressing up" once a week or more!  In college, daily clothes were jeans, blouses, sweaters. I had one friend who dressed to the nines everyday-makeup, hair, the works.  I admired her and I wish now that I would have followed her example. I was too afraid to stand out and also too lazy! I did only what I needed to do to stay a B student. Staying up late at parties makes it hard to wake up and do your hair. She was also at the top of the class (chemical engineering) and was a talented actress. I don't think she missed out on fun, but probably didn't have as many hangovers as I did.  I never went back to "daily dressy" at work (flats and trousers in the lab), but I didn't wear jeans every day until grad school.  My message- don't be afraid to stand out! Express yourself and you will have plenty of admirers. Encourage others to do the same.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I haven’t shopped at Lululemon in years (seriously, probably 8 yrs) & I always loved the brand, but fell off the athleisure train.  I went online to order a pair of high rise, plain black, full length leggings hopefully slimming & the product ratings were just so bad that it surprised me and deterred me!  Do you have a specific style that you recommend?!	labels:This question is so subjective! R/lululemon should help you out if you know what you’re looking for in a legging. Aligns are very popular, I love them they don’t slide down and are very smooth, however the quality isn’t as great. Wonder unders are popular too but they come in two fabrics that are very different from one another so you need to watch for that. The ones mentioned above with the side pocket and draw string are invigorates I like these but I find they slide down.

text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:There is nothing wrong with having 2 or more sets of clothes (work and not-work). I have to wear outdoor clothing for my "big girl job" - think wellies and raincoat or full on hiking gear - and a lot of jobs require a uniform. I also play a sport so i have kit for that. And I have a set of smarter clothes for the odd time I need them (weddings, funerals and interviews!) It's not unsustainable. You dont have to go minimalist or what you think is sophisticated if you don't want to.   As for age appropriate? When I was mid 20's I gave up (most) things that are for children and looked it because I felt I looked silly in them (I'm early 30s) but that was about it for age appropriateness. Other stuff I stopped wearing because my body and/or style changed rather than just ageing. Even the kiddie stuff, i dont think its necessarily silly/ageing on everyone. Some people really go all out on it and OTT and make it a look, and good for them. I did have a sudden panic late 20s that I needed to dress more adult, and wasted some money on things I never wore. But most of the pressure was coming from me and from magazine features. My friends, colleagues and partner DGAF.	episode_done:True
text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:Im Op I’ll share mine-  Personally I sort of plan my makeup look based of what I’m wearing   I do mostly dramatic Smokey eyes and cut crease looks with bright blush and lipstick everywhere in colors that either match my outfit or just compliment it well! I also do more eye liner dramatic looks at times as well! Usually if I’m wearing something a bit more cutesy I’ll do my makeup to reflect the look. If Im wearing my black velvet blazer set I’ll do thé likes of and orange and gold Smokey eye to make it more bold and less professional looking! I have a very dressy style with masculine, Victorian, and highly detailed elements so bold colorful makeup makes some of my more stuffy looks less boring. I’ve lately been after doing my foundation putting a bit of blush from the bottom front of my eye bags to the top of my brow bone. I love how it makes makeup a little more unique and makes me look a little less baby faced.  I used to wear very skater boyish/ art kid outfits and hair ( I still respect the style still though ) but wore heavy Instagram glam style makeup. I still do glam makeup but it looked quite odd at times! I didn’t really think much about makeup in relation to clothing then, not that it’s really necessary! I feel I’ve come far with my style!

text:Im in aus and the last funeral I went too (for an elderly aunt) there were a group of early 20 year old women in melb cup crossed with club wear. They were cousins of cousins type thing.  I'm talking like orange neon body con mini mini dresses with the fake tan, huge fascinators, glittery platform stilettos. When they walked in they seemed to realise it was not appropriate and spent a lot of the church service trying to yank their dresses over their bums and looking awkward.   At my wedding my brother rocked up with holey jeans, a flanno and a bouquet of dead roses he got from the servo for free.   I'm from syd so maybe that's it because people from melb really out do us in the fashion stakes.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: Why/ when/ how do you cuff jeans?	labels:**Why:** to make the hemline higher, to provide a visual break between your pants and your shoes (useful if they're a similar colour), or because they are raw denim that will bleed on your shoes excessively if you don't. I suppose some people also cuff in order to flex the selvedge ID, but why condemn yourself to a life of fruitlessly hoping that somebody will notice your selvedge ID?  **How:** idk, you just kind of roll them up. Usually a width of about an inch looks good, but experiment with wider or narrower cuffs as well as with the height of the hem and see what looks good.
text:I bought a JE zip up hoodie. I also have Stone Island and Burberry hoodies, as well as American Apparel and other cheaper ones. I won't say spending $300+ (cad) on hoodies is smart, but the main difference I note is the cut. Comfort, like you said, isn't too different unless you get into cashmere, but the difference in cut and overall shape and sizing is much better. I definitely wanna get my hands on a Todd Snyder Champion hoodie though, that's right up my alley.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:When to start saving clothes for your children?   Never. You don't know:   1. If you'll have children 2. If you'll have a girl or and trans child who would find it appropriate to wear your clothes 3. If they'll even have the same fashion sense as you 4. If they will be the same size as you 5. If your clothes will hold up to the ravages of time   I come from a family of hoarders. I have some hoarding tendencies of my own which I'm dealing with. I'm also in the midst of cleaning out my mum's home after she died almost 2 years ago. I go over every weekend and spend a few hours clearing out her stuff. I've been doing this for going on 18 months. I've spent hundreds of dollars trucking stuff to the dump. I learned the hard way that it's not worth holding onto stuff, *just in case*.  My mother held onto every piece of baby clothing and toddler and children's and a lot of teen clothing I wore. And all of her clothes. And all of my grandmother's clothes. And all of my brothers and sisters and father's clothes. And some of her sister's stuff, too. And you know what it looks like now? Most of it has disintegrated, some chewed up by mice, others damaged by moths, and a lot damaged by mold. Anything that hasn't been destroyed by time has gone to charity. I love my mother, and I have memories from my mother, I don't need her moth-eaten, moldy, brittle leather jacket from 50 years ago. And neither do your kids. Give your stuff away to charity to people who need it now, and don't leave behind boxes of crap for your kids to have to deal with after you're dead. Cleaning out my mother's home is teaching me to be a minimalist.    Put money aside, and use it to buy things your child actually wants. And donate your unwanted clothes to charity to people who need it now.   e: don't even get me started on toys, old school work, books, records, VHS tapes...    e: This is coming from a 41 year old who never had kids (even though she always thought she would).
text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:I also hate wearing pants. Don’t know how cold we’re talking but up to around  40 F, I would pretty much wear any autumn-y skirt/dress and rely on my wool tights, knee high leather boots, and a long wool coat to provide warmth for my lower body. Personally, most of the skirts I chose to wear were 100% cotton denim, leather, or suede!
text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:The beauty with fashion is that there are so many middle grounds! To venture out of your comfort zone, some ideas are:  - Wear kitten heels or pretty pumps instead of boots. Practically speaking, they'll also be more comfy than stilettos  - Try to incorporate one item of pattern or bold colour which you like into your wardrobe. Plan ahead and style it in different ways with your existing wardrobe, according to different  circumstances (e.g. casual lunch, work day, nice dinner out), and wear it when you get the chance  - Stop thinking too much about what others think and try to identify what looks and things you like instead.   - I prefer to dress for the occasion (e.g. it'd be silly to wear a little black dress with heels if I'm going for a countryside visit), but you can still look nice doing so for whatever event! In the countryside example, I would dig out some nice cable knit jumper paired with jeans, my Barbour and a lovely woollen scarf, plus chunky boots. Equally I could style that with a cute skirt instead of jeans if there's less climbing over stiles and more visits to village pubs and quaint coffee shops. (Not that there's any chance to do the above anytime soon. #bloodyCovid)	episode_done:True

I love it because it’s a pretty tiny bag— perfect for me since I don’t need to carry any makeup around because I don’t wear it! I couldn’t focus at work with all that cake on my face, I don’t know how those other girls do it. they probably aren’t hitting their performance targets like I am!   I also love that it’s vegan— I wouldn’t want to do any harm to my fellow living beings! anyway gtg, I have to go sell bets on the value of someone’s family home :).
text:Feeling self-conscious with changing style around family - anyone relate? Tips?	labels: I way overdress for my family and have been for a few years. Lately they have started upping their own style for things like holidays and family hangouts which is kind of sweet. My dad once saw what I was going to wear to a restaurant with him went "SHIT" and put on a whole new outfit with nice shoes and a suprisingly hip button-down.  You may face some comments, but eventually they'll just get used to it and may even start putting more effort in themselves!
text:I've taken 566 outfit photos over 4 years (my style from mid-20s to 30)	labels:One thing I've always thought you excelled at was understanding your body and silhouettes. I've always enjoyed your OOTDs (especially your travel posts!) because you knew what worked for your body and repeatedly used that formula. I'm sure taking outfit photos helped, since it's almost like viewing it from someone else's perspective.   I also was wondering where did you get your trench you have in photos from 2020?

text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:Try to see things from their perspective. *You* know that this is your real sense of style, and you have liked these clothes for a long time, but to your friends and family, you are a person that wears a t-shirt and jeans. So when you wear a skirt, that's very different and out of character for you. You just need to grind through the first few times, and then they will expect you to dress like that and they won't say anything.  And yes, "because I felt like it" is a good enough answer. Did someone tell you it wasn't? They're wrong.
text:is it main line stuff or items created specifically for Nordstrom rack?	labels:It's main line stuff. My guess is they are dumping stock due to covid. If you look at their sale section, some of it is the exact same stuff as what's currently at NR, only more expensive. I'm actually a little pissed because I bought the Day Heel Mule when it first came out, which was just after covid hit, and I haven't worn them since. Now they're $40 (!!!) and Nordstrom Rack.  That said, I've come to hate Everlane after hearing the horror stories from @ex.wives.club on IG. Kind of pulled back the Oz curtain a bit for me, tbh. If you look at any of their marketing, they're just so up their own ass, which just isn't going to fly anymore in a post-covid world, imo.	episode_done:True
text:But the second question is where to buy second hand from? For example near me we have the Salvation Army and a church thrift shop. I used to live next to a giant Salvation Army donation center and loved it, but after learning about their philosophy and some of the shady things they’ve done I no longer feel like I can ethically support them! Then supporting the local church thrift is also problematic given their stances on social issues! When I lived in California I was able to find some thrift stores that actually gave to causes I support (out of the closet etc) but now that I’m in the Midwest there aren’t any of these! I just want like a thrift store that donates to something like education or food banks without the religious/social aspect.	labels:Check your local paper, or google consignment stores near me. You'll be surprised at what you may find in your area that is not one of the big names. Most will have a FB page that you can check out who owns them. Another idea is there may be a store that is set up to do annual/seasonal pop up style consignment where they hold a sale from a Thursday-Saturday. And finally try Poshmark, while some folks like to do insane mark ups, there are other sellers who just want to move their stuff out. You can do offers and bundles that can help drive down the cost.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have moved for extended periods of time on 1 or 2 suitcases only, how did you do it? Here's the beginning of my process	labels:My job has made me a nomad (I WFH now to most offices being shut down).  However, only 1 of my assignments over the last decade had me travel by air.  The rest of the time, I simply loaded up my car.  I am no minimalist (fashion wise, I am in other parts of my life) and a capsule wardrobe has zero appeal to me.  I typically hit the road for anywhere from 2-6 months at a time.  When I flew, my luggage was 1 wheeled carry on size suitcase (the largest carry on size allowed), 1 larger checked bag, and a backpack (I gate checked the carry on suitcase when they were looking for people to gate check bags).  I was able to fit enough clothes for 2 months into those because I also brought a collapsible mesh laundry basket with me along with laundry pods (which I otherwise do not use).  My caveat is that due to my industry (US politics), everything is domestic.  I've never traveled internationally as an adult.

text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:I’m in your boat and have been for several years now. I was usually between 140-160lbs and a solid hourglass until I was around 23-24 thanks to a combo of PCOS, hormonal birth control, and wedding planning-induced stress eating. These days I float between 220-230lbs and most of my weight hangs out in my belly so I look pregnant lol. In my thinner days I liked form-fitting pin-up style clothing. These days I tend to go for loose, flowy blouses,flannels, and sweaters.   For pants I discovered the joy of stretchy paper bag style pants over the summer and in the fall/winter I do anything black and high-waisted. I still refuse to give up skinny jeans though as I detest anything flared. I swapped H&M out for Torrid and I still get most of my clothes at Target as they usually have decent options for work clothes. I’ve recently discovered that Old Navy makes the best fitting, AFFORDABLE jeans for me.	episode_done:True

text:Athleisure button down shirts	labels:I've had good experience with Twillory shirts.  Good stretch and it travels really well.  I find that it may wrinkle a little but if you spray with a water bottle and let dry it'll come out.  My biggest complaint is that I'm normally a 14.5 / 32 with a 38 chest and 31 waist, and i think i'm in between sizes so mine are a little oversized at 15 and 32/33 (since they don't make a one number sleeve length) rather than my buttons popping off.    I haven't brought myself to buy any of the others since they are 40% more at best and if you buy 2 or more you can get the same as the others but a 2 for 1.  I've tried on mizzen and main but they are just way too big for me even at their small / trim size.  You could find those on nordstrom earlier this year for less than $100.	episode_done:True
text:What rockstar(s) you take fashion inspiration from? What do you like about their style?	labels:I absolutely love rock and heavy metal music so wear a lot of band tees when I’m not in work, I describe my off duty style as ‘polite rocker/goth’ (since I don’t have tattoos, piercings other than my ears or wear ripped or distressed clothes). Usually it’s jeans and a tee with some black biker boots or faux snakeskin trainers, plus some fun jewellery - I recently got some small, silver, spiked hoops which I love. If my tee doesn’t have a band on it might be a cool graphic (a couple I got recently have a bat and a snake on).	episode_done:True
text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers. Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:I almost completely revamped my winter wardrobe this year and tried really hard to shop sustainably and thoughtfully. I had enough jackets (am currently rocking my mom's old leather jacket, a patagonia puff, and a mountain hardware insulated ski jacket depending on the day).   The big things I did add were 8 new tops (5 good, thick sweaters, 2 waffle long sleeves, and a hooded long sleeve). Everything I get was from REI or L.L.Bean. One sweater and one waffle shirt is an REI Co-op (their in house brand), an L. L. Bean, Icebreaker,  Patagonia, and Prana sweater, the other waffle was North Face, and the hooded long sleeve was Smartwool. I love them all and have gotten rid of almost all my other tops. They are so comfortable and can be worn in many ways.  My other big addition was Kamik Sienna mid duck boots in a coffee ish color. I am in LOVE with them. They look super cute with jeans and leggings and are well put together. I have worn them almost everyday in slush, snow, rain and my feet have never been cold. I can not recommend them enough. For Christmas I got my sister in law a pair of Kamik Rouge lo snow boots and everytime I've seen her (almost every weekend) she's been wearing them.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:I think it’s a must but I don’t think it has to technically be a “LBD”. As long as the color is a dark neutral like navy, burgundy, or charcoal it’s fine and a very subtle pattern or texture is okay too, like an obvious woven or tweed. As for the dress part, it could be a non-little dress or even a jumpsuit. For me, I think it’s a relief to have a go to outfit for certain situations. Here are some imaginary ones for someone your age: your boyfriend/girlfriend’s conservative parents decide to surprise visit them at school and they want to take you both to a nice restaurant for dinner tonight; you need to attend a wake for someone who passed away suddenly; you get a call that there’s a new spot open for a highly competitive summer internship and interviews are only a couple days away. In each of these scenarios, it’s so much easier to know that you have a go-to look that is always appropriate especially since some of these can be stressful without worrying about your outfit.	episode_done:True

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:Accessories are just as subject to cycles in fashion as anything else, but I always save mine even when I throw out tops and pants. Partly that is because my body won’t outgrow a necklace.   For some reason every woman around me was wearing stars the last two years, and I never saw it outside of this town. But because I had kept some old star earrings I had stopped wearing, I was already set to be on-trend. I think super thin necklaces are on the way out. But if you already have one you really like and don’t mind putting it away for several years, chances are it will be fashionable again.  And since you’re going for adult fashion, don’t forget black leather (or glittery plastic) business card cases. Even if your field doesn’t use business cards, you can put credit cards in them. I like the Francesca’s chain for those.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have any visual guides for how clothes should fit	labels:I really appreciate this question/thread. I didn’t grow up seeing anyone in my family or circles wearing well-tailored clothing or professional attire in general so i genuinely don’t know what a good fit looks like. I struggle a lot with having a curvier body and a loud personality but not wanting to feel like a pinup girl caricature if my clothes are too tight or fit a certain way. I’ve never really thought about what i would and wouldn’t consider a good fit on me, besides my Levi’s 721s. I really need to have myself a think on this!	episode_done:True

But before it gets to those super extreme sad months, I like wearing a short fitted puffer jacket with a winter down miniskirt over leggings and doc martens.  The short jacket makes me feel like I still have a shape and the down miniskirt keeps my bum warm and looks cute.

text:Share what are your quick tips to always look polished !	labels:I have 2 pups and have accepted that I will always have dog hair on me.   Back when I wore more business clothes, I would have separate at home and work clothes. Changed out of my work clothes as soon as I got home and into sturdier/less expensive outfits.   Also recommend keeping a lint roller in the car.   To generally look polished: add an accessory like a scarf, earrings or a necklace.   I’m also a fan of tucking shirts/sweaters.
text:Inspo Album: Ringing in the New Year!	labels:I love anything shiny / iridescent / sequined / beaded. It's actually a struggle every year to decide which outfit to wear for NYE. I found a really cool purple/orange holo sequin dress at goodwill forever ago and I think it might be the winner this year, with a faux fur jacket over top.

text:Become a Tailored Suit Pro - Guide	labels:If you're totally new to tailoring this is a okay start. For those of us further down our sartorial journeys (© Hugo Jacomet), this is woefully incomplete. I'm not sure how one reads this guide and emerges a "tailored suit pro." Very little of it meaningfully addresses how anything should fit and how to achieve an ideal fit through alterations. Also the section on suit construction and whether or not something is "designer" level is almost laughable.	episode_done:True

The looks just don't do it for me and in some ways they look incomplete. It looks like he decided to wear a dress the day he showed up to the shoot. It just seems, for lack of a better term, lazy. Like they didn't really care what this meant. He needed more hair and makeup work in my opinion. Something to make people look at it and be like "wow, he looks really pretty and I bet he feels it”  or some eye color would've pulled the whole thing together. Or a pretty necklace! I think lacking these little details is why people will say he didn't pull it off and is sort of a let down considering what this symbolizes. Open to hearing from other people who support the look, tho

Until then I’m also in the oversized T-shirt camp.
text:Reliable brands to buy in South America - Americans your opinions please!	labels:/u/bestmaokaina might be able to help you.  Personally, I think Tommy, Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss, and some lines from Armani are all low-end brands that bank on their names and established supply chains and distribution networks to get attention for cheaply made, uninspired clothing. Some Armani clothing is better, but it's all drastically overpriced. Lauren Ralph Lauren and some Polo Ralph Lauren are the same; some Polo Ralph Lauren is pretty good, but you won't find it in a Macy's or equivalent. The really good Ralph Lauren clothing is mostly only sold in Ralph Lauren stores.  Lacose is fine. Nothing too special, but not trash.  Ermenegildo Zegna is quite good. Better than Z Zegna, not as good as zegna couture, pretty nice in general.

text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:I spend about 3-4% (~$250/month) of my take home income on clothes. It would probably be around 7-8% if handbags and shoes were included.   I’m in my late 20s and fortune enough to be making a pretty good income. It’s totally normal to be spending a lot less when you’re in college! Some students have parental help with finances or spend their money from part time work on clothes. Don’t feel pressured to spend money on clothes when you have other priorities that come first (like school, rent, food, savings).	episode_done:True

I also switch around based on quality, fit, and price.   I have a question, though... Your username is BlueWaistcoat. Do you actually have a blue waist coat? Is it a blazer or like a track jacket? How do you manage workwear? No job I've ever had would have allowed me to go to work in Adidas every day. Well, maybe one employer, but I don't think it would have conveyed the right level of professionalism. And what do you wear for special occasions, like weddings and funerals?  Is there a line of Adidas that I am overlooking? I am only familiar with their athletic and athleisure clothing.
text:People who made out like a bandit during COVID-19 sales, what gems have you picked up?	labels:I don't have a link to share but I have been online thrifting a lot lately and I just got a pair of discontinued vintage looking reebok sneakers brand new with tags and labels on thredup. I paid $39 including shipping and taxes and when they arrived I saw the price tag showed they were originally sold for $130 so I was really happy with the deal and to get brand new shoes in an eco-friendly way!!	episode_done:True

text:I'd check out Allsaints on sale in that price range. They use a softer leather and it won't last you decades like something vintage or a Schott would, but with your budget they aren't bad. Big step up from what you can typically find at dept stores anywho.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Model poses while online shopping	labels:They do that when the fit if the garment is inferior. It is intentional.

text:Has anyone just said screw it and focused more on fit than color scheme for your outfits? What's an unlikely color combination that you ended up loving?	labels:I found a way to wear red and green recently without looking like a Christmas tree and my mind was blown! The red was more of a muted, terra-cotta color and the green was that pacific, dark blue-green that’s been so popular the last year or so.   Also recently found out that wearing a denim jacket with jeans was a bold style move but I’ve been doing it for years not knowing it might be a fashion mistake. 😂	episode_done:True

The bare, white walls and flickering fluorescent lights remind me to never show a shred of personality to my coworkers, lest they suspect that I occasionally engage in activities outside of work. My dog's despondent whimpers recall the helpless cries of teenagers on the brink of a nervous collapse as they juggle arbitrary deadlines, crushing debt, and the insidious suspicion that it's all a bunch of bullshit. One big advantage of working from home is the ready supply of cheap coffee to keep me alert now that I'm expected to be available at any time--day, night, and weekend. I'm having heart palpitations and the entire left side of my face is numb, but my productivity is unmatched!

text:How do ya'll express your culture or traditional fashion in modern clothing?	labels:I’m Vietnamese, and I’ve only recently been interested in my cultural clothing because of - well, internalized racism, which wasn’t great, LOL. But what I’ve done is save up for custom áo dài!  Traditionally, áo dài is pretty eye-catching, especially in the U.S. (where I live). I’m saving up to create tailor-made áo dài that’s more modern and something understated I could wear often: for example, switching out white silk pants for black ones, and the main dress for a crushed navy velvet. I find that modernizing cultural clothing can be a way to represent your cultural and ethnic roots without feeling strange or like an impostor, and seeing the same, familiar cuts in different prints and tones that I like fills me with a whole new type of joy.  I also follow other people who wear modernized cultural clothing. The first example that comes to mind is @asunnydisposish on Twitter, who is an artist but often posts pictures of her putfits (modernized hanbok). I have an album of Vietnamese clothing outside of áo dài (like áo nhật bình) and other designers’ takes on modern áo dài, and another album of textures, prints, and fabrics I would kill to wear.   Other ways you can incorporate this into your clothing is supporting artists and designers from whatever ethnic group/culture you belong to!  If anyone’s interested in seeing the albums, I’m more than willing to share; I just don’t know how to operate imgur yet, which seems to be the go-to for everyone here. I hope this helped! Best of luck!

I've ordered from both AE and SHEIN and tbh getting everything in one package in a week vs 10 packages that may or may not show up between 1-2 months after the order date is one thing that SHEIN does right.     Do I think it's a good company? No. But I'm a broke bitch who can't afford nice staple pieces, esp with my weight fluctuating so much due to covid and being depresso.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Cristophe Loiron of Mister Freedom - Inspiration Album	labels:I love Mister Freedom and own a few pieces. I’m especially fond of his Campus leather jacket and Road Champ boots - which I don’t have yet.  The shirt I have doesn’t fit me great. It’s too trim for me, even in size 42/xl.   The pants, however, fit fantastic and thread the line quite well between straight and wide. They’re high waisted fatigues with a 9 inch opening in a camo pattern of his own design that’s reminiscent of frogskin/ duck hunter camo.   Lately, the new workwear repro Labour Union (which isn’t union made, despite the name) have straight up copied his Ranch Blouse design. Fuck them.  Christophe Loiron has a personal blog where he talks about his products, his design process and his inspiration. It’s a great read if you like design and workwear.
text:Are jean shorts on men really that bad?	labels:Listen, there are very few things, if any, in menswear that are always wrong.  But as far as single items go, jorts are very, very, very rarely right.  Denim is a generally a heavy, workwearish fabric designed to protect your legs. Shorts are generally worn for comfort -- they should be lighter, or softer, or both. And there are a few more reasons that jorts are... unnatural, but... They are, don't wear them unless you *really* know your shit. Like, "studies runway shows like an academic" level of knowing your shit.
text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:I sort on ThredUp by particular brands or really specific items.

It let me sort by shirts in my size, made of silk, and then I picked animal print for the color. I found so many good options that I bought three!

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Pssst. You don't need to look "in" the way you think you do. Your clothes don't have to look like you bought them all this year. You are allowed to repeat outfits. You don't HAVE to consciously try to express yourself through clothes. You don't constantly have to try to visually display a personality to strangers. You can opt out and wear simple outfits like 90% of everyone. It's OK.     Sometimes the pressure feels suffocating, I know. But it's OK to not follow every trend. Despite what some posters in this sub think, the vast majority of people will not notice that you bought your jumper/coat/whatever in 2018. I actually like clothes and fashion but sometimes I'm too tired and just do the uniform thing. I just try changing how I do my makeup if I feel bored now, before trying to remix my whole wardrobe. I gave myself new eyebrows and tried a different style of eyeliner and I look different enough people asked if I had a hair cut (lol) which didn't involve even buying new makeup.    As for comments on my appearance, if they aren't nice or helpful ("You haven't blended your concealer" "You have leaves in your hair" "your shirt has popped open") I ignore it.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 19, 2020	labels:Hi y’all!  My 8 year old son has had issues with buttons and laces most his life. We recently found out (3 weeks ago) that he has autistic spectrum disorder and we’ve missed it because he also has a high IQ.  He’s hit a growth spurt recently and I’d like to move his wardrobe to more sensory friendly/ easier to dress himself clothes. He's going to have enough hardships in life, I figure that his clothes don't need to be one of them. It would also be pretty amazing if we could help him develop his own sense of style!  I think that there are pieces in streetwear that would be much easier for him to use than the jeans, flannel and laces boots that I wear. Seriously, this old millennial hipster basically looks like the token bearded bastard on every small batch beer label.  I’m looking for a starting place to find affordable pieces that I can help him start building a new wardrobe out of.  His needs: No buttons, no laces that need to be tied  His preferences: He doesn’t like material touching his calves with the exception of pjs, he dislikes wearing socks or shoes that go above his ankles  His likes: Space, nerd culture, kind messages, bright colors and fun graphics  Side note, my wife was recently diagnosed with cancer for the second time so our budget is really tight with her upcoming treatments.  If you made it this far in my post I appreciate your heroic effort! Thank you for any help you can provide.

text:I think this is an excellent example of when I think overdressing is rude.  How you dress communicates things. If you show up to a situation where messy and/or physical activities are planned and you're not dressed appropriately, you're essentially communicating distain for the planned activities. It's a non-verbal declaration of "you all go ahead and get dirty, I'll just watch."   If you're too good for picking up trash, why did you come to the trash cleanup day? If you knew you weren't going to participate in our frisbee game, why did you come to the frisbee party? Why did you come camping if you aren't prepared to let any part of you touch dirt - are you expecting everyone else to do extra work to make your camping experience squeaky clean? The only way to avoid that message is to dive right in and ruin your nice clothes.	labels:Aw this reminds me of the time when, in our honeymoon in France, we last-minute booked a grape-picking experience at a vineyard. I had no proper shoes so I just wore a pair of golden flats which were the most comfortable pair I had packed. When we went to the vineyard it was rainy and muddy and I felt quite judged by the looks when the rest of the people saw my shoes, they were all wearing rain boots or more appropriate gear. I was not expecting to go grape-picking in the mud when I packed! Anyway, the tour guide and the other women in the group made a bigger deal out of it than I did, I just went straight into the mud with my shiny shoes. It was incredibly fun and yes my shoes ended up all muddy but a good clean and they were good as new.

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:I dress on a date how I dress day-to-day, which is pretty casual, lots of natural fabrics, usually wearing running shoes or some other form of sneaker (Blundstone boot in winter).  So for a first date I might wear a pullover sweater or silk blouse, blue jeans, and my least grungy sneakers. I probably wouldn't wear makeup besides clear brow gel and a tinted lip balm (I like the Burt's Bees ones), but I would take the time to make sure my hair looks on point.  I guess if it's warm (like above 25C/75F) I'd wear jacquard shorts and a linen or silk t-shirt. Or a dress, but I don't usually wear dresses so I might feel awkward in one.  Comfort above all because I find that translates to feeling good about myself (no matter how the date goes).	episode_done:True

text:Let's Talk about hats	labels:There is hat etiquette from the days of yore. Here are some of the conventions that were adhered to:  A lady does not remove her hat when indoors or for the national anthem. This is in contrast to men, who are to remove hats when indoors and for the anthem. However, if you‘re sporting a baseball cap at a ballgame, I would remove it for the anthem, whereas if you were wearing a more formal outfit with hat then I would not remove it.  A hat is a daytime piece in most cases not suitable for evening wear. The fascinator is an exception to this rule, but is more of a Commonwealth/British thing.  A lady does not wear a hat in her own home, ie when receiving guests, and as a guest in a friend’s home a lady would remove her hat.

text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:Yeah, I shop a lot because I'm usually sad and it feels like new items will fix that somehow, or make people miraculously like me more. I'm aware that it doesn't work like that, but I love dressing up as a "new me" every day and I easily get bored... but that's just mental issues :/  With autism and me identifying as queer and all, I'm not exactly popular and there isn't one version of me I'd consider the real me, which makes it even more difficult. "The real me" fluctuates day by day, and so do my outfit preferences. I often buy things impulsively that I WILL love for quite some time, but never on two subsequent days, for example. I've been mocked for this, but I've still found I'm happiest like this, with my crazy big wardrobe and tons of different styles.

text:Well it varies! For a simple, basic cotton t shirt that is decent quality I’m willing to spend about $30 or so. For jeans, between $100-$150 (although cheaper would be great!), etc.   This is for every day clothing of course. For an evening dress I’ll spend $$$ for good quality, design, etc.   I just bought a $400 leather jacket.   So I guess the answer is it just depends! My main focus is decent quality, better than forever 21, SHEIN, etc. But not necessarily $50-$60 for a single shirt.   Sorry my answer isn’t more concise 😭	labels:	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: What is the environmental impact of different fabrics?	labels:Linen is quite amazing in that regard :  \- it doesn't have many natural predators so doesn't require a lot of pesticides, if any.  \- There's no need to water it AT ALL if you've chosen the field's location well, as natural precipitations will be enough.  \- Little to no chemical fertilizers are used, since they actively destroy linen's quality by making it lay on the floor.  \- Requires much less energy to weave into fabric than most other fibers, and is beautiful un-dyed.  \- It's a natural fabric, so recyclable.  \- Finally, since it wicks humidity and doesn't retain odors under "normal" conditions, you don't need to wash it as frequently, and since it has a "wrinkly" nature that is embraced by connoisseurs, you can get away with not ironing it.

text:More Men Reach for Sewing Machines	labels:Mom was a nurse and so I grew up hanging around a nursing home. In that time I learned to sew, knit, and crochet and it's interesting how much of a stigma there was around it, I just loved to create things. This was in the 90s. One woman would even tell me not to be ashamed, that there was a football player who knit (name escapes me).  I've had friends recently finally notice a lot of my mending and sewing machine, and ask if it was a pandemic thing. Like, no it's just not something you really talk about for some reason.	episode_done:True

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Try out a capsule wardrobe yourself first! Just pick a subset of clothes that constitutes your capsule, and try just wearing those for a month. If this issue is that you don’t feel like anything goes together, but you otherwise like the fewer options, then a capsule wardrobe seems like a good fit.

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:Poshmark filters suck, but the fact that you can ask the seller for more details and they can offer you discounts means that you can find great things!  I find that if I like something, about 30% of the time the seller will offer me a discount right away, so start going crazy on the likes if you are ready to purchase something.  I always sort by new so you get first pick of the best stuff.    I search for specific fabrics, but this doesn't work perfectly on Poshmark.  I love linen, so I often just type "linen" into the search bar and see what I find.  The problem is that Poshmark doesn't have a fabric filter, so "linen-looking" items will end up in there, and sellers that don't list fabric won't show up there.  But I've found awesome pieces this way!  "My size" straight up doesn't work for me.  It's annoying, but I always manually pick my size once I get to a category.	episode_done:True
text:My Gucci Addiction: Vanity Fair editor Buzz Bissinger's essay about spending $638k on clothes	labels:The line in the piece that stuck out for me was when he said he was on medication for "mild bipolarity."  The out-of-control spending, the hypersexuality, the losing a job due to temper outbursts...I'm not a psychiatrist, I just play one on the internet, but all of that put together  sounds like, at the very least, untreated hypomania.  To pass it off as only shopping addiction or "discovering himself" seems like underplaying some serious mental illness.

text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I have had the opposite experience because I'm gaining weight! I work from home in my one-story home now so it's easy to go a whole day without getting even 25% of the steps I normally would take, pre-pandemic. That plus stress-eating equals weight gain, but I'm trying to be kind to myself.   This does mean, however, that I don't fit in 75% of my clothes. I still have stretchy size 8 jeans in my closet I need to part with, which is absolutely crazy considering size 14 is what fits me most comfortably now.  I love to dress up and was often the overdressed person at pre-pandemic gatherings, so I get what you're saying about wanting nice things to wear on the rare occasion that you're seen. It feels nice to change it up from my favorite cozy/comfy sweatpants outfit I wear most days.   That said, I haven't been shopping as much as I normally would, but when I do, it's usually in-person from retail nearby so I can see items in person. I size up from what I think would fit (trying to be honest with myself) and usually it works out fine. I sometimes will over-buy, take things home to try on, then return what doesn't work. It's not perfect but that's what I've been doing, occasionally.  If I shop online, I shop from my trusted brands only, or again I follow my size-up rule.  Mostly though, I've found that the few cuter things I buy (like a Vera Wang blouse or a sweater dress from the Target down the street) hang in my closet for months before I realize I was fooling myself to think I'd rather wear this to sit at my desk than pajamas.	episode_done:True

text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:Mechanic here (yeah, a dude in female fashion advise, I know). Get greasy and filthy daily but have always had a more business casual/preppy style out of work. I'll wear polo shirts on the weekend even when I'm puttering around the house and nice sweaters in the evening. As others have said, lots of out of date clothes in my closet but as a guy that matters a lot less. I like to look good and always dress for or above the occasion. Bright side is: I spend VERY little money on clothes because they last so long. Jeans? 10 years easily. Graphic T's? 5+ years, no problem. Buy the things you love and don't worry about the money because the clothes will outlive your memory of the cost.  Added bonus, my wife and I go places together and look like we own the place.

text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it’s typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it’s a bottom, they no longer “stay up”. This usually happens with leggings or panties after about 5 or more years of regular wear with caring for the items properly.  I also had a faux leather jacket wear out after 6 years of regular wear. The faux leather ended up “peeling off” or something like that.
text:What movie/tv show was styled the best?	labels:Obligatory Mad Men
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:My situation was the opposite as far as I know me and my sister were allowed to choose to wear what we wanted from as early as I remember. I also had a job as a teen so I could afford my fashion design hobby. I'm in my early 30s now and I think I finally found my style, but I'm struggling to feel amazing about it as I'm a bit overweight and I think things that I like simply look better on slimmer women.  Anyhow: I experimented loads as a teen and ever since, really. Buying things, wearing them or not, making things. It takes time to figure out which of the things you own get a lot of wear and which don't. You could go to second hand shops as it's cheaper to buy more here to experiment with. A lot also depends on any demands from your job, if you currently work. If you can freely wear whatever, you can go nuts. Some things that are great staples irrespective of style are some quality black leggings, nice trainers, good tops or bras for support, a nice handbag, backpack, and a few nice coats.  You could flip through magazines or websites and save any photos of style that appeals to you or simply individual pieces you like. Look at people in the street and take notes of any insights you gain from that.  I was very into goth stuff for daily wear until I went to art school and didn't want to get nice clothes dirty so I ended up wearing sports/athleisure gear. Now that I have a working from home office job I'm just wearing athleisure)chill stuff too but when I go out I try to dress in my style, which I've accepted is boho/eclectic/a mix. I've stopped trying to find a style and I'll just wear individual things I like, so I end up with a lot going on at times (big coat, patterned leggings, coloured trainers, hippie jewellery, an army style cross body bag etc. That's just me. I'm happy to look a bit strange and not according to one style.  You'll get there :).	episode_done:True
text:I used to go to the Ralph Lauren store in the Biltmore Fashion Plaza in Phoenix back in the 90s and they had all sorts of things for sale.

text:To answer the justification question - cost per wear. My own NF is going on 12 years old now and still looks reasonably new, and I am not (and have not been) particularly kind with it either. I've tossed it around, dragged it on planes, beaches, through Asian wet markets etc. and it's still happily trucking along. The LV Canvas is notoriously hard-wearing.  Along the same line, quality of material used to construct the item. I currently also own leather bags from Everlane and Away. They're both well made, but you can tell the leather is substantially lower in quality, thickness and overall substance than say, my mother's Prada totes with leather that feels really thick and luxurious and plush. And with the Everlane bag, the unfinished suede interior is much rougher than the unfinished suede interiors of say, Celine bags and the leather is much, much thinner.  And while not all designer bags will age well, there is a reason Hermes bags can be handed down through generations but my Everlane bag will probably die before I do.     ETA: LV aside, the aftercare services are also generally pretty amazing. There are brands that will take your bag back and "spa" them for free or nominal fees. You don't get that kind of service with Madewell or Everlane.	labels:	episode_done:True

Oh, to have the confidence and life wisdom of a 24-year-old man.  There's nothing inherently wrong with sharing/asking for your partner's opinion about your style or wanting them to like how you dress, but it has to be something that you've both agreed you enjoy, not just one person offering unsolicited opinions. It also helps if they actually know what they're talking about.	episode_done:True
text:True. Habits can be hard to change though. I think some are more important to prioritize over others. These days I am more focused on health. But I should try slowing down since that aligns well with better health. Leaning into the table seems like maybe like a suboptimal solution that could lead to bad posture. But who knows...  I'm curious. You've never spilled anything on yourself?  So far I frankly just expect it to happen sometimes.  Most clothes and most of my shirts are fairly inexpensive. Even my sweaters.  But recently I did start to upgrade my wardrobe.. still, wouldn't be the end of the world to replace if even necessary.  But I was still curious what other people did & I am happy to read everyone's take	labels:>You've never spilled anything on yourself?  Of course I have, but not with any frequency that it's something I think about. If I had to venture a guess, I'd put it at maybe 3 times a year? I dunno, it just doesn't feel like it's something that takes a lot of work to improve.
text:Inspo Album: The Fun Coats Club	labels:I loooove coats, especially fun coats! I have a good few, from Boden, Ted Baker, Pendleton, Burberry Brit... but I have hardly worn any this season so far.

He talks about building a capsule wardrobe and drives home what basics you need, but I was not impressed with his demonstrations of styling a dress.

text:Not to mention the quality of the fabric used. I sew and consider myself an average sewist. If I take the time and have a good pattern and quality fabric I feel my clothes are pretty decent. Probably not equal to very high end, but because I can adjust fit very early in the process they can look better than fast fashion with fit issues.  That being said not everything I make turns out like I hoped it would. But I have several items of clothing that I have been wearing for years and I will wear until they wear out because they fit, are completely my style, and I love them.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:And yeah, no, I dress primarily for myself and then it's a distant second for pretty much anyone but hetero men.

text:What are your favourite ways to style a black leather moto jacket?	labels:People have already covered the dresses, but the dress/leather jacket combo is for sure one of my favorite ways to style them. If there's enough room in the sleeves/body, i sometimes layer a hoodie underneath during colder weather for a more skater girl type of look. I love wearing it with a white top, light wash jeans, and my black leather combat boots (for me, doc martens but could be any boot with a similar color/texture to the jacket) bc i feel like a rocker from the 80s.
text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:Short of getting a bit of insider info, I think the only way to really have success at those stores is to browse them at least once a week (probably twice).

text:Shitpost Saturday: Ghost Outfit	labels:Humiliation in life. Humiliation in death.  I've died wearing the too-large, white-but-actually-gray-at-this-point, ratty bathrobe given to me by my ex over a decade ago. I haven't had a haircut in almost 2 years and I'm not even wearing socks.   The worst part is that I spilled coffee on myself, so now I have a coffee stain on my chest for all of eternity.  I think it's safe to assume that I died from falling down the stairs or some shit after spilling coffee all over myself. I'm going to haunt the path outside my house because when the wind blows really hard, it actually howls down the path and it's spooky AF. I think I need all the help I can get, give the whole bathrobe situation. Though my coffee stain MIGHT pass for blood, so that's cool.  People aren't creative at all, so I'm probably going to get called something stupid like Bathrobe Witch. Or like, The Ghost of... Well I'm not actually going to put the name of the path because I don't want someone to find out where I live and make me actually dead.

I have a Chloe Lexa that I got for 50% off when it got discontinued and it‘s a great bag. I‘d never buy either brand at full price though.  I‘m trying not to get sucked into any nee handbag trends, I really want to shop my own closet this year. That said, I got a piece from the Loewe x Totoro capsule collection that I couldn‘t be more excited to wear this spring!   If I really had to pick, I‘d say that I‘m still eyeing a Loewe puzzle or a celine belt bag. I do like the Dior Bobby and the newly released Caro as well. Realistically though, I might add another everyday bag from Polène or Leo et Violette before I pull the trigger on any high end designer stuff. Price increases are getting crazy!	episode_done:True

My dad obviously bought this thing in the 70s, because it fits me and my dad has not been skinny since shortly after he got married lol. It sat around in my parent's closet till I was a teenager and it was trendy. It stayed at my parent's house when I graduated college and dumped stuff there while I moved to Germany and rejoined me when my parents got rid of their house. It has now followed me to our tiny house on the arctic circle because I figure an item of clothing that durable should stick around for what must be at least the third time it's been trendy! Along the way it even had afb elimination fight with a sad knockoff jean jacket from some mall brand that shrunk to half its size the first time it touched water in a washing machine 😆 it will definitely still be here, and probably still be in style, at the end of the world lol	episode_done:True

Anything worn when I'm around people gets washed after one wear. In the before days, pants would be worn twice before laundering, but not anymore.   Undergarments are washed after each wear.

text:Why Did Bottega Veneta Delete Its Social Media Accounts?	labels:I suspect this is a marketing ploy of some description - and it has certainly worked as I have seen this covered in multiple venues. It does start/re-start the conversation about the use and value of social media for brands.   As the owner of a small brand, our results over the last few years have been mixed. We haven’t committed a lot of resources to the various social channels but I’ve found they take up a disproportionate amount of time with frequently unmeasurable results. It’s easy to see these channels as ‘free marketing’ but they are anything but. It’s good to see bigger brands look more carefully at their returns here as the costs of doing things on social media has gone up considerably. And don’t start me on ‘influencers’!

Anyone else feel this way about patch pockets? Have you changed the pockets?

I don't think there is much difference between Forever 21 and J Crew, just the price. No one is going to advertise "buy less", "wash your stuff gently!" because...how do you make money doing that?

text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I've purchased several pieces of secondhand jewelry, both from physical thrift shops and one big mixed lot on Ebay. With the work from home/daily video calls life, where nobody sees me for more than an hour at a time and from the collarbone up, lasting until who knows when, I've had the desire to change up my jewelry from simple and delicate, with a lot of long necklaces, to something more colorful, bold, and closer to the face.  It's all cheap costume jewelry that I wouldn't buy new, but with the environmental impact already made it's a fun addition. Everything has been cool toned (green and blue) to go with the color palette I've been feeling lately. It doesn't need to be comfortable all day, just show up on camera until I take it off. Some of it even has visible wear that would be too much for wearing in public, but it doesn't show up on camera, so video calls are a perfect way to expand its usable lifespan.
text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:Decent homewear. Especially robes that aren't bathrobes nor these dainty fragile satin/chiffon thingies.

In loungewear there's apparently four types with no middle ground: For mothers-formerly-known-as-women,  for girls, for seduction purposes only, and Jeff Lebowski.

Just go there and if you feel uncomfortable you can always say you have to try them on in order to see whether it fits your husband/partner/boyfriend/etc.   I actually did this many times, including for my dad, bc I knew how it shd look on me in order to fit them (sleeve length, shoulders etc).  Staff shd not really care, I guess -?   Imho, trousers are a bit trickier but I have bought men's shorts and pants as well, you just have to check them out and see....

text:Deceptive Marketing Practices by Fashion Companies	labels:Speaking of deceptive marketing practices, I just got this email:   Notice of Class Action Settlement  If you purchased any Coach Outlet Merchandise discounted from a “MFSRP,” you may be eligible to receive a payment from a class action Settlement.  If you purchased any of Defendant Coach, Inc.’s (“Defendant” or “COACH”) outlet Merchandise[1] offered at a discount from a “MFSRP,” you may be eligible to receive a payment from a class action settlement (“Settlement”). The lawsuit against Defendant alleges that the “MFSRP” statements on the tags of the Merchandise offered at a discount from a “MFSRP” are misleading because they included the price of its retail goods, creating the false impression that its outlet store Merchandise was once sold in COACH’s full-line retail stores and was of the same quality and workmanship as merchandise sold in COACH’s full-line retail stores. Defendant denies any and all wrongdoing of any kind whatsoever and denies any liability to Plaintiffs and to the Settlement Class. The Court has not decided who is right. Both sides have agreed to settle the dispute and provide an opportunity for payments and other benefits to Settlement Class Members. The case is called Marino, et al v.

For example, if  Person A wanted to be perceived as confident, they would ask themselves if the article of clothing or whatever fit inside the "confident" bubble.  I found that idea to be useful. So the first step is choosing your keywords, and then considering them when you shop or dress yourself.

You're not obligated to buy even if you try it on. If anyone ask, just say you're just trying out and still thinking about it.             I suggest knowing your measurements (use a measuring tape!) and sticking to a capsule wardrobe. Black/White top + colorful bottom or colorful top + black/white/brown bottom with neutral shoes.       Keep in mind the stylish people on social media spend a ton on their clothes or rent/return them after taking photos so they are not exactly appropriate comparisons for everyone.	episode_done:True

text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:Layers layers layers. I live in Canada and our winters get nasty. Long skirts are a must if you want to wear one. Any exposed skin is dangerous and will immediately make you lose warmth very quickly. Wools are fantastic in the winter. They naturally wick away dampness and hold in heat even if wet. Silks are next because they are similar, but they don't breath as well or hold in warmth as well. Avoid cottons like the plague. If they get wet they will sap heat away from you and this can be fatal. I avoid polyester whenever possible unless maybe as a waterproof outer layer. Leathers are a great outerlayer that is generally water resistant.  If I am going to be outside for a length of time in a skirt I wear merino wool leggings from icebreaker if it's cold enough under the skirt. You can also wear another skirt under the first one, or a third, go nuts. Also add boots that make it to around the end of the skirt, or a pair of socks over the tights to extend the coverage. Don't forget your toes, fingers and head. You can bundle up as much as possible but if you forget those you basically undid everything. Your core is much warmer than your extremities.  Also, don't make the layers too tight. You keep warm so long as the air around your body is warm, so you need loose ish styles to seal in not just you, but warm air.  This being said. I would not recommend any serious bushwhacking in heavy skirts and deep snow.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:No other way besides just buying multiple sizes and trying them on. Find websites with good return policies like nordstrom and buy a few items to find your fit with the brand. Just make sure to buy things while they are still plenty in stock, or you risk buying something that doesn't fit, only to find out your actual size already sold out.  Part of the reason people are loyal to certain brands is because they become more familiar with their fits, and then you can buy online with more confidence, even with final sale items	episode_done:True
text:I’m not a tailor but I think there’s a way around it. Maybe it would cost to much to tailor but I think it could be done on jeans for example. kinda like how a tailor would cut jeans to be tighter but then instead of sewing it shut just put elastic behind it to pull it shut but when it opens just the denim shows... again idk what I’m really talking about but I feel like it could be fast ke to make pants go from like a 28 to maybe a 31/32	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What have I done?	labels:Here's the thing. You said a "trilby is a fedora."  Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a haberdasher who studies classy hats, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls trilbies fedoras. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying "fedora family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of fedorae, which includes things from porkpies to safari hats to cool indiana jones hats.  So your reasoning for calling a trilby a fedora is because random people "call the classy hats fedoras?" Let's get pith hats and tricorns in there, then, too.  Also, calling something a duster or trench coat? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A trilby is a trilby and a member of the fedora family. But that's not what you said. You said a trilby is a fedora, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the fedora family fedoras, which means you'd call porkpies, Safari hats, and other hats fedoras, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?	episode_done:True

text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:One thing you could do in search of your "real tastes" is to make a Pinterest board (or equivalent) of pictures you find beautiful and evocative - pictures that do NOT include clothing. If you think about style in terms of anything else - home decor, for instance - don't include that either. Think pictures of landscapes, animals, buildings, even abstract art. It sounds crazy but it really works - patterns will emerge. For instance, my board includes things like white billowy curtains, pink clouds, sea glass, foggy beach pictures. There's a general mood that I can't really describe or quantify through more defined "style groups" like goth, boho, romantic, etc. It's just what I find beautiful.   From there, find parallels to clothing. White billowy curtains -> white billowy blouses. Pink clouds -> pink fluffy sweaters. Sea glass -> sea glass jewelry! Foggy beach pictures -> muted colors, soft textures. If you are more artistic you might not even want to create clear-cut parallels but would prefer to think in "moods," whether a certain piece of clothing evokes the same mood as your board. That works too.  I get that how you want to be perceived is part of you too, but I still think it's useful to understand your more fundamental aesthetic preferences. Personally, I feel like after spending awhile in the world of style bloggers, youtubers, etc. it's easy to appreciate a huge variety of styles or to like certain things only because of exposure. It makes it hard to hone down what exactly you want from your own look. For ME, moving outside the world of clothing seems to do the trick.	episode_done:True
text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:Download a budgeting app so you can visualize what you're spending and get alerts if you're overspending in a certain category. Or if you want to put in more effort, make your own spreadsheet.   If you want to be hardcore, you could make a separate debit card that is ONLY for non-necessity expenses--and fill that every month with $XX   -----  Also, don't buy stuff for the future or imaginary events. When I was younger and just earning my own pocket cash, I'd buy fancy dresses that I literally had no occasion to wear, just because they looked good on me lol. They weren't expensive, but they were unnecessary expenses.    Buy stuff when you need it. Only exception being CRAZY good deals on stuff you will actually need.	episode_done:True

text:The joy of cordovan—and how to wear and maintain it	labels:Cordovan is an Instagram dream - it’s lustrous and has a ton of color depth. Unfortunately I find  actually wearing it is a different story. It’s extremely stiff and inflexible, especially during the first 20-30 wears. It’s the coldest leather I’ve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I’ve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I’m glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there’s no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.
text:Just how revolutionary is Harry Styles’ Vogue cover?	labels:Women look better in dresses.  You can be as progressive and woke as you want, and encourage whatever you want so people can express themselves, but aesthetics dont care about that stuff. Womens clothing is typically styled to cater to the female (sex) body. People always comment on the dress itself, or whether it works, but never how that same outfit would just look better on a female.  This is a matter of aesthetic and taste to some extent, and thinking that men generally look bad in dresses is a justified opinion.

text:> I would suggest looking into local producers  I want this to be the future of not just fashion but the whole global economy. So many places (at least in the US) have lost "local flavor" to global brands, and that minimizes the diversity of options, competition, innovation, and perspectives in fashion and every industry. We need to move towards a better balance of local and global production and identify ways we can strengthen small businesses and enable them to compete and (re)establish a local culture.	labels:Yeah, i agree completely. Its difficult to actually do often (i live in reasonably northern Canada, like not North but we do not have a winter growing season of any appreciable value) so if i don't want to like get scurvy in the winter I won't be buying local.   But listening to first nations peoples and incorporating traditional health knowledge would be a way to solve this issue - is that going to happen on a large scale, probably not. Also cedar tea does not taste very good imo. But anyways.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 20, 2021	labels:My partner is now officially my spouse. I now wear a ring which will look good with my fits, but feels really weird being just ... there on my hand, all the time now.  They vetoed me posting pictures (we have public facing jobs, these pictures are all over social media, too easy to reverse image search etc.), but they wore a Rick Owens dress (that I picked out) while I went full minimalism with a collarless shirt with onyx studs, a sleek blazer and cropped trousers. I put this together from my existing wardrobe, since we didn't want to spend a lot. Covid measures made things a bit weird, but the court officer made a real effort into making it nice, which was great. (edit: just so nobody thinks we are totally irresponsible: it was literally just us at city hall, no guests, no party. We'll catch up with that after vaccination.)  It was fun seeing all y'all Americans count down to my wedding day.

text:Why It's Important to have a Style POV & Desired Aesthetic	labels:I really agree with this post. As I've gotten more into fashion I really have begun focusing on intention of a fit. Using jeans as an example you can wear jncos to slp skinnies and all can "fit" depending on the aesthetic you are going for. deciding that aesthetic and discovering clothes that fit within it is the most fun part of fashion for me.   I think it's worth talking about how you do this when your POV/aesthetic isn't so cut and dry as vintage menswear or repro workwear as well. That's where I  struggle. It's easy to copy/mimic things but mixing influences to create your own style is a difficult process because of the trial and error required.
text:They're either incapable of understanding the basics of doing laundry that even a teenager can manage or they're lying, girl.   Any excuse to distance themselves from the poors and justify overpriced clothes because paying over $100 on a shirt means it's "better quality" than the $20 all the poors can afford. It's not.  They're just treating their cheap clothes like shit because they're cheap. The name brand stuff gets handwashed with angel tears by virgins with long hair in sundresses. Then they're surprised pikachu when the H&M sweater pills and the Sezane one does not.   Or even better, the h&m sweater is *obviously* shit because it pilled, but when your sweater is $300, pilling is suddenly "inevitable" and just use an electric shaver.	labels:Someone asked how to avoid sweaters disintegrating in the wash, so i asked what they meant, and they meant literally just pilling.

So hypothetically you spend 4 days a week in a business casual office. Workout 3 days a week. Go on a hike each weekend. And go clubbing 1x a week. And bar hopping 3x a week.   Then think about some outfits you like or style aspirations for each occasion. Then you can start to see what pieces might work and where you have some overlap.	episode_done:True

A WoC (any brand) worn underneath a coat is just so cool to me and I love how carefree it is.  I also have a few Mulberry bags and two Chloes and while I love them, I wouldn’t pay full price for them. Chloe especially I find to be great value for money if you can find sth you like on sale. I got both of my bags 50% off.   I  like Polène which is a lesser known brand. If you are looking to spend up to €500 for a bag, consider Polène, Leo et Violette or Strathberry.

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I WFH permanently now, but when I worked in an office I wasn't able to escape dry-clean-only clothing; there are some things that just need to be dry cleaned. However, I used Dryel to great effect (awesome for things that aren't stained or stinky and don't really need to be pressed). I will also say, many many clothing items that say "dry clean only" can be washed either by hand, or in the machine on a delicate setting with wool wash or other gentle low-suds detergent. (My dry cleaner, of all people, actually advised me to start washing my cashmere sweaters rather than bringing them in for cleaning - she said dry cleaning dries out and breaks down the fibers and washing them at home would help them last longer. I am still wearing my cashmere sweaters and so far, she's been correct.) If something is very structured or has an acetate lining I never try to wash it, but I have washed other things that were poly blends or wool blends and were marked "dry clean only," and as long as you hang them up to dry, it works fine.
text:What niche do you feel is missing from the fashion blogging/YouTube world?	labels:Middle-aged professional people who want to look put-together and stylish but not necessarily FASHION, especially budget-wise.

I've been knitting for a year, but crocheting and sewing for a decade. Slow fashion is such a rabbit hole because before you know it you're trying to talk yourself out of learning to spin, cause maybe when you buy a house you could get a sheep? Maybe some angora rabbits?! But it's such a cool interest. As a young person I'm really happy that it's becoming a mainstream thing!  It gives me hope.	labels:Yep...very accurate.  I have successfully not purchased yarn for myself for 458 days now (not like I'm counting), so I might be able to reduce the stash a bit. But more than likely I'll cave here in the next six months while I still have 40k yards to work through.   The rabbit hole of slow, self-made fashion goes deep.

text:What work for my boyfriends taste and body type?	labels:My husband has a very similar body type. When he got a new job recently in a larger city after working from home for years we basically went out and got him a whole new but fairly minimal wardrobe that’s worked out really well for him.  We picked out a color palette for him which is mostly blues/navy, gray and olive green. He had a couple of basic button downs like a plain white and a crosshatch pattern in various shades of blue. We picked him up a few more button downs in various classic colors like white, light blue, white with a simple pattern of any of those colors. We also got him a couple of more casual button downs, either because of fabric or a louder pattern for fridays or casual wear. J Crew button downs ended up fitting him well. I agree with other recommendations for slim fit jeans and chinos; we replaced his light wash Levi’s 501s with dark wash slim fit Levi’s 511s and those look great. Banana Republic’s traveler pants are also a favorite for him, fit and good stretch but look sharp.   For outer wear we got a couple of basics: a grey fleece vest like from Patagonia for the “midtown uniform” look; it’s more comfortable than wearing a blazer but still looks more formal than a button down on its own. I also got him a quarter zip navy merino wool sweater to layer over his dress shirts on colder days. More casually he has a lined flannel “coat” that he wears over a basic white tee, a more tech jacket, and formally I found him a basic black wool overcoat for work.   For shoes we got him one pair of nice oxfords, one pair of oxford looking tennis shoes from Cole Haan, a pair of off-white leather shoes as his dressier items.   He also has hiking pants and brown hiking shoes that he wears as casual clothing with sweatshirt tees or flannel.	episode_done:True
text:Your 2021 trend predictions?	labels:I think we'll see an adjustment on the enormous puffy sleeves and ruffles, and a trend towards fitted long-line pieces - still historically inspired but with more of an emphasis on ornamentation than on silhouette. Nods to the roaring 20s: gems, jewels, metallics continuing to be prominent; dramatic makeup; heels making a resurgence.
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I also live in Louisiana. You definitely want to have a pair of rain boots or waterproof shoes because of how much it rains in the spring and summer evenings. I have a pair of cute Chelsea boot style rain boots that are a lot easier to style. Also, get a pair of good quality sandals that are comfortable, I prefer Birkenstock’s.   I strictly wear shorts or mini skirts in the spring, summer, and most of fall, then jeans or leggings/joggers in the winter. I have denim shorts, chino shorts, and some cute dressy shorts, depending on the occasion.   I don’t really like dresses because it’s hard to find summer dresses that aren’t sleeveless, and I just prefer to have some kind of sleeve.   I personally would get too hot wearing a sweater in the spring/summer, and I am very cold natured, but I keep a lightweight jacket in my car in case I go somewhere and the AC is really cold. I am not really big on tank tops, so I just wear a lot of short sleeve tops. I don’t even rotate my tops because I will usually just wear the short sleeved ones under a jacket in the winter, and I only have like 3 sweaters anyway.   Also not big on hats, personally, and the only time I see other people wearing them are for photo shoots or going to the beach. However, I do recommend some nice sunglasses.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 18, 2020	labels:I recently bought several items for my bf from American Giant. I have to say, I am very disappointed. Not only were all the sweatpants out of stock in sizes under XL, their customer service is awful. I expected delays because of COVID and the holiday season, but I placed my order on Dec 7 and it still hadn't even been processed (packed up), yet alone sent. I have sent 3 emails, none of which have gotten a response. They also took their phone number off their website (but I found it on google). Additionally, they automatically imposed a 40USD customs fee on my order (I live outside the US), even though the order was under the customs limit (150USD).   I am so annoyed with the lack of communication and the huge delays even though their website promised delivery by Christmas. I almost feel like cancelling my order.

text:A peacoat is a specific type of wool coat. It is derived from the military pea coat and will be double-breasted, if navy or charcoal wool (usually thick wool-nylon or pure wool), be thigh length,  tonal buttons, slightly curved collar iirc.   A duffle cost I can’t remember the specifics but I think has a good and toggle buttons? Could be wrong.  A trench is a raincoat, generally cotton or at least not wool, usually tan, doubtle breasted, belted, mid thigh or knee length.  Top coat and overcoat are generally pretty interchangeable iirc longer wool coats , single breasted, wool. A lot of variety under those terms but usually a top coat is intended to be worn over a suit iirc.   Different manufacturers will use a lot of these terms interchangeably which can be confusing.	labels:The difference between a top coat and an overcoat is actually in the weight of the fabric; overcoats area heavier. Both are to be worn over tailoring.
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I moved from a place which has four seasons but it often grey and overcast to a place just a little north of the tropics with a lot of heat and sun. I still favour similar shapes but now in much lighter fabrics. The biggest difference has been the amount of colour in my wardrobe. I’ve gone from a mainly navy and blacks colour palette to wearing such a variety.

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:I would find a shape you think works for you and try different textures! A black jean is really different from black leather, which is really different from black velvet.

I've always been told my magazine and fashion outlets that dressing for my bodytype (atheletic boyish rectangle no stomach hips or boobs lol) that I needed to focus on creating the illusion of having curves and wear aline or circle skirts and frilly tops that put emphasis on my boobs. It works and I feel good, but when I take it off I start to feel like a fraud. Like I'm selling a body or image that isn't me and feel bad about it. I know its all about self love but I want to start dressing for MY body and feeling good not dressing to create a body I don't have
text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:I’m in Toronto, Canada.  By January, no one is wearing cute outfits anymore... it’s all goose-down water resistant parkas, balaclavas, Uniqlo heattech long-johns under thick jeans and heavy boots.  But before it gets to those super extreme sad months, I like wearing a short fitted puffer jacket with a winter down miniskirt over leggings and doc martens.  The short jacket makes me feel like I still have a shape and the down miniskirt keeps my bum warm and looks cute.

text:What are you wearing for Halloween this year?	labels:I won't be going out. I'm so fucking sad. Halloween is my absolute favorite, and it was going to be an epic party this year.  However! I'm still going to dress up because I want to. I have recently acquired a comically oversized witch hat, so I'll be building a costume around that. I shall be the most fabulous witch while watching not-so-scary movies, eating candy, and getting properly sloshed.

text:Do you have any pieces that "should not" work with your body that just seems to work?	labels:Honestly I find that I might not like the style of something once, but I need to try it on again maybe a few months or years later. Peasant tops are a good example, the cut popular a few years ago DID NOT look good on me. But now a bunch have sweetheart necks and they're pretty damn cute.  In other words, there is no "should not", just "should" and "maybe I don't feel most comfortable or my best in this".	episode_done:True

text:Wish we could just ban people for this shit  Any conversation around "you have to be attractive/tall/skinny to pull this off", when taken to its logical conclusion, is just people saying that people that don't fit Western beauty standards look objectively bad *at all times* regardless of what they're wearing or doing  Like I've seen people say that if you're short or if you're overweight you can't wear "x", but the "x" is basically everything, and they never seem to reach the point where they admit that they just think that the best certain people can hope for is inoffensive or unnoticeable, which disgusts me	labels:And when there is a good reason, there is normally a way to word it to cover more, e.g. don't wear slim fit shirts if you have a beer belly > make sure your shirt isn't too slim around the waist so that you can comfortably sit down
text:What’s on everyone’s Black Friday wishlists?	labels:It's mostly shoes and bags for me this year—and mostly secondhand. This season's trends have been too utilitarian for my tastes.  I've already bought a few sale things from & Other Stories (a black velvet bag with gold beading, and a cream blouse with a pointy collar and a million little buttons), and a long-coveted Little Liffner bag in sky blue (from TheRealReal).  Here's my current wishlist, though:  * a pink alpaca sweater in a delicate knit * black knee-high leather boots with a low block heel (and ideally a square-ish toe) * a little cropped boucle or tweed jacket, but with a collar (so hard to find!) * a small, cherry red leather shoulder bag to replace a worn-out one * black sheer tights of decent quality * classic, minimal sneakers: one pair in red leather, another in black leather with white soles * inexplicably, a black pillbox hat (I have never worn hats but am suddenly feeling an urge)	episode_done:True

text:Fall/winter shoe trends: what's your dream wishlist?	labels:I bought a new pair of Docs in the sale I bought the black Vaux mid boots.

Not sure what. Options seem a bit limited,  everything that makes me want to buy it has a big heel and so will never be worn. Maybe I'll buy a something in plain leather and paint it?	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys who like a formal/business look manage to not look the same all the time?	labels:Is this an pressure that is coming internally from you being bored or more externally from perceived social pressure or media pressure around you? It sounds like you know what you like and that you’ve already come up with outfits you love but feel pressure to be “new”. Reading about capsule wardrobes and minimalism may give you more justifications for repeating outfits that you love. If you are bored with your look, you could also try changing up your hair, make up, accessories and keep the outfits that make you feel powerful.

I wear skinny clothes always. I wear beat up Vans and cut off jean shorts at home. I just can’t do fabric shorts.	labels:Have you tried baggies from Patagonia?	episode_done:True
text:What fashion trend/s have you been obsessed with lately?	labels:Wow!! I thought it was just me that was suddenly like “corduroy and dark academia... gimme!!!” I was back at work for a short few months before getting put on WFH again, so the pieces I was rocking were high waisted mom jeans, lots of mustards and oranges, and my fav addition are these plaid paperboy type pants... they’re brown plaid and paired with a black turtleneck, it screams witchy professor	episode_done:True
text:Matching shoes & purse	labels:I don’t think fashion has any rules anymore unless you’re royalty or it’s cultural.   I personally don’t like matchy matchy bag and shoes unless I’m going for a monochrome look. I tend to match tones rather than colours. I like a patterned bag (say Gucci dionysus or Fendi zucca or LV canvas) as opposed to patterned clothes because I find they blend in well with a variety of outfit choices.   If I do colour, I will make sure the tone matches. I can’t stand mixing warm times with cool tones. Eg I have a cool tone lilac paid of heels that I love wearing with my cool tone magenta bag.   You can also do opposite sides of the colour wheel with shoes and bags like a green bag and a purple/magenta pair of shoes. But again keep to the same tones. The key with fashion is the tone of colours, and that includes neutral colours too. I would always suggest everyone does a colour/tone analysis and then stick to buying items in that range. It makes mixing and matching easier.

I live in Southern California, home to the entertainment business and some of the best clothing shops in the country, but the hierarchy of fashion and money isn’t linear. There’s some old school law firms where everyone wears suits, and   studio executives often wears suits, but bottom-rung business-side entertainment folks (eg, low level agency people making $40,000 a year) *have to wear suits* too. At the same time, actors, tech people, and high ranking people in the business get to dress casually - casual dress is becoming a mark of success.	episode_done:True

text:How do you tell when discounted items were never full price?	labels:Sign up to their mailing list and see how often they do discounts.

Worst offenders are usually fast fashion sites (missguided, boohoo, pretty little thing, etc), but it can be other websites as well.	episode_done:True

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:To put it bluntly, 100% privilege plays a role in the way people dress because there is increased access to options (including natural fibres, so called “sustainable” clothing, tailoring, etc) that are completely inaccessible for the majority of others.
text:What is the upscale version of Fashion Nova / SHEIN / boohoo / Nasty Gal? i.e. trendy + youth-oriented but not trash quality	labels:Clothes from brands like the ones you mentioned are mostly targeted at 15-29 year olds and generally people in those age brackets don't have a ton of money, so I don't know if high quality sexy Insta-baddie clubbing stuff would even have a market. Maybe someone else knows.  The only premium brands I can think of that sort of overlaps the same demographic (but not necessarily the aesthetic) are AllSaints, Alexachung and maybe Acne Studios.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:You can get a suit jacket or blazer tailored. It’s so important to make sure the shoulders hit right where they’re supposed to, and that any buttons on the front can be properly buttoned. A suit jacket that doesn’t fit properly looks unprofessional. Sleeves can definitely be shortened if required.	episode_done:True
text:I can absolutely understand this. I am an aspie and I buy things because they look beautiful, often not even using it, just because I have the inner urge to take it with me because it is beautiful and I also think others maybe think it's beautiful and so they maybe like and accept me more. My wardrobe is crazy as well, like elegant, boho, goth, japanese fashion, girly stuff lol But it's so destructive to buy so much stuff. I found out I'm trying to fill the void in my soul with it and am only impulse buying when I either found a new special interest (at least a bit understandable) or when feeling lonely, depressive and not motivated for any hobbies. I decided to go to therapy now to better myself and the financial situation.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:I have a few what I would consider to be housedresses in this definition. They are simple in shape - two pieces of fabric, sleeveless, usually no dart, no waist, hemmed - lengths ranging from above the knee to down to the ankle. I've certainly worn them to work and otherwise in public, so they're not just "house" dresses. They're comfortable in the summer in non-A/C environments, like my home office, or the previous place I worked (also no A/C). You can throw on a little sweater for A/C environments, or where sleeveless is not 100% appropriate.  I'm wearing one right now.   I have never bought one new - they're always purchased at thrift stores. Since the sizing is pretty free with these, I may not even bother to try them on. Used, I'd say that they range in price from ten dollars on down.	episode_done:True

So, they push you to a level wherein you have to do the exploitation in order to survive," he said. >  > The owner, who used to supply a major UK brand not mentioned in this story, described some factory audit processes as a "sham". >  > "The factory is aware when the auditors are coming, so they keep everything in perfect condition before," he said. "The moment the audit is over, everything goes back to normal, which means exploitation and non compliance." >  > He said that poor checks and balances, combined with a lack of responsibility by the brands, makes it hard to stamp out that exploitation. >  > **"It is the way of working in the textile industry, it's just not India, it's everywhere."**

Time to be a big boy and learn to go for a few expensive pieces instead of a ton of cheap ones.   Wish me luck lads.
text:How to wear nice casual clothes with a cotton allergy?	labels:Have you tried looking for clothing made out of hemp or linen? You can find casual tshirts and whatnot that are 100% hemp fabric. You can also find causal shoes that are hemp (i have an older pair of Adidas that are 100% hemp fabric uppers). Plenty made out of leather as well.  Do you have a budget for clothes? A lot of companies that use these alternative materials are considered "premium" brands and carry their price tags accordingly.

text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:Im Op I’ll share mine-  Personally I sort of plan my makeup look based of what I’m wearing   I do mostly dramatic Smokey eyes and cut crease looks with bright blush and lipstick everywhere in colors that either match my outfit or just compliment it well! I also do more eye liner dramatic looks at times as well! Usually if I’m wearing something a bit more cutesy I’ll do my makeup to reflect the look. If Im wearing my black velvet blazer set I’ll do thé likes of and orange and gold Smokey eye to make it more bold and less professional looking! I have a very dressy style with masculine, Victorian, and highly detailed elements so bold colorful makeup makes some of my more stuffy looks less boring. I’ve lately been after doing my foundation putting a bit of blush from the bottom front of my eye bags to the top of my brow bone. I love how it makes makeup a little more unique and makes me look a little less baby faced.  I used to wear very skater boyish/ art kid outfits and hair ( I still respect the style still though ) but wore heavy Instagram glam style makeup. I still do glam makeup but it looked quite odd at times! I didn’t really think much about makeup in relation to clothing then, not that it’s really necessary! I feel I’ve come far with my style!
text:I’d probably do   - unstructured sport coat with pattern or texture in something like dark burgundy or deeper green as an alternative to blue - shirt, pick what color you want - wool pants with some more texture or pattern, eg. a chalk stripe flannel or something. I think a medium gray would be the move here and would pair well with just about any jacket.  - tie and pocket square optional, I probably wouldn’t as it could come across as stuffy. Could do a square with no tie. - shoes id keep *slightly* more casual; maybe a chelsea boot or a penny loafer or something. You’re a creative director so show some creativity.  If you want some inspiration look at stuff like Drake’s, Boglioli, or Eleventy.  It would not hurt to bring two jackets, or if you decide to wear a tie, two ties, to the shoot in case one photographs drastically better.   Look a little creative but don’t add a bunch of accessories so it doesn’t look like you’re trying too hard.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:I have moved to different climates many times. My recommendation would to not purge or change anything until your move is complete. The reason is, you definitely get climatized, where what would consider "warm" in the winter to you now will feel chilly enough to wear heavyweight items you hadn't expected would work once you are climatized. A lot of items that you think will/won't work end up being the opposite, etc. You mentioned having less storage, so it sounds like you will need to offload/purge at some point, but I'd wait to do it once you get there and put it off for as long as you can to truly see what items work. I'll never move to a cold climate again but even moving to different warmer climates, I will wait to do any paring down/purging until I can get a little climatized and adapt.
text:General Discussion - December 19, 2020	labels:So I know this has been a problem since the dawn of online multiplayer, but it really bums me out how disrespectful people are in these online competitive games. I was in a situation where our team had won the match but because I wasn't playing \*as\* optimally as a few of my teammates would have liked, they all started trash talking me over voice comms after the match was over. It's such a bummer because it turns me off from wanting to play, even if I enjoy the game itself.  /end nerd rant
text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:It depends on the item. Underwear, socks, and face masks get washed after every wear. Jeans get washed about 3 times a year. Wool gets washed once it starts to smell funky. If I don’t really sweat, shirts and blouses get washed every 2-4 wears. So I do a load of laundry whenever I have enough things dirty to do at least half a load. This is usually every 2 weeks for me.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 15, 2021	labels:A question about cotton/modal blend undershirts:  I used to buy the **Hanes** Comfort Fit Ultra Soft Cotton/Modal undershirts, and they were OK.  A little while ago, I picked up a few **Goodfellow** brand cotton/modal/spandex blend undershirts from Target on a whim, and they were much better than the ones from Hanes. Softer feel, but still thick enough to wear around the house, and longer than the Hanes shirts so they stay tucked in better. My only complaint was that the V-neck wasn't very deep, so it would often show when I left the top button of my shirt unbuttoned. I can't really wear them with casual and camp collar shirts.  Recently I haven't been able to find the Goodfellow modal-blend undershirts at Target (only 100% cotton), but I'm reluctant to go back to the Hanes ones now that I've tasted this luxury.  I've looked at the **David Archy** modal undershirts, because I have some of their boxer briefs and find them very comfortable, but they are a 92% Modal, 8% Spandex blend and the reviews suggest they leave nothing to the imagination.  I'm also looking the **Uniqlo** "Dry" V-neck short-sleeve shirts. However I already have two Uniqlo "Airism" undershirts, and they are so thin they are nearly sheer. I don't really feel comfortable wearing them without another layer.  Are there any other cotton/modal (or similar) blend shirts that you'd recommend? My personal preferences are:  * Ideally less than $10 each * Soft and moisture-wicking fabric, not 100% cotton * V-neck deep enough to leave one button open without the undershirt being visible * Not too thin and revealing  Thanks!	episode_done:True

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:Go through your wardrobe minimum once a year. It helps me to have a 4 tier system.  A - Cothes I like, wear, and fit me well. I have worn them recently and would wear them recently again. These are my go to.  B - Clothes I like but might not fit perfectly but still wear. These are out of rotation but just don't get worn as often. Could also be sort of like a specific situation sweater, these I would hate to lose.  C - clothes I want to sit on to give another chance. If I don't end up wearing it in a season/year/whatever period it will get donated  D - For donate/sell. Don't wear or don't fit. No use in taking up space for something I don't like or may have not held up so well. If you can get money back great but I also say have a time limit. You don't want to hold onto it because it doesn't sell.  I also kind of have a category for gifts/memorable occasion clothing. And that just helps me know, hey I am visiting a friend who got me a shirt let me wear the thing they got me. Might not be my style but I do try to hold onto these for a least a little while.	episode_done:True

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:I have moved to different climates many times. My recommendation would to not purge or change anything until your move is complete. The reason is, you definitely get climatized, where what would consider "warm" in the winter to you now will feel chilly enough to wear heavyweight items you hadn't expected would work once you are climatized. A lot of items that you think will/won't work end up being the opposite, etc. You mentioned having less storage, so it sounds like you will need to offload/purge at some point, but I'd wait to do it once you get there and put it off for as long as you can to truly see what items work. I'll never move to a cold climate again but even moving to different warmer climates, I will wait to do any paring down/purging until I can get a little climatized and adapt.

text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:You Need A Budget. No, really - it's the best money-management app/process I've found. I signed up when I realized that I had promise to pay for a family Italian cruise because I had my first well-paying job - But I didn't seem to be getting ahead even though I was making twice as much as I had before. Zero-based budgeting in general is the way to go but I love YNAB for making that system easy to manage.  The thing that works for me about zero-based is that I can really easily prioritize the things that are important to me and also see the trade-off I'm making for every purchase if I change those priorities. It keeps those little windfalls or pay raises from just vanishing into the ether. I got paid $64 last week for a poshmark sale, and I immediately put that money in my March rent category. Before, I would have gone and bought a new shirt, or spent it all on soup dumplings, or bought a new shirt and then spilled the soup dumplings I also bought on the new shirt. 😅  If fashion is important to you, then you can prioritize that and invest in a wardrobe that will give you joy. If it's travel, put your money toward that instead, and you'll feel the power to walk away from a good sale because you know it's just a distraction from your real goals. I still spend a lot on clothes and eating out, but I no longer feel guilty or stressed about it, because when I spend it's a conscious choice.  I guess this is more general financial advice than specific to OP's situation, but I find it useful for any of us who have expensive hobbies (aka all of mine) or potential big expenses like OP's.	episode_done:True

I also wrote out which physical attributes I want to highlight (and which ones I didn't), as well as listed wardrobe things I wanted and outlined a shopping strategy.  I told a friend about this, and now she's adopted it for herself! I feel like it's a great way to analyze what you want your style to be for yourself.	episode_done:True
text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:I can’t stand faux leather. Not for shoes, bags, clothes; anything. Plastic can start to degrade after some time (6-10 years). I had some faux leather hiking boots that turned to mush just sitting in their box in my closet. The handles on faux leather purses start to peel and the bottoms wear very fast. They simply do not hold up like leather.  I have vintage Dooney&Bourke leather bags that are 25+ years old. I keep them polished, clean and in dust bags when not in use and they look new.  If you can afford a genuine leather bag, even secondhand, it is the best choice imo.

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:Go on Pinterest and pin things that catch your eye. Once you have a board try and find similarities between the pins (for example ruffles, silk, strappy backs etc) and start searching up those things at stores that are within your price range.  In terms of comfort, look for materials you like and what silhouettes you’re into. If you tend to do tighter tops with more volume at the bottom then look for dresses that match that for example. If you know you like cotton blends look for those.    Also look for stores that carry petite sections or find a tailor in your area  Don’t go crazy trying to push yourself too far out of your comfort zone. Look for things that are your style but that you’ve never worn before.

I am right now quite into the Kibbe body type system, so it's helpful to understand that someone with my size and even same waist/bust can have a completely body structure (for example I am frame dominant and am visually wider and my bones are blunt, while someone else may be flesh dominant and have a very rounded frame, or might have quite sharp long bones, or a juxtaposition of both). This can make the same item of clothing look so different on two people.	episode_done:True

text:As I wait to hear if I have to evacuate due to CA wildfires, here’s a hypothetical I had to do: you have time to prepare before your evacuation and pack up your car. What clothes do you bring and why?	labels:I would take my Starter 49ers jacket that my late grandma bought from Candlestick Park in the 80s first. That is irreplaceable and even though I only wear it to special football games I would cry over that jacket more than any other item. Her brown faux fur coat would be next. My "sentimental/valuable" jewelry collection (I'd pawn it if I had to), my black gypsy skirt that looks like moths have eaten the bottom from it snagging on things (it's survived me for 10 years, I ain't giving up on her yet), my made-in-Ireland hand-knit emerald green wool sweater, this ridiculously comfortable yet loud romper that I'm conveniently already wearing, my purple shawl, my lucky Lucky jeans, my space boot Doc Martens and my snow leopard Spirit Hood.  It's a weird list that doesn't seem to go together, but that's what comes to mind first. I've kept these items for years despite all my style changes and wardrobe rehauls. I could (and probably will) replace everything else eventually.  I hope you and your house stays safe - I'm in Cali too, gratefully far enough to not worry about having to evacuate but close enough to watch the ash falling like snow.

That said have a real sailor story to tell about what (recreational) sailors actually wear. Friend in university was really into fashion - was actually an intern at Vogue. Found a photo book on the Kennedy’s and thought Jackie looked pretty chic on the boat so she talked our friend group into renting a boat for the afternoon. Three of us knew how to sail - she did not. The thing to remember about sailing is it’s dirty (especially rental boats) and boats kill clothes (chafe, catching on sharp bits. We all show up in grubby clothes. She shows up dressed to the nines. We make her go back and change - really unhappy about it. She came back slightly less dressed up. Ok. Spent the rest of the afternoon dodging grunge trying to look elegant on the deck of one of the most beat up Sonars (22 foot day sailor) I’ve ever seen. That said a good time was had by all.  TL;DR story about a friend learning that unless make serious bank sailing of any kind is not nearly as elegant as pop culture would have you think.	episode_done:True

text:What is your favorite clothing/accessories subscription box?	labels:I got free Stitchfix credit from a friend, so I've used Stitchfix a couple of times. (disclaimer: I haven't tried anything else). I was very specific about my body type in the profile section, and after the first box I was very specific to the stylist about what types of clothes I wanted to try and what I didn't like. There's also a small extra info box on your profile where you can mention specifics, e.g. looking for more business casual pieces, would never wear X things, live in a warm climate, etc.      I think styling services like Stitchfix work best when you know yourself well— for example, I'm petite, proportionally really short legs, and I know what doesn't work for me (animal prints, dots, shift dresses, low heels). I specifically noted items that I felt like had a low chance of success in terms of fit (e.g. jeans, blazers) and casual items (not worth the $$) as items that I did not want to receive.     The more specific you can be, the better a box you'll get. This does mean that you're less likely to need the help of a stylist to find pieces for you, but it can be fun to try on things you wouldn't have picked up on your own.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:I think that an under-discussed part of picking out a first suit for these types of things is getting out and trying them on before you buy. Being comfortable in a suit, even if it’s cheaper or in a less fashionable cut, is more important in interview settings than the eye to detail and quality that we normally discuss on here. A suit that fits in the shoulders, in a neutral color like navy or charcoal, that you know fits because you were able to try it on is way more important to your success than ordering something online that might be objectively better. Interviewers are looking for you to meet their minimum standard of professionalism, not for you to wow with with sartorial taste. Source: had a lot of interviews in college and law school.

text:FAQ: What are the different use cases of boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes, and loafers?	labels:For me, the simplest distintiction would look at it in terms of the casual vs. formal.  Obvious with the name, boat shoes and driving shoes were originally designed for people who wanted stability/comfort when operating a boat or vehicle. But nowadays, boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes are all meant for casual outfits when you don't want to wear sneakers. They can be worn with tees and jeans, casual button downs, chinos etc for just a regular night out or weekend errands.  Loafers on the other hand, have a large variety (ie. penny loafers, horsebit loafers, chunky lug sole loafers that are trendy right now, unlined Belgian loafers, etc) that they can go from casual to formal. I would even argue that velvet slippers that people match with tuxedos would fall into the loafers category too. The popular look this summer had been pairing Weejun loafers with Patagonia baggies for a more casual look but the loafers on the higher-end price points (Gucci loafers, John Lobb, Baudoin and Lange, etc) can easily be paired with suits and tuxedos.
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:To add onto the rest of the great advice in this thread, following the color trends can be helpful in seeing how color looks on others and how you can apply them to yourself. I follow some accounts that specifically photograph folks during fashion week in various locales, and there's so much vibrancy that occurs there with colors that you might not expect to fit together. It helps to have these (kind of) practical examples in mind before you go on blowing money on colorful goods.  I've never actually done a color analysis, personally, but intuitively over time you will get a sense for what flatters you. You can even try holding random household items like Clorox wipes (lol) or notebooks up to your face or skin to see if that color would work as an actual item on you, preferably in good natural lighting where it won't distort the tones so much. I also like to accessorize with one small bright thing at a time, like bags, belts, scarves, or jewelry. Another way to do this is with wearing nail polish, either different colors on your nails all at once or specific parts of a palette to see if that combination is flattering with your skin tone.	episode_done:True

text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:My Mum saved some of her clothing for me. I really cherish the pieces she gave me. My favourite is a black velvet dress she wore a lot in her mid twenties. She also saved some of my nicest baby clothes, so I could use them with my future daughters.  Almost all the items that she saved were high quality velvet, lace and silk. They also were in solid colors.   In most instances it was items she didn't fit in anymore but had an emotional attachment to, so they stayed in the back of her closet until I hit my late teens. She made most of the items, a couple were purchased, and some were made for her. Since she has a talent for sewing and repair, all the items were kept in top condition. She didn't give me all the pieces at once. She would offer to lend me a dress for an event, and I'd try it on. Then she would tell me the story behind it, and say it was mine if I wanted it.   I have wool coats and leather jackets that I'm using currently, but will put away for future generations when they don't fit anymore or I change up my style. After an unfortunate pen in the laundry mishap I've also considered purchasing doubles of items I really enjoy. If something happens I'll have a spare. If nothing does I'll have a vintage-with-tags gift for future children ☺️ purchasing items specifically for future generations seems a bit high pressure though..  My Mum also saved shoes and boots for me but our shoe size is different so that didn't work out unfortunately.   My husband (at 30yo) is saving some clothes he felt he had grown out of for any future sons we may have. It's stored in the attic.   Solid pieces in quality materials that are cared for and stored properly are likely to be received well. I'm thankful my Mum saved her best clothing over the years for me. Obviously saving every ragged Walmart t shirt is going to become a case of hoarding like other posters mentioned. But if it's a reasonable amount of high quality pieces and you have storage space then why not? It's family heirlooms and history.	episode_done:True

I'm not sure if they have molded around my body, or if my body has grown around them. I will always smile when putting these on, as so much life has been lived in them. I plan on keeping them in good repair until it is literally impossible.  I also smile since I noticed my grandpa got one of the same pattern around the time I did.  I thought that was cool. He's no longer around, but I'm reminded in a wholesome way whenever I wear my shirt	episode_done:True

However, I find I really need to take a break from reddit/social media especially just prior to the holidays as it's far too easy to come across a story or comment that just destroys my mood. I'd rather be present for my family.  Hope you all are able to enjoy the holidays in your own way, that you stay safe and healthy, and that we all have a much better 2021!  Best,  Met
text:People should watch old seasons of the bachelor if they don’t believe this. Professionally styled TV glosses over or tones down some of the trends you forgot about. The ladies of reality TV, on the other hand, really deliver.	labels:I think Jersey Shore is the prime example of this. I just watched a couple episodes and boy, has the fashion changed. Even a basic black tank top looked completely different than today.
text:Ever been censored at work because of what you wear?	labels:Was previously told my trousers had too many buckles. I was a temp.

Fuck that place and that HR lady in particular.
text:Yeah - I wouldn't skimp on denim and footwear. A nice pair of boots that will last years and grow patina, same with denim fades. You can skimp a bit on the rest -    for example today I'm wearing: $300 Samurai Jeans, $x00 boots, $x00 vintage watch - but paired with an $8 Hanes cotton/poly sweatshirt from amazon and $5 generic khaki hat from walmart.	labels:Just seconding what others have said about denim, while I love good denim and definitely see the value of a $300 pair, it's definitely possible to skimp on denim and still have it last for years. Of course it won't look as nice as a more expensive pair, but if your goal is just to look presentable then cheaper denim can do the trick imo!	episode_done:True
text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind?

Men who smell good always get my attention, but too much chokes me out. There are some vanillas I just can’t handle. But I always choose depending on what I am wearing.	episode_done:True

text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:Other people have covered the main points- find fashion bloggers or icons that look like you; buy from companies where people post reviews with pictures, so you can see how it looks on someone with a similar body type; don't be intimidated to go to a tailor, or tailor your own clothes (youtube has plenty of tutorials on how to do basic alterations!).  Please don't take this as intending to trivialize your struggles, but rather an effort to offer some validation: off the rack clothes don't really fit *most* people well. I have friends of all different body types and sizes, and we *all* struggle to find clothes that work for us off the rack. So please know that you're not having trouble because your body is somehow uniquely unsuitable for clothes. It's because, quite frankly, *most* clothing is badly cut and designed. Most clothing sucks. Clothing manufacturers, especially since the 2008 recessions (i.e. most of your life), have been making clothing that just gets weirder and boxier and less flattering with every passing year. It's almost impossible to find things that fit anyone (in the sense of being flattering), because they are made to fit everyone (in the sense of doing the bare minimum of technically covering the body). Instead of manufacturing clothes to fit a human body, with all its curves and variations, it's *way* cheaper and easier to sew a couple rectangles together and call it a shirt. And we don't really have better options, so we buy it, so they keep making it. And it may feel like other people don't struggle with this, but you're not seeing them in the dressing rooms or looking through their closets in the morning. You're seeing them out and about, or on social media, where everything is carefully clipped and styled, staged to look perfect and effortless.	episode_done:True

text:here comes a special boy	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:I don't think there's anything wrong with preferring dresses and leggings and it doesn't inherently signify that you are somehow unworthy for pants or "letting yourself go".   The thing is, historically speaking, dresses were actually far more practical for a woman's body due the cyclical changes we all experience, from menstrual bloating/cramping, to minor weight fluctuations, to pregnancy and breastfeeding (historically there wasn't much choice about the last two but obviously now there is), cuz you could cinch up or let out your dress depending on how you were doing.   It's only now that stretchy fabric is truly mainstream that pants have truly become as practical and cost effective in that they can tolerate a lot more cyclical size changes, which are *normal*.  Edit: not to mention all the times people would gain and lose weight due to the availability of food.   I'd say I have a pretty confident mindset and 90% of my non work wardrobe is dresses and skirts/shirt combos. I wear undersummers in the spring and summer, leggings and sweater tights in the winter and I've gotten SO MUCH MORE USE out of my dresses... They lasted me up until my 8th month of pregnancy, I barely had to buy maternity clothes.  I have been able to wear the same knit dress/leggings combo at 180lbs prepregnancy and later at 210 lbs post partum and still look cute.  What pair of pants could pull that off? Almost none, I tell you.  Saved me a lot of $$$.   No matter what I weigh, I always have a bit of a belly, so most pants dig into that anyways, which isn't comfortable. Only truly high waisted stuff feels ok, but I don't want to wear that in the summer.   It sounds like disordered thinking is creeping up on you, and you may have to consciously remind yourself that there's nothing wrong with enjoying comfy clothes that don't restrict your abdomen.
text:The last time I came here before moving here I saw a man covered in his own shit continuing to shit while shivering under a blanket   That was the moment where I really knew I wanted to live here	labels:Honestly, my favourite NYC Subway moment was a week after I had learned how not to make eye contact with *anyone*. A fat white man with a portable speaker on his chest walked in. He wore a baseball cap that said "JESUS!" and a hoodie that said "THE LORD".  He spoke up. With a confident voice he announced to the cart, "I am not poor or destitute, I have food and shelter, praise Jesus. I do not need and will not ask for your money. I just love to come on the subway and rap for the Lord." At this point I'm thinking "oh this is going to be *amazing*". But I had learned not to make eye contact, so I kept my eyes on my phone and my headphones in my ear. I did turn off the music though.  Indeed, he proceeded to turn on his boombox. A simple beat started playing. The fat white man tapped his foot for a few seconds and, once he got into the rhythm, he began to rap for the Lord. His voice was a bit feeble, but the meter and rhyme scheme of his verses held up. He clearly was experienced, as he came to a natural stopping point just a second shy of the next stop. There, he disembarked and disappeared.  This is probably a more or less regular occurrence for someone who lives there, but I had that warm and fuzzy "omg this is exactly like I always imagined" feeling. It was very hard to avoid looking at him, which I'm sure he would have mistaken as an invitation to talk to me. Everyone around me seemed *entirely* unfazed.

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:The company already made money off of the original purchase of the shirt, so you buying second hand doesn’t really benefit them in any way.

If someone asks where the piece is from, just say you don’t know so they won’t be tempted to buy from the brand lol

My dog's despondent whimpers recall the helpless cries of teenagers on the brink of a nervous collapse as they juggle arbitrary deadlines, crushing debt, and the insidious suspicion that it's all a bunch of bullshit. One big advantage of working from home is the ready supply of cheap coffee to keep me alert now that I'm expected to be available at any time--day, night, and weekend.

text:The Terribly High Cost of Cheap Goods	labels:Most of this conversation is sadly ignorant of how global development works and prioritizes people in wealthy, developed countries over those in developing countries that need manufacturing to raise their standards of living. Since the post-colonial period there has only been two ways that any countries have significantly increased their economic development level, resource extraction like oil (which just isn't an option for most countries) and becoming a low-cost manufacturing center.  Countries that are now flourishing like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan were only able to do so because they became hubs for cheap international manufacturing, which enabled them to transform  into thriving, world-class developed economies.  Slave labor or child labor should always be unacceptable, but the idea that you are helping anyone except those who are already wealthy on a global scale buy strictly buying goods made in developed markets is ignorant.

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:In my experience, lower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose) and spending more tends to lead to a more noticeable improvement in quality up to a certain point. That's painting with a broad brush though... leather dress shoes and boots scale much better than sneakers or sandals, where mid-range options are going to be good enough for most people.  T-shirts, dress shirts, denim, and accessories in low-to-mid-range are generally good enough from a quality perspective IMO and I've only really paid more in those categories for a design I like rather than because I think I'm getting something higher quality. There's nothing wrong IMO with buying something because you like the way it looks even if a similar quality alternative exists at a lower price, but that's harder to do if you're shopping on a budget.  I'll also add that for all of the above, your dollar goes a lot farther if you're willing to shop used. Sites like Ebay, Grailed, reddit/styleforum B/S/T threads, etc. have made it a lot easier to buy preowned clothes without having to set foot into a thrift store.  TL;DR When shopping on a budget I'd focus first on having a high quality pair of shoes and jacket. Consider buying used clothes to stretch your budget further.

text:I think Marilyn was very conscious of what she was doing here. She carried a folksy persona, deliberately catering to working men and women, and had that "What do you mean by suspecting I'm dressing sexy by wearing dresses so tight they have to be sewn on, I can't help that I'm CURVY! It is those who think it's on purpose that are truly lewd!!"-vibe all the way through.   Basically, she tried to be as sexy as possible, but because that wasn't really allowed due to misogyny, she tried and mostly succeeded to pass it off as pure innocence. Here she is saying "I just want to please you guys, it's only natural - why do you judge me for being feminine? Men like feminine women bla bla" in an attempt to make the media be less judgmental about her livelihood.   She wasn't treated respectfully even though she was a huge star, because even though Holywood wanted a woman who was first and foremost sexy, they also judged and shamed the stars for trying to be exactly that. No wonder she was defensive about it - she lived up to the ideal the most, so she also had to be the spokesperson and defender of it. She was very much aware of her image.	labels:I think I didn’t properly explain what I meant. Her saying that “only women criticize what I wear” is very similar to the things that “oh I’m not like other women”  or “I only hang out with the guys” type of women say. Women like this tend to have internalized misogyny that they are not conscious of, and they continue to contribute to this societal problem by trying to put down other women while elevating themselves.   It’s sad because she suffers from exactly the problem that she is contributing to. I don’t think she had some “evil” thoughts or “connived” behind the scenes - in fact I believe from her personal life (and from people that knew her), she was a very sweet girl who was quite naive (which you can kind of tell based on how her relationships often went).   Also I don’t believe she had control over what she could wear while on set or that very famous JFK dress. Her stylist probably styled her and she had little to no input into her outfits.

But if you want the style, almost inevitably you're going to need the money.

text:yeah the camosun might have been a slightly better fit for me. I am pretty happy with my radsten anyway, but wouldn't go any colder with it then the weather in vienna rn. When ordering I was afraid that the camosun would be too warm, which I think it could also very well be. So I chose the one where I thought that it would maybe be a bit too cold instead of too warm and having to sweat. I think that I might pick up a good fleece or thermal underlayer and that should do the trick for the cold days. :)	labels:That's a really good point!  I only start to wear the camosun around 0 degrees and have other lighter coats for above that. Really depends on what your needs are, since winter in Canada can get a bit more extreme than austria.

"Layer it" -- ah, the standard cliche. 5. "Wear it with this expensive moncler vest, who cares if it looks good? That logo is GIGANTIC!" 6. Two completely different suggestions, one of which is their second unhelpful cliche. Somebody clearly took the photo first and they wrote the tip afterwards. 7. "Play with color." Oh, gee, really? I was only going to wear a white shirt and gray trousers with a navy blazer, ever, but gee, you want me to *consider things*? Cool. Thanks. Super helpful, Mr. P. 8.

text:How to combine colors	labels:To be honest, a lot of these resources read like the kind of infographics MFA used to upvote; there's the trifecta of pseudo-objective diagrams (e.g. color wheels), dubious pop-psychology (e.g. colors' subconscious associations), and simple but misleading theory (e.g. "seasonal" color schemes) for lurkers looking for 'rules' to bind them.  And like those infographics, I feel that most of these are, at best, an attempt to transform the act of "looking at things and using your brain" into tractable but useless theory (compare: any time someone tries to create a head-shape matrix for glasses), and at worst pretty much junk (particularly the psychology bits). They're also usually based on the fucky assumption that a conventional white American beauty standard is objectively "correct."  Prevailing trends and cultural/subcultural context are way more meaningful determinants of how to use color than a set of temporally/culturally specific rules, and frankly I think the only way to understand those is experience: looking, doing, and thinking. "Caucasians shouldn't wear all black because it offsets their undertone and makes their skin look less vibrant," for instance, sounds reasonable up till you look at actual people who look perfectly fine in it.	episode_done:True

I save all the ones I really like, and if I’m instagram I will follow someone if their overall style is to my liking. Then I’ll go back through the ones I had liked and assess which outfits I can make immediately, and which ones require any extras that may or may not be added to my wish list.

text:General Discussion - January 16, 2021	labels:A dark and surreal week for me:     Accidentally went to the wrong floor for a meeting this week and stumbled across a sweatshop right here in beautiful New York, New York (the city so nice they named it the big apple), so this is your friendly reminder that "made in the USA" doesn't necessarily mean shit when it comes to ethically made clothing. Reported it to the DoL but I don't expect them to do anything about it.     In unrelated but equally bleak personal fashion news, In my search for some VERY obscure soviet-Czech trainers I accidentally stumbled across a sketchy forum of people selling battle-worn combat uniforms, complete with burns, bullet holes and blood stains. It's always fun to imagine you're living in a Blue Ant book until you actually start living in a blue ant book and life becomes very depressing! The first rule of the forum is you are not allowed to ask how these things were sourced.     Lastly the embroidery studio i work at was contacted for a large order of Rhodesian flag patches. I contacted the client to see if it was for a film or something and he was very cagey about their purpose, so I cancelled the order and refunded his deposit, which lead to me getting chewed out by my boss, who is apparently fine with making White Nationalist memorabilia if it's obscure enough to not get him in any trouble.

I would expect the contact details to have their actual street address (verifiable on google maps and street view, or a drive past), contact details (call them up and ask some questions) and their refund policies etc.    Most of the actual boutiques I know of - their photos (Instagram especially) are all taken in store, in front of the store, or nearby.

text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:When I moved from a very seasonal American city to South East Asia, I for whatever reason thought that I _needed_ to live solely in very thin, very loose cottons and breezy skirts. I didn't bring a single pair of jeans or boots because I was fairly certain they would cause me to immediately melt into a puddle. For a period of time, I prioritized the heat over everything, so my style became really plain and blah, whereas I used to be fairly experimental back in the US.  Luckily, I then realized the key to dressing in the heat is just finding a balance. A thin turtleneck is fine with a skirt. Jeans and boots work fine with a tank top. Light weight blazer or loose oversized button-ups have replaced coats and sweaters, but still allow for some layering.   I've come to a good place with what I view my style as now, but I find that I do have to repeat a lot of basic "outfit formulas" and feel a bit envious of people who live in the cold and can layer to their hearts content. I think the cold weather lends itself to more creative combinations, whereas being stuck in perpetual summer makes me feel confined to a life of sun dresses.	episode_done:True

text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.

I always recommend people look into blanks (I like rue porter), because as you grow up you start find yourself gravitating towards more subtle clothes rather than a big Nike check on the chest.     Additionally, I recommend looking for timeless pieces if you’re starting off a closet. Buy things that have stood the test of time, and will look good on anyone regardless of age.  For example: - a denim jacket - a leather jacket - black jeans - a well fitting white shirt   Lastly, a “hack” I have is telling my friends to follow people that have the same body type as them. Some things look great on on body type but you buy it and you won’t understand why ya look like a saran wrap California roll.	episode_done:True

text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:The first step is knowing what you have - colors, shapes/silhouettes, patterns, etc. and what makes you feel comfortable. The best outfit means nothing if you're uncomfortable/self conscious in it.  A few tricks that have worked for me until I got more comfortable with my closet and could slowly evolve it and venture out:  \- Black or other neutrals are your friend. Pair with a pop of color or a fun pattern. This made breaking things down for me much easier.  \- Find complementary accessories. Statement bracelet, necklace, earrings, scarf, blazer. Whatever you like. Even adding this one element can tie things together.  \- Try different combos of what you have together. Figure out what you feel comfortable in and what shapes work together and what colors you actually like together. One concept that works for me is if I wear more fitted on the bottom, I put something a little looser on top or vice versa.  One thing that really helped me when I had to elevate my wardrobe game for work stuff was a trick I heard they teach associates at a fancy pants store. I don't know if this is actually true but I still found the concept helpful: every outfit should have 3-4 pieces. Skinny Jeans/camisole/cardigan/statement earrings- wham! Leggings/sweater/scarf. This has helped me when I'm staring at my closet with a sweater and jeans wondering if I can do something else to snazz it up.  If you're interested in working with color, I would suggest just browsing about color theory to see if there are some ideas there that may inspire you on things that may work together. Also figuring out what colors work with *your* skintone/hair/eyes is very helpful in narrowing things down.  **That was a long way of saying, try things out and observe the types of styles/outfits you like, what works for your own lifestyle/needs, and just have fun with it!**	episode_done:True
text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism? I love it, but how do you do it?	labels:Based on that album, I guess I am maximal about half of the time! :D  I think the easiest thing to do is to start small.  If you wear a lot of solids and neutrals - dip your toe in with a great coat. A coat in a fun color, maybe even a patterned coat. Wear that daily.  If you don't want to commit to a coat, get one "loud" patterned item. The easiest way to pair it is to pull out one of the colors in the pattern and that is what you wear it with. Instead of using the neutral, use one of the accent colors.  And number 3 is color blocking. That one is super easy. You just pick two solids, but skip the neutrals. Tone on tone is fun, as well as things that are near opposites on the color wheel.  I have yet to master pattern mixing, that is one of my goals.	episode_done:True

text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:The most basic thing, fundamental, objective thing is if it uncomfortable or impedes your movements. Some of this you only figure out when you wear things particularly if they are too loose (too tight you usually notice faster), like tops or dresses too big their neckline might move a bit and look askew, or you step on the hem of skirts or dresses at you climb stairs. Skirts too tight might ride up, pants too tight might dig and create camel toe or the zipper give way and open...  For other things, say pant or skirt length it might be a matter of aesthetics, 5 or 10 cm lower or higher..  Probably the most important point for things to fit is the shoulders and armpits, so it does not impede movement and because outerwear, tops, etc, hangs literally from there. If fitted, the seam should be at the edge of your shoulder blade naturally.  Not everything can be altered to fit right. There might not be enough fabric for that, or it might just a design which was cut for different proportions than yours. Tailoring can do subtle tweaks, on woven fabrics (knits are harder, way harder), but the first and most important step of getting clothes which fit well is REJECTING things, lots of things, most things, almost all things. Trying many many things, being analytical so you can learn stuff (if it looks like that chances are it will loook  this other thing on my body, Brand X pants always fit me right and Brand Y pants never).

text:Permanent Style - The Cold-Colour Capsule	labels:I agree with the sentiment. I recently culled my clothing down to the items I actually wear and the result was almost all black, grey, brown, and navy blue, with some accent colors on the edges (maroon, burnt orange, etc).

text:FAQ: Why/ when/ how do you cuff jeans?	labels:Why: I think it can add a useful visual break in a pant leg, and sometimes it helps the leg drape better. Or if you just want a different silhouette, like cuffing high with boots.  How: I usually do one big turn up of like 2-2.5 inches, seems to let the leg drape more cleanly with no bunching. I'm more of a stacking guy tho.	episode_done:True
text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:I don't think it's strange to feel that way! I tend to have a very eclectic style and enjoy trying out new unique/vintage charity shop finds, and this is something I've always struggled a little with.  This is one of these things where it just depends on whether you fit the occasion practically. For example, if you turn up to play a rugby game in stilettos, or go out into a snowstorm with just a cardigan, that's not a good idea. But is there any *practical* reason why you can't dress up a little more for drinks with friends?  With looks I'm less confidwnt on, I tend to go for practice runs first - that usually means just wearing it to the supermarket or to run errands where I'm not likely to see anyone I know, so I didn't have to worry about people's preconceptions. Sometimes I just try them on in my room and have a little dance party to some funky music, and that's still a way of getting used to seeing yourself in something!  There's always going to be someone who makes a comment about how you're 'very dressed up', or similar. These comments aren't usually even meant to be rude, but they often play into the little outfit insecurities that you already have! But the best part about this is that these kinds of comments get old pretty fast.  For every person who thinks you aren't standing out in a good way, there's going to be 10 people who admire your style and wished they could be as brave, even if they probably don't vocalise it. I can think of countless times where I saw an outfit I liked on a friend or stranger, but didn't actually say anything about it!	episode_done:True
text:TheRealReal x Gucci	labels:It’s not generous. $1 for items priced $300-$15000? They have a huge margin.   Also, the Real Real regularly puts the market price/retail price for goods higher than they actually are so that the goods are only a few dollars cheaper than new.

text:General Discussion - October 27	labels:I think early MFA and the attendant blogosphere it spawned / belonged to / helped popularise is partially to blame for the whole "timeless" nonsense.

text:My Gucci Addiction: Vanity Fair editor Buzz Bissinger's essay about spending $638k on clothes	labels:I read this years ago. It stuck in my memory because of how outrageous the whole story was.

It's also interesting to consider how *fashion* (not necessarily shopoholism) can be an addiction.   I wonder whether he's okay now.	episode_done:True

text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:While my wardrobe is fast turning as black as my soul, I’ve enjoyed two pairs of colorful pants: a pair of mustard cords, and a pair of salmon boyfriend chinos, both from Gap. I’m glad colorful pants exist! I’m heartbroken the mustard cords didn’t hold their color for more than a few years—now they’re just an odd yellow shade, like Charlotte Perkins Gilman picked out the shade—but in their prime I loved wearing them with Weejuns or midcalf boots, a chambray or blue plaid shirt or a lace cap-sleeve and denim jacket, a chunky necklace. Granted, this was the early/mid 2010s. I styled the salmon chinos about the same. Now, if I were to choose a pair, I’d go for a jewel-toned pair, perhaps Eileen Fisher lantern pants in that gorgeous red color, and pair with black. I’d pair a high-contrast pant with a high-contrast/clear top, and muted pants with a muted top.	episode_done:True

text:What were the fashion finds that made you cry of happiness?	labels:It’s funny, I came in to this thread to share the time I found a pair of suede Stuart Weitzman boots in my size in perfect condition for like $25 at a thrift store. I wear them all the time and they’re still in great shape after like 5 years. Enjoy your 5050s!  Less fancy but still memorable: we had just moved cross country for my husband’s job and I got an immediate call back from a job I applied for. Like, they called me the same day I applied and asked if I could interview the next day. All our stuff was in transit, and I had been planning to take some time off before my next job, so I had nothing to interview in and a suit is pretty much expected in my field.  I went to J. Crew, Banana Republic, Ann Taylor, LOFT, etc that afternoon and somehow NONE of them had suits in my size. The best I could find was one from Ann Taylor in a color I hated with an inseam that was 5 inches too long.   HOWEVER, I randomly passed a Salvation Army on my way home and decided to check it out. Friends, I found 4 beautiful J. Crew suits in my exact size, already hemmed to my ideal length within like 2 minutes of walking in the door. I’m pretty sure I actually did cry.   I didn’t end up taking that job (you will not be surprised to hear that it had very chaotic energy!) but I still have—and love—those suits.

My sister, for example, buys the same size leggings as I do despite her hips and waist being 5-6 inches larger than mine, and then complains about them being see through. I have strong suspicions that this is the reason people find thongs horrifically uncomfortable as well.	labels:I have slim hips but a wider waist, so I have to pick a smaller size for mid-waist then for high-waisted. Slimmer hips also comes with a bit of belly pouch, even at size 6-8.  Most bottoms are cut for wider, but flatter hips then my round ones, so sizing pants up rarely works if it get's larger in the wrong places.  Tight, high-waisted jeans doesn't work at all for me, since they try to force my lower torso into another shape, and usually leads to stomach ache.	episode_done:True
text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:Give shoes a day break between wearings.

Otherwise he said they stay in that moist, malleable state and get out of shape more quickly.  Anecdotally I’ve seen a major difference in the lifespan of my shoes.

When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was “saving for good”. Ironically, “good” apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I’m just out running errands.

text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I bought/sold on Poshmark when it was starting to get popular, and found great deals and sold pretty easily on it. I stopped a year later - by that time, I had started seeing wholesale distributers flooding the site and making it alot harder for me to find actual used clothing for decent prices. I'd agree that there are likely too many sellers now compared to buyers - or at least too much merchandise compared to buyers. To me, that makes Poshmark too much like Ebay, and is no longer as distinct a platform as it used to be.  Edit: typos
text:Does anyone else wear one brand only?	labels:About 80% of my wardrobe is Eileen Fisher---partly because I still pick up occasional shifts from the store and I get a discount there and "first dibs" on returns and sale items.

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:I'd say to some degree yes. Most fashion houses are rtw/couture first and accessories second. They dipped into the handbag and accessories market to make more money, but the real quality (and bread and butter) for most fashion houses is their rtw.   Chanel is in this weird spot where they're trying to outrun the secondhand market and regain the exclusivity they once had. They're trying to be Hermes but they could never be Hermes because Chanel is not known for their leather.   So yes, I think when it comes to handbags/SLGs/accessories most luxury houses are trying to put out the latest and greatest and kind of mimic fast fashion to some degree. They're appealing to a market that can't afford to become their regular clientele. The people whom they can't text when the latest $7000 tweed jacket is released each season and know that they can walk away with a $10,000+ sale. So brands are trying to push out the latest and greatest handbags, SLGs and shoes.   In terms of rtw, I do think the traditional fashion calendar is very fast paced, but several brands have said they will step away from the traditional calendar and cut it back down to 2-3 releases per year. It will be interesting to see what this means for S/S and F/W collections.   Commenting more on the handbag/accessories market:  I say this as someone is kind of handbag crazy, but I do wish people would do more research about the brands and bags they purchase. People assume that just because a bag is marked up it's handmade by an artisan who specializes in leather but that isn't the case for most brands.   If anyone is looking for Hermes alternatives I highly suggest Delvaux. Valextra and Moynat also have fantastic craftsmanship. But I bought my first box leather bag from Delvaux last year and it's on a completely different level from Chanel.
text:General Discussion - November 22, 2020	labels:So I've been lurking / participating here for about a month and I think I have a good feel for the types of posts that generally end up on this sub, common opinions etc.  I see this same pattern - posts that align pretty well with what's discussed in WAYWT/Discussion threads, like the Rick Owens post from today or the coats post from last week, getting thousands of votes and comments from people posting things like "he looks like he's shit his pants", and "nobody would wear this".  Why do people who spend their time lurking this sub, silently absorbing whatever opinions and discussion, decide to come out of the woodwork to post _this_ hot take? Really - you had to put some thought and energy into typing that out. If that's what you think, why are you here?  I just don't understand.

text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:I think buying *nothing* except bills and groceries might be a little unrealistic, given that you've slipped up a few times. Can you give yourself a small budget? Personally, I have a yearly budget for clothing. Some months I spend nothing, some months I spend more, but it's all bugeted for.  Overspending on clothes can come from treating shopping as a hobby. I switched from browsing online stores to looking at high fashion photo shoots and shows. Still scratches the fashion itch. But you can't exactly impulse buy a $10,000 dress.   Can you also try focusing on other, non-fashion related hobbies? Reading is a great one for me, and I don't spend anything on it because my local libraries are awesome.	episode_done:True
text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:When I moved from a very hot climate to a super cold, snowy one I was in a weird place both financially and with my wardrobe. It was supposed to be extremely short term but ended up being long term/possibly permanent, which definitely messed with my expectations for my wardrobe.  Eventually I got rid of all my "warm weather" clothes for various reasons, mostly size/style ones, and when I was able to started to stock up on winter wear. I didn't know what I liked so I just kind of went for it. For example, I thrifted tons of scarves only to barely use them a couple years later because I realized I only like infinity scarves. The same thing happened with multiple categories because I was so desperate to fill the missing chunk of my wardrobe.  I agree with the advice to wait as long as possible before making drastic changes. Its hard to know what you'll actually end of needing, much less what you'll like or enjoy using. See what you can pick up secondhand to try out styles that suit your new climate best before investing a lot of money or time into altering your wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:I slipped into the "easy casual lounge wear" early on in the shut down where I live. I almost immediately left crappy and sad. I realized for me, in a world where I have no control over anything, I do have control over what I wear. Even though I have been working from home, and have no where to go, I get dressed...every day.   After a while I realized that, no one sees me except maybe a waist up video call once a day, so why not wear things that I was excited about? Who cares if anyone else likes it. I have always been drawn to vintage pieces and even had a few in my closet. I rarely wore them because they didn't fit the classic business casual that was expected in my office. I wore those pieces almost every day. Then I started a Pinterest board with really specific criteria, earth tones (looks good with my skin tone), vintage cuts, texture, natural fibers. Boom. For the first time in my 30yrs I had a style that I loved!   I kept the few items I already had and loved, and slowly started collecting others that would match or compliment them. I went the thrifting route because 1. its cheaper, and 2. I could find good quality pieces in natural fibers more easily than if I had gone to the mall. I would visit a thrift store once every two weeks and get one or two items, always reminding myself of my criteria (natural fibres, classic/vintage cuts, earth tones). It narrowed down what I looked for and bought which made it easier.  Now, two months later, I have a cute little capsule wardrobe, and I LOVE every piece.  I guess that was a really long winded way to say, wear what you want and what inspires you in the morning. Especially now when no one is around to judge you while you are just "trying things out".	episode_done:True

text:Future of fibers?	labels:Increasing rate of consumption of natural fibers is also terrible for the environment - mass production of cotton is environmentally atrocious. The shipment of sustainable clothing from Ukraine to New York, for example, is also really bad environmentally. If it is a concern for you and you're able, I would suggest looking into local producers; this includes designers, fibre producers, factories, dyers, etc etc. Thats the best way to ensure minimal impact of clothing on the environment.  However, not always practical or possible.
text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I'd get a really nice piece of outerwear, either a coat in a quality material like wool or a leather or shearling jacket. If you live somewhere with colder weather during part of the year, outerwear is something you'll be wearing all the time so it's worth investing in a piece that's great quality, keeps you warm and makes a statement. I think an amazing jacket or coat will elevate even the most basic outfit, whether it's a more classic piece, something utilitarian like a puffer jacket or something more extravagant. Personally I think Acne, Chloe and Tibi are brands that make great high-end outerwear in a variety of styles.

Crossover shoes like LL Bean boots, Kodiak, Teva (boots, shoes, sandals), and other brands work well on casual hikes and in the city. Knit sweaters and a rain jacket.

text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:1) The most foolproof way is to try on every combination of clothing possible. Especially the things that you’re like - there’s no way that will work. Because that’s how you discover new combinations. Or you’re like... well, that didn’t work but if the top were like slightly longer, it’d actually be amazing - and that’s a great way to build a shopping list of stuff that would work with what you already have.   2) Trying on clothes is actually a lot of work. If you’re lazy and would rather lie around instead (cough what do you mean, I’m not talking about myself at all), if you put all your clothes in a closet app (I use Stylebook) you can look at what’s in your closet on your phone and make up different combinations to try out later. This isn’t foolproof, you will need to still try them on irl to see if they actually work (although the more practice you get the better you’ll get at creating successful outfits). Actually getting all your clothes in a closet app is a whole lot of work to start tbh, but if you want to go that route I find it’s best to use as many stock photos as possible and don’t bother with background removal.   3) If you really want to be a geek and see everything in your closet laid out, do a visual wardrobe. People posted them occasionally a couple years ago so search the sub if you want to see examples - but you basically take a picture of yourself wearing every piece of clothing you own. This takes a long time but you have the advantage of being able to see what your clothes look like on you and I feel like that makes it easier to pick out good outfit combos, because at least to me, silhouette is so important. Also it’s kind of fun to see what types of clothes you gravitate towards and you can sometimes discover things like “I really need a bright yellow jacket, that would tie together so many of these outfits” or “I actually hate green so why do I own 24 green t-shirts???” that’s kind of hard to parse when all your clothes are tucked away in drawers and stuff.
text:What are novelty leather keyrings/keychains for? How do you use them?	labels:I believe that they are used so you can have an easier time finding your keys as well as just a decoration.   I don't personally use them because I like to minimize the amount of space my items take up, but I can imagine it being relatively hard to find keys in a large tote unless you have a lot of little thingos hanging off of them, or you attach them to some kind of long string, hook, etc or keep them on a lanyard like you said.	episode_done:True

Also there are definitely modern games (especially big budget) which are designed to retain the player base and suck out the $$. Planned addiction is just a sour taste that leaves me feeling more vacant than I started (to quote that social dilemma doc.)	labels:The trick is to only play games from at least five years ago.

text:I don't know, I know a lot of people who enjoy the process of going to vintage stores and never knowing what you're going to find.

text:And that may very well be. My idea for wanting to set up a capsule wardrobe was because in the last 5 years, I've moved 7 times, so I'm trying to keep my clothing as little as possible. With a capsule wardrobe, I can have, say, 20-30 pieces and 50+ outfits with them instead of having 20-30 pieces of non-matching color schemes and having maybe 20 outfits.	labels:One more thing, if you can narrow your colors a little, it helps with cohesiveness. Like 1-2 neutrals and 2-3 colors for everything else. You still get some color, but there are a few limits. I have a rule that all my patterns need to have at least one of my colors in it. The primary color should be one of my neutrals or one of my colors, and then it can have anything else after that! If it is a pattern that prioritizes my neutral, then it also needs one of the actual colors too. In my world, that means, if I get a floral item with black, then it should have some pink. It can't be only blues, reds. and greens.

text: "regain the exclusivity they once had" - Is that possible? Chanel has too many brand ambassadors that just doesn't scream Chanel.	labels:I think they’re headed in the right direction with all of their price increases. When Chanel increases their prices, the prices on the secondhand market go up. So I guess that’s kind of on their side. On the purse forum, people say the goal is for the jumbo flap to be 10K.   I think it’s fine for Chanel to evolve from the Lagerfeld era.

It works well for me and wasn't something I specifically meant to do, it just sort of happened, haha. I even had bright pink hair for most of university! Some may find it immature but the colour makes me happy, and it makes it a lot easier for my husband to find me when I wonder off in public.	episode_done:True

I can definitely feel that the quality is great however the comfort is currently not up to par.  The back of the shoe on my heel fricken HURTS everytime I walk. I understand that you have to break them in, but is this something thats gonna be fixed by continuing to 'walk-it off'?   From what I see, the problem is the thread in the back thats just sorta protruding and jabbing itself into my foot.  From people who have purchased this shoe brand, did any of your experiences relate to mine? Were they fixed by breaking them in?

text:That’s such a cool and fun idea!! Like fun socks peaking under the dressy pants. I definitely have to look into that!!!  I really like the idea of a colored suit actually. I’ve been eyeing a red suit for a while, but I still to work on the mental block I have with colored pants. (Flashback to middle school when I thought colored pants were a replacement for a personality,, that was a dark time)	labels:Oh I know. The phrase “green jeans” still makes my stomach turn. You could definitely go for a “classic” bold colour like red, or you could go for a new interesting material or pattern! I definitely love my teal suit 😇
text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:See if the people will send you higher quality pictures before they send it off.  Some things that are really impacted by quality are: Shoe glue/soles, leather, coat lining, anything with wool or raw/natural fibers, hardware like zippers, detailing, straps.  Construction/craftsmanship is king/queen, bad/lack of stitching, thin liners, stiff scratchy wool, etc will make or break something. Look for brands or websites that give you macro shots of the stitching, seams, material, that way you can make an informed decision.  Many sellers will be willing to send you pictures if they think it will net them a sale.	episode_done:True
text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:Honestly I think you have to give way more detail on your old pair and what you’re looking for.  In my mind the biggest hurdle to perfect jeans is the fit, and since every body is different this is highly individual. Some people might prefer stretchier denim for a more forgiving fit, while others look for stiffer fabric, and have less leeway.   Personally I still struggle to find a high rise, non cropped, fits my thighs and waist, plain dark wash, straight/skinny, 90% or more cotton, pair of jeans. But hopefully I’ll find it eventually!
text:MFA Style Starter Packs - User edition	labels:This is gonna be a list for me, it's gonna be partly aspirational since I lack a few things as I want to finish losing weight before buying everything. Going to do it to cover my current job with a smart casual dress code on the smart side and occasionally in a suit. Basically what I would go out and buy if I suddenly lost *all* my clothes and needed to start over.    1x charcoal suit   1x pair black Oxfords   2x white shirts spread collar barrel cuffs, 1 twill 1 poplin   1x navy grenadine tie   1x Mac raincoat   1x navy Chesterfield   1x pair of grey peccary gloves, cashmere lining   1x mid grey cashmere scarf   1x mid grey merino v neck or cardigan   1x navy merino v neck or cardigan   1x pair dark brown plain toe Derbys   1x pair mid-dark brown Chelseas   1x pair mid-dark brown loafers   1x mid grey flannel trousers   1x stone or khaki linen trousers   3x light blue OCBDs   2x white OCBDs   2x light blue pinpoint Oxford shirts   1x navy blazer   1x navy Harrington   1x navy Shetland jumper   2x white tees   2x grey tees   1x grey sweatshirt   2x checked flannel shirts   2x linen shirts   1x pair of trainers   1x dark wash jeans   3x chinos, khaki stone and olive   1x casual coat, either peacoat, duffel or Balmacaan       Not the most exciting wardrobe ever, maybe more than needed for a start out, but I think this would provide a suitable core wardrobe for me if I had to start afresh.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 03, 2021	labels:Ok, so this is a weird one and I’m aware I’m not likely to get a response.  There’s this ad that plays occasionally on Instagram. I think it’s from GQ, but I’m very well aware that I could be wrong. The ad features a man who gives advice on how to be a modern man. Some lines I can recall from the ad being things like, “Learn to dance, wildly and out of control.” “Get a book. Print is back in fashion.” And, “Exercise. A body in motion keeps the mind in motion.” Or something similar (clearly, I don’t exercise enough lol).   I cannot find the ad, which is driving me up the wall because I really like is style and I want to learn more about his sense of fashion. If you could point me in the direction of that ad, or that guy from that ad, I would really appreciate it!	episode_done:True

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:kind of all of them? It seems like you have to pay pretty steep prices now to get the quality of clothes that mid-price mall brands had in the 1990s and early 2000s. It seems that most stores have switched to a model of selling poor quality pieces at huge markups with the expectation that they will sell most of the stock at clearance prices. The GAP used to have quality staples, and J Crew was "fancy." Now GAP is really the same quality as Old Navy, and don't know what J Crew is anymore. The quality has certainly dropped, but I also don't get what is up with the designs since you can't even get a reasonable women's suit there these days. Madewell is not made well. Anthropologie used to sell unique pieces with really good construction, now it's roughly the same as other fast fashion, though I do appreciate that they added petite and plus sizing and carry some high end brands too. Levi's main line is terrible now, and to get the heritage quality, you need to get the Made and Crafted line, which is really expensive!  I mostly shop secondhand because I can't afford the stuff I like. When buying new, I try to wait for sales and avoid buying anything "final sale" or with complicated returns unless I know it will work. Clothes that I used to get at Anthropologie, I now get from Sezane, Ulla Johnson, Doen, and Samantha Pleet. I started buying vintage jeans over Madewell/Levi's or expensive craft brands—my 1980s Chic and Gitano jeans were probably sold at K-Mart/Target but are better quality than anything I have gotten from Madewell. I don't wear jeans/denim enough to justify craft denim prices. Patagonia is still very high quality technical wear; I just scope out the Tyler sport outlet and secondhand for deals. Shoes are hard because I don't like to get them secondhand. I switched from Adidas to Veja and Diemme for sneakers (you can find Diemme shoes for huge markdowns on Yoox during the winter and summer sales—I don't think they are worth retail price).

But I did get her the Cashmere turtleneck, which she should enjoy.

But I really, really wanted that zip-up sweater; I had a whole look planned to go along with it.	episode_done:True

text:So uh, what’s the trends for fall this year?	labels:This might be totally wrong but I have a feeling that face masks are gonna be big this season.
text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:Don’t forget to check out thrift stores. This is where I stock up on cashmere sweaters for a few dollars a piece, wool skirts, kilts, sweaters, vests, and cardigans, and amazing wool blazers and coats. I’ve found mint condition mohair and camel hair 3/4 coats for as low as $10, black cashmere sweaters for $2-3 and up, and cable knit pullovers for as low as $4. It’s amazing what people get rid of, not realizing how expensive it all is new. I also loooove wool in the fall and winter, and so this has been a super affordable way to build a dream cold-weather wardrobe.   The only thing wool I buy new are socks for the most part, everything else I’ve found at estate sales, garage sales, and thrift shops. When/if you go, definitely go through the boys and men’s departments, too. A bit of tailoring can make anything look custom like some of the pieces on Walker Slater maybe.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 04, 2020	labels: **Fjallraven Yupik Parka** vs. **Arctic Bay Nunavut Parka**   Fjallraven costs $660 and Arctic Bay costs $990 with 25% sale.  I know Arctic Bay outruns Fjallraven with insulation level and quality, but I liked the brand value of Fjallraven, and since it's almost $400 cheaper, I am still considering.  Plus I live in Vancouver, Canada where the coldest temperature is around -15 Celsius degree, so I do not need a Himalayan alpinist level insulation.
text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:If I picture my mom's typical winter outfit it was a sweater with snakes wearing sombreros and margaritas embroidered on it, a burgundy "sweater jacket" with fringe, and a pink/orange/green bucket purse.*  So I guess she taught me "fuck it, wear what you want", but it did take me a while to adopt that attitude.   *tbf, this was a look for moms in the 90s

text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:There is a disconnect for the general public. I don’t watch many shows anymore, but I often find in US based shows they look good but I know most people (especially teens?) wouldn’t always wear high heels, designer dresses and 10 different accessories with a perfect smokey eye and styled hair. Most people get that ain’t nobody got time (or desire) for that.   Not me though... I mean to be fair in high school I was overdressed and had a reputation for it, but I didn’t care because I personally loved dressing up and was seen as a stereotypical teen in series lol. I did take inspiration from shows like Sex and the City/Carrie Diaries and Gossip Girl + a few k-dramas or k-pop mv looks. Now I dress more normally, but I get the conception that Europeans are better dressed than Americans which I find funny. I live in Scandinavia though, I feel most people underdress where I live.	episode_done:True

I'm in my early/mid 20s, and now that I've worked a couple years at the same place, I'm wearing more what I want than boring professional. I also started caring about what I wear and planning my outfits. Velvet shoes, corduroy overalls, rainbow prints, sequins, bold colors. Who cares? I've been called out for dressing "fancy" before, but I've stopped giving a shit in correlation with my confidence in my abilities. I'm a teacher...if anything, I'm showing the students it's okay to be yourself and take risks.

I've never seen so many designers and brands across several "genres" all thriving so well.  Saying something isn't "in fashion" just seems wild to me right now. Because honestly I think what's "fashionable" is exploring your own personal style and aesthetic. Being yourself is what's currently cool, and I think that's dope.

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.

text:You are describing it perfectly. It feels fine at the clothing store probably because I'm so excited about how it looks and the atmosphere of the store. I avoid malls like the plague for this reason. Then I go to sit down for a long period in the office and I'm realizing how weird and sweaty the fabric makes me in certain parts on my body or the seams are rubbing me weird at random times in the office.   I have one pair of Aritzia pants that I love that have a stretchy band on the back. There's a sale right now, I think I'll just get a few more pairs. I used to like some stuff from Banana Republic too but the last time I went into the store, I found a lot of their shirts had poorly made seams, it made me really sad. I also used to love the JCrew that was not at the outlet but that closed down because their outlet business killed their regular retail.  My whole journey with this is the realization that ADHD can make me appear not serious because of my tendency to talk like my head is on shuffle and talk too much. Works great for my specific job, it's like a superpower. However, I do think I have a tendency to come off as a slob or not serious on occasion. I realized I need a bit of contrast in how I present myself to the world instead of just resorting to hiding. With my medications, I can actually get up and get ready without feeling overwhelmed thinking about all the steps of putting on makeup because there's no direct consequence to me not wearing makeup even though I love it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:If you like the look of vintage clothing, workwear, brands like RRL etc there is really no need to buy from the expensive reproduction brands or the curated vintage fashion stores or IG pages.   There is absolutely loads of that kind of thing for cheap on eBay (probably where those curated vintage stores get most of it from...) and even well regarded brands like Filson, Woolrich, Schott leather etc tons of that available. All it takes is some extra work on your part to actually sift through it, find whats in good condition, worth buying etc and get to grips with the 'keywords' of the clothing items if that makes sense... ('hunting jacket', 'rancher coat', 'A2 flight jacket', 'type 1 trucker' for example) and can also be good searching by fabric type... ('vintage corduroy', 'vintage suede jacket', 'herringbone wool' and so on), these are a good way to narrow down your search.  Some downsides obviously though like not always having proper recourse on things like returns etc like brands and stores will give. But if you put the time in searching, there can be a lot of good bargains to be had and you can get the look of those reproduction brands on a budget.  Not just vintage either though. Especially on things like jeans, if you have already zeroed in on a specific model with favourite fit you know you like, ebay also has a shit load of people selling Levi's, Lee, Carhartt etc brand new old stock, whether they couldnt return a purchase, offloaded from stores closing down, end of season, whatever. Again though, obviously takes searching on your part to see what is genuine and worth buying, but I have managed to get a couple pairs of selvedge Levis and Carhartt jacket way below RRP, as cheap as I would pay from some crappy high street store.	episode_done:True

text:The Business of Markups on Logo T-Shirts. Why You Shouldn't Drop $600 on a Gucci Tee	labels:eugene rabkin must not have much else to write about these days	episode_done:True
text:Yeah, exactly. Like I would say the most fashionable t-shirt cut a few years ago was a v-neck with capped sleeves. Before that, a very long v-neck with longer fitted sleeves (think American Apparel). Now I would speculate that it's either a fitted cropped crew-neck or an over-sized unisex t-shirt. I'm not saying people only wear those types of ts at those times, but that's what is and was most current.     I do think that trends are changing more quickly and thus fewer people can (or bother to) keep up so wearing the exactly what's in vogue right this second is less important than it used to be.     I also think that younger people tend to prioritize being on trend more. Teens in particular are usually still growing so they need new clothes more often anyway. As you get older and spend more time around other older people, your definition of "current" changes. More formal clothing tends to be more timeless too, so once you're wearing work wear 5 days a week the definition of "current" seems to shift.	labels:>Like I would say the most fashionable t-shirt cut a few years ago was a v-neck with capped sleeves.

Oh holy shit, that's such an on point observation though! I still *have* a couple of these v-neck tshirts, which I bought in the first half of the 10s mostly. But I don't really wear them anymore, since most of my basic tshirts nowadays are boxier, more unisex like tshirts with a higher neckline.

text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:This subreddit has a serious hate boner for synthetics and I will never understand why. It seriously depends on the fabric and the purpose of the garment. Not all rayon or viscose or polyester or nylon is the same. It's like you said, the Uniqlo heattech or their amazing wrinkle-free perfectly drapey rayon blouses are so good. Is all rayon wrinkle free or behave like that? lol no... Which is why you need to look at reviews or touch the material yourself. When you touch it, you can just tell it's good...  Not all "natural" materials are elegant or good either. Sometimes stuff like linen is so trash-bag wrinkly. Sometimes cotton/linen/silk really holds in the sweat and makes you stink, or forms sweat stains on your pits, whereas there's loads of moisture wicking poly athletic clothing or super expensive technical gear for hiking or professional sports which is designed for a specific purpose from synthetic material that keeps you ultra dry, ultra cool, whatever it may be. Poly is also good UPF protection from the sun. Some of my most expensive hiking gear is made from polyester. There is some clothing I own, which I can toss in the washing machine, and after the spin cycle, it's completely dry, without the dry rack.   Acrylics can be super itchy and pilly, or be super tightly woven, soft, and incredibly durable. It really depends. You can't just look at the label and put it away because "omg ew polyester 100%" you need to touch it, stretch it, scrape your nail against it to see how the fabric performs.   tl;dr There's loads of great high quality fabrics in all materials whether it's natural fiber or man-made and I don't really have any negative opinion of anything until I see it in person, and touch it and wear it and I don't think it should matter at all, so long as you personally like it

text:General Discussion - October 20	labels:Working from home has been a struggle. Started doing it in March when everything shut down and it was ok (kept to routine of showering, putting on "office clothes" to feel like I'm going to work, etc). Now all I do is roll out of bed about 10 minutes before I start, make coffee and sit my ass on the chair and work the whole day.   Even my clothing purchases have all been tshirts and sweatshirts. I can't even remember the last time I bought a button down dress shirt.

text:I agree here - if what you like is the silhouette, switch up color.  If what you like is the color, switch up silhouette.  If you can't part with both (i.e., black/gray, dressy pants and turtlenecks everyday), go for textures/materials - I have a charcoal cardigan with black leather pockets that's so fun.  One final thought: outerwear	labels:Thanks so much for adding to that!!  And outerwear oof i feel bad - I own two coats and I love them both dearly, they’re basically the same fancy coat, but one in black and one in tan. If my outfits are repetitive let’s not talk about mh outerwear!
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:I remember trying to design dresses when I was seven years old. Then, princesses were my inspiration. After trying to ignore my interest in high school for a few years where I would still find gossip magazines to admire the red carpet looks, my dad brought me W magazine that he had found in his mailbox and looking through it at the art made me so happy. Now I am older and wear scrubs to work and have a baby, but my fashion passion is back and coming to this forum has definitely inspired me to put more love into my image day to day.	episode_done:True
text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:Sort of yeah, I mean I try to look at what brands that specialise in an item sell something for - lots of entry-level goodyear-welted shoes around £200-250, lots of good neckties around £100, wool trousers seem to be £200-£400, many wool overcoats £800-£1000. I'm not rigid on the prices but I do like to search around to get an idea of an average consistent price.	episode_done:True

text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:When I was in my early 20's, my first priority was to look "cute" or "hot". 5 inch heels were just what I did. I had no money obviously, so it ended up being most anything I could find on clearance.   I'm in my mid-30's now and I simply don't wear it if it isn't comfortable. Not to say I live in sweatpants (well, pre-pandemic anyway), but I prioritize my comfort, looking relatively pulled together, and not tragically out of style but still not necessarily trendy. I don't wear heels.   I don't shop clearance anymore. If it's a well made item that I want and I've taken the time to think about it, I buy it. Otherwise, I do a lot of thrifting and wear what I like of that and sell the rest.	episode_done:True

text:Sorry, but I love you now and its too late for that to change.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:No, no, no and no. I hate the aesthetic thing. Buying things bc 'they fit in with my aesthetic' and not bc you like them is weird to me. You can be all of those styles all at once. I love having a grungy girl moment, a colourful LOOKATMENOW moment, a classy neutral I'm a big girl moment and a floaty yes I am a fairy and I just tiptoe about in pretty midi dresses moment.
text:Shitpost Saturday: Zoom Fashion Etiquette	labels:I make a Zoom background of my actual office just to confound philosophers  For clothes I wear the veil of ignorance
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:I try to think about my outfit as a balance beam. There has to be equal parts light and dark (unless it’s a special or formal event). If I wear a monotone outfit, I go with a contrasting or neutral color to support. if I’m wearing black slacks, I try to wear a top with pops of color in it. Then, I chose my shoes based on the color and complexity of the top. For casual wear I apply the same rule, but also take into consideration the style of bottom I’m wearing (I.e skinny jeans, yoga pants, boot cut, etc) and where I’m heading in the outfit. For example, a pair of yogas and a t could go with vans slip ons OR a pair of trainers. If I’m heading to grab lunch, I’ll wear vans. If I’m heading to the store, I’m more likely to put on the trainers.	episode_done:True
text:I love this because I had almost the complete opposite transition. I went from aspiring to have a slightly dressy, classic style 14-16, and then in the past year and a half (17 now too lol), I had a drastic shift towards recognizing that as put together as dressier styles look, it’s not for me.   Luckily, I barely had any clothes anyway, so heading off to college soon, I decided to focus on what I actually value (comfort above all, feeling like myself in clothes, and replacing things I currently wear a ton) and now find myself in a much more colorful (unless i’m feeling all black), streetwear-esque look. Yesterday, I wore an outfit that I can’t stop grinning about today, and that never used to happen before. Absolutely ecstatic getting to play with clothes in a way that isn’t 100% “trendy” and is just more *me*.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Top of WAYWT - December 2020	labels:I totally missed that first pic, but the shirt and tie combination is tremendous.

text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I am a teacher that went back to working in the building at the beginning of September, so to be fair I was only wfh for several months in the spring, but it still drastically changed my style, or my perspective on my style.   Pre-Covid my work style (and general style) had morphed over the years to become very, very minimal and neutral. Lots of Everlane and Eileen Fisher. This was both because I wanted to be taken seriously at my job (I read very young) and because it also seemed like what was in style to me.   Returning to work in the fall, I realized I really f*cking hated all of my sensible, plain, go with everything black and grey clothes.   I still really prefer earth tones and blacks and greys, and I still wear some pretty simple outfits somedays, but I went on a small spree on The RealReal after I had my realization. I bought myself some louder statement pieces that feel more me, including an embroidered Happy Sheep sweater, a knit Missoni sheath dress, a multi-colored leather and fur purse, platform oxfords, and a couple of geometric patterned silk shirts and dresses.   For me life is too short to try so hard to be timeless and professional. I’m not knocking the look, it just isn’t ~me~ I want to love the clothes I wear and the clothes I love are fun knits and patterns.
text:What is your culture’s traditional clothing ?	labels:Well I was being a bit tongue-in-cheek of course, but the basics...jeans. Shirts. Tees. Sneakers. Three-piece-suits. You know - "Generic westernized clothing." That's an interesting question to really think about though.  We've got to take the history WAAYYY back to find anything with a strong regional tradition that's anywhere comparable to, say, cheongsam or salwar kameez, if there even is any to be found. I can't think of much that has really truly stuck around and stayed unique or symbolic to either region.  The cultural symbolism and weight just isn't quite there with most of this stuff. Victorian ballgowns aren't exactly a "cultural tradition," for example, because they were symbolic not of an entire cultural history but of a place and time, though they are uniquely British creations. Not exactly ceremonial or something one would "put on to honor your culture." Flapper dresses, maybe? American Hippie attire? White wedding dresses? Graphic tees? Neckties? All may have started in the US/UK (or been appropriated by them!), but look at where they went. *Everywhere*. That's what happens when you're from a colonizing powerhouse.	episode_done:True
text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:Yes, I do think our age definitely affects what looks dated to our eye.   I’m noticing that some younger men are wearing some strange iterations of 80’s color-blocked track suits that to me look very Golden Girls. Also, I’ve seen shirt and shorts sets on rappers made out of wild print fabrics exactly like the ones I made for my toddler 25 years ago.  I’m older, so I’ve seen a lot of trends come and go. We are now at the point where they are starting to repeat and are designated as “Vintage”.  I have cultivated my personal style over many years (boho/western), and have seen it done well by Ralph Lauren and most recently Christian Dior in 2018(?) and enjoy the idea of wearing the beautiful things I’ve collected until the end of my life.
text:The tension between the ordinary stuff and the artwork is part of the appeal for the fans. That moment of realization that this weird otherworldly look is made out of like chore coats and jeans and shit like that is the part of the fun.  Craig is explicitly more interested in making cool runway moments than the clothes being cool on the rack, so I that's a legit criticism.	labels:Yeah, I get that. I'm just always bummed when I click on "Craig Green" on Farfetch and then everything is just kinda boring.
text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items have all been high quality copies of items I have in low quality but wore out the wazoo.  For example, I knew I was ready to invest in some high end Chelsea boots when I found myself going through a cheap pair every year. Or to invest in a nice leather-looking jacket when I found myself grabbing mine 70% of the time I went out.  The expensive items were hard to wear at first, maybe on date nights or to a nicer event, but as I got more used to wearing them I wore them more often. I think it took me a hot year before I wore my Red Wings more than like once a month.   My recommendation is keep the items in your comfort zone (so no wild dresses or Colors at first) and to force yourself to wear it at a regular interval. These days, just wearing nice jeans while I go shopping seems to be my “date night” when I dress up!

text:Alexander Wang accused of a history of sexual harassment - fashion in a year of reckoning?	labels:I work in fashion and feel that the rage and “do the right thing” mentality only lasts as long as everyone sticks together (during a moment like #metoo or the protests after the murder of George Floyd.) A lot of people working in fashion are on a gig-by-gig basis so it’s Everyman for himself as far as success goes. People will turn a blind eye to the wrong doings of companies if it means that they themselves can get another paycheck or take a step up the ladder. It’s not that they themselves are immoral but it’s a hard industry to make it in and you can feel powerless when you’re not at the top. When you are on your own, which is most days, you will lose sight of the bigger picture of an ideal future.  For example this summer I read that FreePeople implemented racist practices within their stores. I added them to a list of companies that I didn’t want to work for (I’m freelance.) A month ago I was offered an opportunity to work with them and even though on principal I didn’t want to, I still considered it because I need a paycheck and the name would be good for me to have on my resume and would lead to more work.  Until their are unions to protect freelancers the fashion industry will remain corrupt. Everyone is afraid of being blacklisted and/or broke.
text:Omg there’s one down the road from where I work	labels:I’m so excited for you! I’ve made good friends with the owner of my local one after visiting quite regularly over the past few years (COVID permitting of course). My most recent purchase was a grey wool blazer from Jigsaw. It was bnwt and only £35, but would have been well over £100 originally. Some are selling online now too so that might be worth checking out seeing as we can’t get the thrill of the charity shop hunt in person at the moment. Happy bargain hunting!
text:All-time favorite cold weather pieces?	labels:A grey men's Pendleton wool sweater that I think I got from a former roommate who left it behind.   A wool black watch shawl/throw that languished for at least a month in the lost and found of a restaurant where I worked...and then I finally claimed it as my own. Even after I claimed it, no one ever came looking for it. And I wear it almost every day once it gets cold.   LL Bean Deerfield tall boots. Daily wear in winter; gotten them resoled once in four winters of wear.	episode_done:True

text:TBH I feel as if there’s this underlying feeling of moral superiority that’s rooted in the minimalistic wardrobe (for some people). I’ll keep myself from getting too bashed by saying, yes for some people it’s an economic or environmental choice but for a lot it seems like... Ascetic nomad seeking moral high ground.  It’s similar to the painting community where there’s a fetish for having a minimal paint palette. Wow! You were able to paint that using only four colors?!? Who cares so long as the final product looks good??	labels:I think that can definitely be an element on this sub and elsewhere in fashion, but at the same time, this feels unfair to OP.  OP didn't shame anyone, they just asked advice.  We don't know the reasons they're looking for a smaller wardrobe, but thats up to OP and its a valid question to ask without being shamed - just as no one should jump to conclusions or shame you if you came on here looking for advice on maximalism, being a collector, or just having fun.	episode_done:True

text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:Everything eventually comes back in fashion.  Personally I would love for 2000s jeans to come back - not super low rise or the ones that were bedazzled or laced up but just normal rise bootcut and flare jeans. I have a few from that era that I still wear all the time and a couple more that I had to replace with similar ones from poshmark because I couldn't find them in shops.  I also miss 2000s makeup. Sure, there was too much body glitter and candy colors but there was also the fresh dewy look of blush and a light lip gloss - think Britney Spears in her Oops I Did It Again video, or Mandy Moore's makeup in her video for Candy. Not everything in the 2000s was horrible lol.

It’s not like regular shopping where you go, spend 20 minutes looking, and leave with 5 pieces you really love. Last time I went thrifting I spent probably about 2 hours looking, tried on 7 things, and ended up only buying one. If taking the time to dig through piles of trash to find the one treasure is t really your jam, thrifting probably isn’t really for you.	episode_done:True
text:They never have. It just used to be that visible bra straps were "taboo", so most summer shirts were built for people who would like to cover the straps. As people have gotten away from covering them as a rule, that's opened up a lot of new styles. Plus, the new bralette styles have made it more of a fashion vs what would have been considered a lack of covering.   Still doesn't mean I love having few options that cover a decent amount of boobage.	labels:Do visible bra straps look frumpy unless it's a cute lacey/strappy bralette? I tried wearing my regular black going-out bra with a black top... i think it looked weird because the plain strap didn't look intentional.

But ultimately, that isn’t me. I prefer more feminine (typically feminine, if you will) outfits.

I purchased a shirt in my exact size and it was too short, so I'm thinking I could order it with longer sleeves or a slightly bigger neck and just get it tailored (assuming it will make it longer). I looked at the sizing info on their website and didn't see anything regarding length though.  Thanks	episode_done:True
text:I agree with you 100%. The sleeve thing, gaiters, and video game style collar things are a recipe for disaster. Maybe the aesthetic is possible to pull off, but it would require very high quality pieces and someone who is really good at this kind of thing. It's one of those, if you need to ask for advice, there is no way you could pull it off scenarios. As terrible as it is, I'd probably chuckle if I saw someone wearing any of those accessories at a bar or something. I'm just picturing someone alone at a dive drinking some shitty (or very oddly expensive for the bar) single malt whisky alone approaching random people and trying to talk about outdated philosophers. Even just the high rise pants look seems very intimidating to me. I'm always very impressed by the people on MFA who pull it off. It seems like one of those things where if you pull it off you look incredibly fashionable, but if you fuck it up just a little you end up looking  wholly ridiculous.	labels:What the hell is "Outdated philosopher" supposed to mean lol

What are your shoe essentials?	labels:I recently cataloged my wardrobe, and was shocked to find out I have over 30 pairs of shoes! 4 boots, 5 sandals, 8 flats, 6 heels, and 9 pairs of sneakers. The sneaker count is a bit inflated, though - I borrow my husband’s sneakers a lot (same shoe size, 10/10 recommend) and 4 of those are his. I have maybe 5 pairs listed on Poshmark right now, and could stand to get rid of a few more.   Despite the above, I swear I have about 10 pairs on my wish list right now. There are 2 pairs of boots, a pair of heels, and some flats that I have my eye on at present. I’d like a pair of shiny lace up boots, and to replace an old pair of snake print boots with green croc print. I’ve also got a burning desire to own Mary Jane flats, so that’s on the list too.   I won’t list every pair I have, but the frequent fliers are:   Boots: dark red Docs; knee high suede and black Chelsea both from Stuart Weitzman    Flats: black & white Chanel ballerinas, black Gucci mules, red suede Stuart Weitzman d’orsay   Heels: Sam Edelman Barbie pink suede pumps, mid-heel Jil Sander black pumps   Sandals: vintage black patent ferragamo   Sneakers: white AF1 with a painted snake on the swoosh, my husband’s fendi monster eye runners & Gucci ace	episode_done:True

These have been for personal milestones, though, not professional.

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.
text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:I've only ever had one person give really nice jewelry. (Not that I've gotten a lot of jewelry in general, but like, as a teenager, I was given a necklace from like Sears or something. Meaningful at the time, but not something I'd save anyway probably...) The relationship ended terribly but I liked the piece. I just had it remade. Any good jeweler can do this pretty easily (not always cheaply, though). I turned one necklace into two. The jeweler worked with me, as I came in eith general, vague ideas and they actually drew up plans and designs, which I picked from...It was cathartic in a way. I wore one of the necklaces to renew a restraining order against the guy and it felt like an ultimate "screw you, I have the power here" move lol	episode_done:True

text:Amazing! What a cool inspo!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I've found that actually cutting down on the number of clothes that I have (selling what I can, donating the rest), has actually helped me be more thoughtful and creative about what I do have, rather than being overwhelmed by the sheer number and defaulting to basics.  Stylebook is great at well - building looks, having the app randomly create outfits for you, but also saving inspiration photos. Sometimes I see people on IG and think "wow that outfit is so great!" and when I really look at it closer, I realize that I'll have similar items in my closet already, but I didn't think to combine them in that way. So I save those photos in the Stylebook app as a reminder of how I can shake up my basics. If you do choose to use the app, you'll see what you actually wear and may feel a bit more justified in letting go of pieces you don't reach for that are sunk costs & taking up space.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:I have a really hard time shopping on poshmark. I find I have to be super specific and it's not great for browsing. For instance "j crew tan cashmere cardigan" gets a manageable result but "flowy top" does not. I also uncheck boutique as that's all cheap stuff from china and search by brand when I have one in mind.   Ebay is has more filters which helps to narrow items down. I usually filter by material and country (only shop within the us since that's where I am, this gets rid of all the new stuff from china).  Also, I would definitely recommend thredup because you can return things. I recently placed my first order from them and ended up returning about half of it. They charge $2 per return and for free shipping you have to take store credit, which I think is fair and way better than just being stuck with something that doesn't fit. You can set up saved searches to make it easy to check for new items and also filter by brand/material/size/condition and sort by newest first.   Depop is also worth checking out, I find it to be a bit more curated and trendy than poshmark but often overpriced. There are less items so searching is more manageable, and search results are based on an algorithm (poshmark is just newest first). Also shipping is cheaper for small/light things.  Another one people are into is the real real, I haven't ordered from them myself but have seen it recommended. I think it's pretty much a higher end thredup.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:Great responses already. I'll rant a little bit about footwear since that's my specialty so to speak.   I think people still spend far too much on footwear generally. GYW and stitched construction is nice and all, but it's not a cheap option by any means. You get quite high quality leathers from plenty of makers in the <$350 range and there are good options in the $200 range as well depending on the type of shoes/boots you're looking for.   I'm working on a post that talks a bit more about the individual economics of owning even a single pair of "high quality" footwear. Cost of ownership is vastly under estimated by newcomers and expectations overall tend to be set too high.   I still agree that footwear has pretty high diminishing returns, but I also think that a *lot* of people talk themselves into buying stitched construction shoes that are far far too expensive for what they really want.

text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I went out on the thinnest limb of hope for Romwe after seeing ads on insta. I saw the cutest blouse and had to have it. Then I went online and was shocked to see the prices and may or may not have gone a little crazy and bought a handful or so pieces. Only until after did I do research and find multiple negative reviews.  Most of the items that arrived were not good quality. But some were acceptable so I kept them. The sandals lasted a little over a year. The blouses I still have and wear. They haven't decreased in quality. Of course, I also take care of them when I wash them. So, it's hit or miss.  But, honestly, I wouldn't purchase from there again. The anxiety that I can't be certain I'm getting what I'm expecting isn't worth it. And the thought that I might've been lucky this time but next time might never receive my order like others.  Rookie shopper move, for sure. I should've known it was good to be true. And, at least for 5 pieces I kept, it has worked out. But if a company cannot guarantee that their products are of an acceptable quality, you have better luck at target, from which I have a few items that are of way better quality. Also, forever 21.  The clothes do last (I know fast fashion is horrible but if you're on a tight budget, you can find pieces that'll last so you're not buying often). I haven't tossed out a single piece and I've owned them for years.	episode_done:True

text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:I had to revamp my wardrobe over the last two years as I changed jobs and sizes.   I had just finished a no-buy year, while I lost weight so was starting with nothing at all.   1. Buy decent undergarments. As a large busted woman, I can’t tell how anything fits without a good fitting bra. There’s r/abrathatfits to get a good measurement as many women are wearing the wrong bras. I got a size and sister size from this, went to a bra shop with a good range of bras and tried a few on to find one everyday one that fitted perfectly. Get a decent sports bra while you are there if you exercise at any speed above a gentle stroll.   2. Know what you need for where. Having items for work, weekend and exercise is important. Some people don’t separate work and weekend wear that much and others have wardrobes that look like they belong to different people.   3. Start with one or two items/outfits (especially if trying a new look) before committing. There’s no point in buying a whole wardrobe that later doesn’t feel right. I had a strong sense of what I liked and still bought a couple of oopsies.   4. A classic/go-to item might not be a classic for you. I love the look of skirts but never ever wear them. I only wear trousers and/or dresses so wasted my money on a couple of classic black skirts for work. I have worn them exactly 0 times.   5. Take risks in the dressing room. Try different colours and silhouettes on in actual shops and think about what you like/don’t like about each piece. I have changed my style a bit as it is free to try it on!   5. A decent blazer that fits well makes any outfit more formal when you need it- even us more casual people.	episode_done:True

text:Fall/winter shoe trends: what's your dream wishlist?	labels:I always end up just wearing the same couple of pairs of boots during the winter, and I think that will probably continue because of the pandemic... comfort will be king! But these things are still on my vague wishlist:  * some sleek OTK black suede boots with a flat heel  * black, comfortable sock boots with a low heel * some slouchy flat gray suede boots, I don't know if these are in this year but I just kind of want to look like Robin Hood * a new pair of really soft, insulated, waterproof pull-on winter boots. I have a pair of dark brown UGGs (not the classic style, they look more like regular boots) that have served me well for years but for whatever reason I'm itching for a new pair. Was thinking of Mukluks but they're really A Look and I guess something more neutral might work better with the rest of my clothes. (But should I care? I don't know)  * A pair of soft suede moccasins as casual slip-ons for Fall--I'd go ahead and buy, but I can't quite decide on a color, black or cognac or warm brown or gray...? * Allbirds in a bright color with a colored sole. This one is particularly frivolous, because I already have neutral-colored ones, but I saw a friend wearing some teal ones with teal soles and they looked so cool	episode_done:True

text:What's on your 2021 fashion wishlist?	labels:I'm going from the Middle East (last year) to living in the Baltics (2021) so it's going to be aaaaall about the cold-weather gear and woolens for me. I don't have a super-great grasp on what the formality levels are going to be at work yet, but I'm definitely hoping to get some great all-weather boots, some super warm leggings for non-work or work from home wear. The new job comes with a promotion so I'm going to need a few suits and some wool dress slacks for work (for those days when it's just too cold for anything else!).  I'm thinking a lot about velvet and knit and texture, trying to do longer (and warmer!) skirts than my usual pencil skirt without looking girlish or dowdy... and trying not to splurge on every coat known to man (four wool coats and a cape isn't too-too much, right?)

text:Dressing Drakes on a Budget	labels:Good write up on a good topic. I've specifically said that Drake's is visibly expensive before, a lot of these looks are hard to replicate for cheap... But you really have done a great job, at least with the simpler looks. Yes, styling and fit are huge factors.  And of course, materials are a big factor, particularly for their silk and shirting...   But the real magic in the brand is in specific details, color combos... The closer you can get to the exact color palette you're trying to imitate, the better. If you're looking at cord, don't just look at the cut and color -- think about the difference in wales per inch (IE the width of the cords), look at the buttoning method, and every detail you say you're not worried about, just know what you're sacrificing, because they have a real eye for detail.  (Or, do somewhat less work, and you'll still look pretty good, but details matter, that's all I'm really saying).	episode_done:True

text:My incomplete guide for buying less in 2021	labels:Nice guide. Maybe for the inspiration board to also add in a visual inventory. I easily forget what I have already which feeds into temptation. Color scheme. What else feeds temptations? Trends and scared of not seeing it again. I would say if you love a piece immediately then buy it but don't take tag off. Try it out in real life first.  Also tastes change. Like I went from utility pants to wearing and liking tight jeans then back to wanting more room except I don't have any. So having an open minded/ wardrobe with pieces to take you out of comfort zone, not too far, wouldn't hurt.	episode_done:True

text:My whole point was that calling something costumey is a poor/negative description of avant-garde/high fashion, because at it's essence your saying that those people aren't dressing true to themselves (they are wearing a costume) and your not describing anything about the piece.  I agree with you though it definitely hits a nice middle ground between totally high-fashion and more traditional clothes.	labels:Oh I see what you’re saying now, thanks for explaining. I certainly don’t mean this in a negative way to describe how someone chooses to express themselves at all, and certainly don’t mean to say dressing avant-garde is inauthentic. At the same time, I don’t think those things are mutually exclusive. This sub is full of people half-joking or joking about capes and cloaks, and every so often someone asks about a long duster or the like from Blade Runner or the Matrix or something. You could still be dressing true to yourself and look a bit out of place.  I don’t think people advising someone to not dress like a movie character are impugning how that person wishes to express themselves as inauthentic. Rather, the perception of the layperson of some person dressed as Neo would be “costumey” I think the same could be said for someone in full Rick- it doesn’t change the layperson perception just because one of those two people choosing to dress outside the norm knows more about fashion than the other.	episode_done:True

text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:I think it would be good to start with some gold and silver necklaces that you can layer like basic chains with charms and some some hoop earrings, pearls, or diamond studs.

text:General Discussion - January 13, 2021	labels:The king is dead. Length is but a means to be longline or cropped or cuffed or stacked. All shoulders are raglan. Chest is where I put my delicate knits for safekeeping from the prying mouths of intrepid moths.    Measurements are pathetic quantifiers of a qualitative experience. The extra inches will drape from my anatomy pleasingly, like a banner proclaiming that fit's regime has been toppled dancing in the victorious breeze. M and L and 2 and 3 are guidance enough (S and 1 being made only for the woodland sprites who derive disgusting sustenance from their plentiful options on Y!JP).   While your tailor sleepily shaves another inconsequential centimeter from your shirt sleeve, mine envelop my hands, sheltering the delicate palmskin from the sear of a tea- filled mug. While you salve your chafed thighs from those jeans that "just need to break in", my pendulum swings within its harem, emancipated from the confines of low rises.   Will you hear the call of my silhouette, and learn how to breathe? Or will you continue to ride up the crevasses behind the aging corpse of the old king?   The post-fit era is upon us.

I can always go back to the old schedule.  > What do you think about the current condition of the subreddit--i.e., what's good/bad, and why?  I love the little community we have here. Chilling in the GD threads is awesome once you get to know everyone, and getting to know everyone is part of the fun.  Sometimes though, I do feel that we can be a little cold or perhaps even harsh towards newcomers who may not know the subreddit rules.  > What changes, if any, would you like to implement?  Wuzpoppin already touched on it, I thought it would be nice to have more weekly/monthly discussion threads like the "Styling suggestions" thread DangerG posted up nearly a month ago.  > Why do you think you can be an effective moderator?

text:Those Needles Track Pants	labels:I generally don't like the style that the Nepenthes brands go for, but it's impressive how energetic every Needles look seems to be.

It can get confusing checking the size guides of each brand when doing online shopping.
text:Yeah, I know people with millions of dollars and they definitely have branded clothes/accessories. The main things are they aren't buying them *because* of the brand logo alone and they don't show off the logo. Like, if they're carrying a Chanel bag or whatever, they are just carrying it like a purse, they aren't shifting it so the logo is always visible and holding their arms funny so anyone passing can tell what it is (which is legit something I've seen people do)...but yeah, the idea that every really wealthy person is just minimalist and discreet is pretty laughable.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:PSA: Revive by Rent the Runway via Thredup	labels:I find Thredup to be overpriced in general (almost full price for second hand Old Navy? Please. No.) The prices on Poshmark tend to be slightly more realistic or at least market driven.
text:> "why do some fits get praised when they clearly go against the sidebar"  I think this one could be enlightening to a lot of the people who don't understand how avant garde (or even just mildly experimental) inspo posts get so much praise by breaking traditional style conventions. It might help some bridge the knowledge base gap (i.e. you have to know the rules before you can break them) and help explain the (perceived) cognitive dissonance of traditional tailoring *and* designer fashion both being acceptable styles. I think that would help make it seem less jarring to those new readers who get confused when they come to this sub expecting to find answers for "how do I dress so that I look good," but they find a lot more of "how do I dress to express myself?"  For the record I think the second question is a lot more interesting and certainly the reason I'm here, and there's plenty of resources here that answer the first question (*if only people would look for them*), but I do value that this sub does an excellent job of tackling both. More discussion might be beneficial to newcomers to the world of intentional dressing, is all I'm saying, and the ones who are asking questions in-good-faith I think deserve to understand the rationale behind why someone might choose to wear Kapital instead of a suit.  One last edit: Not that I'm saying anyone owes anyone else any explanation for why they dress the way they do, but I think it's always interesting to learn the context.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I've been using a capsule wardrobe of about 30 ish pieces since March so I have some pros and cons to contribute!   Pro: I wear more "out there" outfits. I know its counterintuitive to most people's neutrals capsule, but I put away every piece of black clothing I own and chose lots of color for my capsule and I've been having so much fun with it! Since I took the time to pick colors intentionally, I know when I'm picking outfits that my yellow plaid pants actually do go with almost all my shirts, and therefore I wear the fun pieces I love more often!  Con: I can't go out and buy new clothes when I come across an inspiration photo on Pinterest or instagram or whatever that I want to recreate. There's some clothes that I know won't look good with the majority of my closet, whether because of silhouette or color, so I can't justify buying them (I'm looking at you, wide leg flair pants).  Overall I've loved my capsule and I'm keeping it up for now!	episode_done:True

text:Jewelry trends for 2021	labels:I feel like delicate, minimalist jewelry in general is here to stay for a while longer among the general populous (I personally think minimalist gold jewelry is timeless). It's easy to maintain and it goes with any outfit; can be a day and night piece.  Might just be me, but I feel that high fashion is always trying to promote the big, bold, statement jewelry, which is fine! The way you describe your style mixed with the beautiful pieces you like, it sounds like it fits you to a T. Just not sure if it is trending that direction though. But I think that you should shrug off today's "standards" and wear what makes you feel happy and confident!
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 20, 2021	labels:I was recently awarded a 40 Under 40 award by a regional magazine.

Bottom line, I'm not cool enough to pull off the more "dadlike" New Balances, which it seems modern style is trending towards.  The 998s were as close as I can get.  For the dadlike ones, you've got to have your entire fit absolutely on point.  If anything else is slacking, the shoes look unintentionally bad and not good at all.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 23, 2020	labels:Not to bring up the cape thread again, but something really has been stuck in my craw. It was some comment about how people who basically wear cowboy shit are “attention seekers.” This was very clearly framed as a bad thing. Western wear aside, I feel like the subtext of the comment was basically “if you’re not wearing something to fit in, you’re seeking attention.” Isn’t the pursuit of dressing better/more fashionably inherently attention seeking? And why is that a bad thing? I don’t understand what seems to be the lurker notion of “wanting to dress better to blend in better.” If wearing the shit I wear labels me as an “attention seeker,” then I’ll wear that badge proudly.   Sorry for the rant, this really just got under my skin
text:What are you wearing for Halloween this year?	labels:Don’t think I’ll dress up this year but the best costume parties I’ve been to have been themed.

text:Canada Goose Workers Allege Unsafe Working Conditions in Winnipeg Factories. “Before I came to Canada I was in Qatar and then Dubai and it’s the same here in Canada Goose: No humanity.”	labels:In a culture that has generally turned on wearing fur for fashion, I dunno how this company gets a pass. A lot of people I spoke when I was involved in an anti-Canada Goose pressure campaign didn’t know it was real fur skinned off coyotes.   Canada Goose is unethical trash and you smell like a wet dog when it rains. I’m not surprised a company that’s super lax about its supply chain doesn’t value its workers. Most folks involved in animal exploitation sectors are exploited immigrants.
text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.
text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:It makes life easier although now I just fuss over which top to wear. I typically wear jeans/black pants, printed top, coordinating cardigan, flats and earrings. Sometimes I change out the pants for a skirt or dress, and the cardigan for a sweater. I gave up aspirational dressing a long time ago and started dressing for the activities in my life. I'm much happier and my clothes get worn!	episode_done:True

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:Okay I am totally in the same spot as you. So tired of wearing grey, I want to rid my closet of the colour. The best solution and not to rid your whole closet is to buy colourful accessories or go to a consignment store and buy statement pieces to wear with your basic wardrobe that would be at discounted prices compared to online retail like Free People and Anthropologie  (I recommend not going to thrift stores because that's more basics typically). I also have a rule that if a t-shirt or any article of clothing hasn't been worn in the last 6 months its time to donate it, that's at least 2 seasons of wearing it not being utilized. As for up-cycling your own old clothes you can buy fun iron on patches that can be added on plain hoodies or t-shirts for a pop of colour much like the brands Comme de Garcons and Scotch and Soda.  You can also embroider shirt collars, or the pockets of jeans.	episode_done:True

text:Most westerners seem to have a big preference for uniqlo. I've checked them out locally, and in multiple countries. Quality is consistent across the board and good for the price.   I would say both brands are about even in quality cause Gap is actually pretty good especially when on sale (my experience is limited to Gap Japan though). The T shirt fabrics for both brands are nice, but a bit thin if that matters (tropical weather here so these are a big plus for me). Uniqlo has great collabs though and some of the seasonal collab designs might appeal to you.   I think for the dress shirts and pants...youre probably gonna have to base your decision on price, fit, and design preferences. That's what I'd prioritize when choosing between budget-ish brands anyways.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:Is anyone else kind of tired of posts and comments that variously try to "justify" the price of obvious luxury goods, designerwear, etc.?  Good thread on the SLP teddy, but just about nothing in there is surprising. Is it well-constructed? Duh, it's SLP. Does it have little refinements all over, compared to everyday varsity jackets? Yeah, that's kind of the point. Is it "worth" $2,000? No, obviously not.   Like...at some point we need to acknowledge that these efforts are misguided, even if well-intentioned. You're buying SLP because it's SLP (or Ackermann, or Dick Ovens, or whatever your thing is). *That* is the justification. And that's a fine justification in and of itself! An analysis of the materials and construction is unlikely to throw up surprises that'll make people go "damn, that really makes it worth the obnoxious price tag!"   (This observation does not apply to bespoke clothing, where the justification genuinely is that you get something more or less customized for you, and you alone.)  What do people think?
text:This was the case in the 50s and 60s as well, but at the time, high quality clothing was more common, sewing skills were more common, clothes were expected to last longer, and the general public had a better understanding of what good-quality clothing looks like; people bought Chanel expecting quality construction, of course, but the main appeal of buying from a prominent Parisian fashion house was knowing that anything Chanel made would be in fashion for the upcoming years.  \- But my question is how can fashion labels go back to this vision right here?	labels:When the people who buy Chanel products start caring about the thread count and style of hem finish used in their clothing, then Chanel will have to start caring about that as well.  But as long as they can sell cheaper clothes for the same price, then it would be silly to expect them to 'go back' to having higher business expenses.  So, really, you're asking for a societal change.  I think we're seeing more pushback against fast/disposable fashion in general, but we'll have to wait and see if that really takes off enough to the point where it changes rich peoples' buying habits.   There is that other issue, though:  \>  the main appeal of buying from a prominent Parisian fashion house was knowing that anything Chanel made would be in fashion for the upcoming years.  That depends on there being distinct fashion trends, and on people feeling compelled to follow them.  In the 50s and 60s, women had to comply with fashion trends in order to be accepted and respected within society.  Personally I'm quite glad that this is ~~no longer~~ less the case, but... well, now that it's less important to be on trend, it's also less valuable to be on trend.   Is it still worth paying thousands more dollars for a garment to be in style when nobody cares and the styles will change in a few months anyway?  If trends don't matter, then what is the point of shopping with a trendsetting brand?  Are brands like Chanel literally just depending on their customers buying solely for the sake of the label?  I guess that's another thing where we'll just have to wait and see if/how fast fashion destroys itself.  Maybe trends will regain some influence if they slow down, or maybe the trend bus will finally explode and people will just scatter into a multitude of alt fashions.  Either way I think there's a possibility for luxury brands to reestablish some sort of high style niche, but I would not expect (or want) them to have the same sort of leadership influence that they did in the 50s.
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:Can I just ask why “as few pieces as possible” is the goal and not, say, “every piece in my wardrobe has a clear function or two, and sometimes that function is ‘because I feel like it’ or ‘because sequins make me happy?’”  A wardrobe you like is one that lets you be properly equipped for everything in your life and gives you a nice little aesthetic pick-me-up while you do it.   Before even shopping, I’d say: Look at your life. What do you do at work? What do you do in the community for volunteer work? How’s your social life? Are you outdoorsy? Do you have messy hobbies? Do your hobbies include going out to clubs and live shows and festivals? How often are you running meetings, speaking with elected officials, serving on committees? How often are you attending religious services, religious rites of passage, or big-deal family events like weddings?  Start with taking an inventory of your time and what you need your closet to do to help you be as prepared as possible for how you spend that time. Identify the holes in your working wardrobe, like “I need a good outfit for going to funerals” or “I need a warm weather first-day-at-the-new-job look.” Then you can settle questions of personal style, budget and what items fit more than one situation in your life.

Sometimes I like preppier, menswear-type pieces. Other times I’m into the ultra-feminine, curvy femme fatale schtick, sometimes I’m more boho/folksy, other times I’m a bit vintage/classic, and then sometimes modern and edgy. I can’t decide which style is mine!

text:Handbag conundrum: lesser know (and lesser seen all over the place) or standard luxury designer bags (think the usual Gucci, YSL, LV, etc.)	labels:Definitely buy what makes you happy. The fact that you have looked at the high end, well known brands and came away disappointed indicates that (this season at least), they aren't for you.   To answer your question directly: for me, personally, showing my own style is 1000% more important than showing the status of a luxury brand. Do the two sometimes overlap? Yes, and that's fine. But I don't personally get buying something *just* because it is a certain brand. Who are you trying to impress? What are you conveying with that logo (wow, you're well off? What kind of message is that, on its own?) I just feel like people who are super into labels, not the design or the style or anything else, just come across as kind of immature? The truth is, anyone worth spending much time with isn't overly concerned with what logo your bag has. (Now! I will concede there is a difference between showing off luxury brands and having higher end items, in some circles. Like, there could be some tension if you're hanging out with super millionaire socialites and everything you wear is from TJ Maxx...but in that case, I'd still say its important to focus on personal style first. And knowing about smaller higher end designers, rather than designers you can buy at a mall, is a whole different thing too...)
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Also, this is a common rule, but no clothing that requires anything special to wear it - eg a shirt that only works when you switch around the bra straps of your convertible bra, a dress that requires shapewear to look how you want it to look, a wrap blouse that has to be pinned into place after you put it on, a shirt that requires another shirt underneath because it’s see-through - all of those are a no for me. If it doesn’t work with just my regular underclothing (except for choosing nude underclothing for light pieces) I won’t buy it - I just know by now I’m not going to make the effort to wear it when I could just put on something easier that I like just as much.

text:This exactly. I have a pretty stuffy office job with a fairly traditional business dress code (not business formal, but the kind of business casual where jeans are 100% not okay, people wear pantyhose with skirts, blazers are extremely popular, absolutely no thighs or cleavage or shoulders seen), but I still have no trouble finding work-appropriate clothing that makes me feel comfortable and that I like to wear.   I have pretty loud taste and I am not one for neutrals, while also being pretty conservative with regard to the amount of skin I like to show, and I love to find stuff with bold colours (like my very favourite suit, which is bright magenta), strong shapes (like oversized boyfriend blazers instead of a traditional hip-length fitted ones, wide paperbag pants, cape sleeves, etc), and unusual patterns, like a cardigan I have with small intarsia unicorn silhouettes. I only buy the shapes I like, so no pencil skirts, high necklines only, pant rises similar to those in my casual wardrobe, etc.   I absolutely live in athleisure outside the office, but I still like and enjoy my work wardrobe a lot and I think it's still expressive while being appropriate for my specific office. I pretty much only wear it to work and I don't pull any of it out to go to the grocery store, but it's still great for the purpose and I don't need to be able to wear all my clothes for every occasion.	labels:	episode_done:True

If I need to be at a more professional or less “uniform” I will bring if I have to travel that day or while on course, I will take a few button ups , a nice blouse, and dress pants or skirt and tights.  As it is a toned down environment, it means classic but cute, so a nice set of earrings, classy but simple make up and a few muted accessories., a really cute classic skirt is easy to travel and pair it with a variety of shoes will work nicely.  It is a bit of a hassle bringing more clothes as well as shoes but it is often business casual.

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I have similar connotations as you about them being kind of cheap or tacky looking, but would add one other angle to it. While I'm 100% against the use of real fur/exotic hides, I think part of the cheapness animal prints comes from taking something that in its natural state exists on fur and copy-pasting it onto all different kinds of fabrics. Real cheetahs look beautiful and elegant. A poorly rendered cheetah print on thin polyester leggings just looks like a terrible imitation. There isn't this mental comparison going on with other patterns, like stripes or polka dots, because there's no "real" standard to compare to. They're just decorative patterns.  Even if you attempt to create a faux fur that more closely imitates a real animal hide, it's going to look cheap and fake (to me) unless it is really well done.

text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:Why would it be tonedeaf? This is kind of a U.S.-centric view. Not everyone in the world is still struggling with COVID, and a lot of the rest of the world isn't nearly as casual as America is, fashion-wise.   Call me crazy, but I'm tired of shapeless billowy clothing in earth tones, and I am READY for some structure and interesting textures. All summer has been about beige and washed out green and brown linen, let's see something else.   Plus, it's a weird take anyway, because high fashion doesn't really target loungewear, either way. Do we really expect major fashion houses to all abandon blazers and leather pants and start showing PJs and sweatpants on the runway?   Others have already pointed out that these collections have been designed months in advance, but consider another point - fashion has always been reactive. When forced to stay inside and only wear sweatpants for 6 months, people will rebel and start daydreaming and longing for the opposite. This pandemic was always going to inspire a sort of glam rock aesthetic, imo. BRING IT.

text:I don’t think this is fair. There are a lot of people out there that have real struggles you’re not considering.   I have ADHD and I have difficulties with executive functioning. My ADHD brain sees there is food in front of me so my singular focus becomes shoveling that food down my gullet. When you start adding “distractions” like talking to my partner or unconscious distractions like filtering out restaurant noise, it’s difficult to focus on staying neat. Like many others with ADHD, I’m also clumsy without a clear cause.  Consider physical handicaps. Someone with tremors will have difficulty with spills. Same with someone in a wheelchair when a restaurant isn’t properly ADA accessible. They can dress they way they, but they might need some accommodations or they might need to employee some extra life-hacks.

text:This is what I ended up doing! Basically “elevated” iterations of tshirts with some interesting detail — puff sleeves, peplum, etc. Also fun prints. IMO the brand Madewell does this very well, pretty much all of my “fancier” tops (really just a step up from plain tees) are from there.   Otherwise for boring tshirt days I wear a long necklace.	labels:I don't really shop at Madewell, but maybe I should look more closely.   I feel like t-shirt fit is hard for me, the shapes do not always work very well on me. My challenge is basically all my extra weight shows up below my belly button. I am pear-ish and I have a really short torso/high hips. So some tops that fit perfectly for tucking do not work untucked. And shorter tops need to be actually short, or they just look dumb because they hit in a weird place on my torso. And the shirt that fits my hips and lower waist is not a good fit on top, especially when tucking. So I ended up being super picky about the fit.   At the moment, the tops I am generally happy with are:   * 2 floral button ups * 3 striped shirts  * one cropped sweatshirt (lilac, it is new, but promising) * 2 long sleeve black blouses (but I didn't have the right bottoms, now I am a lot closer! I don't like wearing a fully black outfit so all my black bottoms were a bad fit. Now I have some patterned skirts and an olive one that should work) * 2 short sleeves silk blouses that may be a little too dressy for right now * pink peplum with balloon sleeves (sadly I got it like 2 weeks before quarantine, I envisioned it being super fun with jeans and I hadn't figured out skirts yet, but you know)  What I need are some interesting solid colored short sleeved tops that aren't black, and are in my palette colors, that can work with pants or a skirt.

I have been looking for selvedge denim that has the silhouette of joggers or skinny jeans (slim thru the thigh, hugs the knee and smaller ankle opening) with the comfort of more baggy jeans(doesn't restrict your crotch). Tapered fits are still a bit baggy in the ankle area for my taste.  Haven't found one that can do both. I ordered some Uniqlo jeans and I'll have the tailored, which still turns out to be a pretty good deal.  Any suggestions out there that can help me out. I'm debating whether to buy skinny jeans with a mid rise and 2" larger waist. Looking at the Gustin mystery grab deal, could lean toward a Skinny 35" since I've heard their fits are looser than most.  For reference : im 5'9 173lbs. my waist is about 34" and inseam around 31".
text:What rockstar(s) you take fashion inspiration from? What do you like about their style?	labels:For me, early Cat Power.  White T-shirts, vintage men's jeans and vintage jean jackets.  Chan Marshall was my style icon circa 2000.  The cover of the album Moon Pix was IT for me.	episode_done:True

text:Everyone’s opinions on Youtube fashion channels?	labels:One of few Youtubers I follow is Safiya Nygaard, mainly because her fashion videos tend be very well thought out. She actually does the research on the history of styles and trends, provides insight on why certain things were worn and what they inspired, stuff like that. She has her own very distinct style, but clearly enjoys learning about new and different things. She tries out alot of fashion-related things but is really informative about them, and not doing it just because she can. Videos of other Youtubers that I've tried to watch, seem to focus alot more on the "haul" and materialism aspect which isn't necessarily bad, but bores me. Some of them actually have interesting items or outfits, but they don't go beyond "hey, doesn't this look cool" or "hey I got this thing everyone else wants".   Safiya is also hilarious, and her interactions with her now husband (who shoots the videos) are so wholesome!	episode_done:True

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:At some point I wanted others to know I'm gay from meeting me, so I got a pixie cut and called it good. It was a bad haircut, it didn't feel like "me", and guys still hit on me. I've gone through other time periods where others couldn't tell my sexuality from my appearance. This was something I was proud of, due to internalized homophobia. (But other queer women always knew. It's the vibe.)  Now, I'm more comfortable with myself and comfortable playing around with masc/femme in how I dress and present. I've made a few subtle changes with my clothes. But what has really made a difference is allowing myself to use more masculine mannerisms - the way I stand, the way I talk, the way I carry myself. In the past I've felt awkward in social settings despite being an extrovert, and I've recently realized this is mainly due to the dissonance between the gender role I'm expected to perform, and what's going on internally. By accepting my androgynous/masculine side, I've started to feel free of awkwardness.  To me, queer fashion is not one thing. There are many different queer and lesbian fashion styles. Just like straight people, we have different subcultures and styles within queerness. You got your art queers, your sporty queers, your co-op queers, your preppy queers. But there's often an element of playing with and mixing masculine and feminine and androgynous, both in the clothes and the way you wear them and the way you act.	episode_done:True

text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:The problem is that doing a no-buy for a year is a HUGE undertaking that you are destined to fail. Not just you, people, in general. I think 3 months is a great start, and I think it's easier if you start with smaller, more attainable goals. It's like with a project at school or work - you break it up into smaller increments.  Once you get the hang of it, it'll be WAY easier to extend another month and another month. Looking at a year of no-buy is daunting. 3 months? More manageable.   The other thing is - you can't go cold turkey, because that is also unrealistic and sets you up for failure. I'd start with a low-buy, a circumstantial buy, a no-buy with a number of exceptions, etc. That enables you to form better habits.  The less strict you are being with yourself, the better your chances of success, overall, and long-term. If you go hard (one full year no-buy, no exceptions, fuck yeah!!!), it'll be super easy to break down and lose your progress, because the minute you give in, you've "failed" and what's the point of continuing. This is an endurance run.  Eventually, you get excited at your progress and want to see it through till the end. This is what helped me start saving money. I wanted to save for a deposit, but man, setting aside that first $1000 was hard. But once I saw my bank account growing and growing as months went by, it became easier. It became thrilling. How much could I save? How much closer to my goal could I get?   It's satisfying to see the progress, and it's harder to give up once you've made a "dent" in your ultimate goal.

I got to work the next day and realized I forgot to put them back in after the gym, so I opened up my wallet and they were gone. I had made my usual morning stop for breakfast on the way to work, so I rushed to the food cart and looked all over the sidewalk but I couldn’t find them.  At least 1-2 weeks later I went to the same food cart for breakfast, looked down, and saw one diamond earring in the crack in the sidewalk. I looked more closely and there was the other one! The metal was chewed up (they were bezel set) so I had to get them repaired, but it was a lot cheaper than a new pair!   Definitely my #1 fashion (jewelry?) miracle.

text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:I think start by looking at pictures online on Pinterest or Instagram of styles you find aesthetically pleasing and create a little dashboard with outfits that catch your eye. You can also think about some of your favourite actors or singers that wear outfits you like and try to save the pictures you find. After that i would go window-shopping online on websites that fit your budget and look around trying to find pieces similar to any outfits you saw. fyi; i would browse on a website first and then go to the actual store to try out what you saw online, it gives you an idea of what you’re looking for.  I think imitation is the easiest way to start finding your style. Once your comfortable in a type of style you can start experimenting with it and picking more personalized pieces. Good luck :)

text:That's actually really helpful! How do you suggest finding my style? I feel like I have such a wide style that I wear (minimal, to punk, to cutesy, etc). I feel like I love all of my clothes but some go months without being worn.	labels:A more direct answer to your question, and something that may help you cull your closet, is through a lot of self reflection and analysis.   Personal style exists at the intersection of life function and self expression. Clothing is the way you define yourself to the world, but is also integral in how well you function in that world. What purposes do you need your clothing to fulfill— do you need to have good pockets? Easy movement? Hypoallergenic fabrics? Do you have a work uniform? What do you want your clothing to say about yourself to others?   Of the things in your closet right now, what do you love? Why do you love it? Is it the texture of the fabric? The construction? Certain stylistic elements? The way it fits you? Get really specific, put it on and think about the fact that you’re wearing it as you’re going about your day and how you feel in it and why.    Keep going: What do you wear all the time? Why do you wear it all the time over other things? What do you hate? Why do you hate it? What do you never wear? Why not? What clothing do you hate but wear all the time or love but never wear and why? Spend a lot of time on these questions because they’ll help you put the language to your needs and wants. When you have some answers, then you can start searching for trends amongst the things you love and the things you hate, and learning the details of clothing and construction that will best help you hone in on what you like. Review fabric composition; find your color trends; learn the names of structural elements that you see in several garments you love or hate; this will all help you seek out or avoid those better in the future.   Once you have some of those answers you can pointedly look for pieces to replace those that you hate but wear all the time with ones you love that align better with your needs or preferences, and you can cull accordingly.   Developing personal style is a journey and one in which there are no wrong answers. Your clothing should serve your wants and your needs.	episode_done:True

I keep my graphic/memorabilia tees and my "nice" tees very separate, though; they're even stored in separate places in my closet because they fill such different functions for me. I'm not sure if I would take such a conscientious look at my t-shirt collection as you have here because  I mostly regard tees as either pajamas (graphic) or more akin to underwear (layering) than anything else. They're just functional - not something I love or cherish or feel the draw to be more intentionally mindful about. I just Respect the Stack.

text:Let's Talk about hats	labels:There is hat etiquette from the days of yore. Here are some of the conventions that were adhered to:  A lady does not remove her hat when indoors or for the national anthem. This is in contrast to men, who are to remove hats when indoors and for the anthem. However, if you‘re sporting a baseball cap at a ballgame, I would remove it for the anthem, whereas if you were wearing a more formal outfit with hat then I would not remove it.  A hat is a daytime piece in most cases not suitable for evening wear. The fascinator is an exception to this rule, but is more of a Commonwealth/British thing.  A lady does not wear a hat in her own home, ie when receiving guests, and as a guest in a friend’s home a lady would remove her hat.
text:20 Sweaters for Less Than $150, So You Can Achieve Peak Coziness - Esquire.com	labels:In my experience, sweaters are one of the few garments where there's a noticeable increase in quality as you spend more money.  Cheaper sweaters are noticeably thinner (both the threads and the sweater itself), which don't keep you as warm and don't last as long.   The good news is that there are some great options for getting high quality sweaters at low prices if you're willing to shop secondhand. For $150 you can find a gently used sweaters from Ines Meain and IMO that's a much better purchase than most of the cotton and fine merino wool sweaters listed in this article.
text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession). I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession 🤣
text:When did skinny jeans go out of fashion?	labels:skinny jeans haven't been on trend since at least 2015-2016 imo. that's when mom jeans became all the rage.

Just because something isn't currently on trend, does not mean it can't be stylish.

text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I buy/sell on eBay, Poshmark, depop, and Mercari. There are pros and cons to all of them. For me I’m not trying to make money or save money necessarily—I just want to recycle clothes that didn’t work for me and from everything I’ve read most donated clothes end up in landfills. I also prefer to buy secondhand for similar reasons.   Poshmark definitely has the best customer service. I’ve dealt with a lot of bad sellers (listing the wrong size, clothes not as described etc) and whenever I’ve reached out to Poshmark they basically refund all my money and let me keep the item. On the flip side, as a seller people have unnecessarily complained (item didn’t fit) and Poshmark didn’t allow them to send the item back for a refund—maybe Poshmark gave them a refund and let them keep the item but I wasn’t effected. This is something that REALLY irritates me about eBay—they always take the side of the buyer and u end up having wasted time, money etc shipping something even when u aren’t at fault. I really wish eBay would absorb the costs like Poshmark does, but this is probably why Poshmark has the highest fees.  Ultimately I think the downfall of Poshmark will be the wholesalers and people who are doing it as a side hustle. It’s becoming harder and harder for sellers with 20-30 listings from their actual personal closet to sell things because there’s so much garbage for buyers to sift through. It’s also hard for me as a buyer to find bundles anymore. In the early days sellers closets were made up of actual clothes from their closets so they were all the same size and the style of the person selling. Now if I find something I like it’s impossible to find another item in someone’s closet because there are 500 random listings to sift through.

If you feel disconnected, try reframing your perspective and look for people, communities, and designers that draw you in and connect you.

text:Cristophe Loiron of Mister Freedom - Inspiration Album	labels:I love Mister Freedom and own a few pieces. I’m especially fond of his Campus leather jacket and Road Champ boots - which I don’t have yet.  The shirt I have doesn’t fit me great. It’s too trim for me, even in size 42/xl.   The pants, however, fit fantastic and thread the line quite well between straight and wide. They’re high waisted fatigues with a 9 inch opening in a camo pattern of his own design that’s reminiscent of frogskin/ duck hunter camo.   Lately, the new workwear repro Labour Union (which isn’t union made, despite the name) have straight up copied his Ranch Blouse design. Fuck them.

I put this together from my existing wardrobe, since we didn't want to spend a lot. Covid measures made things a bit weird, but the court officer made a real effort into making it nice, which was great.

text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:I moved back home earlier this year and as a result had a much reduced storage situation. I sorted my clothes into three categories,wear,don’t wear often (or at all) and doesn’t fit.  I donated the truly ill fitting items and my sister picked out some items she liked.  The last category I put in a drawer and wore each one throughout a month and noted what I was drawn to and what I liked especially the items I had purchased for ‘fantasy me’.   Mixing them with familiar clothing helped make them more accessible and actually a usable part of my wardrobe.   Essentially I now feel like I have a new wardrobe. Plus the notes I made meant I know what I actually like to wear more and therefore purchase in the future and what should definitely stay a fantasy item that I only like on IG or something.	episode_done:True

A good winter coat, better to invest more in something stylish and long lasting than to have several that are not great quality.

text:Fashion "fantasies" coming true years later?	labels:Male here (kind of important for this story).  Growing up I was always really jealous of female fashion, makeup and the ability to express yourself in your clothing (and it not coming down purely to details or fabric). I dabbled in the japanese rock scene back in HS, partly because I really liked the music, partly because it opened up a lot of opportunities for exploration. I didn't have the guts to go all the way though, but did some light makeup and had sort-of feminine haircuts.  Anyway, past HS this was all behind me, except in my art where I kept my aesthetic alive, though never consciously setting out to do so. I've since moved the canvas onto myself, so haven't picked up the pen much at all lately.   Fast forward 10 years or so, and I'm standing at a graduation ceremony. I work as a teacher, and I'm saying goodbye to my students, since summer break is about to come up. All teachers are lined up, and I look at my female colleagues and feel a real sting of jealousy. I'm standing there dressed in a shirt and pants while they're wearing lovely dresses, with earrings, makeup and bags.  I decided enough was enough, and went and bought nail polish the same day, and booked a time to pierce both my ears the day after. This all coincided with a long solo trip to Japan, where I bought a ton of makeup and really started to let lose. I also started (slowly) incorporating female cuts and items into my wardrobe, but every step needed quite a bit of courage, heck they still do. My comfort zone has blown wide open but anything beyond what I wear regularly gives some slight anxiety.  Then in 2020 I started posting here, getting feedback and help, and through constant cheering from colleagues, friends and students I finally feel like anxiety isn't keeping me away from expressing myself the way I want.  &#x200B;  So yeah, kind of a tangent, but that's my fashion fantasy coming true.

I feel pretty fortunate that I had a pretty good idea of what I liked and didn't like, but I think if you're still wanting to experiment then it may be best to stick with very specific investments. For example, I started just with shoes (I have strong preferences) and outerwear (I wanted to upgrade shapes/colors I already loved). That'll help build confidence in moving to other areas.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 23, 2020	labels:**I trust you. Please tell me exactly what to get, from bottom to top.**  I'm a 23 y.o. student at Zurich,  Switzerland.

(no accessories, no colors, outfits matching in color but  not style)  Whenever I try to work on this I get overwhelmed and my brain shuts down, so now I come to you.  I am 1m82, average build, unkempt hair that is a bit longer than average, slightly feminine facial features.  Stores  that I can afford in Zurich are: H&M, Jack & jones and others  in the same price range. Black Friday is coming so that might give some  flexibility.  I don't know what  style I exactly want, but I know that I don't want something too  "clean". I want something memorable, somehow cool, but not too much  either.

I still keep some boho influences and still pin recent outfits of theirs as inspiration.	episode_done:True
text:100% this.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:This style is surprisingly attainable for me after several years of hardcore minimalism. Once I got to a place where my basics are both on point and super pragmatic, then I have been able to incorporate a few Tibi and Tibi-like statement pieces into my rotation. I’m no longer a minimalist in terms of style - I like buying a couple “big impact” things every year to jazz up my clothes, especially oversized  or dramatic drape or “origami structure” on tops and coats. A single piece really changes an outfit and you don’t need many pieces in rotation to suddenly change your style. Amy Smilovic appears to do a similar thing - keep several things “basic” (neutral color, solid/no pattern, uniform texture, unadorned (no bling or fringes etc) and the play with one thing (her thing seems to be oversized fit and pleats).  The only reason I bring up minimalism is because I cannot emphasize more how much the basics being “just right” makes my dramatic pieces work. Especially with oversized, it’s a thin line between slob and stylish. Those big pleated dad pants Amy Smilovic wears? The rest of the outfit should be sharp or you look like you simply don’t know how clothes should fit. Not everyone needs to first develop an “unfashionable” base before reaching for both fashionable and pragmatic, but I did.   As for Tibi, I know them most for silks and for their origami shapes. GoSilk is a great option for patterned silk and Roksanda has the shapes. Ganni and Comme Les Garcons has some of the quirkinesses and oversized looks. But none of them are cheap either unless you score a good sale. If you can identify exactly what you like about Tibi, we can make more recommendations.
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:I get almost everything other than lounge clothes tailored. Size number means absolutely nothing anymore. Buy clothes that fit the widest part of your body, and have them taken in to fit the rest (it’s harder to let out than take in). Some of my dresses are 6s, and some are 0s, so size is literally just a made up concept for women. This definitely gets expensive, but I add the cost of tailoring to the cost of the thing I know I’ll need tailored.   So like, if I see a skirt I really want, but I’ll need the waist taken in, I know that my tailor streamlines waistbands with a zipper for 30 bucks. 35 if there’s a lining. That turns a $50 skirt into an $80 skirt. Do I really want to spend $80 on a skirt?? Maybe. If I do, I’ll buy it. If not, I put it back. It ends up saving me money because I buy less impulse trendy purchases.   Find a good tailor by testing them on cheap pieces and building a reputation. Eventually, you’ll know exactly how much they charge for each fabric/type of alteration and it helps with keeping prices in mind while shopping. A good tailor will have no problem at all with silks or satins. You may have to burn through a few and have them ruin some clothes before you find your soulmate, but it’s totally worth it! I recently broke up with my tailor and I’m still heartbroken about it..

text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:I used to wear black jeans daily for work for about 8 years. A lot of that time I was broke af and spending $35 every 6 months or so on jeans was a really big purchase. I’d usually only have 1-2 pairs of work jeans at a time and wore them every day for 8-12 hours. When they ripped in the thighs I would hand sew them together very very poorly lol. I don’t know why I never looked up a tutorial or anything but the sewing would usually buy me 3-4 days until I could buy new ones.   Now that I’m more financially stable and I don’t have to wear black jeans to work, my pants tend to last a lot longer. When they wear out in the thighs/crotch I just toss them now. I no longer have to save jeans just in case I can’t fix the next pair and it’s very freeing.	episode_done:True
text:Store closings at malls	labels:This has put a real damper on my online shopping too. I really miss shopping in person to try things on. I also only go to physical stores to return but now I realize if only I can try everything on (meaning stores actually have inventory and all sizes) I wouldn’t have to rely on the internet and returning when they don’t quite fit. Honestly all physical stores should have all sizes for fit try-on purposes but they don’t 🤷🏻‍♀️
text:How do you challenge yourself?	labels:I branch out when I watch a new TV show and I really like the main character's style. I will buy one or two things that are really 'them'.  But then I always end up not feeling like myself. So I'll either immediately return those things, or I'll wear them a lot for three months and suddenly snap out of it one morning, like, 'what was I thinking?' and push them to the back of my closet.  So now, when I have that itch, I just add everything to my shopping cart and then close the tab and go to bed.	episode_done:True

text:Fall Fit Battle - Final Four - Discussion	labels:**NgoKnows** vs Chunsak. I'm a little bit let down by Chunsak's colour palette, whereas Ngo rocks it in this department. I'm also giving points to Ngo for the better trousers-to-footwear transition. Notably, both did a cheeky thing with showing a little bit of a white sock, but this too is nicer in Ngo's fit. Clear winner for me.  8888plasma vs **Rariora**. I'm a little bit let down by both fits (but I am coming into this with extremely high expectations). Rariora feels like a rehash of last week (and last week was a better execution of this concept, maybe). plasma is committing to "very cool textures", but aside from this nothing about the silhouette or palette or other French fashion words excites me here. Besides the cool texture clash, I don't think that sweater and trousers work particularly well (tho the belt is cool).

text:What are your tips for being stylish when your weight fluctuates like crazy?	labels:Wrap dresses and wrap skirts tend to be flexible with size fluctuations. I don’t know if the same wrap skirt can take you from a size 4 to 14 but they’ll fit longer than other styles do.
text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:I think it doesn’t make a lot of sense to think of resale value for an object that gets worn and is subject to a lot of wear and tear with usage. How would you feel if you stain or rip or stretch out some garment you plan to resell later? It doesn’t make a lot of sense to me!  But the clothes you like and wear them. When you no longer like them or they not longer fit, pick a sustainable way to dispose of it then.	episode_done:True

text:I haven’t shopped at Lululemon in years (seriously, probably 8 yrs) & I always loved the brand, but fell off the athleisure train.  I went online to order a pair of high rise, plain black, full length leggings hopefully slimming & the product ratings were just so bad that it surprised me and deterred me!  Do you have a specific style that you recommend?!	labels:Honestly, I think lululemon reviews skew negative bc sale styles/colors are non-returnable - unless you can convince them that there was a quality defect with the pair you received. And the easiest way to get CS to initiate a quality return/exchange seems to be leaving a negative review...   Personally I love align leggings for everyday (knowing that they will eventually pill... but for me at least, usu more like a year or two in), fast & frees for lightweight running/spin (pockets!!!) and wunder unders or wunder trains for more of a sleek compressive feel (probably the best at achieving the slimming look you’re going for?). Hope that helps!	episode_done:True

text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:My local Goodwill, is... adequate.  I've found some decent things, there but nothing amazing; it's overshopped, but one could find good things if one went regularly. There's a spot on the far side of town that's a great for, like, furniture and winter coats, but I don't hit it often.  We had a Salvation Army but it was, like all the other Salvation Armies in the area, incredibly terrible and I'm not sad it's gone.  The best spot in my town is the Hospital Thrift store.  It gives serious 'little old lady' vibes, but also consistently has very wearable, quality items as well as cool, funky stuff that's nice to look at.  Bonus is that it's tiny  (Covfefe restrictions have pushed the store limit to 10,) so digging around doesn't take long and is well worth the effort.	episode_done:True
text:This so much!  I love getting compliments, and it's easier to complement "fun" things. If I show up in a blue dress with little birds on it, It will get compliments.   A much more stylish blouse and pants with killer heels? It will look great, but no one compliment the perfect black pants.  At home with a dark office and shitty camera, I wear knitted joggers and cardigans with tight tops, like heattech. I'm really happy about trading most sweatpants for knitted versions, even though it's mostly synthetics. I find my legs are sensitive to wool.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:The joy of cordovan—and how to wear and maintain it	labels:Cordovan is an Instagram dream - it’s lustrous and has a ton of color depth. Unfortunately I find  actually wearing it is a different story. It’s extremely stiff and inflexible, especially during the first 20-30 wears. It’s the coldest leather I’ve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I’ve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I’m glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there’s no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 18, 2020	labels:i’m a guy and i love cardigans, both low key ones like the thom browne ones and also loud ones like the advisey sunflowers one and the golf landscape one. But as far as i’ve seen it irl and in social media, most men don’t tend to rock it as much. Why is that? Because they’re feminine? Or is there some other reason i’m not aware of? I also feel like cardigans will start trending and become mainstream in the next year. Do you guys agree?
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:In high school I wanted to be as punk rock as I could be. I spiked my hair up, DIY-ed everything, and bought my first pair of Doc Martens at 14. I either worked at Hot Topic or a body piercing studio through school. I grew up in an affluent/conservative area so my goal was to be as weird to everyone as possible. Music was my main influence.  In college my style changed a lot since I went to school for fashion. I moved to LA where I didn't feel like I had to rebel against anyone anymore. I started incorporating other musical influences like goth, new wave, and grunge into my style. I started appreciating higher quality designer clothing but had zero money. While I really wanted to shop at places like Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen, and AllSaints, I ended up just wearing all black all the time and trying to get those looks for less.  Now I'm in my mid 20s, moved out of California, started my career, and finally have some expendable income. I'm really influenced by 60s/70s rock n roll. I try and buy all high quality pieces that I'm obsessed with so I don't feel like I'm always having to shop.  I do still have and wear my original Doc Martens though	episode_done:True
text:What is your favorite under-the-radar leather handbags / brand?	labels:Matt & Nat! They're not leather specifically (they're vegan - made from recycled water bottles I believe?

text:I feel the same way, I'm bewildered at so many people finding ALL pants uncomfortable.   The only thing I can think of is that they're either wearing the wrong style (I vastly prefer super high rise. midrise and lowrise cut me across the stomach in an uncomfortable way, unless they're a size too big), the wrong size (too small jeans WILL be terrible, especially 100% cotton), or they have sensory or digestive issues/stomach sensitivity.	labels:SQUEEGEE!!! -Tookie Clothespin	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:My mother. Growing up I idolized her style and would always take her saris and lipsticks. It has always been something we have bonded over. When I became 6 I think that was the time she stopped wearing the sari full time and only for special occasions. I wish she  would dress up again but she says it' would take far too long to drape the fabric.   From a young age both my parents instilled into me that a good outer appearance is very important, for ones self esteem but also for how others viewed us.	episode_done:True
text:Can You Wear a T-Shirt Under a Blazer and Not Look Like an 1980s Leftover?	labels:It's got to be a very casual jacket, with a tee that does not look like underwear. Way back when a suit or jacket is part of normal daily wear, people wear them over anything- think tweed work jackets over thick crew neck sweaters, with or without neckerchief. Tailoring used to be much more free-form compared to the generally more prescriptive "worsted-wool sharp businessman look" nowadays. Crew neck sweaters are basically the OG t-shirts, and easier to wear on its own since plain t-shirts were originally underwear and not meant to be seen.	episode_done:True

text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:In my experience it varies greatly on the family of the deceased and what they want. Most funerals I’ve been to have specifically stated a dress code required. Most of my wife’s family generally has a “dress like you’re going to a party” kinda vibe.  I usually split the difference if I’m unsure and just wear a grey suit 🤷‍♀️	episode_done:True
text:The Very Useful Black Sweater	labels:>And black leathers don’t acquire the  patina that makes a pair of well-polished, well-worn brown leather  shoes so handsome. In fact, giving up square-toed black shoes in favor  of more anatomically correct brown ones became something of a rite of  passage for well-dressed men.   This is quite a reach. But then again it does feel quite reminiscent of nearly MFA where brown red wings were the best choice a man could make.
text:Fellow clothing trackers, what coveted items are you tracking now?	labels:Tory Burch came out with this colorful green and blue beetle pattern years ago.

Nothing too flashy, but the Woolrich collection goes so hard. Also have to say, as much as I love some of Howlin' designs,  compared to the ALDxWoolrich stuff,  Howlin' quality is just not there. Surprised at how itchy the wool is. My gf got them as a full price Christmas gift though so can never say that out loud lmao.

I doubt every fifth post in the Funko Pop subreddit is about curbing consumption and how they should be rethinking their involvement in a plastics based interest.   Personally, I think they're wasteful as shit, but I'm not about to roll up into their space and shame them for it.

text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:<rant>  If I said "Wear cropped jackets so you look taller" I'd be laughed out of the room but somehow "Short people shouldn't wear long coats" is a valid thing?   Also what's defined as short? If someone is 5'7" do they get to wear long coats? What if they're 5'7.5"??  It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering". If you care so much about these gender norms, masculinity and being ~ flattering ~ then sack up and wear the clothes you like.   That whole thread is just people saying that someone else told them they couldn't *wear a coat* so what should they do? Oh idk. How about tell them to fuck off and wear the damn coat.  </rant>

text:The Style Blogger Index: finding people who are the same size as you	labels:Oh my gosh I'm so happy to see this here! I created this because of FFA! I hope you enjoy it ❤️  P.S. just a note that the size twin app is going to be updated in the next week or so -- it's very out of date. If you follow me on IG that's the easiest way to hear about updates, but I can edit this comment when it's refreshed, too!   **(11/30 update if anybody is still reading -- the app is updated!)**  Edit: since so many of you are finding the tool mostly useless, I just wanted to say that the goal was to create something that would help you find fashion inspo from people who are more similar in size to you than a fashion model in a magazine.  Of course it's impossible to get an exact body double from just 3 measurements, but that's what the standard is, and that's what I could reasonably expect the average person to know about themselves. I have to make sure that the barrier to entry is very low. The more people can join this index, the more useful it is. Please remember that I offer this tool completely for free, that I don't work in the fashion industry, and that I don't have any background in the industry (fashion, data, or web design). I just wanted to do something helpful for the community. I will try my best to make as many improvements as I can over time, but I have very limited resources, and maintaining it is quite a lot of effort as is. Sorry, all!

The main problem you'll see is not people telling you you look *bad*, but you being overdressed or underdressed for most occasions. You need a very particular occasion, and you can't just be the bow tie guy in your office and move to this, you need a certain amount of... Street cred? A certain amount of pre-accepted cool to see your friends, do this, and have their first instinct *not* be to make fun of you, but too recognize the cool aspects.	labels:Fair enough.  Fashion for fashion people, I suppose (and I don't mean that in a bad way).

text:Thoughts then and now?	labels:Love that old post. Thanks for linking!   To me, it’s not as much about dressing up or down as it is about design. I have seen a lot of articles about the heightened attitudes towards “design,” which is a pretty general term, but to me it starts with the era where Apple was being criticized for hiring more designers than engineers. In my opinion, a LOT of products could use more/better designers, including fashion.   Maybe it’s the “hard times” mentality of my generation (millennial), buy the fundamental question of design (full disclosure, I do not work in design) is “What is the problem I’m solving?” In my opinion, a lot of clothing fails to meet the basic expectations of utility. See, for example, my impossible quest to find summer dresses appropriate for Texas heat!   I hope that the dressing up/down discussions we are having will lead us towards clothes that are better designed for the realities of our lives.
text:What are your most loved ride-or-die winter clothing items?	labels:my Sorels. I’m a Texas transplant to an actual winter and they both keep me from breaking my neck on ice (my inability to walk on ice is an ongoing joke) and I can tramp through about any slush puddle and still have toasty toes.

text:General Discussion - January 04, 2021	labels:I’ve had terrible luck with dating since I left college and moved to a new city a few hours away. Even in college I was mostly focused on work and classes.  On New Year’s Day I went out on a date with a girl I met on a dating app and she seems wonderful, and she really likes me. I almost feel like 2021 is teasing me, so I’m trying really hard to let go and just have fun.
text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:I feel like Abercrombie and Fitch has turned around! I love all the dresses I've bought from them - almost all have been lined and a lot of them have pockets! I'm so pleased.
text:How to Combat Fashion Apathy?	labels:I get like this from time to time and I actually think it’s from overstimulation. Too many influencers and brands and blogs and trends and fashion weeks.

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I have what would pretty loosely be defined as a capsule wardrobe -- everything is in a limited palate, and goes together. I love it, and don't plan on switching any time soon -- but I don't super-strictly limit the number of pieces I have either, which gets me out of the "Ugh, I hate all of this and I'm sick of it!" rut. While I've got a lot of strong investment-piece basics, there's a generous sprinkling of new (well, new-used) stuff coming in and out often enough that I don't get bored. Also, I don't stick just to neutrals; two of my four colors are green and purple.   I love that setting limits on myself has curbed my shopping addiction. I love that I'm pushed to be creative with what I have and think more carefully about how what I buy goes with what I have. I feel like I'm being true-er to my aesthetic because I'm not letting my head get turned by clothing that is objectively completely gorgeous but isn't for me for style/color/age reasons. And I love feeling put-together more often than I did when I didn't have limits.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 14, 2020	labels:Does anyone have any brand recommendations for sweatpants/joggers that you can wear to work? I'm looking for something in black with cuffed ankles and a drawstring since I don't have something like that in my wardrobe yet. I'd prefer if it was <$100 CAD but I do know that you pay for quality in clothes and might not mind something a little pricier.

text:I'm really struggling because I find clothing at stores are getting more cheaply made, like tshirts with the seams all twisted after one wash. Some of the ethical brands don't really have the style or colours I like. I'm also hesitant about ordering online because I cannot look at the seams or test out the clothes. I live in Canada so I have a lot less options.	labels:I’m also in Canada and I have ordered from Uniqlo before. Shipping and returns are very easy and the fibers are identified on their website. Their cotton t-shirts are well constructed especially for the price point.  On Nordstrom’s website you can sometimes filter by fabric type which is useful. They also have some of the “better” brands like Eileen Fisher. I haven’t shopped online there, however.  I really notice fabric texture and I can’t stand to wear any scratchy fabric like polyester or mohair, or have tags on my clothes - it’s too “itchy”. My main priority when shopping is finding fabric I can deal with. I also don’t want poorly made clothes so I skip most of the fast fashion in Canada. (Aritzia, Club Monaco, J Crew, RW&Co, Zara, H&M, all the GAP family brands, the stuff at Winners, all the other mall stores... they aren’t worth the energy to sift through in my opinion.)	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Beauty is Pain	labels:I squeeze myself into the stiffest raw denim there is. I’ve heard of these things called leggings or stretch pants, but the idea that pants could provide a modicum of comfort means they must be entirely unfashionable. I avoid them. Instead, I adorn my lower half with the most unyielding, unforgiving denim they make. I don’t “break it in” or other such nonsense as that could potentially soften my rigid mom jeans into pants that I don’t grimace while wearing. If your bottoms aren’t leaving crease marks on your hips and thighs, then I don’t think they even count as pants.	episode_done:True
text:What is something you've heard as fashion advice that isn't worth following?	labels:I guess no white after labor day? I still hear that a lot, which is nonsense. I love wearing white and will continue to wear it whenever I want.
text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I think the size of your wardrobe is going to depend on your climate, job, hobbies, and general lifestyle. I have a lot more clothing than that. I also live in a place with four seasons. I have outdoorsy hobbies that require some tougher clothes. I can‘t wear my casual clothing to work (and I’m also holding onto some more professional clothing from a past job in case I return to that field). I don’t have a lot of disposable income either, so I always keep things like dress pants even though I never wear them in my everyday, because I can’t afford to go shopping when interviews and funerals come up.  For instance, I probably have at least 15 dresses alone, once you count all the strappy sundresses, nice work dresses, wool sweater dresses, the cocktail dresses, and the evening gown that’s in the back of my closet - and everything in between.  I swap out my clothing with the seasons and have one closet that I share with my husband, so I try to be judicious about what I keep, while giving myself grace that I don’t need to get rid of something just because I don’t wear it regularly.

text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:It’s less about the value of the item and more about the stars aligning perfectly.  I wear a size 12-13W shoe, plus other things that make my feet really hard to fit, so I am used to buying formalwear to match the one maybe two pairs of formal shoes I own at any given time.  So when I was 17 and going to prom in 2006, my mom tried really hard to help me find shoes, any shoes, that were suitable. But we could only find casual flats or runners, and I realllly wanted to dress up nicely for the first real time in my life. So she said “you know what, let’s buy a dress and then we will just have to find a way.”  So I picked out a black and pale pink dress that just made me swoon, and I figured black heels would be easiest to find. Lol I was so young and stupid.  Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn’t find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I’d just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.
text:How to build an age-suitable varied chic wardrobe?	labels:I dressed “older” when I was your age, but no one thought I was older because I still looked and seemed like a kid! Your face gives it away. :)  Now is a good time to experiment with fashion and figure out what you want. It is ok to make mistakes, and change your mind. Your style and body could change as you get older so no need to focus on “timeless classics.” You have plenty of time for that.   The current trends for people your age feel so much like what it was when I was your age. There are always people who skip the street wear part! You don’t have to do if you don’t like it. Keep playing with the things you are drawn to.	episode_done:True

For me, my college program is extremely small (less than 16 people) and given the context of the course, they’re allowing us to go in for face-to-face instruction. I’m hoping that maybe I could exude more style during my limited time out then, but it may not be realistic given the circumstances :)	labels:Well, you can always do your research on what you want to buy, and have your list when you can go and shop!  You can still try and buy things that you know they will fit. Dresses and tops are usually fine, but I wouldn't go for pants or jeans without trying them on because my body is stupid-shaped.   Or you can shop from places you know your size, whatever works for you best.   Just don't try to change your whole wardrobe without trying things on is all I'm saying haha
text:BoF: J. Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:i just feel like their price points are so high and the quality can be kind of mediocre. they’re stuck in a weird place where their pricing is too expensive for the average consumer who’s trained to expect bargains and too cheap for someone who buys luxury or higher end pieces.   even with their random extra 50% off sales, it’s still above what people expect to pay. but then again, madewell is thriving.

text:Trying to get into jewelry	labels:I did the same thing last year, and started with earrings as well. I just browsed Madewell because I am a big Madewell fan and have shopped there for a longtime — they have cute jewelry with most pieces falling on the lower-to-mid price range. I also looked at their ‘Labels We Love’ — which are smaller brands that have a similar aesthetic. And I ended up purchasing some stuff from the labels Tribe Alive and Year 901. So I definitely recommend starting with brands you are familiar with! Etsy is also pretty awesome, and has a large selection of jewelry. I bought a pair of medium clear lucite hoops (which are super versatile) from Leetie.

text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I don't have a prescribed budget that I stick to, but I try my best to ensure I max out my generous 401k match and other accounts provided from my employer. I have a certain amount I keep stashed away as an emergency fund if I can't work for several months, some for paranoia from being raised lower-income and some for the fact that I live in a HCOL area. Other than that, I am super flexible with how I spend my money, which is ~dangerous~. Luckily, fashion and food are my only pricey hobbies. I'm really privileged to be in this position with a rewarding job and understand that this is not the norm for many.  I got a substantial promotion and raise this last summer, so I definitely have been overspending this year as I try to ramp my wardrobe back to my ideal self, rather than my more practical self; I was also purchasing a limited number of pieces since I was in a client-facing role making half as much. I moved from buying clothes on the more affordable spectrum (mainly pre-scandal Everlane, and KOTN) to buying pricier pieces, usually in the pre-owned designer spectrum (mainly bags, shoes, and outerwear ranging from $200-$3000). I'm finally scaling back by having a curated wishlist and aiming to resell any unused pieces (easier said than done).	episode_done:True

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:It sounds like you're having trouble staying motivated so maybe you need to remember why you wanted to change your habits in the first place - you mentioned that you wanted to reinvent yourself.  For me, it took years and it's an ongoing process to change the way I think/buy, as well as to save up ad afford the nicer things I wanted. I would say that some main factors for me to change were that I became dissatisfied with the quality I saw (once you learn to sew, you can't unsee it), and I had a friend who was starting to buy nicer things. She made more money than I did, so it took more effort for me when I wanted to buy some, too.  I had to learn to do my research - follow the brands/makers, see what sales and discounts they offered, if any. It might take a season or easily longer to learn about their habits before I made my move. I also had to learn about when to just buy something full-price - if I thought I would be so disappointed to miss out, I'd consider buying the piece sooner. I wear a XS-S most of the time, so these sizes tend to sell out faster. Most of the time though, I had to learn to be patient, be honest with my style/needs, and shop smarter.	episode_done:True

Is it maybe just this particular suit? I’ve ordered two but am awaiting the other.	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:I love loose shapes, but particularly the ones that are a little rigid and architectural, rather than something that hangs. I think it’s nice to wear something where the garment is the focus, not the body underneath it.   For example, I have a boiled wool cape/poncho piece I wear a lot because it is SQUARE and the neck is a stiff funnel and the sleevey parts stick out at an angle from my arms and that is what you see when you look at it, this interesting shape. It’s impossible to tell what my body looks like at all and I find that comfortable and kind of freeing.   I also love wide-leg pants for the same reason. People see the shape of the pants, not the shape of my thighs and butt.   I have a pretty average-looking body and I just have never enjoyed people noticing it (and frankly, I don’t think it’s very interesting, nor do I feel more attractive when it’s clearly visible.) I just don’t really  *care* if people think my waist isn’t small enough or my butt isn’t big enough or whatever. Especially if I think the piece of clothing I’m wearing is interesting even though it hides my boobs etc. I kind of prefer people to compliment my outfit over how I look in the outfit, idk.

I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

And to add to that, fashion for the red pill women isn't about personality, individuality or art or anything avant-garde, it's about looking "hot" as defined by society at large (aka men). The Kibbe system gives a sense of right/good/attractive vs wrong/bad/ugly in fashion.

text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I've written about this before, but as someone who is 5'2 on a good day, I have stopped giving a shit about looking "longer and leaner."  In fact, I reject the idea that I should want to look taller. Maybe all those 5'7 women should be taking advice on how to make their legs look as stubby as mine. <--Obviously a joke but to make a point. How stupid is it that I should feel like my natural body is something to correct?  I'm an old woman, lol, and over the course of my life I have never found that my stubby legs (that I was once self-conscious about) have kept me from career advancement or from finding people who thought I was beautiful and wanted to have sex with me, so what's the freaking problem?  Fuck conventional figure flattery.  That being said, of course there are things I think look better on me than other things and I tend to wear the things I think look better in ways I think look better most of the time.  Except when the comfort or beauty of a garment is so outstanding it overrules that.  Thanks for coming to my TED talk.  There are cookies on the table in the back.

Or do I just have to wear them a lot to fit into them?	episode_done:True

text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism? I love it, but how do you do it?	labels:I wouldn't call myself a maximalist, but style theory is similar to any other artistic theory. When choosing how to combine pieces, always take into account the color, lines, patterns, and textures. From here, the aesthetic is completely up to the individual. For example, a maximalist may work within a certain color pallette and then intentionally incorporate a clashing accent. Pattern mixing might seem random, but the person may have taken into account the contrast between sharp lines and abstract patters. So I guess my answer is somewhere in the middle. It always takes A LOT of effort to make something look effortless. However once there are certain boundaries, it can feel effortless to put colors, patterns, and silhouettes together that make sense to the individual and are theoretically pleasing to the eye.

text:Fashion "fantasies" coming true years later?	labels:A little bit different, but I remember as a kid being like "man, wish I had the confidence to wear belly shirts, they look so cool" or whatever we called them back in the 00s, and now that they're being styled with high waisted pants and skirts it's like, the best of both worlds, in that I don't have to have my full stomach out and it's way cuter this way anyways. AND the nigh waisted/crop solved the issue I had with clothes and my wide hips: low-rise pants would slide down and shirts would always ride up unless they were loose enough, so I would have to CONSTANTLY adjust.  And on the reverse note, any shirt I have that isn't cropped gets tucked in, which is funny considering how ridiculous it always seemed to me to tuck in shirts back then too.	episode_done:True

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.
text:Naked and Famous Raw Denim Review/Fit/Experience	labels:I’m a personal stylist who focuses JUST on women’s jeans and in all my years of experience I’ve only put raw denim on 2 of my clients for this exact reason. It’s too difficult to really nail the fit.... and if you do, there’s a good chance it’ll change as the jeans settle out or if your body changes. Plus, cutting around curves is super tough.   Raw denim is awesome in theory. It ages with you and confirms to your body. And the look of it over time is so cool. But I’ve almost never seen it work with women, especially in skinnier cuts. There’s just no give.   I would otherwise recommend vintage Levi’s or 100% cotton premium denim in a heartier weight for a more structured jean. The difference it that it’s been rinsed/washed so the fit is more predictable and longer lasting than raw denim.
text:You raise good points, but I’m going to respectfully disagree - I don’t think there’s ever any valid excuse to buy from a company who openly profits from exploitative third world labour. We can all do better.   Sustainable fashion is expensive, yes. But *usually* buying quality clothing is cheaper in the long run than buying lots of cheap stuff (I know this is easier said than done for people living hand to mouth).   Secondly there are options that don’t exploit people. Namely second hand shops and Depop. I guarantee - no matter what the item is - someone’s already bought it or something VERY similar and wants to get rid of it. Even when I have money I buy from there because... why wouldn’t you?   The “what about poor people” argument always gets made but it just doesn’t sit right with me. What about the people who are being paid 40p a day in sweltering and unsafe Bangladeshi factories? Factories that are dumping toxic dyes into water sources? We all have a responsibility not to perpetuate the monolithic success of these horrible fast fashion conglomerates.	labels:Regarding the poor people argument, what finally resonated with me is that looking at the profits for these fast fashion empires like shein is that poor people simply do not have the purchasing power to be responsible for those types of profits. Fast fashion businesses are profitable because, overwhelmingly, not poor people buy from them, and they buy a lot of items from them. I first heard the argument from a fashion activist called Aja Barber and it really got through to me that my support of fast fashion was a choice even at the times in my life where I struggled financially. Poor people are not responsible for fast fashion even when they buy it. Aja has a fantastic Instagram and Twitter if you are interested in the topic!

text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:First off congrats on not moping around and leveraging 2020 in a positive way.  Your style will keep evolving but a few suggestions from having made this journey.  1.  Get your workwear wired.  Not sure of your dress code but if you are biz cas go basic bastard and pick up some cheap j crew type of stuff.  Not to much but enjoy some 484s, you've earned it.  This will tide you over professionally.   2.  Start exploring. The best way to do this is look a lot of places for inspo but keep your lens wide.  It's a wide world out there.  3.  Start picking up a few pieces here or there.  Vintage and thrifting are your friends.  Try different things.  Some will stick, some won't.  But by getting it cheap you can experiment at a discount.  4.  Think about how you can accessorize and leverage what you have.  Simple things can raise your level (but don't do them all at once).  Throw on a cardi or blazer over your biz cas.  Buy a pocket square or two.  Switch the laces in your shoes.  Have fun and congrats.	episode_done:True
text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:Impulse buying is a lot like impulse eating... it's hard to manage because you have to do it, you literally can't stop altogether.

text:The White Issue: Has Anna Wintour’s Diversity Push Come Too Late?	labels:> Black editors who have worked with Ms. Wintour said they saw her apology as hypocritical, part of a calculated play by an executive known for her ability to gauge the public mood.   It's a token gesture meant to appease without actually showing any penance or apologetic lessons learned. Though it is at least something.  > From Manhattan to Hollywood and beyond, she has helped set a standard that has favored white, Eurocentric notions of beauty.  This was not fun to grow up with as an Asian-American. Heavy emphasis on western ideals of beauty, even on Asian models and stars. It's strange to look in the mirror and feel like you don't even look like the public figures of your own race. Worse when you consider how hesitant Hollywood still is in casting Asian male stars; they still tend to heavily lean upon mixed-race actors (nothing against them; it's just sad to have few Asian male figures that aren't typecast in the usual roles).	episode_done:True

It’s always only the one, but I’m not sure they’re different entities or it’s the same one with an infinite number of variants.

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "How to Determine Your Body Type" and "On Dressing Your Body Type"	labels:There is a ton of great info in these, though I think what I found most interesting was the section in Body Type about other measurements and proportions, because it offered a clearer explanation of why you might measure as one type and not look it.  Both guides still felt outdated, not only because of the fashion examples, but because the popular silhouette has shifted more in favor of a dramatic hourglass/pear and there more leeway in what’s considered flattering in general.  There already seems to be a lot of (understandable) dislike towards typing systems, so I could see it being beneficial to **start off** with reframing, i.e. “having an understanding of your body shape/silhouette allows you to present it in the way that you feel is most flattering”, and then moving into an explanation of the types (instead of getting right into it/breaking down all the problems before trying to convince you it’s still useful,) the shapes/silhouettes, and how to attain them. Personally, I’d love it if you could go “my body is shaped more like this type, doing xyz would help me look more like that type.” and a mention of each type being more easily read as masculine/feminine/androgynous, though it’d have to be handled delicately;  I just think it’d be helpful for people trying to present themselves more in those ways.	episode_done:True

text:What is your favorite clothing/accessories subscription box?	labels:Is your main goal of using a subscription service to save time shopping or because you need help with picking the clothes?  For me it would be to save time shopping because I love picking my own clothes, but I have always felt that the inventory with the subscription services is too narrow.  Another reason I have shied away from subscription services like Stitch Fix is trust.  I don't trust that they aren't sending the inventory they are trying to get rid of before they bring new inventory in.  I like to use a platform where people save their favorites and I can shop from what they have saved!

text:Yearly Aesthetic Goal Setting	labels:Great goals!  My goal for last year was to experiment with makeup, far outside my comfort zone. I normally cheat and just do "Floki eyes" when i go out dancing, but last year i did some lightning inspired crackles, a tree-like crackle (similar to the lightning so that was also kind of cheating), a circuit board motif across half my face, and a couple of different heavily Viking looks with bindrunes.  I will continue to try new things (i have one based on the lead dancer in the Suspiria remake on deck) as soon as we're allowed to go out dancing again.  Until then, my low key goal is to continue working my way through my mending box, and to take the logos off my favorite tshirts that are falling apart, and transfer them to either new tshirts or tanks, or if they are small enough to bowling style collared shirts/guyaberas.  Most of my tshirts are from charity or small business fundraisers, such as Pride or a local band, so i want to keep the memories alive even after the fabric decides to give up the ghost.	episode_done:True

text:What’s your everyday purse?	labels:I don't really have an every day purse as I like to switch purses depending on what I need for the day, what I'm doing, and also to add an additional stylish element to my outfits.   I really like clutches (think Clare V size and shape- preferably with a wrist strap) and have collected probably 30 of them over the years in a variety of colors, textures, patterns. Very simple way to add a touch of something to an outfit. They also travel easily as they essentially pack flat, so you can bring several and use them to change up your simple travel outfits.   But if I'm shopping or doing something where I need to be hands-free, then it's a cross body. I have a few of these but my most often used is the Lo&Sons Waverly. I do like this brand and also have their laptop bag with the interchangeable sleeves. I just noticed they have a new fanny pack style... hmmmmm... gotta check that out! My other favorite cross body, which is a bit more spacious and dressier and can act as a satchel, I think is a Coach but you wouldn't know it (I hate obvious branding).  If I need room for more stuff then I've got a choice between a white leather backpack and a black leather backpack.   I don't really like totes, shoulder bags, or satchels any more. There was a time when I had a lot of those, but these days I prefer a bag that's smaller and not too heavy to carry. Got tired of having shoulder pain or wrist pain, but I'm a grumpy old middle aged woman. Rock it while you can.	episode_done:True

text:Rugby Union is a middle and upper class sport associated with fee paying schools in England (and Scotland to some extent).  The working class version is Rugby League. There was a schism in the late 1800s over the payment of wages to players and the dominance of London and the South East of England in the RFU. The working class sport went in an entirely different direction.   Union is the prominent version in culture, and the big money one too and a lot of English support and players still come from the wealthy South East and private fee paying schools.  Slightly different in Wales where we kept playing Union, and it's essentially our national sport and very working class but we're an outlier in the UK on that.  Of course, Ireland (and Ulster) is even more complicated because of, well, the sectarian thing.  But rugby shirts tend to get seen heavily around the big Spring and Autumn tournaments and worn by a very particular kind of English man (and Scotsman, Welshman etc), that is both a class thing and also a kind of macho laddish thing. Here in Wales rugby culture is heavy drinking, men down the club thing and not exactly friendly to women, LGBT etc.  There's also the national thing, Wales' single greatest sporting achievement in my lifetime in popular culture probably isn't winning the Tour de France or making it really far in euro 2016. It's knocking England out of the rugby world cup they were hosting at their home stadium. We all love to hate England rugby fans too. The England rugby team represent a lot of what the Welsh resent about England for lots of reasons.  When we were in Japan for the World Cup last year I thought my wife was going to tear apart the loud England fan who was supporting Fiji over us three seats away.	labels:That makes sense. My father-in-law is really into rugby, in all forms, and has all the obscure sports packages for TV to be able to record basically every single match on earth. He very well might have been on the US national team in his 20s... but tryouts were on his wedding day. Ended up being the club team advisor for about a decade at the university he taught at instead.  He's never brought up this stuff at all.

text:100% on privilege. Over the past few years, I’ve slowly transitioned much of my wardrobe to natural fiber clothing (with the exception of athletic wear - but now there’s recycled options at least!). And I know it’s a privilege to do so, now that I’m further in my career. A $300 slow fashion, locally produced w/ fair wage, pasture raised wool sweater simply isn’t accessible for most. And even secondhand, it’s not cheap by any means. This is why as problematic as Everlane is as a brand, I won’t judge someone for buying a much more affordable wool cardigan there instead of from babaa, if it better fits their financial needs.  However, trends are for sure more physically accessible now than before with e-commerce and social media, for better or for worse. It’s interesting - I’m in my early 30s, so our generation was in jr high / high school just as e-commerce was starting. We were one of the first Facebook user cohorts. I grew up in a sleepy suburb that was ~2 hours from a large city. We had an OK mall, Macy’s was our fanciest department store. Whenever a girl wore something from Nordstrom’s, everyone oohed and ahhed because not only was it more expensive, but you had to be fairly privileged to travel to the city to go shopping.   I still remember our family visiting my older brother in another major city, and he took me to an Urban Outfitters store for the first time. I thought all the clothes were _so cool_ and how awesome that the people had local access to that store?? And now it’s both visually and ‘physically’ accessible through the internets (with their problems as well). In that sense, I do think it’s great - but the trade-off is the exacerbation of fast fashion with trends cycling through and consumed at lightning speed.	labels:I lived in South Carolina in high school.

text:I think this is an excellent example of when I think overdressing is rude.  How you dress communicates things. If you show up to a situation where messy and/or physical activities are planned and you're not dressed appropriately, you're essentially communicating distain for the planned activities. It's a non-verbal declaration of "you all go ahead and get dirty, I'll just watch."   If you're too good for picking up trash, why did you come to the trash cleanup day? If you knew you weren't going to participate in our frisbee game, why did you come to the frisbee party? Why did you come camping if you aren't prepared to let any part of you touch dirt - are you expecting everyone else to do extra work to make your camping experience squeaky clean? The only way to avoid that message is to dive right in and ruin your nice clothes.	labels:Well said, this is really the core of it.  I'd also add that being overdressed (or underdressed) to an event with a dress code can also show disrespect for the host who chose the dress code.  For instance, being noticeably overdressed for a wedding could indicate that you think it's improper for someone to have a wedding that casual.

text:Dashiel Brahmann Fall/Winter 2020	labels:!mfaimagebot 8   I wonder if you're supposed to leave the pant hems like that. They're clearly purposefully cropped and the stitch looks more like a Margiela-type decorative basting stitch you're supposed to leave on, but then the hems are super deep like they have a hem allowance for tailoring. The other running stitches in the collection and the jeans having a normal hem alongside the running stitch have me leaning towards "yes", but I'd love to check the construction of those out in person to find out.	episode_done:True

text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:Some good recommendations, not sure where you are but there's a Canadian company called Dynamite that is priced like H&M/Zara and has really nice clothes including office wear and comfy clothes.

text:>  I think it's worth talking about how you do this when your POV/aesthetic isn't so cut and dry as vintage menswear or repro workwear.   Thats incredibly important. Obviously I'm writing from a place of personal bias, but I definitely think a similar mindset could be used for other styles, especially as most "common" ones have a root in classic/vintage menswear. For example, Engineered Garments and Evan Kinori have a similar basis, but done with a twist on details and silhouette.  I think its healthy to simply think about *why* a piece of clothing appeals to you and to have your own inspo albums saved for reference (and explanation, if people ask you why you did something). Trial and error is a big part of it and shouldn't be dissuaded from!  And even then I think that mimicing is an important part of style; copying would be if you wore the exact same things the same way as your inspo. The latter seldom happens due to budget or accessibility to certain brands.  For example, I've done SLP inspired looks, but instead of head-to-toe YSL, I could wear a 1950's biker jacket, reproduction rayon shirt, thrifted black levis, and RM Williams. It might be mimicing as a whole, but its still my own take on it with the pieces I already own.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you feel the Pandemic is affecting your style? (Or, “I am a butterfly in a chrysalis”)	labels:I'm a healthcare worker and the pandemic definitely didn't change my day to day scrubs look much 🙃 However, I used to dress up and go out often to eat or see friends, and am really bummed that pieces in my closet have sat untouched for a year.  Initially I coped with some of the panny stress with shopping. But after a few months, I quickly realized it was pointless. Now I just cope by planning fun outfits for when travel resumes. Post pandemic I'm definitely going all out dresses and high heels as much as I can!	episode_done:True

text:I'm a J. Crew loyalist, so I'm acknowledging my potential bias but I'm also a fan of Banana Republic and went through a hardcore BR phase. However, I've kind of forsaken Banana (my young professional wardrobe was full of it) and returned to even more J. Crew -- I've found that, in general, my pieces from J. Crew last longer and hold their shape/quality more than what I have bought from Banana. Also those 50% sales are usually goldmines for me! Just my experience!	labels:I loooove BR - they’re in my price range and their clothes just fit me well - but quality is absolutely hit or miss. I have stuff I’ve had for years, and I also have a dress that I wore twice and then a ribbon on the back just fell off haha. But for my budget, if I’m picky, I do very well there. (Love J Crew for linen pants and shorts, though!)

text:Naked and Famous Raw Denim Review/Fit/Experience	labels:I’m a personal stylist who focuses JUST on women’s jeans and in all my years of experience I’ve only put raw denim on 2 of my clients for this exact reason. It’s too difficult to really nail the fit.... and if you do, there’s a good chance it’ll change as the jeans settle out or if your body changes. Plus, cutting around curves is super tough.   Raw denim is awesome in theory. It ages with you and confirms to your body. And the look of it over time is so cool. But I’ve almost never seen it work with women, especially in skinnier cuts. There’s just no give.   I would otherwise recommend vintage Levi’s or 100% cotton premium denim in a heartier weight for a more structured jean. The difference it that it’s been rinsed/washed so the fit is more predictable and longer lasting than raw denim.
text:Would you prefer people throw away their old clothes when they are done with them?	labels:Ah yes, because there’s absolutely no middle ground between throwing away an item that’s still got some life left and being a vulture and re-selling it for multiple times it’s original value when it could have been purchased at a thrift store by someone who truly needs clothing and can only afford second-hand

Sneakers would have been TSAJ1, yeezy 500 in black, and a funky pair of air safari atmos.

text:For the parents of girls	labels:Mom of two little girls - 4 years old and 20 months old. The four year old dresses herself in whatever she wants. If it is not weather appropriate, I make her adjust (like a long sleeve shirt under a tank dress). She rarely matches but I think it builds independence, confidence, and creativity. She hates it when I ask her to wear something specific (like for a holiday) so I just try to buy special outfits we will both love. I let her pick out some of what I buy for her (give her some options to pick from). We shop mostly online so it’s easy for me to have some control over what she can choose.   The 20 month old pretty much wears hand me downs lol and I mostly pick what she wears but she’s starting to prefer to select herself (she’ll tell me “pick dress” in the morning to tell me she wants to choose a dress). I will let her pick her clothes more and more as she becomes more independent.   I imagine over time my girls will start to put together more and more fashionable outfits as they become more aware of style and what their peers are wearing. I will always let them choose for themselves and only intervene when what they want to wear is truly inappropriate for some reason. And even then I will continue to give them options for alternatives and let them choose. It’s their body after all!	episode_done:True

text:Kibbe System and Body Inclusivity	labels:First of all, the Kibbe system is too dated to work - if you look at the suggestions for clothes to know what they are talking about, they usually involve dated styles. And the types I fell into the most - gamine and theatrical romantic - featured images of women who were heavily styled, whilst writing about those features as if though they hadn't been altered in any way. Didn't help that said women were from the 50's and most of the photos weren't even colored.  It is also sexist, but in a weird way. Like, if you look taller than you are or have long arms and legs with a short torso, then you are automatically 'masculine' - the opposite is also true, that stockier women are considered feminine (?). It's categorization is usually wrong.   I could go into the descriptions of the types I fell into, but I won't - they made me angry in their weird, smotheringly obsessive way, of describing traits, as if though you were a perfect fairy tale character in a book written by an incel.   This all combined with the fact that the people who take these tests are usually clueless about style, means that they will probably end up either confused or use a very limited way of expressing themselves. And so it appears with those who write about Kibbe in the first place - it's the blind leading the blind.   It's like those apple, pear, hourglass, thing yet again. They sound like all of them safe for hourglass, are freaks of nature, whose exaggerated proportion frighten everyone unless they are covered up. Only Kibbe takes the opposite position, where slight variation in how you are built, must be exaggerated hugely, yet again in the name of being harmonious.   It just doesn't work that way - almost nobody has this thing, where their face and body fit together in 'type', or at least I sure as hell don't.

I appreciated that their menswear (sweaters in particular) came in small sizes that I could wear. One of my favourite sweaters is a thin wool men's from Le Chateau, purchased 2009, still looks and feels like new. My most complimented blazer is from their 'Made in Canada' line. Aw.  They've been on the chopping block for years, though. Not at all surprising they've collapsed now.  The number of different pieces they produced always seemed crazy to me. The outlet stores were enormous and I could go back year after year and see a lot of the same clothes from my last visit.

When in reality, they're sexy and great.	labels:So much this! Very pear shaped and wearing wide leg pants makes me look way bigger on bottom, so instead of just my hips being big EVERYTHING looks big. Also the “ X makes you look taller” people used to suggest to me all the time, I’m 4’11” for god sakes no amount of pointy shoes are going to make me look tall!

Really think about what goes with the rest of your wardrobe, and buy things that you would want to wear again and again.  I buy fast fashion, but I have a very small closet. I don't consider my fast fashion items disposable. They are treated with similar care as I would treat the more expensive pieces in my wardrobe, like Max Mara, etc.  I also purchases second hand a lot of the time, and often consider trend cycles when I buy items. I avoid the really trendy stuff - unless it's something I really want to try out, and buy things that wouldn't feel that outdated in 3 years time.  In the case of buying 2 dollar tees and really cheap shoes - it might not be sustainable in the long run, because based on my experience, bad quality tees don't last very long.

text:Uniform dressing is the best!!  I have a VERY casual job (dog handler at a daycare) with an actual uniform (if very loose - t-shirts and hoodies with the logo) and it's lovely.  I don't have to think about it beyond checking the weather and seeing if I need two layers of fleece leggings and snow pants or if I need shorts and a wide-brimmed hat.  I now have a "uniform" for off days too.  Still super casual, but it's an easy selection.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Do you guys default to a set of a few pieces even though you own a ton?	labels:Definitely. I think it's natural, depending on how much work from home you're doing, and what the dress code is at work is where you spend a lot of the time.  Regardless, owning a piece I love, sitting in my wardrobe, gives me joy. There comes a stage where that joy turns to sadness when I realize I haven't worn it for a year, and that's when I move it on. However most of the stuff I have I get some wear out of, and keeps the joy going. It's just a little bit more difficult with a toddler and wfh life.	episode_done:True

I've essentially created a small capsule wardrobe of all new clothes in the past year that I love and I'm so excited to pick out my outfits every day.

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.
text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:I'm in a similar situation as yourself. The way I think of it,  I save the clothes that I absolutely love in a small box. That way, regardless of if I have kids or not, I will have a curated box of my favorite pieces that I can look back on in time and think, "wow, I'm so happy I saved this." It's a little tedious, seeing as you will be hauling around a box for years, but if you take the approach of a museum curator, the old pieces can resemble pictures in a photo album, as opposed to clothing to be worn.
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:My mom got me a beautiful micro suede blue jacket last fall, but it was pretty bulky. I had it tailored to fit and I love it. Specifically the upper sleeves were tightened and the waist was pulled in.  *it even has pockets.	episode_done:True
text:Local dress agency?! Is there a name I could google?	labels:It depends where you are based - I’d perhaps just try “dress agency near me” and see what results you get.
text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:My thoughts are that everyone should wear whatever they hell they want, and nobody should feel like they *have* to wear something they don't enjoy, find uncomfortable, etc. Obviously it's not that "simple", but at the end of the day...it is. There's no magic pill you can take that will allow you to suddenly stop giving AF. It's a process of looking in the mirror, having those feelings, and then accepting that your body is the way it is and that is okay. Feeling bad about your body doesn't serve you in any way. It's not going to someday lead to you waking up with "perfect" tits if you just hate yours hard enough. All it does is make you feel bad. It's fine to have those thoughts, even the most confident and body positive people will have them. They don't need to dictate your behavior or impinge upon your happiness, though. It's a choice. It's a HARD choice, and it requires ongoing effort, but like many other things it becomes easier with practice.	episode_done:True

text:Wolf vs Goat Fonzie Goes to India t-shirt Review and Fit	labels:I'd be curious to hear how these hold up over time.  I bought into the WvG reddit frenzy a few years ago and got a set of tees. I've honestly been horribly underwhelmed with the quality, especially after ~6 months of light/normal use (i.e., worn once a week). They were great at first, but within one year stitching was coming undone on all the shirts. I was very disappointed in the quality especially after all the talk on reddit of how high quality WvG are.
text:Is Yesstyle a good website to buy clothes from	labels:99% of the clothes are based in asia. The clothes are very low quality and run small. If you do choose to buy I'd suggest 1-3 sizes bigger than yourself.   I've bought from them before and while I like the styles, I'm pretty bad at not destroying things so buy at your own risk.  Quality on par with Forever 21 which also manufactures based out of asia.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 26, 2020	labels:I've always heard "match your leathers and metals".

(E.g. natural colored leather accessories while wearing dark brown leather shoes)
text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:My first (meaningful) boyfriend gave me a diamond necklace when i was 18. It was lovely, I wore it constantly, and received many compliments. And then we broke up, as one does with their teen boyfriend, and blah blah blah, after a while I was like, "wtf do I do with this?"  I was *never* going to wear it again and selling it felt a little mercenary.   I ended up giving it as a gift to a girl I babysat/nannied for when she turned 18. It was nice because it was a way for me to give it to someone I cared about and I was able to give her a much nicer gift than I normally would have. And now when I think about that particular piece of jewelry, I don't think about my imploded relationship with my ex, but my relationship that I had with this girl as she grew up.

I add everything to a list, and wait until Amazon's algorithms decide they need to sell it for $6. They also offer Tall sizes on quite a lot of items, which is great for having sleeves that fit.  Uniqlo for jeans, Amazon's Peak Velocity brand for Tshirts, and Goodthreads for everything else is what I would do if I had to start from Scratch.  If there's a certain type of item your looking for, feel free to ask for recommendations and I can send you a link to what I'd look at.

text:Have you ever found a designer, maker or collection that makes you seriously think, "Everything they make is so beautiful and I want to own/collect everything they make?" If so, what is it?	labels:I think it's so cute and funny how much people's tastes differ.  I like a lot of free people stuff, rat and boa, reformation, various dollskill stuff for things that are more affordable.   I also love stuff by Alberta feretti, bottega Venetta, Rick Owens and red kawabuko.

I stick to what I’m good at haha - follow ppl’s style you like! No need to replicate but feel inspired!!! - when I buy a new piece of clothing I go on a styling rampage w my closet.

Edit- added point #4	episode_done:True
text:100% this. This whole "truly wealthy people are classy" narrative that's so popular here is so incorrect.	labels:It might be tied in with old money/new money. New money might (like the kardashians) dress more loud, old money might dress more subtle. But even then, it's still a matter of personal taste. The Kardashians and other non rich people enjoy the loud look, that's fine, other rich and regular people don't, that's also fine.

Once you have an idea of what you are looking for you can check online stores that have locations in your area. That way when you go out shopping you arent as overwhelmed and have a plan going into it.   Covid permitting ofc	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe not updated	labels:What makes sense for you, your life, your budget, your mental health, your storage space etc? These are questions I consider for myself.   Following fashion trends can be fun to engage in, but I'd recommend asking yourself whether you follow the trend because you like it or you feel societal pressure. Are you doing it for yourself? If so, is there something else you could be doing to substitute that would cost less money, use up less space, last longer, etc?   I've acquired a few things since Covid, and the later purchases have been way more mindful than what I bought initially. I've been investing more time into hobbies I've been meaning to get back into in lieu of online window shopping mindlessly. You see more things to buy, you'll likely have more urges to shop.   It does feel like my wardrobe is in a time capsule-- more so the idea of "these are clothes I wore pre-Covid" and now "these are the clothes I currently wear." In a way, things feel dated because they are no longer in active rotation. But I don't feel the need to get rid of things I like. If I no longer like them, then there's no reason to hold onto them.  I bought warm clothes for the winter and I've been very grateful. I don't pay a lot of attention to trends as an indicator for what I should buy, but rather if I like something then I might invest time into finding the right version of x piece. But lately... I can't justify too many purchases and that's okay! Enjoying trends vicariously is just as good as owning something.	episode_done:True
text:Knee-high boots, classy heels, or trendy sneakers?	labels:I really don’t wear any of those!

I’d love to be a heel person, but I’m already about 5’11”. I don’t have any sort of insecurity about being extra tall, but it’s a pain when you have to bend down for everything.	episode_done:True

The album you have created really incorporates hard edged details into a softer look well. Notice how it's just 1-2 items, mostly accessories. That's the way to do.

text:This - many people tend to compliment things that catch the eye or are a change from the norm. They may be noticing the item itself or the alteration (e.g., from long hair to short), but this doesn’t necessarily mean it works for you. (Also, with friends/family, they’re likely to compliment any changes to be nice, even if it’s not an improvement.)   I agree with OP’s stance of focusing on how you feel over how others react. I love jumpsuits, and lots of friends tease that I look like a mechanic in one I own, but I like it and wear it anyway. Similarly, I get a lot of compliments on a sleeveless dress that makes me feel like a frumpy MIL, and that dress has since been retired.	labels:	episode_done:True

And there’s a specific shade of Dockers-khaki that is completely bland, and therefore goes with everything and nothing at the same time.  You can avoid this by choosing more interesting colors, finding a flattering fit, and paying attention to the break (basically anything is better than pooling around the shoes).	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:There are a few brands that do this (Vince and Theory are the ones I've encountered...). Back when I worked in a more formal industry I was shopping for a Theory suit. At Nordstrom Rack the suit was unlined and a wool/poly blend. At Nordstrom the suit was wool with a poly half-lining. And at the Theory flagship in NYC the suit was pure wool with some natural or cellulose full lining (it's been a few years... but it definitely wasn't poly). This was ostensibly the same suit - similar silhouette and the same name, just a few numbers on the product ID differed. And of course the fit when I tried them on was noticeably different, from the Rack one being like a very cheap imitation, the Nordstrom one being pretty good, and the flagship one fitting like a glove.   Similarly, I recently bought some AllSaints moto boots from 6pm fully expecting them to be a diluted version. Instead they were the same cow leather lined with goat leather I tried in store. Considering how these things usually go, a happy surprise (no way in hell are they worth the $450 at full price). Side note: 6pm secretly lists most of their stock on Amazon with Prime fulfillment, which is great because their return policy sucks.

It just seems so boring to me, I can't see myself looking like me in those types of clothing	labels:One thing I think a lot of minimal capsule wardrobe inspo images don’t show is that you don’t HAVE to do only neutrals. This is a revelation I just had recently — I came to the end of about 2 years of personal style exploration and put together a capsule wardrobe to see if it would work for me. I’m all about colors and floral patterns, so for me the trick was to choose everything in a color palette that would mix & match. My colors are navy blue, coral pink, yellow, and dark green. Almost all of my items were one or more of those colors, and everything interchanged really easily, even though I only had 20 items or so.   You said fashion is how you express yourself. What are the consistencies between your favorite pieces? Do several of your pieces already go together? That might be the basis for creating a “minimal” wardrobe that still feels expressive and in line with your personality.

Just dress for the occasion and besides that wear clean and good smelling stuff that you actually like. You'll be much more confident which is much more attractive than the way you dress	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Also, this is a common rule, but no clothing that requires anything special to wear it - eg a shirt that only works when you switch around the bra straps of your convertible bra, a dress that requires shapewear to look how you want it to look, a wrap blouse that has to be pinned into place after you put it on, a shirt that requires another shirt underneath because it’s see-through - all of those are a no for me. If it doesn’t work with just my regular underclothing (except for choosing nude underclothing for light pieces) I won’t buy it - I just know by now I’m not going to make the effort to wear it when I could just put on something easier that I like just as much.

text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:I think that an under-discussed part of picking out a first suit for these types of things is getting out and trying them on before you buy. Being comfortable in a suit, even if it’s cheaper or in a less fashionable cut, is more important in interview settings than the eye to detail and quality that we normally discuss on here. A suit that fits in the shoulders, in a neutral color like navy or charcoal, that you know fits because you were able to try it on is way more important to your success than ordering something online that might be objectively better. Interviewers are looking for you to meet their minimum standard of professionalism, not for you to wow with with sartorial taste. Source: had a lot of interviews in college and law school.

Went to the store though, and they had everything. I was in love with the oversized parka from pictures but once I actually tried it on, I got a bit disappointed with it. It was too long IMO and overall had that same slightly childish/adolescent look that I also think the original Uniqlo hybrid parka has. I think pairing the oversized silhouette with a slightly cropped length could have made all the difference and made it s sweet piece. But it honestly is not that different from the original. The turtleneck however is awesome. It's way wider than uniqlos usual sweaters so it fits amazing. Uniqlos standard turtleneck is stupid slim	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:I have worked in casual places for the last few jobs now, and my motto is dress up but add one casual thing to dress it down or only have one dressy element per outfit.  That might mean wearing some sneakers with your fave dress. Wear your fancy skirt with a t-shirt or sweatshirt instead of a blouse. If you want to wear a blazer - make it a fun color, fun pattern, or softer less structured fabric. You wear your fancy trousers with a graphic tee and a jean jacket/leather jacket/chore jacket. You wear some vintage wash mom jeans with a t-shirt/boxy sweater and heels (or fancy boots).  This gives you one foot in casual, but gives you space to wear your favorites. And you do not feel ridiculously overdresses when your peers are wearing leggings and flannel shirts.  You also learn to go with it, and everyone thinks you are a dress up person.  These are my tips as a dressy person who works in casual Bay Area tech land.  And I'll chime in on the no crop tops if skin is visible! Not appropriate (although I know dress codes are loosening and people are doing it.... but it is a bad idea!).	episode_done:True

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:Shoes and other accessories can be much cheaper to own and can completely change the vibe of an outfit. A different pair of shoes alone can take basically the same outfit from grandpa-core to vintage feminine to streetwear. For example I have pretty basic black cotton blend dress that I can wear with platform sneakers for a streetwear look, with flats or booties with pearl or diamond earrings for a "classy casual extra feminine" daytime look, and thigh high boots and berry lipstick for a "baddie" look on a night out.  Jewelry, makeup, and shoes are just fun easy ways to play with being someone else for a day without own multiple different sets of actual clothing. In my experience costume jewelry and second-hand or outlet retail shoes (like from places like TJ Maxx, Ross, Burlington, etc.) hold up much better for the lower prices than fast fashion fabrics do. So I like to get quality clothing and basic accessories, but then have cheaper more "out there" accessories/stuff for variety and experimental/trendy moments.  That ends up being way cheaper and more sustainable than buying a new top or skirt that will fall apart or be out of style in a year every time I want to feel different for a little bit. A change in hair and makeup is even cheaper and more sustainable because often you can use the same products, but just with different techniques/styles.	episode_done:True
text:Inspo Album: Pulling the Past Forward, Asian-style	labels:I came here from the other Asian designers thread you just posted! I hadn't seen this post but THANK YOU for this.  I'm an East Asian immigrant who came to North America about a decade ago. One of the first few things I did was to promptly lose my native accent and do everything I could I assimilate asap. That meant everything from making caucasian friends to dressing on a certain way. I hid my culture and never really enjoyed telling people where I was "really" from.  Fast forward to now and I finally feel secure enough to wear whatever and speak however I like. I *LOVE* having Asian motifs on my clothes - my closet is full of crane and koi fish details. I'm also lucky enough to be working in a sector that fully embraces diversity on a deep level. Can't wait to try some of these brands out!

text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:My fashion is evolving! I was raised in a strict conservative homeschooling environment, so until college my fashion was nonexistent.  In college, I had the same instincts for fashion I do now— but no taste. Meaning I knew the message I wanted to send but didn’t have the language down.  It took me five years, and several kind friends in grad school. I used the Curated Closet, lurked on this sub, and- I know it sounds weird- watched RuPaul’s Drag Race with a very fashion-forward friend.  I have three key “styles” and rotate based context: 1. Business casual— lots of black leggings and Uniqlo swing dresses, blazers, button-ups, minimalist sweaters. Clothing that says Take Me Seriously, I’m Here to Work. 2. Flannels and nerdy or artsy graphic tees. Laid-back mode.  3. Artsy, edgy, fashion-forward. I like the subversive and truly odd. As a confused baby in undergrad, this love combined with poverty drove me to a series of failed experiments. Notable: the notorious black sequin dress and top hat, a vintage 20s button up with poofy sleeves paired with high waisted jeans, camo jacket and flowy skirt. Now, my artsy style manifests in outfits like: Universal Standard Geneva dress, green bomber jacket, cherry Doc Martens and matching lipstick, dangling silver figure earrings, statement bag. (I’m currently in love with FashionBrandCompany’s garbage bag purse).   I put a lot of thought into my wardrobe and 75% are pieces that can rotate through all three. Black leggings and black dresses are great neutral canvases— the accessories make the style!	episode_done:True

text:I'm Not a Watch Guy I Swear - Street x Sprezza	labels:I am a watch guy, but very much a relatively broke one.  Had I known how much trouble it would be to break into watches, I might have said never mind and wisely walked away. I didn’t, though.   Some pointers for those interested:  1.	The cost of the watch is only the upfront cost. Like a car, a mechanical watch needs regular maintenance. Generally speaking, this will be anywhere from $300 to $1,000+...every 5-7 years.  2.	Because of point #1, entry level (~ $500) mechanical watches are not pieces you will pass down to your kids. In fact, it is usually cheaper to trash them entirely and buy new than to bother having them serviced.  3.	People will tell you there are deals to be had in the vintage market. That’s true, but it can also be difficult to find parts or people willing to work on them. 4.	There is relatively little offered between entry level and about $3,000.  5.	There is nothing wrong with wearing a quartz or digital watch.   All that being said, I still love my small collection. Just wish I had known those things from the start.
text:In total agreement with this. I kept trying to find my season/palette/whatever using a bunch of systems and always got frustrated. But then I found friskygatos on IG and she was just like...

Today I wore an all pale pink outfit and got tons of compliments and felt fabulous. I don't even know/care if it was my most flattering color, but just the fact that I looked different than the sea of neutral outfits out there made me happy!	labels:> "Hold up colors next to each other and if you like them together, wear it."

text:Handbag conundrum: lesser know (and lesser seen all over the place) or standard luxury designer bags (think the usual Gucci, YSL, LV, etc.)	labels:Definitely buy what makes you happy. The fact that you have looked at the high end, well known brands and came away disappointed indicates that (this season at least), they aren't for you.   To answer your question directly: for me, personally, showing my own style is 1000% more important than showing the status of a luxury brand. Do the two sometimes overlap? Yes, and that's fine. But I don't personally get buying something *just* because it is a certain brand. Who are you trying to impress? What are you conveying with that logo (wow, you're well off? What kind of message is that, on its own?) I just feel like people who are super into labels, not the design or the style or anything else, just come across as kind of immature? The truth is, anyone worth spending much time with isn't overly concerned with what logo your bag has. (Now! I will concede there is a difference between showing off luxury brands and having higher end items, in some circles. Like, there could be some tension if you're hanging out with super millionaire socialites and everything you wear is from TJ Maxx...but in that case, I'd still say its important to focus on personal style first. And knowing about smaller higher end designers, rather than designers you can buy at a mall, is a whole different thing too...)

You being a woc does not make you less badass, I am not a woc but you ladies are literally stunning as hell and your skin tone doesn't prevent you from being the baddest bitch in your block. So what if you're not a skinny white girl, it's not like a certain skin tone or weight determines whether you can be an egirl or not. You are capable to be the baddest egirl being woc and not beansprouty. I'm not sure what to tell you about your family, but I know a girl who would always put on something baggy over something revealing at home and before she left for school, then take it off. That could possibly be an option for when you get to go outside, or just dress like that in your room or something. When I started wearing clothes I thrifted instead of shopping at my small town's h&m or the other 3 fast fashion stores I thought I would get judged, but actually quite the contrary happened and I got compliments on my vintage clothes. I'm not exactly dressing edgy,more very colourful, but at least from people our age, they don't seem to judge edgy clothes. And honestly, when talking about strangers and not family members, I don't think anyone actually judges that hard. Seriously, why care anyway? Other than sorta needing to conform to social norms when looking for a job, like when you need professional pictures for a CV because egirl makeup isn't seen as "professional" or whatever, there's nothing you have to lose. You're not losing friends over glittery makeup and short plaid skirts, if anything, they might rather admire you for your cool new style. And strangers? They're strangers anyway, you won't ever see that mean ass grandma at the grocery store who frowned at your eyeliner ever again, it's not like you dress and do your makeup for her. You'll be a super pretty egirl, you can do that shit
text:Guidance organizing a suit for my fiancé for his father's funeral during lockdown	labels:So one thing to keep in mind is that, when your father passes away, most people aren't paying attention to what you wear. Many communities don't even expect a suit -- they just expect you not to wear anything too loud or disrespectful. But assuming he still wants a tailored jacket and pants.  6'5" is rather tall. I tend to say that height is not a clothing measurement, and it's not -- he might still find something off the rack... buuuuut it may be a lot of effort, especially if you can't get an arm measurement without a lot of effort. And I suppose it's not worthwhile to have him measured for a Made to Measure suit. So sure, just keep the gray jacket you have.  A gray jacket is... kind of easy and hard to pair at the same time. On one hand, it's neutral. On the other hand, you don't want to pair charcoal with black because it's usually low contrast; you don't want to pair it with other darkish grays, and you can't pair it with light grays for a funeral. You can't pair it with bright colors for a funeral. So you need navy blue trousers. That's the conservative, classic choice here... and it's fine.  100% wool is fine. Don't worry about an obvious mismatch -- you *want* an obvious mismatch, you don't want anybody to think he was trying to wear a suit but couldn't figure out how to match properly, you want people to look at him and know he is wearing separates on purpose.  A white shirt is your safest bet. A light blue shirt should usually also work, but might be a little more interesting than you want for a funeral. Get something sized by neck + arm measurements. Try Charles Tyrwhitt, they have a good variety of fits and do easy returns abroad. Charles Tyrwhitt shirts are 3/$100, don't pay a penny more.  A tie is probably still not necessary for a funeral, but if you want one anyway... well, what's your budget? There are brands that will sell you great extra-long ties.  Oh, and use a lint roller or garment brush to clean that jacket.	episode_done:True

text:I think MTM is more of a long-term threat to bespoke rather than RTW. The technological improvements, which will theoretically make it possible for software to draft a pattern indistinguishable from one drawn up by a human, could eventually make it very difficult for bespoke makers to compete on fit. The market could shrink to basically just the guys who want to be able to say they bought bespoke for sentimental reasons.  RTW will likely always exist just because it’s cheaper and easier to mass produce clothes in standardized sizing. Maybe the higher-end RTW market shrinks, but  at the bottom I don’t see a future where Zara only stocks M2M suits ordered online in advance.	labels:This article was about bespoke, but there are a lot of businesses taking mtm from the other angle -- not only making it cheaper, but making it such a cheap marketing hack, using it to reduce dead stock  using it to reduce return rates...

text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:I think it's pretty outdated, but I don't see anything wrong with her saying she dresses for men, if that's in fact what she was doing. There are bits in here that aren't that different than what I hear people say/read on a regular basis:  > I don’t think I could dress like the illustrations in the high – fashion magazines. For that you require what is thought as a Vogueish figure , and is, I believe, a boyish type figure and I don’t have a boyish figure.   Pretty similar to the idea that women with straighter figures can wear clothing or particular shapes that aren't traditionally feminine, but curvier women need to wear clothing that shows their curves or end up looking fat.  > You have to be friends with your clothes if you’re going to dress for men – no too tight zippers or unnecessary doodads to make you uncomfortable! Sometimes their acceptance is just in their response, but the response tells me I am right.   I've heard this often enough: (straight) men don't appreciate complicated clothing, they don't like clothing that isn't "flattering" but might be aesthetically interesting.   I think a lot of the article's pretty silly from a modern perspective and has some eye-roll inducing lines about women not liking her clothing. However, it's not like (some) women don't dress for men at all any more. I don't think her opinions are that unusual, she's just putting them in a way that doesn't sound right for modern readers, especially because hardly anyone actually *says* they dress for men, even when they do. I don't care to dress the way MM did, and I don't share her opinions, but I also think she's conscious of playing a role here.

text:4SDesigns FW21	labels: 4S Designs is a relatively new brand, whose first collection was Fall-Winter 20 as things were going absolutely haywire in the world.  A lot of talent working for the brand, with the key designer being Angelo Urrutia. Angelo worked for the Nepenthes brands and Engineered Garments for god knows how many years (Through FW18 if I remember right?). Angelo is commonly known as Daiki's right-hand man, and from an outside perspective seems to have nearly as much influence in the brand's growth as Daiki has.   4s is definitely a different animal than EG. Still a workwear influence to be sure, but the styling is a little more conventional.   Fabrics are even crazier and much more lux than most of what EG has used - a lot of stuff that seems to be made special for the brand. Chanel-esque lurex-laden tweeds, soft and bulletproof melton, heavy twills, and ventile keep the choices interesting. Similar to EG, there have been many unconventional uses of fabrics.    While I don't think Angelo and team are aiming for the Conceptual collections ala Rick Owens, I think they nail an absolutely wearable aesthetic. Their lookbooks have been "different" but are one of the few brands that are unlikely to alienate people. With that, the details are still interesting enough to keep a normal enthusiast interested.	episode_done:True

text:Become a Tailored Suit Pro - Guide	labels:Went to a tailor for the first time today. £25 to get some chinos shortened and tapered.      I walked in and said “I have some trousers that are too wide. I would like them to not be that way”.        He had me change, said “are we shortening or tapering” - which I took as a very polite way of saying “they’re far too long bro”, so I responded “both!”.      We chatted for a couple minutes while he folded, pinned and measured.       He was polite, respectful, and only scratched my ankle once with a needle - I figure that you accept a certain amount of risk when people put pins in a garment you’re wearing.          7/10, most anxiety inducing part was walking through the door. Will be getting my stuff back on Tuesday. If it goes well I will be throwing a lot of business at them, as I have a lot of clothes which would see more action if they were better fitted.
text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:I came to the following conclusion a few years ago:  >I am able to wear essentially anything I want anywhere I want.  However, **every single person I meet with functioning eyes** (whether they are aware of it or not) will pass judgment on my appearance no matter what I wear, and some of these people are in a position to materially affect my life based on their opinion of me.  I think it's unrealistic for most people to "wear what you want, screw the haters!" because appearance-based judgments happen constantly.  Is that a problem?  Heck yes.  Is it illegal?  When it comes to clothing, usually not.  The balance between "what I like" and "what won't get me ostracized and unemployed" is going to be very personal and will probably change several times in your life.  The trick is figuring out who you can't afford to *not* please (being realistic, of course), then figure out what is needed to please them, then figuring out where your creative freedom lies.   Most people have substantially more creative freedom in their off-work hours.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I often buy multiples of items I love. I bought several of the same cardigan after I realized that I wore it more than any other sweater I owned. It's great!  Another thing I do is, when I see an item I like, I mentally run through my closet and see if it will mesh with what I already own. If it works, I get it. If I'd have to buy several new items to make it work, I don't. For this reason, I don't own many t-shirts, but I do own lots of sweaters and dresses.
text:You’re definitely right, I just think I won’t know if a luxury bag will make me happy until I actually finally own one. For now it’s like chasing a dream I’ve never been able to attain on my own before and idk if it’s achieving the dream or the actual bag that I want.	labels:I definitely know this feeling, but it sounded like you weren't all that impressed by the quality of the  luxury bags when you went to look at them.  Maybe think of it like this as a test to see if it's the bag or the achievement of a milestone. If this bag (luxury or not) was found in a thrift store, and you couldn't find it in the store of the brand or online, and you left the thrift store without it, would you be worried that someone else would buy it before you? Or would you have a feeling of "meh, I'll find something similar?" If you would be worried about missing out on it forever, you want the bag.   You could also buy the super pricey Prada (or what ever luxury brand) and if having actually bought it feels wrong, you could return it.  But I totally understand wanting to have tangible reoresentations of the milestones you hit in life. Mine is one day being a home owner and not just a renter, and I really get excited at the thought of finding a space (not necessarily big, beautiful, or expensive) and making it mine.

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:I prefer getting drinks for a first date. I think having a dinner date is too formal/too much of a (time) commitment when I’m just trying to get to know a person and feel each other out. It’s easier to dip out after a drink and there is less financial involvement.   Usually I wear a pair of statement earrings and one other statement piece (can be anything: jacket, top, etc). The rest I keep pretty basic (aka the rest of my outfit is black).   I wear a lot of black generally, so on a first date, I want to wear something that is representative of what I wear on day-to-day.	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I wear a lot of dresses, skirts, and wide-leg flowy pants during the summer. I almost never wear shorts because I've always hated them. Breathable fabrics are important especially with humidity; you'll be a lot hotter in polyester than in cotton. Also thigh chafing is a thing, so I like to alternate between days I wear a skirt and days I wear loose pants.   I do tend to carry a lightweight top layer for air conditioned buildings. But it doesn't need to be something super warm; mesh or a loose weave is fine. I tend to like that layer to be something that won't wrinkle so I can toss it in my purse.	episode_done:True

text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:My makeup tends to stay the same unless it’s for a formal occasion and even then, that usually just means I use an eyeshadow that’s even sparklier than usual and go just a little heavier on the blush. I tend to stick to light, shimmery, pink-champagne-white tones for shadow and generally rock a nude lip unless I’m feeling spicy. I have a couple good berry lips and some deep reds.	episode_done:True
text:What shoes besides boots are you looking forward to wearing this fall?	labels:My feet are mangled (I’m 33) so I pretty much wear Alegria shoes exclusively (also Birks). I recently ordered a pair of Alegria black lace-up oxfords that are probably not stylish in the least but man are they comfortable. I’ve become more drawn to black clothing the past few years so I feel like *my* style is coming together, even though that style requires orthopedic shoes!	episode_done:True
text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:Rayon is made from cellulose, a plant based fibre  While yes, polyester is a synthetic   It seemd the less synthetics worn and used the better, as yes fibre shedding in the wash is an issue.  It is proven, that synthetics will grow a bacterium, that cottons, linen, wools, canvas etc will not. So you need to wash synthetics more. As everyone knows from gym clothes and swimwear.  Plus the cling and static of synthetics not so nice.  Also synthetics textiles used for so many textile things around us daily life, that aren’t clothing, but were we are adding them in rubbish all the time and they pollution, and materials that won’t breakdown.  So choosing more natural fibre clothing helps balance out our excess use of synthetic fibres in day to day life, and feels better on body.

text:Fall Fit Battle - Final Four - Discussion	labels:Hey, who forgot to tell /u/Rariora about the textured gray trousers?  \--> /u/8888plasma <-- v. /u/Rariora \-- neither fit really surprised me. Maybe I've just seen enough of this battle for now. Like I said, with /u/Rariora, I like the long coat over interesting pants, but I think it came out better last time. And I'm not in love with the black-forward color scheme here. Plasma's look is also more tame than usual, no crazy colors, but the first background was... cheating, really. The long cardigan worked. And is that all color 8? And the scarf being worn asymmetrically like that is a plus for me. Tame, overall, but... really solid.  \--> /u/ngoknows <-- v. /u/chunsak \-- I'd say NGO ahs the most interesting fit here, for me, with the big, fun, scarf. I like the asymmetry in the first photo... Really solid fit. Oh, and I love the detail shot! Chunsak... Also solid, but doesn't stir anyting up in me, personally. I can see how cord, flannel and donegal in this combination might excite some of you, but for me... eh.  Overall... I expect something crazier next round. Don't pull any punches for the finals.
text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:No, no, no and no. I hate the aesthetic thing. Buying things bc 'they fit in with my aesthetic' and not bc you like them is weird to me. You can be all of those styles all at once. I love having a grungy girl moment, a colourful LOOKATMENOW moment, a classy neutral I'm a big girl moment and a floaty yes I am a fairy and I just tiptoe about in pretty midi dresses moment.

Let Cole Haan/whoever do their thing.  Edit: this is not counting people I know who may have very different requirements throughout a workday/ work trip and may not want to pack/ bring several shoes and are in a constant haste.

text:What clothing items have you reverted back to since WFH/quarantine?	labels:I've really been embracing dressing more youthful. I'm in my early/mid 20s, and now that I've worked a couple years at the same place, I'm wearing more what I want than boring professional. I also started caring about what I wear and planning my outfits. Velvet shoes, corduroy overalls, rainbow prints, sequins, bold colors. Who cares? I've been called out for dressing "fancy" before, but I've stopped giving a shit in correlation with my confidence in my abilities. I'm a teacher...if anything, I'm showing the students it's okay to be yourself and take risks.
text:Chore Coat Inspo Album	labels:Its the same picture	episode_done:True
text:Yeah, my point is that navy slacks + grey jacket generally isn't a good look (although I'm sure someone somewhere can make it work). black slacks with a grey jacket would also not be my first choice, but agree it would probably work better than navy and would be easy to find in a pinch.	labels:It's not a *bad* look, it's just... kind of unusual, that's all. Because the navy blazer is such a classic, gray/navy flipped from their classic roles is... kind of like a peanut butter and honey sandwich. Perfectly good, but you might have been expecting jelly.	episode_done:True

In a corporate setting hair accessories probably need to be used more sparingly, depending on the job.	episode_done:True

This is because, and maybe I'm the only person in the world, but I have a VERY hard time wearing any top with spandex because it gets stinky with my body chemistry and the smell is basically permanent. Grey's is one of the only brands that fits my long torso and has options for no spandex.  For pants, I do find the Grey's ones pill after a relatively short amount of time, so I'm following along on the thread to see what else I should try!	episode_done:True
text:I know “fashion” but people of minorities are always forced to try better. Some Insights	labels:I'm Asian, not black, but this reminds me of something I've consciously learned to do in my career, to try to actively contradict stereotypes in order to encourage colleagues to actually engage with me as an individual with my own strengths, weaknesses, and personality. In the U.S., stereotypes aren't nearly as harmful for Asians as they are for black men, but in the workforce I've seen a lot of Asians plateau at the lower level, informal team lead positions, while getting stuck being hidden away when it comes time to build relationships or manage long-term, strategic goals.  I've played up my blue collar background in order to disarm the "nerd" stereotype, and I've played up my military background as necessary to remind people that I have management and leadership experience, and that I'm not just the guy hired to be some technical specialist, or the one-off task. It's also an easy way to connect with other vets.   Early in my white collar career, I retained my military haircut, maintained a stronger (rather than a leaner/cardio-friendly) build, because from what I've seen, a bit of a subconscious bias about blue collar = power lifter while white collar = weekend marathoner.  Now that I've climbed the ladder a bit I've been able to back off some, and adopt a bit more of the style and look of a mid-career white collar professional (but in a fashion-conscious way). I've also gotten older so I haven't hit my strength (or my cardio) goals in a while, and I look more like a white collar professional that way, too.   And maybe I'm overthinking things, but I found that leaning into meathead or combat vet stereotypes allowed me to avoid being pigeonholed like so many other Asians who came before me. So this linked study at least seems roughly analogous to what I had already seemingly experienced, albeit in a very different context with very different considerations.

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.

text:All great points!   What always got to me was that the "good" stuff always cost money.  It was like tailoring in that sense, where say Ring Jacket and Drake's clearly has a different aesthetic than H&M or J. Crew, but you just need to have the income to support it. And then of course for me, I'd rather have a nice jacket/shirt/etc than one watch.  Then there are vintage watches and swatches which are affordable and quirky, so it worked out at least for now. And I agree: nothing wrong with digital or quartz.  Hopefully others see your comment and they can also start collecting!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:There's a lot of good advice about finding inspiration here but what really helped me is in some ways the opposite: allowing myself to be really picky. Maybe I'm just a negative person haha but it's easier for me to realize I sort of balk at wearing a particular item and then figuring out the reason it's off-putting as well as taking note of clothing I feel my best in	episode_done:True

text:What are you looking forward to buying for "pandemic life" this summer?	labels:Bike shorts and baggy cropped tees!

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:Man, I had this short, lacy white dress I wore for YEARS. It was just a babydoll dress from UO or something, pretty casual, but it looked killer on me. In the winter, I’d wear tights and boots (and a coat, of course); in the summer nice sandals or sneakers depending on my mood. Sometimes I’d add a long necklace, sometimes just super simple earrings. It worked every time, my magic dress. It got lost in a move, but the move was cross-country with my bf with whom I have a dog, so I think the dress did its job.	episode_done:True
text:So happy to hear this expressed so well.  I am short.  I've been, at various times, self conscious about it & listened to the seemingly universally accepted notion that it is desirable to look taller.  Now, the idea that taller is objectively better is a crap idea I bought into mindlessly.  I'm embracing my height and rebelling against choosing my clothes with the aim of looking taller.  I will buy what I like and what I think looks good.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:> ower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose)  Also because of the cost of raw materials like wool or leather. A $100 wool coat will always be thin and flimsy because wool isn't cheap and you need a lot of it for a coat. The only way to make that $100 coat is to use less wool, either by replacing some of it with polyester or by using less of it.  (Which, in this specific example, leads to people buying a cheap woollen coat and a cheap down jacket and wearing them both at the same time. Which does make sense for a lot of people, but I can't help finding it a bit funny.)	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:I second what everyone said about buying stuff secondhand, but just want to add, if you’re going to buy something from a fast fashion store, only buy it with as high a percent of natural fibers as possible. 100% cotton/silk/linen/wool/leather etc. The items will last longer and will look/feel better. Otherwise, you’re buying plastic clothing.	episode_done:True

text:From my own experience, I'd say the best made "vintage" Andrew Marc leather jackets are better than a lot of "mall" brand leather jackets I've owned or tried like Kenneth Cole, Tommy Hilfiger, Reilly Olmes, Ralph Lauren Chaps. I have a Ralph Lauren POLO leather jacket (original MSRP $695) from 1999 made of a heavy leather that has held up wonderfully over the years and I'd say is better than the best Andrew Marc I've tried (but my experience is limited--there may be "gems" out there, like limited editions).	labels:90s Polo is kind of golden era polo, somewhat different to what we have 20 odd years later.      RL Polo iteration one happens in 67' , RRL comes in 93', and then Purple label is in 94', but over the years I think the gap in quality has really widened sadly.

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

text:I think the chunk of the FCW Cons is the appeal in that they can be worn to balance a chunky, wider silhouette on top.

text:Strange. I find them to be great hot weather wear, no warmer than calf (and cooler if unlined). Also have not had problems with permanent water spotting. I live on the equator and wear my shell in any weather.  ETA: That said, most of my shell is on the darker side (burgundy/colour 8, dark brown, black, or navy). I recommend these colours to those who are deeply bothered by water spotting.	labels:Similar experience here. I wear mine year round in Florida and don't really notice a difference between shell / calf leather as far as getting too hot. Usually what stops me from wearing boots is the weather gets so hot I don't want to wear pants so the boots go too. I can see how the spotting would annoy some, but I usually just don't wear them if I know it will rain. If they do get wet a quick wipe down with a damp cloth takes care of it for me.	episode_done:True

text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:Personally I’m still somewhat new too this but I’ve had many different fashion phases and have done many different looks throughout my three years of personal fashion experimentation. I feel the biggest thing that’s helped me is sticking to a sort of color scheme.    It’s definitely not for everyone necessarily but it’s helped a lot as I have grown my wardrobe, slowly adding more colors. It makes things very easy to match. I started with three colors ( I know that’s extremely little however) now I’m up to six!  I feel accessories ( not just jewelry necessarily but belts, hats , bags etc. ) are also very important to obtaining a certain look.   I feel organizing ones closet can also really help. There’s no specific way I’d necessarily recommend I organize mine by grouping items article then group them by color , as I mentioned color and matching things is very important to my personal style so that’s what makes sense for me.   Hope this could help some! I’m new at this too as I mentioned lol!

text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:While my style has evolved over the years, the number one concrete example I can think of is... pushup bras.

text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:The most basic thing, fundamental, objective thing is if it uncomfortable or impedes your movements. Some of this you only figure out when you wear things particularly if they are too loose (too tight you usually notice faster), like tops or dresses too big their neckline might move a bit and look askew, or you step on the hem of skirts or dresses at you climb stairs. Skirts too tight might ride up, pants too tight might dig and create camel toe or the zipper give way and open...  For other things, say pant or skirt length it might be a matter of aesthetics, 5 or 10 cm lower or higher..  Probably the most important point for things to fit is the shoulders and armpits, so it does not impede movement and because outerwear, tops, etc, hangs literally from there. If fitted, the seam should be at the edge of your shoulder blade naturally.  Not everything can be altered to fit right. There might not be enough fabric for that, or it might just a design which was cut for different proportions than yours. Tailoring can do subtle tweaks, on woven fabrics (knits are harder, way harder), but the first and most important step of getting clothes which fit well is REJECTING things, lots of things, most things, almost all things. Trying many many things, being analytical so you can learn stuff (if it looks like that chances are it will loook  this other thing on my body, Brand X pants always fit me right and Brand Y pants never).
text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:My 2021 resolution is to wear the clothes I bought in 2020 and not buy more, lol. Honestly I'm in the UK and it looks like we won't be coming out of frequent lockdowns until maybe June/July at earliest so that leaves less opportunities for going to places and serving snazzy outfits which is sad but hey, it is what it is.  I've been trying to wean myself off buying clothes, not because I hate fashion or something but to combat a shopping addiction I developed in 2017 (basically dealing with any negative emotion by buying clothes) and I've gradually gone down from 80 items a year to 40 and now 25. I've got a baller wardrobe with clothes I love so if I can manage to get my clothes shopping habit to what it used to be - a rare treat instead of a regular thing then I'll consider it a win for myself.	episode_done:True

Thanks for the review and introducing the brand. Winston & co seem to have launched some time this year? How has the cardigan been since you've had for a month or so. If it's made by S&C, I presume it's still immaculate as it can be.   It's unlikely that I'll pick up any cardigans or knitwear this year, but I like to compile a list and plan for future years. I have a SNS Herning Stark, Inverallan 6a, and a few Inis Meain sweaters.  Shawl Collar: Winston | S&C | Drake's | Colhay's  Knitwear:  O'Connell's | Johnstons of Elgin | William Lockie |  Andersen-Andersen | John Smedley | SEH Kelly | Loro Piana   "Afforable options" : Harley's | Bosie | Howlin' | Outdoor Knitwear   Guersney: Le Tricoteur (another brand found out from you. Do you still have a fit pic?)    Vintage: Drumohr | Ballatyne | Pringle of Scotland | Alan Paine  Any names that you would also recommend?

text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:I need to stop shopping - full-stop. I did way too much "fill the hole in your soul with stuff" this year, for obvious reasons, but I feel overburdened with the amount of clothing in my life now and I need to make a conscious effort to pare things down. If I run into a genuine need, I'll continue checking secondhand options first before buying new. I'll also continue logging outfits daily with Stylebook, because it helps me be honest with myself about what is and isn't getting worn in my closet (both for getting-rid-of purposes AND for informing-future-purchases purposes), *and* it'll help me focus in on what I gravitate toward in my day-to-day life rather than continually shopping for some nebulously just-out-of-reach fantasy self.   Summed up:  * Buy less, buy secondhand, buy practical, buy for TODAY (not a dream and a half from now), and buy only what is genuinely needed (very likely *nothing* for quite a while).  * Continue evaluating what I really need in my life, and how much, and adjust accordingly as time goes on with the goal of seriously paring down my closet to a manageable size.
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I also hate pants for the same reasons as you. But I also live in a Nordic country which is hella cold.   I just wear thights that are made of comfortable quality fabrics (sometimes cotton/wool blends) and I buy at LEAST one size bigger than my actual size, with wide waistbands. I want comfort above all, and for me this works.  Also if I only had to deal with cold weathers in the morning, frankly I would just put the thights on in the morning and then take them off later and put them in my bag.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:It took me quite a bit of time and money to realise that there are some styles I like looking at but do not suit me - either my body type or my personality, or both.  The hardest to let go of was the sort of floaty, drapey, effortless boho style. I wanted to waft around the place like a modern Romantic whilst gardening and being all artsy and shit. But my shape is basically round with hints of hourglass, my personality is not best suited to wafting anywhere (I bounce, mostly), and show me mud or art supplies and I will be covered in them before I've actually got near them. And any skirt that's made of light enough material to drape and waft elegantly, or goes below my knees, is going to be ripped to shreds within a day. So yeah - I admire those looks on other people and have discovered a style I like, that's practical for me and reflects my personality a bit.	episode_done:True

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:Having a heavier coat on hand isn’t a bad idea, especially if it’s already available - but for context I grew up in Austin, TX and the *only* winter coat I ever had I purchased specifically for a vacation. There’s an odd day every couple of years where you might want to use it... but for the most part people just stay inside and the weather warms up.  Things like a lighter fleece will take care of you pretty well on the coldest typical winter days.   A big thing I would recommend is a lot of light layers that are easily removed - cardigans, button ups, jean jackets, whatever. They served me well year round, even on the hottest days. I’m not sure specifically about New Orleans, but it’s pretty common to run the air conditioning really intensely in that part of the country (I swear my high school was kept at 50 degrees year round) and being able to cover my arms indoors was important to my comfort. Basically just something that’s light and easy to store away when you’re in the heat.	episode_done:True

text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:While we can't say for certain: is it possible that the second experience is the correct one? A lot of men believe that they need a fully custom suit to fit well, but in actuality for most body types the patterns are rather close. If an OTR size with alterations would look great, paying for MTM is a waste of money. I've done MTM suits and bought OTR suits and have generally found that getting OTR with alterations is a faster way to a well fitting suit than the low to mid level MTM stuff we're talking about here. I've done Indochino MTM which was generally a mess and a tuxedo from Black Lapel which eventually worked out well, following one full remake and $100 of local alterations (that they paid for). My OTR blue line suits from SS fit great after alterations.
text:I second this recommendation for OP.  Banana Republic is my go-to for exactly three things: Inoffensive winter basics, chinos, and short-sleeve prints (because for some bizarre reason, they're great at them). When I say winter basics, I mean solid-color sweaters/cardigans/pullovers. BR hits an amazing value proposition when their stuff is on sale.   Not sure any of it will last 10 years, but I don't think that's a realistic expectation for any clothing except suits.	labels:Good to know! Thanks so much for that valuable inputs 🙏	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 20	labels:Can anyone recommend a good brand of tank top to use as an undershirt that meets the following criteria?  - Long enough to be tucked into the pants without coming untucked throughout the day by doing things like raising my arms, bending over, etc  - Armholes and necklines aren't massive on larger sizes.   The few brands I've tried, I had to go for larger sizes to meet first criteria, but then I ended up with tanks with armholes and necklines so massive that it looked like one of those goofy wrestling leotards. It looked stupid, and it was also very uncomfortable because I often had the hems rubbing on my nipples. Ideally, the neckline should be low enough that I could wear a v-neck without it being visible, but not so low that it sits below my nipple line. And the armholes shouldn't go lower than a few inches below my armpits. And again, needs to be long enough that I can tuck it into my pants without it coming untucked (I'm 6ft and 220lbs, so I do have a bit of a gut).

text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:From a logical perspective, it makes a lot of sense and this system would work for most people. I think everyone naturally has a different idea of what "on par" means to them given their budget and taste and there's a saying that the value of a piece is what the buyer is willing to pay for it. Sometimes there will be those pieces that just speak to you regardless of the price and while those are a rarity, I would like to see that incorporated into this system. This is more true when you start going up the scale where fashion becomes more of an art form instead of "clothes". For me, I would pay $1000 for a Craig Green jacket because I love his work and it speaks to me on a deeper level like a '97 Honda NSX would; to me the experience is worth the money. While the numbers are important, to match your golf analogy, it's still a game to have fun.

text:I agree with you, as I aged and had other responsibilities I realised I did not care to follow trends.  Though I enjoy following fashion and learning what is going on. It is interesting to look at it as an expression of culture, social and public mood, technology advances, and as an artistic expression.  It's also interesting to see how fashion percolate (the famous Devil Wears Prada scene on the jumper).  On that same note, as fashion changes, it is difficult not to follow it. Trends come into most clothes we buy no matter what we trie to do.	labels:>Trends come into most clothes we buy no matter what we trie to do.  Exactly. And it's also really difficult to predict what will culturally "stick" as a more longterm trend that may even end up being a "classic." I remember when skinny jeans were becoming a thing and people decried they they'd be a passing trend, when they've gone really strong only until very recently (and even though they're no longer super fashionable, they're still a common "basic" at this point.)   I was recently watching an old episode of "What Not To Wear" and Clinton was aghast at the trend of people wearing white sneakers/trainers to the grocery store and anywhere other than the gym. That reaction seems so weird now that athleisure has become so ubiquitous.
text:What are your fashion tips for looking good on Zoom?	labels:I’m late, but!  -	Sit next to or in front of a window -	download and use Snapcamera’s makeup for zoom filter if you’re not wearing makeup -	“adjust for low lighting” if you need to in zoom video settings -	go to a free stock image website like unsplash and look for “office” or “home office” or “living room” or “coffee shop” photos as your zoom background. It’s even better if your background lighting matches your real lighting  -	statement earrings also work out well for extra pizzaz. -	if you can help it, angle the camera slightly higher than your head, or whatever you use as your “selfie” angle. If you can’t do this then at the very least do not have the camera angled up at your face. -	I have noticed when I have my monitors blue light filter on, because the screen is more yellow toned, it warms up my skin on camera lol	episode_done:True

text:What would you wear to elope during a pandemic?	labels:I wore a red ribbed/crushed velvet jumpsuit with long flowy sleeves and hoop charm earrings. It was cold when I eloped so I wore velvet to keep me warm! This was pre covid but I’d wear the same thing today.  My backup would be a jumpsuit or dress from electric feathers.

text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:Impulse buying is hella of a drug, I feel the urge to buy anything clothes related at least once a week.

text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:If you're nervous about the look itself: I used to wear things I was iffy on when I was in a new or different place. Like, if I was worried a dress was too loud and attention-getting for my comfort level, I'd wear it when I was in a different city for the day, because if it did catch too much attention, who cares, I was never seeing these people again! Obviously this is harder to do in covid, because we aren't casually daytripping or traveling, but even just wearing the outfit to the grocery store, where you're probably not going to know everyone, vs wearing it in the office, where you see the same people all the time can ease you into being comfortable...	episode_done:True

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:I'd say to some degree yes. Most fashion houses are rtw/couture first and accessories second. They dipped into the handbag and accessories market to make more money, but the real quality (and bread and butter) for most fashion houses is their rtw.   Chanel is in this weird spot where they're trying to outrun the secondhand market and regain the exclusivity they once had. They're trying to be Hermes but they could never be Hermes because Chanel is not known for their leather.   So yes, I think when it comes to handbags/SLGs/accessories most luxury houses are trying to put out the latest and greatest and kind of mimic fast fashion to some degree. They're appealing to a market that can't afford to become their regular clientele. The people whom they can't text when the latest $7000 tweed jacket is released each season and know that they can walk away with a $10,000+ sale. So brands are trying to push out the latest and greatest handbags, SLGs and shoes.   In terms of rtw, I do think the traditional fashion calendar is very fast paced, but several brands have said they will step away from the traditional calendar and cut it back down to 2-3 releases per year. It will be interesting to see what this means for S/S and F/W collections.   Commenting more on the handbag/accessories market:  I say this as someone is kind of handbag crazy, but I do wish people would do more research about the brands and bags they purchase. People assume that just because a bag is marked up it's handmade by an artisan who specializes in leather but that isn't the case for most brands.   If anyone is looking for Hermes alternatives I highly suggest Delvaux. Valextra and Moynat also have fantastic craftsmanship. But I bought my first box leather bag from Delvaux last year and it's on a completely different level from Chanel.

text:Everyone’s opinions on Youtube fashion channels?	labels:I used to spend all of my free time watching beauty guru videos. I learned pretty quickly how badly that impacted me! Watching beauty content on a much more controlled scale, avoiding hauls, etc helped a lot so once I started getting into fashion I applied the same logic.  Pixielocks is my favorite fashion influencer. Her video about Lirika Matoshi's Strawberry Dress really transformed the way I think about clothing, got me to quit fast fashion, led me to my favorite brands (Big Bud Press & Mokuyobi), and gave me the inspiration I needed to finally start building a real wardrobe for myself instead of just living in "good enough" clearance rack finds. Her entire house and wardrobe is almost 100% my aesthetic so following her on Youtube and Instagram makes me happy.  I also really like these channels, although I watch them less.  - The Stitchess. Her style isn't as close to mine but her videos are very informative and interesting to me. - Karolina Żebrowska. Her fashion history videos are so cool! - Rachel Maksy.

text:Formula for a put together outfit that works for most aesthetics	labels:having to mentally rank your clothes every time you are about to put on an outfit seems exhausting. I'd also like to point out the person in your example picture is wearing 2 dresses, one sheer one on top of a floral one.  I don't think I would describe that outfit as "restrained" as much as "unique pieces but overall subscribes to the formula of a very normal outfit" in the sense that a dress with socks, a bag, and loafers isn't weird. You could just look at outfits you consider "chic", par them down to their elements, and emulate that.	episode_done:True
text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Hi! Former stylist.  1) Pay attention to the fit of things and figure out what cuts and shapes look good on you. Paper bag pants and some joggers have similar fits. Some mini skirts and shorts hit the same place on your legs and can have the same waist height. Find your sweet spot and don’t be afraid to buy multiple things in silhouettes that work for you.   2) Get some statement pieces that you would die for. If you are wearing a pair of jeans that fit well and a t-shit purchased within the past 3 years with some awesome earrings you going to look and feel great. If you are wearing an amazing dress and simple white sneakers you are going to look and feel great. Don’t overthink things but try and wear at LEAST one piece you are excited about at a time.   3) Don’t buy things just cause they are on sale, you saw your friend wearing it, or you feel like you “need” something in your wardrobe. You should love everything in your closet in its own special way unless it’s workwear and you hate your dress code for work. Something as simple as a T-shirt has so many different factors like cut, material, neckline, sleeve length. Purchase what feels good and don’t bother with the rest.

Particularly liked this excerpt around the 3-minute mark that a lot of people need to hear:   > The problem I find with dressing to maximize your perceived height is that 1, it puts height on a pedestal-- it assumes that your height is the most important factor for determining your attractiveness--and 2, it assumes you should dress to maximize your attractiveness to others... you are dressing with one priority, to look taller and more attractive to the eyes of other people and the result of that is a sea of men dressing the exact same way... where is the personality in that?

text:I came here to say this! Having words vs not having words for something doesn’t change whether or not you can see that colour lol. Language does change how you construct your worldview (eg whether you think of time as linear vs circular is often rooted in how you talk about time) but not so wholly as to affect colour.   I think more so than language, culture and location would have a huge impact on the colours you wear. I grew up in a hugely colourful country and all levels of formality allow colourful clothes, but now I live in Canada and everyone wears black and blue and grey year-round, especially in winter, even casually. As another commenter said, someone living in Alaska will likely dress in different colours vs someone in Cayman despite both speaking English.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:As Chanel Raises Prices For A Second Time this Year, What Do Luxury Brands’ Inflating Prices Mean for Them & for the Industry at Large?	labels:Luxury brands inflating prices means creating another pricepoint at higher categories. When fashion tees at $300 a pop becomes the norm, why wouldn't the luxury brands jack up the price on other products to increase their margins?  The only way this can be curbed is through the consumers. When we stop falling into the hype cycle and scramble to buy up everything just for the gram and social media likes, these products will sit and go into the 50-60% off discount during the sale seasons. All these brands have data; when they see that stuff is sitting and mostly selling at lower price points, they'll need to curb their expectations and set price points accordingly.   It doesn't help right now during COVID that I see people whose jobs/income did not get affected by COVID, and therefore has additional disposable income because they aren't eating out, partying etc. They justify spending more on items at MSRP instead of waiting for a sale.

text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:The fabric content and construction methods  selected for menswear tend to be more durable (wool, Tweed, twill, cotton/cotton blend, denim, tencil, natural and synthetic suiting). It is also considered feminine to buy a broader range of colors and lighter weight fabrics so most retailers don't get trendier colors and fabric weights when stocking menswear because they don't think it will sell. It's more to do with risk aversion and gender assumptions than planned obsolescence.   I did menswear design in school and now that I'm learning to sew for myself, it's very challenging. Women's garments have more variety, but the weight of many of the fabrics with better drape are pretty flimsy.	episode_done:True

I also have a small beaded purse from her, it looks quite older, maybe 1930’s. I only use it for special occasions and otherwise it just sits on my dresser looking pretty. The same great aunt was the oldest of my grandmothers siblings and gave them fancy dresses from a lady she worked for to play dress up in. Later my mom played dress up in them and so did I. I wish we had realized how nice they were because they’re in rough shape now even though I’ve saved them. They’re probably 1920’s, one is silk and could possibly be repaired enough to look nice displayed.   My mom did her own sewing and saved a lot of her favorite clothes. I still wear some of her 70’s maxi dresses but she wore her dresses too short in the late 60’s for me to wear most of them as an adult. There’s one wool jumper dress I wear over leggings.   When I was in high school I wore her 1980’s Calvin Klein jeans, the ones with the white labels instead of the modern leather patch.   My aunt gave me some of my grandmothers costume jewelry and it started my love affair with tacky mid century jewelry.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 25, 2020	labels:Why do people ask if it’s ok to wear WW2 era German military garments casually? Why is this not even the first time people have asked this? Why is the reaction to being told no “well, but what about”? Are my expectations just too high or???  Like, I think choosing to cosplay as a WW2 Gerrman soldier in your free time is incredibly sus to begin with but at least that’s under the pretext “reenactment” but why do you think it’s ok to just throw on random articles of clothing from that group for going around town?

I've found it's a really useful skill too (obviously), feels nice to hype people up. Don't need to accept as many compliments IRL (Finnish teens do be dicks doe (it's not their fault doe we're all still learning)), but it's great to have a handle on that too.

text:Have your clothing purchases dramatically dropped now that we can't go anywhere?	labels:I  never worried about or felt I understood anything about fashion before. I grew up in a family of so many girls who all feel like we don't know fashion. I always wanted to but it felt unobtainable. Well I went through some family stuff where I no longer need to be spending my free time and money taking care of some family members so I have been updating my wardrobe like crazy. I watched and learned about a ton of fashion for a month first with all the free time from covid. I have never spent this much on myself ever. Don't get me wrong everything was thrift store finds or clearence but I was still wearing almost only things from highschool before and I'm 25.. I extra splurged yesterday and was able to score a brand new pair of vegan doc marten oxfords for $45!!	episode_done:True
text:How do you tell when discounted items were never full price?	labels:I don’t have any great suggestions but it seems like this is a problem technology could solve for us (ala CamelCamelCamel) but for some reason it hasn’t?!? I have zero technical knowledge on this, but suspect retailers must be actively doing something to prevent consumers from tracking prices (beyond, like, manually tracking one product at a time by checking the website every day) so that they can run these fake 20% off sales. It’s slimy. If anyone knows of any way around this, sign me up!	episode_done:True
text:Start small and work your way up! Maybe sew some pillowcases first to learn making straight/even hems and borders (or I guess you can use scrap cloth but that’s not as fun or rewarding) - also maybe kitchen cloths - and then maybe you could try tailoring your outfits. Maybe a pants is slightly too long, or a blouse is too loose - now you can hem up the pants and take in the blouse. Don’t cut cloth until you’re comfortable!! Sewing is the opposite of cooking - you can subtract but never add, while cooking you can always add but not subtract. And even then, when you build up to the stage where you want to cut cloth, maybe try that project on scrap material first lol. Cloth can be expensive, so as pretty as it is... start small.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 17, 2020	labels:In the spirit of it being men's mental health month or whatever, I want to put something out there: you aren't your clothes. Lots of dudes (myself included) conflate their wardrobe or their fits with their worth, believing that looking good is all they have to offer the world. But let me tell you, you have value. Not by your fits, not by your hobbies or skills or jobs or what you do for others, but *just by being you*.  I know lots of guys who wear butt-ugly shoes, suits that don't fit right, mismatched patterns and textures, etc. A few of those guys are my best friends because they are good people regardless of how they dress.  So for whoever needs to hear it, you have value and you are valued. You are good. And I'm here for you.
text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:It helps to look if the item is on sale anywhere else/if any other retailer is price matching. It’s less likely to be “made for the Nordstrom anniversary sale specifically” if you can find it elsewhere!

text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:I'm in my early thirties and live a comfortable life. In my early twenties I loved shopping for secondhand clothing and had a regular loop of my local thrift stores, Clothes Mentors, and consignment shops. I was always on the hunt for a good deal and was really developing my personal style (with a lot of experimentation and questionable choices.)  A few things that I've been reflecting on recently:  1. I no longer find shopping (specifically browsing) fun. Now I would much rather seek out a specific item on Poshmark and only shop to replace needed items or fill legitimate gaps.  2. Related to the above, I have a short list of brands that I buy and it's based on quality, warranty (I have a lot of outdoor/athletic gear), and environmental impact. Right now, I'm looking for a Patagonia Houdini for at least 50% off retail. I'm not in a rush to buy it but I'm also not aimlessly shopping for "a windbreaker" and then come home with three t-shirts. 3. Fabric/fit snobbery. I don't care if the cutest top I've ever seen is on clearance for $3... if it's 100% polyester it's just not coming home with me. Same with "I really like it, but if only it..." I have far more clothing than I need so there's never a moment where buying a pair of leggings is the difference between owning pants and going to work naked. I can wait till I find the perfect item.  4. Lifestyle creep is real! Across all my spending (groceries, clothing, hobbies) I just don't pay attention to the cost as much. I still have an upper threshold that gives me pause, but I don't have any month-to-month "oh, I can't afford that right now." Which, I really should be saying far more often!   All together, it takes most of the fun out of shopping because I am so picky and can usually say, "okay, I really don't need/want this."
text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process? What would you prioritize?	labels:You know what? I’m middle aged and secure in my job. I’d go full cyber goth. Not even joking. I’ve spent my whole life trying to dress appropriately for my work and lifestyle and it’s boring me. I have all kinds of office appropriate slacks and cardigans and button up shirts in cutesy patterns, casual jeans and sensible shoes. I want to wear plastic corsets and fluorescent clip in braids and platform combat boots.

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:If you have the space to store your current wardrobe, then my advice to you is simply not to pressure yourself into getting rid of clothing that you're not comfortable getting rid of.  Minimalistic wardrobes are not for everybody, and you certainly wouldn't be helping anything if you were to throw away those clothes only to end up  buying replacements later.     Take the clothes that you don't think you need and set them aside, maybe in a box or the very back of your closet, and keep only your 'minimalist wardrobe' in the easily accessible location.  If, after a year, you find that you didn't really miss anything from the old collection of clothes, you won't feel as hesitant about getting rid of them.  If you have to dig a few things out of your stash, just keep them.  If you find that you've completely ransacked your stash over the course of a year, and ended up wearing everything you didn't think you needed, then, well... maybe minimalism isn't for you.	episode_done:True
text:Fashion "fantasies" coming true years later?	labels:Since I was about 14, I've lusted after patent platform stiletto boots like Lady Gaga often wears / used to wear (like the Little Monster I've been since I was 10). I've stared at Pleaser boots (about 120€) for hours already but never went through with it. About a year ago (when I was 21), Asos dropped a similar pair of boots for about 60€ and I went for it. I can't wear them often (lack of occasions), but I use them as decoration and they make me very happy.	episode_done:True
text:That's probably the single most recognizable quote of his outside diehard avant-garde fashion circles. It needs some contextualizing though. Like everything else, you have to consider where the speaker is coming from. Rick is addicted to working out. He's on steroids. His addiction is understandable because before he got into working out he was doing drugs and was, by his own admission, on a very unhealthy path. His wife got him into working out instead. But he's effectively swapped one addiction for another. Working out is generally one of the best things you can do for your health, but not when you're pushing 60 and regularly taking steroids. When it comes to that Rick quote, it's worth knowing that he's not speaking from a well-balanced position.  All that is to say, the general spirit of the quote is solid advice. But Rick Owens is probably not a good authority on moderation, which as with all activities, should be a part of your workout routine.	labels:Can I get a source on that? All I could find were some articles where he took steroids when he was younger but has been sober for a while.	episode_done:True
text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:My taste in jewellery has evolved over the years, and most boyfriend jewellery was small silver things, so I’ve either donated them to op shops, or passed them on to other people.   I had one little diamond ring that he paid about $200 for, and I sold that to a pawn broker for about $80. Then I probably spent the money on clothes and wine.	episode_done:True
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:I go to a lot of networking events in the STEM field, where the dress code is business casual, and I know that business casual in STEM is a whole different beast to business casual Law, and as Australians in a hot city, I'm guessing it's a lot different to a colder climate city. Probably way more casual.  After work networking events: whatever I wear to work. Generally long sleeved button up, mini skirt or skinny jeans, ankle boots, loafers, oxfords or sneakers. No effort into hair or makeup.   Networking event where I know there'll be bigwigs: I'll swap out the mini skirt for a pencil skirt, or a sheath dress. Definitely avoiding sneakers.   For an event with kids (like industry engagement): I'll make an effort to present more femme and do nicer hair, makeup, work heels, pencil skirt, polo. Sometimes blazer. I am almost definitely overdressed, but I think it's important to subvert the stereotype of female engineers as "pink steel cap boots" because that's not really indicative of me.	episode_done:True
text:Covid Dilemna - Finding my style	labels:I got to do some of this in store, and honestly that was a lot easier. But when the stores closed, I ordered stuff online and tried it on at home. I ordered from Zalando, which has a ton of different brands and free returns. Trying clothes at home was pretty nice, because I could take it in for as long as I wanted, get back to some stuff on a different day and pair the new clothes with my own to see if it made a good outfit.   When you're just starting out though, it's important to actually try out a lot of different things. Don't focus on clothes you might want to buy, just get some plain things with different necklines, fits and materials to see what looks good and what doesn't.  Once you have narrowed that down, you can look for more interesting stuff that actually fits your style. So if you do this by ordering online, make sure returns are easy.   If ordering online is not an option, maybe you can borrow some clothes somewhere? Shirts, dresses and skirts also can be pinned to change their shape. And if you have old clothes you don't wear anymore you could cut them into a different fit. Things like cutting a crew neck shirt into a V-neck or a maxi dress into a midi or mini, or shortening sleeves. If you're handy with photoshop or something, you could even try that.

text:To add on:  The formality of a loafer is (generally) determined by a few things:  Leather: Smooth leathers in darker colors are more formal. This is opposed to leathers with a visible grain, or with a nap (suede).   Stitching: If the stitching color contrasts with the leather, it's more casual.   Outsole: Lower profile, darker midsole with a dark welt finishing is more formal. A formal loafer will also have a raised heel, a flat heel is casual.   Styles: The more plain and sleek, the more formal. Beefrolls, bits, tassels, heel pinches, and other such flourishes are *generally* less formal. However this is sometimes a point of debate, and most people won't care or notice.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:I can say something about this from a EU design law (very very basic) point: In the EU, if you make your design public in any way, you have 3 years automatic protection. However, to prove that the other party is infringing, your design still has to meet the minimum requirements of design law, which means that it needs to be distinctive enough. To do this, you need to consider what else was around at the time the design came out.   For the low back body suit, I imagine theres plenty of low back body suits around, and it would be really difficult to prove that Sezane had something distinctive here.   With respect to the jumper, I think that the jumper itself is distinctive, but that VICI’s jumper is different enough (only single balls, balloon sleeves) that it would not infringe either.	episode_done:True

text:I agree, I've never understood what people are doing in the laundry to make their clothes literally fall apart after a few washes. Washing on the hottest setting and drying high heat, maybe?  Ive legitimately never had anything fall apart in the wash ever and I dont take particular care other than cold water and low heat in the dryer (plus not chucking things like sweaters, dress shirts and leggings in the dryer at all). And I used the communal machines in my apartment!	labels:I can count on one hand the number of things I have had "fall apart" after a few washes in the last 2 decades (excluding actual laundry errors). Primark tshirt WERE shite quality tissue feeling crap, (worse than the cheapcheapcheap stuff we used to get from the market stalks) in the early 2000s but I've got some now that are 10 years old and still wearable out if the house. The last thing that died in laundry was a fluffy jumper I bought in 3 colours in 2018. One of them unravelled in multiple places first wash. The other 2 still look new tho, after multiple washes.	episode_done:True

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:I love that you brought this up. Of course, there are are ethical retailers out there that have lower prices, but if you are young and/or poor, there is a certain amount of fast fashion that you need to buy because it fits your price/budget. Even though it isn’t ideal, not all fast fashion is gone in a couple years, if you are buying less trendy pieces you can wear for a while.  Many things I’ve bought from fast fashion retailers I’ve had for years - I haven’t changed my height or weight much in over 10 years, so I have tops from Old Navy I have had for 10 years and other clothes that have lasted way past 5 years.  Reducing consumption is a key part of ethical fashion and even if you buy it from a retailer that is cheaper because that’s what you can afford, if you keep it a long time and don’t buy a bunch of clothes all the time, you are reducing demand and helping the environment.	episode_done:True

text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I did a complete wardrobe overhaul and at first was going to buy my items from regular online shopping like at J Crew and Banana Republic, but then I realized I could find those same items secondhand through Depop. I usually find online shopping to be a pain, but being able to search for specific essentials I need for my wardrobe and also scroll through and find unique vintage pieces made the process really entertaining. It turned out that I enjoyed this way more than regular shopping in stores!   The way I tackled it was I searched for specific items I needed that were essential to me (e.g. black velvet square neck top) and did my best to avoid fast fashion items that I knew weren't built to last. If I needed help visualizing a piece, I asked for a try-on pic, measurements of the bust/waist/hip/length to make sure it fit my body the way I wanted it to, and material content. It's nice too that I'm supporting a small business and oftentimes messaged with whoever I was buying for a bit to ask questions about the item and maybe haggle a bit, that social aspect was nice. Essentially 90% of my closet is secondhand from depop now after shopping over the course of a couple months and I love that I'm in love with every piece that I have and was able to curate each one to suit my needs.  It definitely takes some patience and a good eye for pieces/what materials are best, but I think that's far better than how I originally used to shop and has taught me a lot about how I'm allowed to be picky and absolutely love and enjoy my items, instead of buying things just because it's on sale even though I'm only lukewarm about it. You can find some really good deals and unique vintage pieces while saving money and saving clothing from landfills!	episode_done:True
text:early 2000s looks are already hugely popular again, especially with younger people.  If you go to the hip neighborhoods in brooklyn you'll see tons of cool kids wearing big baggy jeans and oversized tees/racing jackets, which makes sense as fashion is trending toward looser fitting clothing in general.  The main difference is cuffed/cropping in the pants, but even then there's a lot of people, especially girls, wearing baggy low-rise cargo pants that go full break at their big chunky sneakers.	labels:i see where it comes from, cause for the past few years cuffing pants and having a more looser fit became alot more popular, this just seems like a normal transition from that to a more oversized/cuffed look from the tapered look thats kinda falling out tbh.   like its something i see alot of people who cuff their pants above the shoe moving to. like me honestly and i see it being a thing in the future i just cant see myself doing it.	episode_done:True

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:You can find quality items + tailoring for less than $200. Make sure to read what expensive clothes are made out of - just because a shirt costs $200 doesn’t mean it’s good quality. You can also thrift good quality vintage clothing for less than $20.   I bought a blazer almost 5 years ago for around $150, tailored it, and it fits perfectly to this day. Pair that with a white 100% cotton t-shirt from The Gap ($15 max) and a real gold necklace ($$$$$) and you have yourself a business casual outfit for work. My dress pants and jeans are also all tailored.   I would say statement pieces - jewelry, shoes, bags - look cheap if they actually are cheap. Invest in quality leather shoes, an expensive watch, and gold/silver jewelry. I find that some tops and jeans from Forever 21 and Zara don’t look cheap if you tailor them and know how to style them. However if you buy cheap $20 shoes and a $5 fake gold necklace, an expert eye can tell and you’ll look quite tacky.   Just my 5 cents!  ETA: you don’t need to buy $200 items of clothing, but you also can’t buy $10 clothing. You need to find something in the middle. Don’t shop at stores like  Primark, but you can still find a decent blazer or pair of dress pants at Zara or H&M. My personal favourite for work clothes is Banana Republic. Their dress pants are less than $80 and they frequently go on sale. However, do NOT buy statement pieces at these stores as I mentioned before.	episode_done:True

text:I bought way too many things from farm rio in 2020...  They often have 30% off sale prices which means you can get some bargains - though note everything more than 50% (60?) is final sale. Having said that, everything I’ve bought has been quite different in style and I’ve found things true to size so far.  Anthropologie also stocks them and I’ve bought a couple things on even steeper sale from them, however the fabrics and construction seemed cheaper to me.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:This style is surprisingly attainable for me after several years of hardcore minimalism. Once I got to a place where my basics are both on point and super pragmatic, then I have been able to incorporate a few Tibi and Tibi-like statement pieces into my rotation. I’m no longer a minimalist in terms of style - I like buying a couple “big impact” things every year to jazz up my clothes, especially oversized  or dramatic drape or “origami structure” on tops and coats. A single piece really changes an outfit and you don’t need many pieces in rotation to suddenly change your style. Amy Smilovic appears to do a similar thing - keep several things “basic” (neutral color, solid/no pattern, uniform texture, unadorned (no bling or fringes etc) and the play with one thing (her thing seems to be oversized fit and pleats).  The only reason I bring up minimalism is because I cannot emphasize more how much the basics being “just right” makes my dramatic pieces work. Especially with oversized, it’s a thin line between slob and stylish. Those big pleated dad pants Amy Smilovic wears? The rest of the outfit should be sharp or you look like you simply don’t know how clothes should fit. Not everyone needs to first develop an “unfashionable” base before reaching for both fashionable and pragmatic, but I did.   As for Tibi, I know them most for silks and for their origami shapes. GoSilk is a great option for patterned silk and Roksanda has the shapes. Ganni and Comme Les Garcons has some of the quirkinesses and oversized looks. But none of them are cheap either unless you score a good sale. If you can identify exactly what you like about Tibi, we can make more recommendations.
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:I like fleece lined tights. The lack of a seam really helps with itchiness and the fleece feels softer against my skin instead of clingy.

text:Sewing your own clothes	labels:Whether it's worth it or not completely depends on what you personally value in your clothes.  Economy? If you just compare any shirt to any shirt, it's often not cheaper to sew it yourself. Fabric is expensive and if you use patterned fabric, you're going to have a lot of scrap pieces due to pattern matching (if that's a priority to you, it's often not a priority in cheaper fast fashion clothes).  Fit, style and comfort wise? If you get good enough at sewing, you can customize the fit of your clothes, choose the fabrics you like, and sew them in a way that you feel is comfortable, without itchy seams, bulk, tight shoulders, excess fabric pouting or whatever.  They're going to be perfect for your taste.  Quality compared to the price? Here sewing your own stuff will definitely be worth it. You can choose a good quality fabric, prewash the fabric to ensure a good fit even after washes, have a proper pattern that suits you perfectly, and then cut the pattern out of fabric that you've pattern and bias matched perfectly, which also means no further twisting after washing. Basically, clever and good pattern matching is going to take the garment from looking 20 bucks to 200 bucks.  There are many more factors to include, like time and labor and interest etc, but basically, if you like it, see it as a hobby that will provide you with clothes that most likely are going to last better than ready made clothes for the same amount of money.

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Are you me?!  Clothing is 100% the way I manage to feel even remotely confident in my body. I have by no means actually figured this out – especially since I gained weight during the pandemic AND had abdominal surgery (no more crop tops for now since I don’t care to explain the marks) this year – but these are my tips:  1) Get rid of stuff that doesn’t fit you. I’m not sure if what you’re describing with weight stabilizing in a stable relationship is eating-disordered behavior, but in my similar situation, it absolutely was. I am pretty triggered by things that don’t fit, especially across the bust, which leads to my next point...  2) Bra fitting changes everything. I love how you note your old style was “lots of boobs” because mine was too, but kind of by accident because I had ill-fitting bras, and, by transition, clothes. I cannot recommend r/abrathatfits enough because whether “lots of boobs” is still you or you want to transition from it, a well-fitted bra makes everything look more professional and makes everyone look incredible...and feel incredible, too!  3) Tailor to your favorite parts of you. So, I took this really radically and now make my clothes. But that’s not an option for everyone. What is, however, more of an option, is taking things in at the waist, getting things hemmed, and putting in darts (triangle folds) to better fit curves. Depending on where you live, these “operations” can cost like $9-20 only and make the biggest difference. I have stubby legs, a ridiculously short waist, and bras that work as hats, but in my clothes that actually fit me, you don’t see those traits so much as the total look...and I like that look! I think tailoring is the best way to make clothes work FOR you, not you have to work around the clothes.  I hope that helps!!	episode_done:True

text:Influencers with Jobs: A Brief Collection	labels:Style Apotheca on Youtube is a pharmacist!   I definitely prefer to keep up with influencers who have real jobs for a few reasons.   Firstly, I don’t love when every other post or video is an ad. It makes it difficult to differentiate between actual personal style content and what’s just an ad for a company I’m not interested in shopping at. I don’t like being Sold something every time I watch a style video, and I find you get that less from influencers who get income from day jobs.  Secondly, as you say, there is a bit more realism in what they’re posting. Style doesn’t happen in a void, it has to happen in our daily lives. I don’t wear four-inch heeled boots to work, and I don’t like watching a college-age girl try and make Work Relatable content by making “Work Outfits” with four inch heeled boots. Influencers who have day jobs understand what it is boring office employees like me are looking for in a work outfit 😊 sure, maybe because of their “influencing” work they spend more money buying high-end clothing items that I’m simply never going to justify buying, but I don’t tend to follow people like that for very long.

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:Hi! As a stylist I get this question ALOT. For starters don't get rid of too much before buying replacements. What ends up happening is we get rid of everything without establishing what pieces we actually need.   Start with establishing your personal style. What do your want your closet/style to be? What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping! Now that you have a moodboard and list of things you need you can shop to fin in the gaps and more importantly you can shop with intention!   &#x200B;  I hope that wasn't too much and was helpful haha. I'm always happy to help.

text:Nordstrom's anniversary sale is notorious for this - most of the clothes and shoes they sell special for the sale are lower quality than they would be otherwise.	labels:That’s a bummer, seeing as I purchased quite a few things during this year’s sale. Is it just their in-house brands or does it extend to other name brands too?   I bought some Nike tights that were discounted more than I’ve ever seen anywhere (including Nike’s website) so I suspect it’s the latter. They don’t feel too different than the ones I already own in other colors, but perhaps longevity will tell a different story.
text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:This sub celebrates all sorts of fashion but not everyone is up for endless variety. If this is something you’re keen about, you should go for it. But slowly - make sure that the multiple versions of one outfit is something you really love wearing and won’t get bored of before you buy more  If this is more like an area you are exploring due to frustration of having nothing to wear, consider a capsule wardrobe instead. It’s much more involved and intentional than coming up with a uniform but it is a little more flexible	episode_done:True

text:I'm so young compared to the average MFA poster. Like we got people with careers and families on here and an awful amount of you are older than my dad while I'm on Christmas break from what would be high school in the US just fucking around with my unlimited free time.      Also it's crazy that there's people desperately trying to keep in touch with the youth (e.g. marketing departments) while I'm part of what LITERALLY defines what it means to be in touch with the youth. In 40 years they'll be looking back on today and I define what it is they look back on. It'll be really weird to have people my age in positions of power and I'll probably be constantly jealous of everyone cause they'll have done more with their time.      Also also I wonder if designers are gonna reference the youth culture of now in the future. Like Raf and Undercover have made punk and rave influenced clothes recently, will some future designer make DIY thrift-flip skater and e-boy/alt girl influenced clothes 30 years from now? Will that Celine E-boy collection be an important relic of this era? Are those IG brand album artwork 1 of 1 tapestry shirts gonna be in a museum some day? Is some designer gonna bring back the skinny jeans longline tee 2015 Kanye aesthetic as a deliberate callback?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 13, 2020	labels:The long comment thread below got me thinking.   I feel like we live in a time where dozens of fashion subcultures are able to exist at once. I've never seen so many designers and brands across several "genres" all thriving so well.  Saying something isn't "in fashion" just seems wild to me right now. Because honestly I think what's "fashionable" is exploring your own personal style and aesthetic. Being yourself is what's currently cool, and I think that's dope.
text:Can I see your casual natural-fabric outfits?	labels:I live in my cashmere sweatsuits. They look chic and stylish and feel better than the best pajamas.

text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:In this hypothetical I'd go with haute couture. In your friend's situation I'd keep looking until I found a designer I liked. Bespoke would be my last option for a couple of reasons. Your friend wants contemporary fashion, but most bespoke tailors make traditional clothes for a typically older crowd (you're in NYC though so there are some bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd; make sure you look for them specifically). The bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd don't have designs as good as high end ready to wear IMO. Tailoring and designing are different skills, and there's a reason Louis Vuittion, YSL, Dior, Gucci, etc pay their head designers millions per year. Of course some $4000 coats are worth more than others, so it would be good to know a bit about general quality.  Personally, I prioritize design over fit. I can deal with a less than perfect fit if I love the design of a piece. But I won't wear a piece if I don't love the design, even if it fits well.   The middle ground option is made to measure, or MTM. MTM for outerwear isn't as common for suiting, but it's out there.

They go like oh you can wear whatever you like but then they come up with 1000 rules about what should not be worn together. Anyway, if you like that style and also like to DIY things you can totally adjust regular items to look like Tibi ones. For instance, the asymmetrical shirt that closes a bit on the diagonal, the buttons that are used to pull up the sleeves, the ankle bands on some of their pants, etc. can all be recreated relatively easily and you don't need to spend 100s of $ on their "affordable" items (Amy's words, I always crack up when she boasts about how affordable Tibi clothes are).

text:The suit looks dark grey to my eye, though monitor may be misleading.  If it is indeed dark grey/charcoal, I would not recommend navy pants, I'd suggest a lighter grey with no pattern that is very noticeably lighter than the jacket. Agree with the above poster that the goal here isn't to match, but to contrast in a... Controlled... way, especially since you're planning for a funeral.  White shirt, simple/plain tie in any dark color (black or grey would be traditional for a funeral, but dark blue, burgundy, or dark green would be fine as well).	labels:I think navy is the right bet. There's nothing really wrong with it, and if a gray is too light it might grab attention in the wrong way. The range of grays that contrast enough but don't stand out might be very narrow.	episode_done:True

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Had something similar happen, and let me just say - the first step is to find two or three good pants that you feel good in. For me, it was to leave behind shops like forever21 or New Look, and I started shopping at shops like Torrid. I know some people hate torrid, and some of their clothes are cheesey. But let me just say - they do the BEST jeans. I have bought them in size 10, 12, 14, and 16, and they fit and grow with me as my body changed and fluctuated, and then when I lost some weight, the smaller pairs still fit.      Just remember, you have to ignore the size on the rack, and instead go based on what feels good. Good, buttery jeans that make your butt look rocking are a huge confidence booster for me. Tops that hid the ladies which grew sort of uncontrollable after changing the pill also helped. Structured blazers with t-shirts and dark jeans = perfect office look for any size. Statement necklace or simple earrings always a bonus. However you are, as you said, you deserve clothes that fit, so get em, girl!	episode_done:True
text:(Man) Repeller: A postmortem	labels:I started following manrepeller around when it started - it was around when I graduated college and fashion blogs were still big. I always liked Leandra' styling, and later the style pieces on manrepeller. it never bothered me that they often showed clothes that were expensive - I mean, have you ever read a fashion magazine? you expect that in well-curated fashion content people will be wearing things that you yourself can't afford. it's inspirational, not a how-to.  Anyway, I felt like the lifestyle content they were trying to expand to more and more was their weakest point. We expect our fashion magazines to show us $900 items, we don't necessarily want to see models flaunting generational wealth and writing a 1,000-word thinkpiece about it. And the more they pushed lifestyle pieces and less fashion, I worried that they wouldn't last too much longer.  But also, maybe Leandra's time just came? It's rare for a blog or website to stay trendy for 10-ish years. MR started as a sort of hipster-gossip girl hybrid and I feel like that era is just over. I think the events of 2020 made MR's demise faster, but it was probably coming.	episode_done:True

I’ve had so many pieces I loved the design of get ruined because they were cheap. So I look for sterling silver, solid gold or at least gold-filled but also stuff like brass that’s cheaper, and looks it, but at least doesn’t peel.

Surprise, surprise - there’s literally always something new that I “need” to “finish off” my wardrobe.   Like you, I’m trying to learn to work with what I have and narrow down exactly what I feel best in. I like high-waisted everything, plain tops in neutral colors, subtly patterned pants, button-downs that don’t need too much ironing, and a variety of jackets and shoes to switch things up. (Which I already own in spades.)   For 2021, I’m hoping to curb any non-necessary shopping impulses and am creating a shortlist from which I cannot deviate (as there are a few items I still want to add, such as a camel coat and a ski bib).	episode_done:True

For the $$ it's good value.  However, I want a high quality closet and find it absolutely worthwhile to spend the extra $$ for SS - Full Canvas MTM. The fit on my SS suits and materials just feel a world ahead of Indo.	episode_done:True

I'm from a college town and their Goodwill has amazing stuff, probably because there isn't a consignment store in town so they get everything. I live in a big city now and the Goodwills are completely picked through and don't have many trendy items but I would still go to find jeans to turn into cut offs or something. Buffalo Exchange is a consignment store so they don't accept anything damaged or dated, but its a little more expensive. I recommend Poshmark for workout clothes because you can search by brand and size. I buy shoes at Goodwill and don't have a problem since usually you can tell if they're heavily used or not.

At least it is my perception of what they are saying.  Yeah, concerning affordable items... It is above my reasonable clothes budget.

Some neutral blazers. Some dresses.  For fancy appointments I own the same etui dress and blazer combination in black, navy and grey.   Shoes black leather (ballerina, winter, closed shoe, pumps).   My whole wardrobe fits in one ikea pax (1 meter/3 ft). Generally it is boring bottoms and some more color for the tops. I always feel huge in colored pants.

My mom is an M and has been comfortable in M, but she also likes to size up to a roomier fit, haha. I also just buy online and I haven't had a problem with their customer service.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 22, 2020	labels:**Trying to get fashion advice on my body type for all seasons in the UK and Ireland environment.**  Relevant physical profile:  I am an Asian dude with a fair complexion, short (165cm) and not bulky but not too thin.  I will be moving to Ireland with occasional trips to the UK.  I just don't want to look like a tourist and aim to dress like the average local for blending in.  My priority is gear and fashion for winter but since I will be living there indefinitely, I would appreciate fashion for all seasons as well.  Right now, the important thing I am looking for is a proper attire for the wet and cold weather of these countries so my focus is on the shoes and an overall gear that wouldn't need an umbrella as much as possible. And then these should be appropriate as business casual for office.  I really like to be able to wear trench coats or any long coats but I think they are really not good for short guys. :(	episode_done:True

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls” catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your “fashion house designers” but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I’ve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.
text:Yeah, or take classes while you’re working. I’ve taken several continuing ed classes there and it’s always been great. I’m saying take a little time before you enroll in another full time program.   Also, it quite normal for students at Pratt/RISD/Parsons to attend and get another bachelor’s. At RISD, where I got my BFA I actually think it’s a better education than a Master’s.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I have a similar body type, though recently it’s gotten very slightly curvier. I’ve felt the same way, but literally everyone does this, not just us! Clothes create illusions. You’re not a fraud at all.   I’d also consider who you’re dressing for, like the other reply said. If you love what you wear obviously don’t do different because of something I say! But I felt a lot better about myself when I stopped trying to change my body type with clothes (which doesn’t mean I stopped wearing all of my more “flattering” pieces). But I actually found a lot more confidence dressing in clothes that are easier for us to pull off. For me, that’s 1920s and 1960s inspired dresses. The “sack” shape and drop waists are actually often really flattering on us (even with my short legs) and it’s unique because most people don’t find them flattering.   Yes, I probably look less traditionally sexy. But I’ve gotten lots of positive comments on the style that mean more to me anyway. I’ve gotten “Mad Men” comments so some people think it’s sexy anyway!   My advice is to step out of your comfort zone and try to find things that make you feel wonderful outside of people’s expectations of what your naked body should look like.   Good luck! I’m sure you look stunning.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:The South isn't "oppressively hot," so you don't need to apologize for anything! Most of this album is perfectly wearable. I live in a part of the world that is hotter year round than the American southeast, with no real winter and high humidity. People here wear pants and sleeves and long dresses, not just tank tops and shorts, because (a) who wants to limit their wardrobe to tank tops and shorts all year? and (b) sun damage is a very real thing! Some people have different tolerances for sweat or sun, but living in hot weather isn't really equivalent to living in extremely cold climates.  Not to mention, it's not suffocatingly hot at *night*. A lot of these looks which may be too warm for day (leather and velvet dresses) may be tolerable at night. Or just fine in buildings with air conditioning!  You did a good job with the album! The loose sleeves and lacy fabrics are actually pretty practical when it's warm. I wear long sleeve stuff but loose stuff because half the battle is preventing the sun from cooking you alive.	labels:That’s incredibly kind of you, I appreciate the encouragement. I guess people deal with heat their own ways! If i’m in the sun, I will wear covered clothes in natural fabrics and in relaxed fit. I hate a hot forearm exposed to the sun that goes red! Some days I don’t care to slather on sunscreen so i’ll throw a big loose denim jacket on. I’ve gotten used to it though (most everyone in my burb doesn’t like to cover up in summer and I stand out! They all have skin that tans and apparently doesn’t get burnt. Lucky Australians)

text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I haven't been able to buy any glasses online yet. Glasses feel like too much of a serious purchase to leave in my amateur hands. Also, if I already overthink which earrings to wear to work everyday, imagine if I had to pick out glasses too??? That being said, I wear the same glasses everyday for 2-3 years until I can't stand the sight of them and then go buy something totally different, then repeat. I try out different shapes and styles (I've had square hipster, cat's eye, tortoiseshell, thick arms, and currently big nearly-clear peachy ones which are my favourite because they show off my eye makeup and are less in-your-face. What I refuse to wear are colourful glasses, because I know I'll get sick of those quirky red frames super quickly!) People get so freaked out when I show up to work with a different hairstyle...can you imagine how many irritating comments I'd have to deal with if I switched up my glasses every day? "Something's different about you today..." "Did you get new glasses?" Etc. For my own personal sanity, I could never!   Anyway, if you're feeling in the mood for a switch up, I say go for it! These are something you wear everyday so you should love them!	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 18, 2021	labels:I'm renting a car to drive home with my SO (about a 14 hour drive). I rented from Avis and it was a bit expensive, about $450 (I purchased extra insurance). When I went to check on the rental, it said that the insurance was now $3,500 a day instead of $35 a day, so the rental would be more like $7,000. I was able to cancel the extra insurance, but wtf? In no way should it be legal to charge 14X the estimated price. The worst part is, no customer service agent was able to tell me why the charge increased, and the option for extra insurance just popped up at $35 a day.
text:Yes this! I call it “ideal style” and “real style”. My “ideal style” involves a lot of flowy, Christy Dawn-style dresses. My actual, “real style” is way more simple - in my free time I wear a lot of plain t-shirts, sweaters, and jeans/shorts. I’ve bought a couple of absolutely lovely dresses over the years that I never wear, but will reach for my favorite Everlane t-shirts and comfy sweaters over and over again.	labels:I call it my "aspirational" me.

I live in scandinavia and always wear skirts/dressea so I have to keep warm, so three quarters of the year I wear thicker knit tights (I go through like 3-4 pairs of my go-to grey cable knit tights every fall/winter), sometimes knee-high wooly socks, leggings over them to layer when it’s really cold, and I have a few warmer/thermo leggings too. Like, I’ve been basically living in a pair of Black Milk toasties leggings this entire fall (since I want to be both warm and colourful and that’s hard when it’s cold haha).  For keeping them up I have a pair of those little spandex shorts meant to shape the butt and tummy, but I wear them outside the tights. Also keeps the tights from wearing out in the crotch, bonus!	episode_done:True

text:I’ve seen people say this, but tbh hoarding is something completely different from eccentricity.

text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:I think what's consistent in the examples that you've shown is that she has a very minimalist style in darker colors. The quality of the fabric appears to be high. When you use natural fibers like cotton and wool and silk they will naturally drape better on any body type. Look for pieces like cocoon jackets, cropped wide leg trousers, and tunics for example. I hope this helps, I love the images you've selected. last thought is that if you are going to accessorize keep it somewhat simple and also high quality.	episode_done:True

Occasionally I will come across something that looks amazing from a brand I don't know, I will look it up and buy it if its a high quality brand. I generally stick to natural fibers, as polyester and rayon can be very hit or miss without feeling it. I don't buy anything with any damage. Thread up also has "premium" section but I find its kinda random what gets in there. You can also search by price >$10 and it will weed out a lot of junk.	episode_done:True

text:What Do You Wear With Strong Sentimental Value?	labels:I have a real basic Pulsar watch that my wife bought me because I lost a similar Pulsar watch that had been my Grandpa's. I imagine watches are actually probably one of the more common sentimental items.  Also used to have a hoodie that I'd had since 7th grade (so \~18 years), that got lost while moving just this year. It was from being on the swimming team and it was perfect. It also had the extra sentimental value of being a time in my life that I ended up meeting my, too this day, best friends. It still fit because it had most likely stretched out with me over the years and was fairly sheer in comparison to most sweatshirts. I run hot so it was great when a t-shirt was a little too chilly, but a sweatshirt was too hot. .  I also used to have another zip-up hoodie years ago that was a similar story that had just been one of my go-to items for like a decade . So more like a safety blanket than any particularly sentimental memories.	episode_done:True
text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:I'm not a fan of linen or silk, so natural fiber wise I'm good with cotton and that's about it. I can't do animal hairs (severe allergy) so I guess if we're avoiding synthetics, I'll just freeze in the winter? On the positive side, I rarely wash my sweaters as I wear them over top of other things so there's no need to. I guess at least I'm not polluting the water supply as badly there.   I think polyester has a place, like in gym leggings or that kind of thing. I had a pair of cotton based gym leggings and they got disgusting real quick. I also like a little polyester in some styles of clothing because it provides structure and a certain look that can be desirable on particular items.  Natural fibers, due to this movement, have gotten a lot more expensive. So this is another one of those ethical issues where those that can afford to spend the money and hunt around for more natural fabrics can do so, and you have to be careful not to degrade someone who can't do the same.	episode_done:True

text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:This might not be helpful at all, but here’s how it worked out for me:  My first realization was that (for me) basics are overrated. I only like certain types of pants and never wear basic, plain tees. So I got enough skinnie jeans to last me throughout the week (which is 3 in my case) - two in black, one in a timeless jeans shade. Then I got just enough lounge/sleepwear to last me between washes. I had a small handful of old sweaters and tees that I didn’t love and phased out (still keeping them around for yard work) when I got items I loved.  From here on I decied to take it slow and *only* get pieces that   a) worke with what I have, and b) genuinely excite me.  In my case that meant (second hand) designer pieces that I meticulously picked out.  They needed to be timeless, of high enough quality to last years, fit me and suit me, and reasonable to care for. (Learning how to properly care for your clothes goes hand in hand with that)  If I saw something I loved (for example an 80s Fendi monogram jeans skirt, a lovely navy blue N. Pearl men’s turtleneck that looks just the right kind of oversized on me) I’d jump at it, otherwise I made due with what I had.  I slowly built my wardrobe like that. I only purchased 2-3 pieces a month and was really really picky. I either bought outstanding “wow”-pieces, or items I *really* needed at the time (a winter coat for example).   While I don’t have a large variety of clothes to pick from, I’m genuinely excited to get dressed every day.	episode_done:True

text:>You don’t have to keep buying progressively more expensive stuff, and can instead enjoy what’s in a price tier you’re comfortable with.  This is one of the most level headed responses on the page and something that resonates with me. Basically all of my shoes are in the $300-$450 USD range and while I like having quality shoes and want to talk about GYW shoes and raw denim and stuff, it just is unfathomable for me to spend US$500+ on shoes at this time. Maybe when I'm making $200k a year I can think about spending that kinda money on shoes but it just doesn't make sense to me.  And, truly, if you're buying even a pair of AEs. If you don't wear them like a tool box, you will have them for years to come anyway.  Some of the other brands like Enzo Bonafe, John Lobb, etc, that other people have rec'd might not end up resonating with OP. They might, but they don't have to. I can appreciate people opening OPs eyes to other high end brands but it isn't necessary to buy them.  Hell, my most complimented shoes I have are a pair of Cole Haan Zero Grand sneaker oxford hybrids that my SO made me buy.  So a lot of the time, buying the high end shoes is only gonna matter to one person, that being the wearer. So buy whatever you want. Just make sure you do your best to get it to fit right.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Influencers with Jobs: A Brief Collection	labels:Love this - similarly, I work in a 9 to 5 office job (during Normal Times) and as much as I would love to, I can’t wear heeled OTK boots and a tiny shoulder bag to the office lol. For the weekends, sure! But that’s a minority of outfits.  I may be old school, but I still follow blogs as well as IG / YT:  9to5chic: OG officewear blogger, she used to work in marketing at a medical company, is now a marketing consultants  Feather Factor, she’s focused on her recent book now but was previously a product manager after earning her MBA from HBS.  The Luxe Strategist: Very thoughtful posts on finances, shopping and general lie stuff.  I’ll also add ExtraPetite / Jean Wang, though ever since she started blogging full time, her outfits aren’t nearly as consistently relevant for workplaces.  Also, pantsfessional is great - her posts got me interested in learning sewing, which has been a saving grace these past 8 months.  I’ve noticed with some of these, it’s less so ‘daily OOTD’ content and more often than not, a weekly/monthly cadence of varied content. Which might not fit the ‘influencer’ definition, but I still enjoy reading / consuming it!
text:I actually hate my Ruggable. I love the design, but it is horrible for a house with dogs that shed a lot. The only way I’ve found to get hair out of the rug is to get down and scrape it with my hands.

Ok, end rant!	labels:I hate mine too. My dog peed on it the day after we got it so I put it to good use right away, but it’s a pain in the ass to set up and the edge are rolled up	episode_done:True

Not to mention jeans repair, crotch on my nudies is more darning than original fabric now. Worn in look on a reliable pair of jeans that fit nicely is hard to imitate.      It's wierd how the simple home repair craft has been labeled un-manly, despite most of those paragons of manliness people put on pedestals singing the virtues of repairing objects used every day.

text:If you’re not yet ready to commit to investing in an expensive good quality winter coat (long ones are indeed more expensive!) before you get to feel out conditions for your new climate—an intermediate solution I recommend is that you wear a light/thinner puffer & a waterproof rain coat over it. Your puffer will keep you warm (and you can wear it solo on clear days) and the raincoat will give you snow/wind protection. They will also trap heat and warm the *air* surrounding your body, which is key!  Costco base layers are also wonderful quality and super affordable (and I think you can get them delivered online). I wore them on a pre-pan trip to Iceland during NOVEMBER and I would have to like race to rip them off when we got indoors because I would begin literally sweating lol but so warm when outside!	labels:Even a fleece and a raincoat will keep you warm.

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I often buy multiples of items I love. I bought several of the same cardigan after I realized that I wore it more than any other sweater I owned. It's great!  Another thing I do is, when I see an item I like, I mentally run through my closet and see if it will mesh with what I already own. If it works, I get it. If I'd have to buy several new items to make it work, I don't. For this reason, I don't own many t-shirts, but I do own lots of sweaters and dresses.
text:How many handbags do you have and which one is your most used?	labels:Currently, I have two Coach and one Kate Spade, but I tend to carry the same bag every day. When I get tired of what I'm carrying, I will switch it out with one I have or buy a new one. If I wanted a luxury bag like Chanel, I would either have to dip into savings for it or put it on credit (which is a no-no for me). I only buy what I consider affordable and that means easily paying cash for it (my range is Coach and Kate Spade).	episode_done:True
text:What were the fashion finds that made you cry of happiness?	labels:That has happened a few times - I found a pair of Giuseppe Zanotti stilettos in my size once for $70 at DSW too. Still own them and my most comfortable high heel. It was relatively conservative looking too so I can wear it with lots of things. The other time was a long knit circle skirt at Winners. It wasn’t the right size but I might have been able to squeeze into it since it’s a knit but someone bought it while I thought it over. Fast forward 6 weeks and I found one in my size on clearance for 60% off. I don’t think I snatched something that fast before...
text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:I think if you find a style appealing but don't actually wear it, it's not technically your style. Like I really appreciate romantic styles with volume, lace, ruffles, drama, etc but I rare wear clothes that could be described as romantic because it doesn't feel appropriate for work. I wouldn't describe my style as romantic, despite window shopping on the Oscar de la Renta site a lot.   But! I also don't really put a lot of thought into what my style is or what I think it is - I wear what makes me happy. While I do find value in expressing my personality in clothes, I try not to get too caught up in what it means or this mindset that if my style changes, who I am as a person changes.  I think your situation is different because you live at home and don't have quite as much freedom to choose what you can wear, so that gets a pass. It's quite possible that if you had the ability and freedom to wear what you wanted, you'd wear more alternative clothing.	episode_done:True

text:You rock. That is your style! Dressing eccentrically suits you, your personality, your profession, your passion - and you do it expertly with the knowledge and eye of a textile specialist. I think OP is talking about the trend of people paying tons of money to emulate the eccentric look without understanding any of it. Their goal is simply to project an image, not to express themselves. They're poseurs who collect a hodgepodge of fashionable pieces but never manage to come up with an ensemble that is really them.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I’ve seen people say this, but tbh hoarding is something completely different from eccentricity. Rich or not, if your living space is unsanitary because you have too much crap in your house or your spending addiction damages your life, then you’re a hoarder.  If you just have unconventional style or make whimsical choices (like carefully curating an unusual collection) then you’re eccentric.   These words have completely different definitions.	labels:It is, of course, but for a lot of reasons mental illness in wealthy people gets labeled as eccentricity long after it would be called what it is for the rest of us. If you’ve got a huge house and help to clean it, you can hoard a lot more for a lot longer before you hit that unsanitary state you mention, for instance.	episode_done:True

text:Kind working off of this premise, my mother always emphasized that a expensive designer purchase should be attached to a goal or important milestone.

I had been worked as a contracted worker for 2 years and was aiming to get a stable full time job. When it finally happened I gave myself the go ahead to purchase a bag and waited till I found one that I liked and fit my lifestyle (Small Chanel Gabrielle).	labels:	episode_done:True
text:When is a garment worth it to you?	labels:For most reasonably priced items, my rule is (unless there an urgent sale) to wait ~3-4 weeks.

text:Seems size 6 is a 50/50 size for a lot of people given the standard size is made for bigger feet. I have a few friends that wear a US size 6 and it's basically split down the middle between if they'll find the same shoe comfortable or not.  One of my friends revealed that she is SUPER flat footed so, even 2 inch heels can give her problems as a result even if it's a thick heel or a wedge style. Some of them were also just buying low quality shoes since they didn't want to spend a lot of money and then when they got better quality pairs, their shoes hurt far less. Quality definitely matters a lot.  Something as simple as the incline (outright influences the slope steepness) is a game changer as well. Not to mention ankle and nerve strength differing between two individuals. There's so many factors into why shoes are comfortable or uncomfortable for us but, it definitely appears most are unaware of the heel slope steepness and shoe size factors.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 23, 2020	labels:Oh trust me, I will gatekeep because it’s proved to be the only way to ensure the existence of standards.  And I don’t care about what you say you are. Fedoras/Dusters/Capes/whatever is not just clothing. It’s an entire lifestyle and subculture that you are unlikely to be privy to or even fit into if you lack the euphoria and pedigree. That’s just the reality.  You’re probably one of those people who believes anybody can be anything yada yada yada. Sorry to break it to you, but no matter how much I want to be, say, a gentlesir, it simply isn’t going to happen. I can don the wolf shirts all I want, but it doesn’t change the fact that because it isn’t who I was born, it’s something I’ll never be. The same goes for most of the people on this subreddit who, by most accounts, even detest and reject the trappings of class that can not be divorced from euphoria. It is a style of, by, and for the American lower basement class and below, and nothing you say will change that.   It’s literally a costume for most of the people on this sub, and frankly, it’s subversive and I despise it.

text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:If you don't have any requirements about synthetic fabrics, you have a lot more options. Are you in a climate controlled warehouse? I basically dress for outside weather every day just in case I get stuck out there all day.  Golf polos and dark jeans. T-shirts and tops with fancy/formal detailing (like a half zip and a little pocket, or a fabric with a neat pattern or modest see-through or lacey details on the shoulders). If they have giveaway or purchasable polos with the company logo those are a good option. I used to only wear unisex cotton blend tshirts to work on the days when I would be sweating a lot, but I invested in some nicer athletic fabric v neck tees from Under Armour and now even drenched in sweat I at least look better than I did in high school marching band camp. Also on the topic of sweating, if you know you'll get gross, bring a change of clothes so you can look and feel fresh for your afternoon meetings!  I've seen some womens' only safety toe brands, but never tried them. I use the free boot truck at work. But they have some that we call the "el jefe" boots, that look more like boating shoes or desert boots or are a nicer looking leather. Those might be a good option to make you feel confident and put together.  I think fit goes a long way to make you look professional (and like a boss).

text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:A slouchy cardigan in a muted pattern.  Not mine, but I got it for my dad: Sunspel Riviera - they have some really nice yet understated colours in this superb mesh fabric. The aubergine is such a comforting colour - dark and easy on the eye, yet discernably saturated with purple. Some duller purples verge on brown tbh.  If you are lucky enough to find a good one in a reasonable price range - a bespoke or at least MTM shirtmaker. I was on holiday in Naples, spent basically Gitman money on bespoke shirts that are infinitely more special. Absolutely no regrets, it just conforms to my shoulder slope perfectly without any adjustment, and the armhole is so well-cut it doesn't dig into my armpits and yet gives me freedom of movement without snagging or tugging on the body of the shirt as I move. It made wearing a shirt become a pleasure, from a chore.	episode_done:True

text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:I think everyone looks back on their teenage years as being super cringy... not because of our style but because the fashion itself from 10, 15 or 20 years ago *can seem* really awful when we look back. 20 years ago, I was 15. I look at what teenagers wear today and I'm like "damn.... I wish I'd had that sense of style." But I did, just in my time. We wore what we wore back then because it was a great way to help us explore, create, and share our identities in the sense of a larger concept of style. But those styles change, evolve, come back around, and disappear again over time. I think I looked ridiculous when I was 15, but back then, I was cool as hell!  Honor your own sense of style and what makes you feel comfortable, happy, and the most authentic expression of who you are. Those may all change over time, but enjoy the moment you're in.  I also had a big vintage clothing phase when I was around your age and perhaps my favorite thing was hitting the local thrift store and altering my finds to fit my size and style. My senior prom dress was actually 3 vintage gowns that I'd found and spliced together. Even today I would say that about a third of my wardrobe is vintage and thrift. The best way to wear vintage and thrift I would say is to learn how to make little alterations like hemming, changing buttons, adding or removing darts, or dyeing. I loved making things my own in simple, little ways.	episode_done:True

text:Matching shoes & purse	labels:I don’t think fashion has any rules anymore unless you’re royalty or it’s cultural.   I personally don’t like matchy matchy bag and shoes unless I’m going for a monochrome look. I tend to match tones rather than colours. I like a patterned bag (say Gucci dionysus or Fendi zucca or LV canvas) as opposed to patterned clothes because I find they blend in well with a variety of outfit choices.   If I do colour, I will make sure the tone matches. I can’t stand mixing warm times with cool tones. Eg I have a cool tone lilac paid of heels that I love wearing with my cool tone magenta bag.   You can also do opposite sides of the colour wheel with shoes and bags like a green bag and a purple/magenta pair of shoes. But again keep to the same tones. The key with fashion is the tone of colours, and that includes neutral colours too. I would always suggest everyone does a colour/tone analysis and then stick to buying items in that range. It makes mixing and matching easier.

text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I’m also a teen and I’m new to styling and clothes and fashion and all.  When I was little (basically from when I was 5 to like around 9) I was what some people called a stereotypical girly girl. I only wanted to wear skirts. Hated pants. I *loved* pink. I loved to wear cool and frilly skirts and also skirts with graphic prints (and by that I mean Hello Kitty I was obsessed lmao) and also I loved dresses.   Then when I was around 10/11 I started straying away from dresses and more towards jeans and sweatshirts and graphic tees and Hot Topic t-shirts. And basically just continued just that casual style with jeans and a t-shirt lol.   Now I’m starting to get into fashion and finding out what I like. I’m also getting into more vintage looking things thanks to vintage and sewing youtubers such as Karolina Zebrowska, Bernadette Banner, Rachel Maksy, and etc. Now I still have a lot of the Hot Topic shirts and jeans and all but I’m getting into styling them. And also I’ve gotten rid of a lot of my wardrobe that I just didn’t want/like/fit me anymore.  I have/had a lot of clothes that I like but I don’t feel especially passionate about. Very few pieces make me feel especially passionate or I love thoroughly. But  now I’m getting a few pieces that I know I’m going to *love* and are going to develop the style I want (which is probably a casually edgy victorian 50s Newsie with a modern twist lmao. Idk lol) And I’m also starting to get into sewing some clothes I like (haven’t started but I bought the supplies for sewing two skirts. ).   Also now I have a badass jean jackets and more beanies. I love beanies. Lol      Don’t really have much to say about my makeup journey because I don’t wear any. Other than when I was little I use to wear it for dance recitals and was into makeup. Then I just wasn’t anymore. Now I’m getting into skincare (because of my mom) and I’m considering getting some makeup and starting off with it. But I’m kinda clueless lmao.

text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:This post feels like it's coming from my brain! Yesterday I wore a bralette for the first time along with a low cut top and, while I was comfortable, I was also really self conscious. I ended up changing to a top with a higher neckline for a zoom hang with friends. I'm not used to my boobs being in a natural, saggy position on my body.  I have a figure that's somewhere between hourglass and pear shaped so I have always tried to dress in a way that makes my bust larger and higher in order to balance out my hips. Seeing the other posts on this thread gives me hope that it's just the need to re-train my eye.	episode_done:True

text:From my own experience, I'd say the best made "vintage" Andrew Marc leather jackets are better than a lot of "mall" brand leather jackets I've owned or tried like Kenneth Cole, Tommy Hilfiger, Reilly Olmes, Ralph Lauren Chaps. I have a Ralph Lauren POLO leather jacket (original MSRP $695) from 1999 made of a heavy leather that has held up wonderfully over the years and I'd say is better than the best Andrew Marc I've tried (but my experience is limited--there may be "gems" out there, like limited editions).	labels:90s Polo is kind of golden era polo, somewhat different to what we have 20 odd years later.      RL Polo iteration one happens in 67' , RRL comes in 93', and then Purple label is in 94', but over the years I think the gap in quality has really widened sadly.
text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:Don't be too worried about looking like everyone else, clothes aren't always about standing out. I think it's good to have a classy black dress just in case you get invited somewhere you have to dress nice. Like maybe you need to do a poster presentation for your thesis, or your org has a formal. They're easy to dress up or down depending on accessories.    Honestly, if you can't think of an occasion where you'd wear one, then you don't need one! I just like the simplicity of a black dress sometimes, esp if you have accessories that you want to emphasize.	episode_done:True
text:Andrew Marc New York Leather Jackets -- exploring the different "grades" of this brand	labels:What is Andrew Marc quality comparable to?
text:In the interview Boyer mentions buying a custom three-piece flannel suit around 1965 for $125 — which would be $1,027 in 2020 dollars. That’s obviously quite a bit less than a similar piece would cost on Savile Row today, but it’s not like that was a cheap piece for a recent college grad at the time. I don’t know all the ins and outs around why the cost of tailored clothing rose faster than inflation, but I suspect it has a lot to do with the casualization of the Western wardrobe sharply reducing the demand for both bespoke clothing and its inputs (like wool), which meant the industry couldn’t profit from volume.  Inflation in particular seems to be an element people have difficulty mentally grappling with over time. If a guy grows up thinking a pair of jeans should cost $50, he’s likely to consider anything more than that outrageous even decades later, when the money is worth 3x less. I think this is an under-appreciated element of the race to the bottom in our clothing — it’s not just that Instagram encourages everyone to wear different clothes in every picture, it’s also that we’re conditioned to think price tags should never increase over time. The clothes most people wear every day are significantly cheaper than they used to be in real terms, and that was only made possible by using cheaper labor and cheaper materials.	labels:Furthermore, that generation wasn't really bothered by inflation, as the wages were generally keeping up with it. But since the late 70s, early 80s, wages have stagnated for most. I think this is the reason most people cannot justify saving for a higher quality item. Good quality garments nowadays are keep getting further out of reach for most.	episode_done:True

I feel like it always takes me a couple of months to decide whether I really like something or not (or if it’s just exciting because it’s new) so I tend to accumulate a lot of “not exactly right” things regardless of how careful I am with the initial purchase.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Totally agreed, and this is why it makes me a bit squirmy when people say "wear what makes you happy!" in this sub, in the sense that it should be the last word in clothing. Yes, of course you should wear what makes you happy, but what makes us happy to wear is not so simple for a lot of people.  There are tons of things I don't particularly love in isolation but make me happy on my body, and conversely things I love in isolation but *don't* love on my body, and that can come from many angles: pure aesthetics but also fit, comfort, personal goals, how I'm treated when I'm wearing it, etc etc. What exact elements contribute to any of these is really the crux of personal fashion, and it's a far more complex conversation than just "wear it if you like it".	labels:Yeah, "wear what you like!" is an unhelpful platitude. It's the "just be happy!" of fashion advice, it doesn't tell you HOW to get where you want.	episode_done:True

Today I ruined my last good pair of chinos. Anyone know a brand that could work for me without the need for fitting? I like chinos and a slim, fitted look.

I am a bigger guy 6’2” and about 260 pounds and have always worn the 511 style with a 38 waist and a 32 length. I work in higher end retail and I wear these pants almost everyday so I need something that will look professional in the fashion industry and also hold up. I’m willing to spend more money (trying to stay under $250, but if I can get a few years out of the pants it’s worth it).

text:Your #1 tip is helpful, but my concern with sizing up is that I don't have a particularly large waist. My butt/thigh to waist ratio is a bit off in that I have naturally big thighs/a big butt compared to my waist. So if I simply sized up I would be quite loose at the waist. My jeans have already been a bit loose as is :(   As another redditor commented, I may have to look into the cut itself as to simply sizing up.   As for #2 and #3, thank you for clarifying. I've learned a lot in this post!	labels:Maybe experiment with types of fits, not just size. For example, Levi’s has the 541 athletic fit, Naked & Famous has the “Weird Guy”.

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:Hm, I wonder if the same thing is happening there as has happened to so many other business sectors since the start of the MBA boom.   * Company has a fine, high quality product  * Consumers buy it on reputation * MBA comes in, cuts costs and quality * Consumers continue to buy assuming quality is the same * Profit margins up massively, MBA takes the opportunity to leave on a high note * Consumers finally realize it's garbage and stop buying * MBA already gutting the next brand  It's been happening everywhere the last few decades.
text:What ultimate-splurge fashion item would you buy to reward yourself for achieving a big milestone?	labels:Probably a Cartier Tank or Panthere watch.

It might be time to invest in a "forever watch" in the near future.     Edit:  The ultimate spurge would be a Chanel classic flap for my mom.  When I was in law school (and pretty broke), I gave my mom two Chanel lipsticks for Christmas and wrote in the card:  one day, this will be a bag.

text:That's how I interpreted the question as well.  The "third piece" rule pretty much would have you to put a third piece on top, and in winter, that third piece is a coat, and once you are inside you don't wear the coat anymore.  For me, I typically have an indoor third piece waiting for me, ie a neutral color cardigan at my desk, so when I take off my kickass outerwear I can still complete the look with a third piece for indoors.  If that's not possible for whatever reason I'll wear the indoor third piece under the outdoor third piece because if it's cold enough to wear the winder coat, a thin cardigan isn't going to seriously mess up the temperature calculus.	labels:	episode_done:True

I can be super picky when it comes to clothes. I know exactly what I want and what would look good on me but it's hard to find both in stores with a limited selection but it's also hard in the endless sea of clothes that is Poshmark/ThreadUp.   Sometimes online shopping makes it easier to filter things out but other times it makes things harder and not being able to try it on is a huge downside. I have so many things from Poshmark that I've just donated because I didn't like the fabric or the fit.   What don't you love about the clothes out there you're seeing right now?

text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I am a teacher that went back to working in the building at the beginning of September, so to be fair I was only wfh for several months in the spring, but it still drastically changed my style, or my perspective on my style.   Pre-Covid my work style (and general style) had morphed over the years to become very, very minimal and neutral. Lots of Everlane and Eileen Fisher. This was both because I wanted to be taken seriously at my job (I read very young) and because it also seemed like what was in style to me.   Returning to work in the fall, I realized I really f*cking hated all of my sensible, plain, go with everything black and grey clothes.   I still really prefer earth tones and blacks and greys, and I still wear some pretty simple outfits somedays, but I went on a small spree on The RealReal after I had my realization. I bought myself some louder statement pieces that feel more me, including an embroidered Happy Sheep sweater, a knit Missoni sheath dress, a multi-colored leather and fur purse, platform oxfords, and a couple of geometric patterned silk shirts and dresses.   For me life is too short to try so hard to be timeless and professional. I’m not knocking the look, it just isn’t ~me~ I want to love the clothes I wear and the clothes I love are fun knits and patterns.

text:I want to be that bada*** biCTH (Ik it's spelt wrong, it's meme bro lol sry. Plus idk if we can swear, I don't post) tl;dr at the end cuz I tend to rant :)	labels:You've gotten on the wrong train to self confidence. You're becoming a negotiation between different people, rather than your own self. You're totally focused on your appearance and your clothes as a way to get confidence, but that isn't the way. Body image is not related to the way that you look; study after study has shown that even after drastic appearance changes, most peoples' body image stays the same unless they work on it in other ways. Aim for body neutrality, and focus your efforts on things that will actually give you some level of self confidence. Consider reading the book My Body Is Not An Apology and detoxing your social media from "self-improvement" accounts that are only focused on appearance under the guise of "wellness."   What's your 5 year plan to become independent? What are you doing to become involved in your community? What opportunities have you not considered for your future - from teaching English abroad, to artist residencies, to trade school, to university, and beyond? Whose advice have you sought out? What have you read, and who have you contacted? What inspiring WOC outside the entertainment industry, who are NOT self-help "gurus" or "wellness "inspo", do you follow on your social media? The only thing you have to do now is become who you are. Concentrate on figuring out your values, your hopes, your dreams, etc, in isolation of what other people think. This is hard to do, but it's possible.  Dress however you want. The most common outcome of a teenage girl going on a diet of any kind is that she becomes obese; studies have shown that when compared to overweight teenage girls not put on diets, overweight teenage girls put on diets are much more likely to become obese. Set up healthy habits for yourself, like going to bed at the same time every night and getting an hour of good exercise that you enjoy - whether that's an hour long walk, or walking and jogging, or yoga, or boxing. Literally whatever.	episode_done:True

Buy what you like, wear it were you are feel safe. You might start by just wearing it around your room. Taking selfies and such. Get a feel for how you wear the clothes for yourself. Eventually start pushing your boundaries a little. Be paciente with yourself  This will get easier as you get older, think of your age as an advantage for your adventure not a hindrance. Do the same thing with your body. When I was your age, I was self-conscious of my big butt and thighs. Now they are in style.  You are enough as is

I have my original diamond & platinum set, plus an eternity band in yellow gold that I wear when I’m wearing yellow gold jewelry and an emerald cut eternity band that I wear when I wear my emerald cut three stone right hand ring.   My birthstone is emerald so I have several pieces with this stone. My son’s birthstone is sapphire so I have both a blue sapphire ring and a yellow sapphire ring.   Casual jewelry is yellow gold usually - hoops in various sizes, bangles, gold chains & pendants, my Tiffany bold T ring in 18k is one of my fave pieces to wear for a minimalist look. I also like the Mejuri slim dome ring for this as well.  I do have pearls - a vintage strand that was my grandmother’s and I have matching pearl studs plus black pearl studs.   For earrings I mostly always wear hoops. I have yellow and white gold hoops in all sizes small to large and diamond hoops in mid size and large.

I also love oversized/loose-fitting pieces with weird structural details or unique drapes.

text:Craig Green Spring 2021 Menswear Collection	labels:Feels like a pretty of a retrospective collection this time around. The collection defining details are all in the small things (neckties, sneakers), while the big things that make the silhouette are refinements of things from past seasons (tents, fisherman hats, even an iteration on the window bags(?) from FW20). The vests look like they could be a reference to the tennis silhouettes from the Bjorn Borg collab Craig did way back when. Still a banger of a collection, though. Nothing wrong with a little comfortable consistency right now.   The Adidas collab is still going hard. Can't wait to see that cast shoe show up on r/malefashion.

text:One thing I really want to highlight with Drake's is that while the value proposition is reduced in terms of the items themselves (e.g. soft shouldered tweed jackets, etc) due to new competitors, Michael Hill's eye for colour is still one of the best in the game. His choice of pattern is amazing too, striking just the right balance between stodgy and kitschy to achieve a real sense of fun and enjoyment out of a more dressed up look.	labels:An example of this is the first Drake's shirt I bought - a cranberry + white university stripe oxford shirt. I stumbled across it in their London shop on sale 5 or so years ago in the dead of summer, and in the subsequent years have appreciated how many things it goes with - sure navy sport coats, but also greys, greens and browns all can work as well.     I bought it because it was beautiful and well constructed, but over time I have come to appreciate how versatile it is, when "cranberry and white stripes" probably wouldn't make many "Top 10 Shirts for Work" lists	episode_done:True
text:What high quality fashion or style related hashtags do you follow on IG?	labels:One that I like is #averagegirlsize to keep my Instagram feed somewhat grounded to reality. It’s cool to see how ‘normal’ girls dress!  Not sure if this one fits the bill, but I find some of my favorite brand or designer tags quite helpful to figure out more ways to wear clothes that I may already have, or am thinking about getting from them. My favorite is #zimmerman.
text:General Discussion - October 25	labels:On my bi-annual Bollywood film kick. Watched *Dear Zindagi* last night, watched *Kal Ho Naa Ho* today.  One thing I've noticed is how heavily Bollywood costume designers/stylists leaned heavily on trends at the time of shooting. So much so that the clothes add an extra layer of dated-ness when you watch these movies 5, 10, 20+ years later.	episode_done:True
text:Why Ralph Lauren Never Goes Out of Style	labels:RL is and was an absolute visionary at creating a lifestyle brand that is instantly American. It never shies away from the idealized Americana that Ralph cultivated either, which is why I think most of the vintage pieces are still relevant even in 2020.   The recent documentary about RL was a fantastic look into his philosophy of style.   And Double RL...man those are some of my dream pieces right there. I was recently at the RRL store in Malibu and it was an unreal retail experience.	episode_done:True

Its much easier to move belts than a lot of clothes.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:I thrift quite a bit and take items to my local alterations tailor. Think vintage made in USA items made using natural fabrics (cotton, wool, cashmere). Sometimes they are made with older, odd, or boxy fits that are slightly off. Which leads me to the diminishing returns of...   Tailoring and Alterations (in relation to fit): These costs can add up quickly - and sometimes the end result will not be satisfactory.  Simple alterations like taking in the waist or sleeves usually work out - but major surgery with jacket shoulders and major pant adjustments usually are not worth the effort.    It's ok to pass on a sale or leave an item on the rack if you know the fit or alterations won't work out for you. On the other hand, it can be worth the extra $ to purchase something if it fits very well off-the-rack.	episode_done:True

I know my grandparents used to have a rule about no hats at the dining table, so I’d take mine off then (this was when I was a kid and had a sunhat - it was also impolite to put your hat on the table even if there was room).

I'd rather be present for my family.  Hope you all are able to enjoy the holidays in your own way, that you stay safe and healthy, and that we all have a much better 2021!  Best,  Met
text:A work shirt will generally have two chest pockets and be lighter weight in a fabric like chambray, or a lighter flannel/twill.   Overshirts and shirt jackets will tend to have flapped chest pockets and maybe hip pockets and be a little heavier - maybe moleskin or corduroy or heavier flannel.   A chore jacket will be heavier again - wool or heavy twill or canvas maybe, and classically have two patch hip pockets and an external patch chest pocket and an internal chest pocket. Chore jackets will normally be cut much boxier too, and will have plain instead of button cuffs.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What would you wear to elope during a pandemic?	labels:I would still wear a wedding dress. I sort of eloped and the airlines lost my wedding dress for 5 days and I got married in a sundress. It's been 11 years and I'm still sad about it. We always said we'd go back and have a do-over, but things happened and life continues to happen and I'll never get to run around Vegas in my wedding dress. I have worn it any chance I get though! Holiday parties or other random events. People are always weird about it "um. Is that a wedding dress?" Me: hell yeah ! I love my wedding dress. I'm gonna wear it as long as I can! I feel like a mother fucking princess in it!" Also, I'm happy I work hard to stay fit enough to still fit into it. Haha. I bought it on Craigslist for $400. I love it. I will continue to wear it as much as possible without any cares because I feel good in it.   That being said. Wear what you feel best in! If it's a wedding dress or sweat pants. YOLO it with all your confidence.	episode_done:True

I am a highly sensitive person and I will not wear clothing that is “scratchy.” If it rubs me I am cranky pissy and have to change.   I need to be comfortable. Not tight, soft and smooth cotton or polyester. I do not like silk or anything like silk, I do not like lace especially if it’s under my armpits. It rubs.   I’m just thrift and feel the fabric before buying. I always reach for leggings and T-shirts because I am a houseplant now.   So I don’t like things with tight arms because I have fat flabby arms. So tshirts and tank tops for me. I do not like long sleeves.   Also I am always hot! So long sleeves are almost always a no.   And shoes. Omg shoes! I have have have to wear comfortable shoes or I actually cannot function.	episode_done:True

text:Hot Southern Gothic Summer / Inspo album / Because we needed another for 2021!	labels:not southern US, but Picnic at Hanging Rock is such a great, dreamy, and spooky movie about a group of schoolgirls who go missing at while on a picnic in Edwardian Australia. its so surreal, and the costumes are so lovely! the movie was even shot using a camera with a thin gauze of fabric over the lens to give the whole thing a dreamy weird vibe.
text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:I’d agree that personal comfort is the big thing.    I’d also pay attention to the content of the compliment. “That’s a cool sweater” is NOT the same thing as “you look great in that sweater”, KWIM?   Sometimes people are appreciating the design or color or novelty of an item and not the big picture of how it works for you.
text:Fashion Favorites	labels:Definitely wool coats—the longer the better, preferably with nice sharp shoulders and a big collar that stays up if you pop it. Blazers, too: anything with strong shoulders, a nipped waist and a slightly longer length.   Silk scarves and vintage clip on earrings—I have a bit of an obsession with both. The combination can dress up a lazy outfit in seconds, in a way that's appropriate for any occasion.  Flowy midi skirts and dresses, especially pleated or wrap-around designs. Much more comfortable than jeans, and eye-catching, too.  Blouses: button-front silk shirts, cotton Liberty prints, and anything white/cream with lace or ruffles.  And because we're still in a pandemic...silk satin face masks. I've actually enjoyed matching them to my outfits!

text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I don’t know about everyone but for me there are pieces of jewelry I own that even if not currently trendy I still use and reach for time and time again.  Hoop earrings - not large and not too small - a pair in gold and a pair in silver.   Diamond studs. Pearl studs.  Thin bangle bracelets - again silver and gold.  Thick cuffs. Depending on my outfit I like having the weight of a cuff on my wrist. It can make me feel like Wonder Woman!  I think bold rings are beautiful on my hands. I have a ring my Mom gave me. It’s an oval dome turquoise stone set in gold. It’s an unusual piece and I love it!   I have a good quality watch I only used for special occasions because it clashes with my Fitbit.  I have a very old (60+) gold crucifix with intricate open scroll work and a tiny red ruby in the center. It’s about an inch long and I’ve been searching for the right chain so it lays right about my cleavage. The gold is from Greece so it’s hard to match the color of the gold. I would wear this all the time.	episode_done:True

text:Is it disgusting to not wear socks with shoes?	labels:She's a jerk, but also it's better for the shoes if you wear no-show socks.
text:I keep getting moth holes in suit jackets - how to solve problem?	labels:Put clothes away cleaned and you have fewer issues. The grubs like to eat the human oils we leave on clothing.   You can also wrap/bag your clothes, better still vacuum pack them if that won't crease the clothes too much. Freezing them also works.  I've had good success with cedar cubes in drawers too, I haven't found it to be a myth but maybe it's coincidence nothing got eaten. You need to give them a little sand to keep them fresh every year or so.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I find some websites also have good customer service centers where you can ask questions about sizing and get a better idea of fit. So I'd find those companies and just reach out.   That said, I certainly have just stuck with what I know - no new styles for me! I was eyeing up a very nice jacket and even put it in my cart only to panic and abandon the order, because I just wasn't sure the style would work on me.	episode_done:True
text:You could always contact them! Their instagram is always active and you should be able to get a response. Also from what I know, the fabrics are certified organic and are from small specific mills. Also Alejandro makes all the clothes by hand. If I'm not mistaken, Alejandro is also mexican and is doing work based on his heritage. Small businesses like these don't make 90% profit because it takes time, money and effort to create a small amount of clothing.   As for myself, I'm not 100% sure on mexican traditional clothing and how much they cost but I know that their western style clothing is worth the price. It's a different style of clothing that you don't really see and something special like this is worth the price at times.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Are there any actual fashion trends in 2020?	labels:we must be living on different planets.   lingerie as camisoles, fur trim everything, distressed tops, denim skirts, sweater vests, low rise pants, straight leg replacing skinny jeans, patchwork jeans, patterned tights, flared leggings, corset tops, fur lined boots, super tall platform shoes, juicy tracksuits, animal prints, tie dye, hand and leg warmers, fluffy bags, all were super popular trends last year. this has been the most trend heavy year in my memory, I could barely keep up.

text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I had a school uniform til 17 and truly wore the most random clothing until I was done university. I never thought of the clothes I owned as a whole, and instead just picked up whatever piece of clothing caught my little magpie eye.   When I was about 23 I started looking at my clothes a bit more strategically in terms of “outfits” rather than “items” as in, if I want to have these cool funky pants then maybe I need to have a simple black shirt to go with it. When I started I definitely got sucked into the “essentials in every wardrobe” lists but in the last two years (since I was 24!!) or so I have learned stopped using those as a template for my own closet.   It also helped that I became a bit more confident in myself — I used to just want to blend in and be unnoticed and that showed in my wardrobe, but now I am happy to be wearing something a little more out there. I have always loved the ripped jeans, all black, big stompy boots look, but where I grew up was so not a big stompy boots country that you couldn’t even find items like that back in my day. Now that I’m older I’m more confident in wearing those kinds of items.    Since that is my main style I don’t vary too much from it, but I have been enjoying working on little “mini capsules” of items that are a style I like to delve into occasionally, such as a cowboy/cottagey look or just looking like a disco ball. I have a very narrow colour palette of 3 colours so  as long as my mini capsule items are the same three colours I can wear them head to toe for eg a full cottagey look, or I can just wear my peasant blouse and black jeans to tone it down. :)	episode_done:True

I still spend time trying out new outfits, to keep it fresh since I'm not buying much right now. I'd encourage you to try it out, even if you don't have plans to leave the house!

text:Shitpost Saturday: Fashion Resolutions	labels:Now that we're in week 579 of quarantine, I've forgotten what day of the week it is, which is... not great.  The solution is obvious: Day of the Week Underwear!  This will ensure that not only do I always know what day of the week it is, but I'll also go back to changing my underwear daily.   I also have resolved to only thrift my clothing, so I bought a used pack of day of the week underwear on ebay. It's missing Wednesday, but Wednesday is the worst day of the week anyway, so I'm just going to skip Wednesdays and go straight to Thursdays. Then, every two months, I'll have a leap week, where I don't wear any underwear at all, so that I can "reset" to the proper days of the week.   A flawless plan!

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 13, 2021	labels:I (M) am looking for a leather jacket that will last me many years.   - Budget: $300 US, with about $50 in wiggle room if absolutely necessary. - Color: prefer black, but I'll flex if I love another option. - Fit: slim, but I'm willing to compromise if I genuinely love the jacket.  I'd like to be able to buy from a physical store, so something at a common US chain like Macy's or Men's Warehouse would be fantastic. I live near Dayton, OH, so access to boutique shops isn't stellar.  At this price range, I'm not buying something I wouldn't wear every day for the rest of my life, so being able to try it on is extremely important to me. I would love to go bespoke, but I can't justify that, especially given how much more that would cost.

text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:I really enjoy this approach, it reminds me of leveling up an RPG character. Pushes lots of my good serotonin buttons, and of course means I can sit on a bigger pile of cash and be financially independent sooner!	episode_done:True
text:Help needed for buying jeans online! All advice is welcome!	labels:I just bought a pair of jeans online. I went with the “calculate your size tool” on the website to double-check what size I should get since it was a UK company (Californian here), and struck out. I don’t have any tips, but I am sending good vibes your way.  ETA: I guess if I do have a tip; it’s to go with your gut. Had I gone with my gut, I would have wouldn’t have listen to the calculator and it’s stupid “70% of people” got a size X and “30% got Y.” I went with the X even though my initial instinct was to go with Y. Always trust your instincts.	episode_done:True

text:I was about to say! The reason I'm not buying "mom jeans" is because they're going to make me look like exactly that--a frumpy mom, not a cool, hip 20-something who is wearing them ironically and who has a body that looks good even if the clothes aren't flattering.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Best and Worst Purchases of 2020?	labels:Best: 3 tees and 2 beanies from National Athletic Goods/Homespun. The quality is just so great, the fits are awesome, and if you love neutral toned basics made in Canada these are the way to go.   Runner up: Crescent Down Works Montagne Down Parka. Was super stoked to get a down coat that was made ethically and made in the US or Japan, was able to snag this one brand new for 50% off. My only complaint is it’s a little long so my hands don’t reach the pockets perfectly but that’s really not a huge issue.  Worst: Visvim Virgil folk in suede. These were really gorgeous and I was totally star struck when I got my hands on them, was super super disappointed with how uncomfortable they are. Not that they’re objectively uncomfortable, my feet are super flat and wide so they just don’t have the arch I need. Was able to sell them the other day so all is good.	episode_done:True
text:What pieces would you love "backups" of?	labels:This is pretty uninspired, but I have a lot of basics that I wish I had bought in duplicates, but didn't buy in duplicates, because I figured they were basics and I could always just get more.   Alas. The styles changed just a bit, and now I can't find the plain white tanks and tees I want because the sleeves and the neckline and the length are all just a tiny bit off. Thank you for reading along, this not-a-real-problem is very frustrating at times.
text:What’s the comfiest material you can put in a washing machine without fuss?	labels:I love Supima or Pima cotton and modal. Preferably a blend of both! It's the smoothest soft knit blend. You can get tees made out of this fabric at L.l. Bean, Lands' End, etc.	episode_done:True
text:Where do you get good quality, legit wool sweaters that won't rip/shrink after washing?	labels:Basics? Woolovers and Pendelton. It worries me a bit that you’re reporting rips though. Maybe put them in lingerie bags first. Wash on cold and air dry and there should be no shrinkage.

text:General Discussion - November 26, 2020	labels:just had a chat about the topic u/Anthraxistaken brought up yesterday about people wanting to wear Nazi uniforms and their only response was  “I’m upset because those uniforms should be in a memorial”.

text:Fall/winter shoe trends: what's your dream wishlist?	labels:more over the knee boots. the black ones are good to throw away already. i'd like to get a pair of coloured ones (loved the dark red from last year). perhaps dark green or dark blue.  some chunky heels in colours i don't have. navy blue is the worst offender, but i need a pair of dak green as well.  another season of window shopping flats and not liking anything. i don't know what to say anymore about flats. i should have some yet i don't like anything.	episode_done:True

text:Seconding this. After years of experimenting, I’ve finally landed on a style that feels right to me and have a curated closet full of beautiful things I love, but I’m not wearing any of that right now.

text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:My jewelry style is very simple so I tend to wear the same thing daily. I invested in solid gold necklaces and studs for this purpose. If I want to mix things up a bit with my earrings, I have purchased filled gold or at least gold plated. My plan is to see if I like the style and if I wear them enough before I invest in the solid gold versions of them. These days it seems like I purchase jewelry exclusively from Etsy!	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:Boots - Blundstones. Can’t beat them for comfort and longevity. I’ve had all sorts of high end shoe brands from Alexander Wang to Rag and Bone and Acne but nothing comes close to a pair of blunnies imho.	episode_done:True
text:Indochino VS Local custom clothier (HM Cole). My fair review.	labels:I would agree with the overall sentiment to get an OTR suit and tailor but I will also add, in my own opinion, to avoid Indochino whenever possible.    I purchased a suit from them that was really bad because it was too small.    Then they sent a recut that was too large.  Both had arms set at different angles by a few degrees leading to weird darts of fabric showing up on the back and the chest.  One sleeve, out of the four, was wavy all the way down instead of a straight line with a bend at the elbow.  I'm not even sure how it was possible.    Then they sent ANOTHER recut that was again too small.    My local tailor I took it to said there was little chance of salvaging any of them, given the level of complexity it would require to do so.  Not a simple pinch-tuck-hem situation.  This process took over two months and when I got tired of the shot gun attempts they were sending me, I asked for a refund and they refused.  Even though their claim is  *"Every INDOCHINO purchase is backed by our Fit Promise. If your order does not meet expectations, let us know and we will make it right."* their customer service rep told me *"Yes, using alterations or a remake to get the right fit. There is no mention of refunds, as this is not something we offer."*  Once you drop $500 on a suit, you're stuck with it.  Even if they made it so poorly, the tailor tells you they can't do anything.  Today I'm down $500 on a wonky suit that I never wore and will likely end up giving to Goodwill.  I'd strongly advise everyone to look elsewhere and just avoid the hassle altogether. It's a gamble that's not worth it.
text:Are there any actual fashion trends in 2020?	labels:we must be living on different planets.   lingerie as camisoles, fur trim everything, distressed tops, denim skirts, sweater vests, low rise pants, straight leg replacing skinny jeans, patchwork jeans, patterned tights, flared leggings, corset tops, fur lined boots, super tall platform shoes, juicy tracksuits, animal prints, tie dye, hand and leg warmers, fluffy bags, all were super popular trends last year. this has been the most trend heavy year in my memory, I could barely keep up.
text:General Discussion - December 23, 2020	labels:Not to bring up the cape thread again, but something really has been stuck in my craw. It was some comment about how people who basically wear cowboy shit are “attention seekers.” This was very clearly framed as a bad thing. Western wear aside, I feel like the subtext of the comment was basically “if you’re not wearing something to fit in, you’re seeking attention.” Isn’t the pursuit of dressing better/more fashionably inherently attention seeking? And why is that a bad thing? I don’t understand what seems to be the lurker notion of “wanting to dress better to blend in better.” If wearing the shit I wear labels me as an “attention seeker,” then I’ll wear that badge proudly.   Sorry for the rant, this really just got under my skin
text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:Most of the fashions we see today I feel like doesn’t celebrate the style, but the very specific tall thin model body that wears it.  I’m tall-ish but also apple shaped and broad shouldered with narrow hips and no waist. (Also officially overweight, thanks quarantine)   I think what helped is that i started following a lot of OOTD accounts from people here on ffa from waywt and the midsize and plus-size style hashtags on Instagram. These helped me normalize seeing confident, stylish people in different sizes and now if/when I try to emulate their style, I’m less disappointed. If you look at @timorous.me on Instagram she has a style blogger index where you can search for people of similar measurements to you. It’s helped me a lot.	episode_done:True
text:How would you style or rebuild your wardrobe around your holy grail fashion piece?	labels:Pear shape with a big arse - I want Lauren Bacall style wool trousers. Fluid, full, and fitting just so on the waist. Styled classic for work with an equally full and fluid washed silk shirt, rolled up sleeves and tucked in with a patent waist belt. For brunch dates with a bateau neck tee that fits like a second skin, and for evenings with a low backed long sleeved version of the same. A chunky, cropped length fisherman’s jumper if theres a chill on casual strolls

text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:I've done so twice and the first time was a disaster.   I was trying to combine advice about "classic and timeless" pieces with a look based around an entirely different aesthetic, and it turned into a mess. I was still holding onto outdated assumptions about what was fashionable. I was trying to do too much at once. I have almost no pieces left from that year.  I am convinced that for 99% of people, "classic and timeless" is a scam. If you sew your own Victorian-style pieces, that's awesome. If you have a lot of time and money to spend a lot of time looking for the perfect 100% silk and cashmere pieces from different decades, that's awesome too. Otherwise, there's a good chance that you're in denial about a dated wardrobe. A better goal for most people is to get to a place where you can update with new pieces slowly - maybe 2-3 per year. I will be buying one new wool sweater this winter.  A good place to start is with what you already gravitate to in your daily life and your own closet. Imagine that you really want to go to work (or your favorite restaurant or to do something fun on the weekend, whatever you do often) tomorrow wearing something that makes you feel special and look your best, but you're going to be wearing it all day, so it needs to be pretty comfortable. Which outfit do you pull out?   In my own wardrobe, I can look through the outfits I passed by and say why - too casual (although sometimes those are perfect for another activity), I just don't love it and it would never be my first pick, too tight, too cheap-looking, not my style, too boring. It's easier to build around what you already like than to throw everything away and try to buy things based on an imaginary person that you've never actually been. Get rid of the things that you never gravitate toward, and see what's left. From there, you might need just a few more wish-list pieces to get that smaller wardrobe you love.	episode_done:True

text:Fall 2020 Fit Battle - Elite 8 - Discussion	labels:I've been doing very shitty analysis/writeups for every other round, so might as well continue the trend!   **8888plasma** vs HalftheGoldTreasure: Plasma's pattern mixing here is really great, very luxe overall. I wish we had an alternate with the sleeves down though. Chuck's depriving us of having MAXIMUM fun with layering the shirt, but I really like how the different colors pop out of the sweater. However, don't think the popped collar works very well with the neck of the sweater, worked better last week imo. ^^^I ^^^died ^^^for ^^^this, ^^^Chuck? ^^^for ^^^THIS!?     Rariora vs Salutorian: Really fuck with Rariora's drop shoulder cardigan. Top half feels like comfy wfh, bottom half feels more formal, to me it feels kinda incongruent. Sal's fit has really grown on me, the sock and sandals combo in the deets shot is so damn cool.  This one got more difficult for me the longer I looked at them. Haven't voted on this one yet, gunna let it stew.     NgoKnows vs **DeLaJoel**: DLJ knocks it outta the park here, such a cool fil. Colors and silhouette are just awesome all around. The shirt is such an awesome piece. Really dig Ngo's fit too, especially with the scarf. Feels like it should be in a Fall inspo album. But Cheesin' Joel is just too powerful.     **Chunsak** vs Thecomebackkid: Good god man. I really really like TCK's fit overall, but I think Chun's fit here is the best of the whole battle. Absolutely phenomenal stuff.	episode_done:True

text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels: I don’t know that I have a unique style, but I remember my first office job where I could wear something more than the company assigned uniform. I was super excited too!    I would hold off on your shopping spree until you work in office for a bit. That way you can make sure what you buy not only incorporates your style, but is also something you feel comfortable wearing in an office setting.   I tend to work with an older, more conservative crowd but I am having a hard time picturing wearing crop tops in an office setting, maybe I am completely wrong, but I think you want to get the feel for working there (and how much effort you are realistically going to put into dressing up each day!) before you spend a lot of $$!	episode_done:True
text:Lol blogs as old school  I’m truly not laughing at you, just myself.

Crew shirts made out of a material that feels exactly the same, but they don’t say Oxford on them. I also have a few other shirts that look the same but the material feels different. The labels say their material composition (like 98% cotton 2% elastane for example) but not what type of cotton it is.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:I work in fashion and you’re spot on about the acrylic. Very uncomfortable fiber to have as a primary content on a smooth fabric. Fine if it’s in a yarn...I would say knowledge about fiber content is key, which you seem to be aware of.   There are no hard and fast retails as markers for quality in fashion. I have Uniqlo jeans for $20 that have held up pretty well. I’d say you’re spot on again when you ask about brands in this respect. Some brands offer customers a great value AND value their customers.   I agree with the comments here that say if it sparks joy and you wear it, then it’s worth the money, on both the low end and the high end.   However, shopping online can be extremely deceptive sometimes. In my experience Free People is one is the biggest offenders in this. Their stuff just looks horribly cheap once it’s in your hand.   So something that sparks joy in on a model in a photo might not once you get it home. I’d just say shop with your heart and be prepared to make returns.   Personally, I shop vintage a lot and I am pretty selective about the brands I buy new from.	episode_done:True
text:When did skinny jeans go out of fashion?	labels:Women in fashion have stated that skinny jeans have been out for years now. They at first were replaced with mom jeans, than wide leg coulotts, than the high rise straight leg and now I'm seeing a lot of low rise boot cut. That being said in everyday life I am still seeing a large majority of women still wearing skinny jeans
text:Everyone’s opinions on Youtube fashion channels?	labels:I only follow 2-3 fashion youtubers now. This might sound really snobby but I can’t stand the way alot of fashion/beauty youtubers talk about their clothing. It’s hard to explain.. like it’s pretty clear they’re only wearing certain items for the sponsorship paycheck. They’re not very well spoken, and their style is kinda boring IMO	episode_done:True

text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:I feel this! I’ve grown up obsessed with stories like little women, Anne of green gables, and a little princess, so I’ve always had an affinity for feminine, old fashioned styles. They are so wholesome and pretty 🤩 I’m a little afraid to dress that way in public since it’s not the norm, but I have some flowy night gowns with lace and ribbons and such, and I wear them to bed. I also have bloomer shorts with lace that were custom made for me. They’re so pretty. I’ve been buying more flowy dresses with little floral detailing lately. I don’t have a lot of money to spend, so I mostly buy from online stores, but you can get lucky finds at thrift stores, some unique pieces from Etsy, or from a specialty shop that specifically sells vintage clothing. A lot of those types of stores are located in downtown stores, so I’d look there!	episode_done:True

The angora industry turned into a depraved mess, and a surprising amount of people don’t seem aware that silk worms are often killed during production. Peace silk does try to avoid this.
text:What sort of secondhand stores do you shop at? My local thrift and consignment shops only have the recent, poor quality of items, but marked up because of the brand.	labels:I find good stuff on Poshmark and eBay, you can search for vintage, or like 90s GAP styles, and get pretty good deals.	episode_done:True
text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:I wear it at home. So I can get used to it without others seeing me. After a bit I suddenly feel more comfortable.   Also, avoid mirrors! This helped massively when I was trying to get comfortable wearing bright lipsticks.

Like, it's really not deeper than that.   Then I came here and apparently you need to have a name for your ~*aesthetic*~ with at least 4 adjectives "preppy witchy nonsensical space librarian" and I learned that some people seem to buy clothes they don't like because they're "trendy"? And they think that everyone who's "trendy" just buys the latest clothes because they're in fashion and not because they like them?   IDK, the FFA mentality and shopping habits are super confusing to me.
text:What niche do you feel is missing from the fashion blogging/YouTube world?	labels:Middle-aged professional people who want to look put-together and stylish but not necessarily FASHION, especially budget-wise. I agree about mid-sized women, too. The 10-16 range that’s not skinny and not fat. Whatever “average” size is supposed to be these days.

text:Upper midwest here - after the polar vortex, I don't fuck around. I bought a mid-calf length down coat and smugly swan about in it looking like the Michelin Man and feeling no windchill.	labels:I feel that. I went to Canada during a cold winter and have been living my best life with Canadian winter fashion (a fancy long coat and big hat and unapologetically winterized boots) since then. I live right on the US-Canada border. We have the same weather but fashion is marketed so differently...I think it’s bc Americans in this climate are experiencing the coldest weather in the country, but the Canadians in the next town over just past the border have the warmest weather in their country. The means catered to by the markets are totally different.  Since then I’ve been waaaayyyyy happier, all snug as a bug in my big coat while my neighbors wear the standard low profile down parkas found in stores here and complain they’re still freezing.	episode_done:True

Wearing heels one night distroys my feet for weeks. It’s not worth the pain.  I started out specifically buying clothing that would look good with cowboy boots (skinny jeans). Now I rock them with any and everything. Just tucked them into a pair of blue plaid trousers and they looked awesome.   Its surprising how much more confident you feel when your feet aren’t miserable. Also my boots were $200 bucks why should I be concerned about them not being “fancy of fashionable.”	episode_done:True

text:How have you been doing your shopping since Covid?	labels:I generally hate shopping online, but I have been. If possible, I'll order 2 sizes for items and return what doesn't fit. Ideally I like to return in store, but I have found a lot of the stores near me have closed this year so that is a more annoying option.  I also hate that so few brands include shipping labels, I do not have printer so that means I need to go to Fedex to print, and then drop off at UPS or postoffice. It is annoying (printing at UPS is too expensive).

text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:I love the idea of them \[Less decision making for me!  More time in the morning! Less clutter!\], but in practice they don't work great for me \[I get bored easily, I like a variety of styles, I love to play with clothes\].  I'm working on figuring out what 'styles' I enjoy, and a few pieces that would fit each style, so that I can have maximum options with a minimal(dish) amount.       I've been working on creating a capsule just for work though - even though my job skews casual, there are some safety rules that I should abide by when I'm in the lab space like long pants and closed toe shoes.  Plus, I seem to be more productive when I'm dressed more business-y.  I haven't figured out how to separate them in my closet though since we don't have a ton a space in our loft.	episode_done:True

text:Same.  When I worked in Antarctica, there obviously was no reason for me to put on makeup, do my hair, and put on nice clothes.  One season I worked in a lab and the other I was a contractor at the South Pole.  I still did it anyway.  I like how I look with makeup and my hair done so who cares if there's nobody there to appreciate it.   Now I'm back working a "regular" job in the lower 48.  I'm a pharmacist so I still have to go into work.  The only thing that's really changed is that I wear a headband with buttons on the side to save my ears.  I'm not a fan of wearing the same headband every day, but it does help with the pain immensely.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Hi! Former stylist.  1) Pay attention to the fit of things and figure out what cuts and shapes look good on you. Paper bag pants and some joggers have similar fits. Some mini skirts and shorts hit the same place on your legs and can have the same waist height. Find your sweet spot and don’t be afraid to buy multiple things in silhouettes that work for you.   2) Get some statement pieces that you would die for. If you are wearing a pair of jeans that fit well and a t-shit purchased within the past 3 years with some awesome earrings you going to look and feel great. If you are wearing an amazing dress and simple white sneakers you are going to look and feel great. Don’t overthink things but try and wear at LEAST one piece you are excited about at a time.   3) Don’t buy things just cause they are on sale, you saw your friend wearing it, or you feel like you “need” something in your wardrobe. You should love everything in your closet in its own special way unless it’s workwear and you hate your dress code for work. Something as simple as a T-shirt has so many different factors like cut, material, neckline, sleeve length. Purchase what feels good and don’t bother with the rest.
text:General Discussion - November 02	labels:i feel like my interest in fashion has been cyclical throughout my life, where i'll care about clothes for months, if not years, and then have to drop it for a while  anyway life is pretty tough atm so i think i'm dropping fashion / reddit for a bit. see you guys on the other side!
text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom didn’t care about fashion until she started watching What Not to Wear on tlc. Then she threw out all her embroidered sweatshirts and appliqué jeans and got some more stylish clothes. She maintained this for a few years and now that she’s in her late 60s, she wears what makes her happy- embroidered sweatshirts and appliqué jeans.   I don’t wish she taught me anything but I think if she kept a pulse on trends it would’ve saved me from some teasing in middle school. But, on the flip side, is it fun to fit in? Middle school sucks regardless.

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:I can't speak on the weight gain thing other than I'm sure you still look lovely and I hope you still feel beautiful right now as well. Weight gain is nothing to be ashamed of, but I commend you for trying to be healthier - that shit isn't easy!!  As for the "wanting to look professional but wanting to look / feel like myself", I think a LOT of people struggle with this. I feel like for the emo look, wearing all black can still be seen as very professional, I think the issue more would be the cuts of the clothes. It also depends on your profession / workplace - obviously some places are much more lenient and you can get away with a lot more skin. Maybe wearing jewelry that is more alternative can also be a good way to look professional but feel like yourself.	episode_done:True

text:Hooded Sweatshirt Roundup	labels:Once you get over a certain level of $ point, it's really hard to rank basic hoodies over one another, it mostly comes down to the fit that you want.  I've tried a lot of hoodies from cheap to expensive and most of them are as comfortable as each other. The article mentions JEs villain hoodies which are probably out of fashion these days but JE still produces other cuts of hoodies such as the beach hoodie, raglan hoodie and oversized cropped hoodie which all have different fits and are all as well made as each other. People who rave about a particular brand of hoodie are highly likely to be just really happy with the fit, the quality and comfort isn't gonna really differ between RC, Norse Projects, Champion and such. Even coveted things like loopwheeler also doesn't provide anything unique either when it comes to comfort.  I've rambled but if I had an advice to give to hoodie buyers who are mostly focused on fit and comfort, it would be to identify a fit that you want and just start from the midrange brand that you can find of that fit.
text:General Discussion - January 20, 2021	labels:My partner is now officially my spouse. I now wear a ring which will look good with my fits, but feels really weird being just ... there on my hand, all the time now.  They vetoed me posting pictures (we have public facing jobs, these pictures are all over social media, too easy to reverse image search etc.), but they wore a Rick Owens dress (that I picked out) while I went full minimalism with a collarless shirt with onyx studs, a sleek blazer and cropped trousers. I put this together from my existing wardrobe, since we didn't want to spend a lot. Covid measures made things a bit weird, but the court officer made a real effort into making it nice, which was great. (edit: just so nobody thinks we are totally irresponsible: it was literally just us at city hall, no guests, no party. We'll catch up with that after vaccination.)  It was fun seeing all y'all Americans count down to my wedding day.
text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I usually wear one statement piece with more basic items, but if I want to combine more dramatic items, I try to pick items that stand out for different reasons (unless I'm going for full on maximalist).   So like with the pink suit, it's 100% the colour that makes it stand out. So I would pair it with a top with a bold pattern, or a dramatic scarf that creates an interesting silhouette, or a belt or necklace that has a lot of interesting detail.

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:Short of getting a bit of insider info, I think the only way to really have success at those stores is to browse them at least once a week (probably twice).  My aunt tends to go every other day and finds some amazing stuff…because she goes *every other day*.  She says it doesn’t take her long because she’s so familiar with their stock, but it still seems exhausting to me.  (As opposed to spending three hours scrolling through Poshmark in bed every night…)

text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:I conceptually understand that I probably don't need to wash my clothes as often as I do as someone who lives in a temperate-cold climate, and studies from home, but I can't get over my childhood conditioning to wash clothes after almost every wear. My parents grew up in South East Asia, where you practically have to shower and change clothes twice a day, and that training runs deep. I probably wash T-shirts after 1 wear, gym clothes after 1 wear, bras every 1-2 wears, jeans/pants every 2-4 wears, and outerwear/sweaters less frequently (when I spill something, or every 3-4 weeks for my indoor home sweaters that get frequent wear). I am however very careful with how I wash clothes- always on cold, use appropriate detergents (euclean for wool/cashmere, soak for silk/other delicates, and unscented tide for everything else), and I try to air dry everything that I can. Clothing care is a big part of how I approach sustainability; my purchasing habits might not always be the most sustainable, but I try to take care of the items that I own well so that they last for me (and maybe even for a second owner). I also would prefer to wash clothes a touch too often than not often enough and end up smelling; I spent a year studying in Germany, and my host family was great, but I kind of felt like they didn't wash clothes as often as I would to prevent smells; natural fibers are not = deodorant, they still need to be washed. Now if I could only kick my dry shampoo habit....washing my hair is so much more work than laundry.	episode_done:True

text:I Dyed My Jeans With $6 Dye and Here Are The Results	labels:Just going to put it out there, as a costumer who spends a lot of time dying fabric...

You can use them in a \*very loose\* dyebath to produce a wash, but for anything else, you're taking the risk of producing a patchy result.     If a garment is truly precious to you, I would definitely recommend hitting up the internet (or a specialist's crafts/fabric store--not just the big chains) for Jacquard or Dharma dyes. They're more expensive, but we're talking about the difference between spending $10 to restore your favorite shirt or $6 to destroy it; I imagine for most folks it'll be worthwhile.	episode_done:True

Real leather on the other hand can have a super long lifespan with proper care, and too me it just looks way nicer because real leather items (like boots and bags) are usually made with more care because it’s a more expensive material.

text:Can You Wear a T-Shirt Under a Blazer and Not Look Like an 1980s Leftover?	labels:I still maintain that a t shirt with a tailored jacket is not a good look. It's a clash of formality. Same reason sneakers look odd with a suit. That doesn't mean you can't wear a t shirt or sneakers, just that they don't look good with those particular pairings.
text:General Discussion - January 11, 2021	labels:2020 was probably the worst year of my life (most of the year was ok but nov/december was so awful it dragged it all the way down), but a serious silver lining was that i lost close to 35 lbs. i've been overweight pretty much all my life but not what most people would consider obese. still, it has always affected my self-esteem and confidence, and i was at my peak weight at the start of 2020, 235 lbs.  I cannot overstate how taxing it was to not see the scale budge downward for so long and always seemingly ticking up. a suit I had bought a year prior to fit comfortably after I gained weight was starting to not fit, real "ah shit here we go again" moment. at the start of the pandemic though, i lost 14 lbs in like two months and was ecstatic. i ticked another 10 or so lbs downward before I plateaued and you know, I was happy about it because I never felt hungry and I had a consistent lifestyle and it was good that I could live like that and not gain or lose weight at all. Then, I came down with food poisoning in december and barely ate for like a week and lost another 10 lbs (hardly healthy but in 2020 i'll take the good with the bad). Even after getting better and feeling good again I have kept that weight off and now weigh under 200 lbs for the first time in years. I'm ecstatic for more progress in 2021 and hopefully finally being confident enough to buy the dope clothes I want and not worrying that I look bad in them.  It's so interesting what relativity does to you. I'm 198 lbs rn, but I was last that weight when I was a senior heading off to college and felt awful about it. Now, I feel fucking great and way more confident than I was before. Funny things. The mission is 170 lbs but I'll be happy to be between that and 180. Sorry for the paragraphs but I know this forum more than almost anywhere will understand struggles like this, especially for guys.
text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:The present always feels “neutral”.

text:Totally.  To me, Gen Z is a lot of clothing that isn’t work appropriate but super fun. A lot of crop tops, bra tops, spaghetti straps, usually some tummy showing, and then some baggy pants. Lots of thrifting and also cheap fast fashion. Doc Martens and other platform shoes. Very 90s/early 2000s. Long acrylic nails, false lashes. Really fun and can be a really “hot but trashy” style   Millennial fashion is more professional/better quality/structured. Linens, trousers, heels, sandals, etc. Frankly I think it has to do with millennials having more money. Low key hair, nails and makeup. Neutral colours and patterns. It’s a more mature style   I’m 25 so I get to do both 😎 woohoo	labels:As soon as Gen Z get a job they'll be all over trousers and linens lol. Gen Z right are mostly teenagers and young 20s, they can afford (socially, not money wise) to dress fun and crazy.

text:>many many clothing items that say "dry clean only" can be washed either by hand, or in the machine on a delicate setting with wool wash or other gentle low-suds detergent.  I agree a lot of things can be washed at home! Heck, I've even thrown dry clean only items into the washer + air dry because I'm cheap and bought the garment cheap and wanted to see the outcome. I wash my woolens in a sink with woolite, and put them in the washer on spin to remove the water. I recently hand washed a suit jacket with no negative repercussions, it could use a bit of a steam on the shoulders, but otherwise A-OK.  The only thing I worry about is silk, of which I own very little. I have put my silk items in the washer and air dried and they were fine but the wrinkles were hard to get out, but I'm curious what others do.	labels:I second the hand steamer. It is a game changer - and way less annoying to setup than my ironing board.	episode_done:True
text:Why Ralph Lauren Never Goes Out of Style	labels:I f***ing love old Ralph Lauren. I eat that stuff up. I agree that the quality is part of why it never goes out of style. But also Ralph Lauren is still huge and relevant today, so vintage pieces feel both en vogue and archival, a very "intellectual" take on an American classic. Like an old Herman Miller chair. It was cool then and it's cool now. And RL has infiltrated all sorts of cultures, namely hip hop and streetwear meaning the demand for it isn't just bankers. And RL has been a titan of American fashion in that he sort of figured out his formulas a while ago and hasn't changed that much. RL from the past is just as recognizable as RL from today. In my opinion it's aged unbelievably well. Old RL pieces are like darling Americana that can styled with anything. An old RL knit hangs just as well with streetwear as it does with jeans and boots. And while similar brands like BB are nice, they are one trick ponies. RL has and continues to offer an expansive product line from tech skiwear to western clothes. I think this huge line up means that even if there are duds, they are hidden by the massive catalog of hit pieces like the bear line up.
text:The suit looks dark grey to my eye, though monitor may be misleading.  If it is indeed dark grey/charcoal, I would not recommend navy pants, I'd suggest a lighter grey with no pattern that is very noticeably lighter than the jacket. Agree with the above poster that the goal here isn't to match, but to contrast in a... Controlled... way, especially since you're planning for a funeral.  White shirt, simple/plain tie in any dark color (black or grey would be traditional for a funeral, but dark blue, burgundy, or dark green would be fine as well).	labels:Thank you.

text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:What can help with defining on par is a cost per use / year metric. Especially, if you set yourself a price you are willing to pay for an item per year and use that as the measure of on par quality or not.   As an example, my Barbour wax jacket cost 350 back in the day, it gets a new finish every three years which is around 30ish. So over a period of 20 years that jacket costs me roughly 550. hence, on a yearly basis I paid 27.50 which is fine by me. However, if it had lasted only five years I would have probably seen it differently (and if it had gone to pieces after one year I would have been livid).

text:General Discussion - December 05, 2020	labels:I've gotten to the point that my printmaking and embroidery work are my "part time job", in that it can pay some bills and give me spending money, and allow me to live off of less work for other people.   Typically, i do repair work on people's clothing or sell paper prints and things like installation pieces and back patches, since I never got very far making art to hang up on gallery walls (I have sold a single-digit number of pieces that hung up in a gallery, but orders of magnitude more prints online or in a table show! WTF!)  Recently I'm trying something a little new- getting old, worn out, and/or vintage garments and doing all kinds of overdyes, sashiko, embroidery and quilting to them, mostly by hand. Then I plan to auction off or make a catalogue of these pieces as one-offs to buy. One of the pieces is a 1980s japanese denim kimono that i'm sashiko stitching in the traditional patterned styles, and I'm loving how it's coming out- but it still is scary to put so much time and thread into something that has no garuntee or obligation to sell at all... it feels much riskier somehow, even though all art is risky.

text:Did you skip over the sentence “ ...much forgotten is the 90’s take on ’70s style, not as an exact replica but as a toned-down version of a wilder decade.” Seems pretty clear the references were the reinterpretation of the 70s by Tom Ford’s Gucci and other Italian designers.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I handwash all the time--the salad spinner is a great idea!  Most of the clothes that I handwash call for cold water only though, so I never use any warm water.  As for detergent, I use Woolite.  Threads are more delicate when wet, so I avoid any rough wringing--I roll them up in towels to get most of the water out.  With knit sweaters etc, I let them dry laying down, put back in their shape, as they get very heavy with water and hanging could cause them to lose their shape.  Since I already have many pieces that I handwash, I just end up doing that with all of the pieces I care about/really want to last and it works great albeit a bit time consuming!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I got my first fancy bag after calling off my wedding lol I figured it cost around the same amount as the dress I wouldn’t ever wear so why not? The woman at the LV store thought I was on drugs ... “are you celebrating something?” And I’m like as a matter of fact, yes, yes I am. I just lost a ton of money on a wedding but I dodged a bullet and left that POS. All she said was “well you can always make more money” anyway, I’m getting a Chanel bag for my next milestone birthday. Not sure which one but it’s gonna happen soon.
text:Ooohh thanks for sharing! I actually rarely go clothes shopping with my friends so I'll try it out more	labels:Ask someone for a zoom hour of going through what you have and recs.  The more specific you can be about your preferences and limitations (for me I don’t do dry cleaning or heels over 1.5) the better your results will be, pro’s and the online services have a form you go through but what I really like asking a friend is the bonding experience and cute compliments, people are always flattered when you tell them that you admire their style. I’ve been trying to support local and POC so I’m supporting my local drag queens and makeup artists, it’s really helped me get out of my natori robe for a couple hours during SIP	episode_done:True
text:The suit looks dark grey to my eye, though monitor may be misleading.  If it is indeed dark grey/charcoal, I would not recommend navy pants, I'd suggest a lighter grey with no pattern that is very noticeably lighter than the jacket. Agree with the above poster that the goal here isn't to match, but to contrast in a... Controlled... way, especially since you're planning for a funeral.  White shirt, simple/plain tie in any dark color (black or grey would be traditional for a funeral, but dark blue, burgundy, or dark green would be fine as well).	labels:My monitor leads me to mid greyish.... if it's on a darker spectrum, probably black slacks could do either, although depends on the colour of a pair of shoes.

text:My thoughts of the Cote&Ciel Isar L after a year	labels:Have this in ecoyarn M and was my daily driver for about 2 years until covid hit. I like it for its intriguing look, but it's not the most practical of bags. It is quite heavy, and the damn shoulder strap adjusters always loosen up. It doesn't have a quick access pocket as well except for the secret one where I just put my coin purse for commuting.  It's more of a show-off/flex backpack imo. I got an Aer Fit Pack in X-pac for practicality but will most likely keep my Isar M.	episode_done:True
text:Can we make a thread of everyone posting their all time favorite Halloween costume they wore? 🎃👻	labels:I don't want to share an image on a public forum, but I dressed up as "The Night Sky" last year and it's one of my favorite costumes I've ever done! I had a dress covered in stars, did my hair up in an elaborate crown studded with crystal stars and moons, black knee-high boots, and -for the most dramatic "look" - I sewed three sets of blue and white string lights into a black cloak so that I wore a cape of stars. Also I covered myself in glitter! The battery pack made dancing difficult but it was so worth it haha. The party had a woodland-gods-and-mystical-creatures theme so there's a picture of me at some point sitting on a massive throne and it's probably the most regal I've ever felt in my life	episode_done:True
text:give me a reason: inspo from multiple sources	labels:I dig this  One common aesthetic I notice, not necessarily clothes related, and maybe not what you had intended, are interesting/characterful textures in the surrounding setting. More coherent words are escaping me, but many (though not all) of these pictures have cracked or peeling paint, geometric patterns in the wood floor boards/cement tiles/bricks which show beautiful but non-homogenous aging. Very wabi-sabi, though not in the meaning of worn out clothes as it is often interpreted here.   I recognize this is some fresh word salad, hopefully I conveyed the idea though!

text:How to find non-custom tailored clothing for short men (under 5')	labels:If you're looking to build a professional wardrobe on a budget as a small guy, your best bet is raiding thrift store kids sections for Brooks Brothers and Polo Ralph Lauren.  You're likely a large in both. I guarantee you'll at least find a nice navy blazer that fits, if not entire suits, etc. It is insanely easy to go full prep just by buying thrift store kids section Polo and Brooks Brothers, trust me.

text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:i personally disagree that there are no aesthetic reasons for y2k fashion to come back. there definitely are, or else it wouldn't be as huge as it is!! i personally love a lot of aspects of y2k fashion. :) but you're right that nostalgia is a huge part of it. nostalgia as a whole is so trendy these days. for example my whole tiktok is full of people talking about shows from their childhood, or toys, or disney channel stars from our childhood. "1999, 2004, 2008" picture day tiktoks are also a huge trend right now. i've even seen tons of people talking about 2011-2014 nostalgia which wasn't even that long ago!! it's insane how it's such a big thing. i'm honestly more interested in analyzing why everyone's so nostalgic in general these days haha
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:I get it, I'm a nurse who is also an introvert who loves fashion/style. Its tough because we can't express ourselves at work, and I've also felt insecure about wearing my best clothes on the rare occasion I would go out (especially nowadays), and feeling like no occasion is good enough to wear my nicer or different clothes.   I still struggle with it, but my advice is to incorporate items slowly and consider how things can be dressed up or down. For example, I have some shorter skirts that might be a bit of a statement on their own, but I'll bust them out in winter with a sweater, scarf, and leggings and go grocery shopping. Simple and still casual. I do the same with shorter dresses. A nicer top and jeans is not over the top by any means. Try pairing a nicer pair of shoes with your jeans to dress down the shoes (and dress up the jeans i guess!)  As for asking why you're so dressed up, I don't see why people have to comment in that way, but I'm guessing they mean no harm. I typically get compliments from friends on my stuff but they also enjoy style, so if you hang out with people who aren't into it at all then they probably won't get it, or maybe they are interested and are in the same dilemma as you. Either way, the appropriate thing to do would be to compliment your skirt or top or whatever, not make you feel weird about it. I think "because I like it" is actually the best response. How can anyone argue with that? If you want to be petty you might say "oh, don't you like it?" and see how they respond, I'd actually be curious. The more you wear your nicer things the less you will be asked. Fake it till you make it! I've worn things out that I thought maybe was "too much", and people might stare but for all you know they are admiring your look, and occasionally I will get a compliment from strangers which is a great confidence boost.

text:Shitpost Saturday: Fashion AITA	labels:I am fairly well-known in my community for my unique fashion sense, ropes of pearls, zebra-striped roadster, and two-tone hair. A woman I knew from my school days has a lot of spotted dogs. When I commented that they would make a beautiful coat, she became offended! AITA?   Edit to add: My husband is a furrier, if that helps your decision.  Edit again to add: I may also be a lot older than the woman with the spotted dogs and have a red and black roadster and no husband, depending.
text:What's on your 2021 fashion wishlist?	labels:I'm going from the Middle East (last year) to living in the Baltics (2021) so it's going to be aaaaall about the cold-weather gear and woolens for me. I don't have a super-great grasp on what the formality levels are going to be at work yet, but I'm definitely hoping to get some great all-weather boots, some super warm leggings for non-work or work from home wear. The new job comes with a promotion so I'm going to need a few suits and some wool dress slacks for work (for those days when it's just too cold for anything else!).  I'm thinking a lot about velvet and knit and texture, trying to do longer (and warmer!) skirts than my usual pencil skirt without looking girlish or dowdy... and trying not to splurge on every coat known to man (four wool coats and a cape isn't too-too much, right?)

text:I love the idea of this, although really good custom tailoring as they describe in the article is not exactly easy to come by. I think you are right about suiting; nowadays it seems exclusively reserved for weddings, special events, etc. and is rarely intended for every day wear.   Still, I almost always get dressed up to some extent when I’m WFH. I can’t bear to sit around in sweatpants and an old tee all day like a lot of people seem to do. Look good, feel good!	labels:Obviously the level of tailoring available to the Royal Family and their personal means, makes wearing suits more practical for them than most people. Of course what's interesting about HRH Prince Charles is that he WEARS his suits, meaning that they are repaired and adjusted and stay with him for decades...it's a very Trad approach to clothing.	episode_done:True
text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:Mainstream fashion is so much more inclusive these days when it comes to plus and mid size women I don't think gaining weight really makes a difference in the majority of cases.  Women who carry some extra weight are no longer designated to day floral vomit and glo tunics, empire waists, shark hems, polyester and doleman sleeves.  They can wear crop tops, high waisted pants, athleisure, alternative fashion ect.  Even high fashion is coming around somewhat.   This is especially true in the USA where 70% of people carry extra weight.    I think the way you feel about your body is important when choosing clothes.  Many women think they look worse in fashionable and attractive clothes than they actually do.  When women feel insecure they often hide behind their clothes instead of using their clothes to express themselves.	episode_done:True

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.

text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:It’s less about the value of the item and more about the stars aligning perfectly.  I wear a size 12-13W shoe, plus other things that make my feet really hard to fit, so I am used to buying formalwear to match the one maybe two pairs of formal shoes I own at any given time.  So when I was 17 and going to prom in 2006, my mom tried really hard to help me find shoes, any shoes, that were suitable. But we could only find casual flats or runners, and I realllly wanted to dress up nicely for the first real time in my life. So she said “you know what, let’s buy a dress and then we will just have to find a way.”  So I picked out a black and pale pink dress that just made me swoon, and I figured black heels would be easiest to find. Lol I was so young and stupid.  Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn’t find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I’d just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.
text:Goals and Resolutions Check in: February	labels:Later last year, I decided to go a year without buying clothes (with a few exceptions, e.g. if I end up getting a job that requires things I don’t have), so my style lately has been about making use of things I own. Last month, my goal was to spend time mending an article of clothing every week, and I’m happy to say I’ve salvaged a few things and improved my sewing! This month, I’m learning about embroidery. I want to add subtle decorations to pants.  The struggle is wanting to splurge on cute things. :( Another: sewing is time-consuming, but I often do it while I watch TV.  It’s cool to hear about your goals! I care about sustainability, too.
text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:No, I don’t think it’s tone deaf that fashion houses or designers are releasing collections that, like oconorris mentioned, were designed a year+ in advance.   As cities and *other* countries begin to re open people will begin to adapt to the new norm and resume their day to day activities so that will present more opportunities for them to go out and wear new clothes. I’m in America so don’t expect to relate any time soon lol  Having said that, there’s something for everyone. There’s quite a few brands that offer natural fibers, minimalistic looks, but no guarantee that greenwashing isn’t involved or that they aren’t treating their employees like shit.   The world doesn’t revolve around America so I’m not sure that more affordable brands will drop whatever collections they had designed for 6+ months just to adapt to whatever image people have in mind during this pandemic.
text:Excercises for personal style	labels:I think there are some resources for this in the menu of this subreddit under “Finding a Style.”  One exercise I liked for me was looking through a big list of adjectives and choosing the top 5 or so that resonated with me. They were primarily style-related adjectives but a wide range, and even some that might seem repetitive but have different nuances. Words like classic, edgy, preppy, athletic, retro, witchy, librarian, minimal, colorful, artistic, etc. (One of my friends brainstormed a big list for a style workshop we did, but I don’t think I have it anymore.)

text:Unique brands/boutiques in your city?	labels:Some nice places around Europe:  * Switzerland:    * Geneva: on weekends, there's a flea market around the park near Patek Philippe Museum. I loved it especially for vintage fashion magazines and books but also clothes and jewelries.    * Lausanne, Boutique Etat d’Ame: kind of elegant garments with a twist. I love especially their shoes, they have elevated designs of classic types of shoes.    * Lausanne, MANIAK Boutique: this is a really fun and weird boutique where you'll find: some second-hand items, leather jackets and corsets, costume stuff, urban brands like Dickies and Carhartt, vintage dresses, etc. It's a really fun, quirky mess of everything. Every time I went there I bought something, it's one of my favorite shops ever.    *  Zürich: There's a nice flea market in Stadthausanlage on weekends.    *  Zürich, Fizzen: part second-hand, part regular shop, it has some nice designs similar to MANIAK in Lausanne. Also in Zürich, Barbar Vintage usually has a large selection of SH jeans and on Bleicherweg there are some more high-end vintage stores near the offices of consulting companies (what a coincidence). * France, Annecy: there is (was? maybe temporarily cancelled because of Covid-19) a quite large monthly flea market on the last Saturday of every month. I went there once especially for this and it was amazing. * Romania, Bucharest: some local boutiques are Ioana Ciolacu (designer items), Ana Urbana (shoes), Gazzelle (shoes and bags), Diana Cojocaru (unique porcelain jewelry, doesn't have a regular store but regularly hosts exhibitions around Bucharest, worth checking her Instagram account), IONA (lovely gold jewelry), Malvensky (also nice gold jewelry), Iutta (handbags and shoes with traditional motives). A lot of these boutiques can be visited only by appointment, so check this beforehand.	episode_done:True

text:Tips for easily looking more modern/in style?	labels:I've heard the advice to buy 5 low-cost pieces of clothing that is in fashion per season to keep up with trends. Obviously if you see something more expensive that you love then feel free to go for it but my main point being that it doesn't have to be an entire new wardrobe of high priced clothing, it can literally be £50-100 at H&M 4 times a year buying pieces that slot into your existing wardrobe (e.g. a top or a coat or a pair of shoes). If a certain style becomes precious to you then you can always upgrade that piece.  Like for example skinny jeans are not quite the fashion of the moment but you'd still look pretty current if you paired them with a puff sleeve top. Sleek white trainers are not as on trend as some of the chunkier clunky dad styles in white but they'd still look OK with your slightly frumpy prairie dress.	episode_done:True

text:Brooks Brothers's Future Looks a Lot Like Menswear’s Past	labels:* Less SKUs. The amount of stuff BB sells is overwhelming.  * Do away with there weirdly named fit system. Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.

text:Dream Unconventional/ Unrealistic Fashion Accessories- Discussion	labels:I honestly wish it were anywhere near acceptable to wear my academic regalia in real life. I've got some beautiful robes and headgear that cost me dearly! The felt mortarboard isn't bad, but the velvet tam is where it's at...if you want to look like a renaissance explorer, anyway.  I also once saw somewhere a huge necklace in the form of a jeweled fried egg. I think it would go with everything.	episode_done:True
text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:A well fitted black wool coat in a cut that flatters you. It goes with any outfit. You can dress it up or down, and on early mornings taking the kids to school or late night runs to the store you look like you have your shit together even if your sans bra and wearing 3 day old leggings.
text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting our 'Finding A Style and Building A Wardrobe' guide	labels:one thing i noticed in my fashion journey is the effect that location has on style, and to be aware of it. is it something you like, or dislike?  i went to college in the north east in the late 2000s and it was all prep all the time. i was in academia at the time, and fully embraced prep into my life, even though it felt like a facade.  then i moved to NYC and  i stuck out like a sore thumb lol. slowly, and without realizing it over the course of a couple years, my style went from typical new england prep with lots of fake pearls and plaid and corduroy and navy and JKP lusting, to all black all the time city girl.  i LOVE my style now, it just feels very "me" and can't ever imagine wearing a navy blazer again in my life. but if i was to move to the north east again, or down south or somewhere else with a different local aesthetic i would pay a lot more attention to my buying choices to make sure i   maintain my style in a way that i like, and if i ever decide to change it up to make it a conscious decision. it would have saved me a lot of money during that transition period when i had no cohesive items to wear together.  a navy wool blazer from jack wills doesn't really go with leather shorts!  &#x200B;  \[edit\] i'm not sure how it would be worked into the guide, though. maybe when talking about climate which heavily affects people's fashion choices and is also very regional, regional (even hyperlocal, different neighborhoods in NYC dress very differently) style trends could also be mentioned?   it would have been helpful for me when moving to a new city to have had that seed planted in my head. if you're freshly moved or have been living in a place for a while and want a new style, look at the people around you! they'll probably be wearing clothes that can be found locally, and if you like how people dress it's a great way to get inspiration on what's current in that area.   it's also great because if you DON"T like how people are dressing you can consciously make the decision to avoid those choices.

text:Interesting. I wonder what value they see if it’s so obvious they’ve been on a decline for so long and ate scrubbing the name. It’d be odd to have the GBG sub-brand living under GUESS Factory forever. And it is sad the designers went on F21 because the stuff there (I am speaking for men) has declined so so much. When the men’s stuff came out in 2008, the designs and quality were SO good. Yes, it is fast fashion, but quality was so there. I bought F21 like crazy up till 2014 or so when quality started to slip. I met a guy who knew designers at F21 and said many from the initial Heritage 1981 men’s launch were pouched from GUESS (the irony).	labels:	episode_done:True

text:"Can people just hate fashion again" - Synecdoche When Talking about the "Industry" Discussion	labels:> Should spaces & industries for fashion lovers, clothes lovers, and people that have to wear clothes be completely separate?  I don’t think that any of these groups should be completely separate however I do find them all being lumped into the same spaces very frustrating as someone who does love fashion as a form of art and creativity.  I like harsh and blunt constructive criticism in pretty much all areas of life and I most certainly want it for my outfits as well. I want to hear what other fashion lovers and artists think of my colour choices, proportions, textures, fit, etc. and be able to refine those things and really flex my creative muscles when creating an outfit. Instead, many fashion spaces are dominated by ‘you do you hun!’ and ‘so long as you like it, that’s all that matters!’ which is great for someone *who has to wear clothes* and doesn’t actually care about fashion but joins fashion spaces because they feel some obligation as a woman to care about it but... those spaces just become unhelpful and bland for those who really love fashion and want to get better at it.  I’ve been an off and on follower of FFA for a few years and I feel like it’s definitely dominated by the “people who wear clothes” group and unfortunately it limits the amount of critique that is acceptable to give.

text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:I’d doubt that Amazon offers enough quality pieces to really redo your wardrobe.  If you’re 21 and not really making money yet I still wouldn’t look for the cheapest items and “biggest steals.”  I’d look to add pieces here and there as I go along that fit the weather/routines you’re currently experiencing.  I’m not advocating for buying overpriced pieces either, just simply stating that just because you may be able to buy a “complete wardrobe” off Amazon you may be very disappointed in your choices if your wardrobe is shot by the time you’re 23.  Good quality clothes can last forever, and the money you spend will stretch further.	episode_done:True

text:Matching shoes & purse	labels:I don’t think fashion has any rules anymore unless you’re royalty or it’s cultural.   I personally don’t like matchy matchy bag and shoes unless I’m going for a monochrome look. I tend to match tones rather than colours. I like a patterned bag (say Gucci dionysus or Fendi zucca or LV canvas) as opposed to patterned clothes because I find they blend in well with a variety of outfit choices.   If I do colour, I will make sure the tone matches. I can’t stand mixing warm times with cool tones. Eg I have a cool tone lilac paid of heels that I love wearing with my cool tone magenta bag.   You can also do opposite sides of the colour wheel with shoes and bags like a green bag and a purple/magenta pair of shoes. But again keep to the same tones. The key with fashion is the tone of colours, and that includes neutral colours too. I would always suggest everyone does a colour/tone analysis and then stick to buying items in that range. It makes mixing and matching easier.

I am also fairly curvy, with prominent dark curly hair, so have to make adjustments there as well.

text:From my own experience, I'd say the best made "vintage" Andrew Marc leather jackets are better than a lot of "mall" brand leather jackets I've owned or tried like Kenneth Cole, Tommy Hilfiger, Reilly Olmes, Ralph Lauren Chaps.

If you double it up, there isn't much length left after having knotted it. It looks a bit as if I'm using electrical cable to hold up my jeans but I think it's cool.

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.

text:Everyone’s opinions on Youtube fashion channels?	labels:I felt the same way by the time I hit 20 (22 now), so i unsubscribed to most of those beauty and fashion "gurus" and started anew. I only kept and subscribed to channels that tend to do their research or seem pretty down to earth. Honestly a pretty good rule of thumb is, does watching this person make me feel good and fulfilled afterwards? Inspired even? If not then, i just don't watch their videos anymore. YT is suppose to entertain you, not make yourself feel bad.  Someone mentioned Justine Leconte in the comments and for ex, after her videos, i just feel so much more knowledgeable, like i actually got something out of it. I like watching bestdressed because her personality is relatable and she knows she has imperfections but still posts anyway. Jessica Neistadt is one that hasn't been mentioned yet, but i watch her cause she has a good energy. Most of her hauls are thrifts so they're affordable, with a few expensive pieces here and there. Also, she has a quote of the day at the end of her videos. Obviously, what makes me happy isn't an answer for everyone.  I tend to mix up my feed as well so I don't get tired of one topic too quickly (food, social experiments, science, video games)

text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:I've went through this myself, and the thing that has helped the most is to build that skill inside your head of "what does style mean to me?" The answer to this question is different for everyone, and you'll see it reflected just on the WAYWT threads - whether fashion is highlighting your existence in a certain social sphere, whether style is function over form, etc. What I did before my "outlet" grew was to source my inspiration online and think about pieces that I had and why I did or didn't like or wear them. You can do this with your existing wardrobe, or by window-shopping, which I know isn't so easy in COVID times, but you can do it online as well. What features do you love about your existing clothes? What defines "nice clothes" to yourself? I used to think that it was all about polished business casual clothing, because that reflected the work environments I had to survive in. Your staples will also be defined by what you think flatters (or unflatters!) you the most.  To be honest, I think style takes time; time to hone in on what you want or how you want to represent yourself. And if it doesn't take time, it does take money, and that's why being a stylist is a viable career path as well. But you do not need money to build or learn about style. My style has changed vastly from when I moved cross-country multiple times, and when I've changed careers. But style doesn't need to be static or done immediately. :)	episode_done:True

text:The joy of cordovan—and how to wear and maintain it	labels:Cordovan is an Instagram dream - it’s lustrous and has a ton of color depth. Unfortunately I find  actually wearing it is a different story. It’s extremely stiff and inflexible, especially during the first 20-30 wears. It’s the coldest leather I’ve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I’ve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I’m glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there’s no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:The reason why fast fashion is often seen as bad is because fast fashion is synonymous with trendy clothes that wear out within 2/3 washes and unethical labor practices.   Trends change very fast and If a shirt is $5, how much do you think each person who worked on it is getting paid?  I personally have a hard time believing in sustainable fashion nowadays because so many brands that marketed themselves as sustainable have been found to use the same practices as unsustainable ones. This includes high end fashion labels that sell a T-shirt for $2000 but pays their employees the same as forever 21.   So I think of you can get multiple wear out of a fast fashion item, it’s a win for you as an individual. More expensive doesn’t always mean better practices or quality. I’ve bought more expensive items that lasted just as long or not even as long as my Zara items.	episode_done:True

text:90s/00s Bollywood Fashion	labels:This is so awesome lol. Fantastic job.  The time period covered in this album is also a near-exact overlap with the liberalization (along broadly "American" capitalist lines) of India's domestic markets, as well as the West's own hamfisted attempts, after the fall of the Berlin Wall as well as the USSR, at a kind of liberal multiculturalism (of the "United Colors of Benetton" variety). So from both an economic and a cultural perspective, it's really interesting to look at how mainstream Bollywood styled their leads during these years.	episode_done:True
text:Clarks Released a "Desert Boot 2" - They Look Pretty Nice, What does Everybody Think?	labels:This might be heresy, but I actually prefer the Bushacres over the old and new CDB, having had multiple pairs of both. I originally bought the Bushacre just because they were cheaper, but ultimately came to like it better.   The crepe sole looks nice out of the box, but it just gets dirty and nasty looking IME. Although this one looks a bit darker maybe. I'll have to see it in person.

The OP is asking how looking at a garnment in a website, how you can gauge if it has quality.  The majority of websites don't list anything other than fabric composition and have a page on the company's ethics, which is likely filled with lies (EVERLANE, which many "ethics' conscious people were duped with bought)). Also, expecting the majority of people to research on said ethics, when most don't even read that ethics' page is being out of touch with reality.  This person is making an effort than the majority of people don't do. To which some respond with condescending remarks?	episode_done:True

text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Your post really resonated with me. First and foremost, hats off to you, for real. I definitely would not consider a no-buy during 2020 easy, at ALL. Yes maybe on a superficial level it would seem so since we are all just sitting around in onesies watching Netflix, but shopping - especially for new clothes - is an extremely effective way to self-soothe and lord knows we have needed a lot of that in 2020.   I personally broke up with fast fashion in 2019 during my second pregnancy (which really was easy in a way, because I didn’t actually fit into anything so it was difficult to justify purchasing new clothing). I’ve had a few weak moments but have discovered sewing/dressmaking. It is really exciting in its own right because, as you said, I actually have a personal style and a lot of my dream pieces are actually super attainable. It also just feels so good to finally be outside of the hamster wheel of endless trends, sales, promotions, influencers, newsletters, marketing and whatever else have you. Good luck in 2021!	episode_done:True

text:As Chanel Raises Prices For A Second Time this Year, What Do Luxury Brands’ Inflating Prices Mean for Them & for the Industry at Large?	labels:Luxury brands inflating prices means creating another pricepoint at higher categories. When fashion tees at $300 a pop becomes the norm, why wouldn't the luxury brands jack up the price on other products to increase their margins?  The only way this can be curbed is through the consumers. When we stop falling into the hype cycle and scramble to buy up everything just for the gram and social media likes, these products will sit and go into the 50-60% off discount during the sale seasons. All these brands have data; when they see that stuff is sitting and mostly selling at lower price points, they'll need to curb their expectations and set price points accordingly.   It doesn't help right now during COVID that I see people whose jobs/income did not get affected by COVID, and therefore has additional disposable income because they aren't eating out, partying etc. They justify spending more on items at MSRP instead of waiting for a sale.

I have all kinds of office appropriate slacks and cardigans and button up shirts in cutesy patterns, casual jeans and sensible shoes.

I can see where for the average person pairing that many different colors together and including big statement pieces could be intimidating, but generally the color palettes are straight forward. Pattern including pink, yellow, and orange on the dress, orange coat, pink shoes, etc. I think it's just using more colors where some would choose a neutral.

text:General Discussion - December 01, 2020	labels:Some of the best ring sizing advice I've seen from Alicia Hannah Naomi:  > You are strongly encouraged to check your ring size carefully before placing your order.Ring sizing is not an exact science. Tools and techniques used to read and take sizes can vary from jeweller to jeweller, but being sized professionally by an experienced assistant at a reputable jewellery store is always the most accurate way to determine your ring size. Using string or paper to work out your circumference size is often unreliable.  >Make sure to factor in which hand you want to wear the ring on, and the temperature the day you are fitted as this can affect your size. Check that space between the base of the finger and the knuckle is wide enough to accommodate how tall the ring measures. Personal comfort is also a factor, but ideally, a ring should need a hard wiggle to get over the knuckle - too easy and you may risk it falling off, too much resistance and you may not get it back over the knuckle again.   >The heavier and wider a ring is, the larger the size you will typically need to wear. You may need to add one or two full UK sizes to your usual ring size when choosing a heavy and wide ring. An experienced jewellery store assistant should be able to advise you whilst you are being measured.
text:What Do You Wear With Strong Sentimental Value?	labels:Love this post, I was just thinking about this same idea earlier today as I wore my most sentimentally valuable clothing item: a ball cap I got at Rocky Mountain National Park a while ago, before I started college (I’m about to graduate now). It’s actually the only ball cap I own, and it’s my go to for early morning classes when i don’t want to do my hair.

You need to look at the reviews to make  sure you're getting a decent quality item, and even then the sizing is inconsistent, so be prepared to give some items to a friend when they don't fit.

text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:I don't think there's anything wrong with preferring dresses and leggings and it doesn't inherently signify that you are somehow unworthy for pants or "letting yourself go".   The thing is, historically speaking, dresses were actually far more practical for a woman's body due the cyclical changes we all experience, from menstrual bloating/cramping, to minor weight fluctuations, to pregnancy and breastfeeding (historically there wasn't much choice about the last two but obviously now there is), cuz you could cinch up or let out your dress depending on how you were doing.   It's only now that stretchy fabric is truly mainstream that pants have truly become as practical and cost effective in that they can tolerate a lot more cyclical size changes, which are *normal*.  Edit: not to mention all the times people would gain and lose weight due to the availability of food.   I'd say I have a pretty confident mindset and 90% of my non work wardrobe is dresses and skirts/shirt combos. I wear undersummers in the spring and summer, leggings and sweater tights in the winter and I've gotten SO MUCH MORE USE out of my dresses... They lasted me up until my 8th month of pregnancy, I barely had to buy maternity clothes.  I have been able to wear the same knit dress/leggings combo at 180lbs prepregnancy and later at 210 lbs post partum and still look cute.  What pair of pants could pull that off? Almost none, I tell you.  Saved me a lot of $$$.   No matter what I weigh, I always have a bit of a belly, so most pants dig into that anyways, which isn't comfortable. Only truly high waisted stuff feels ok, but I don't want to wear that in the summer.   It sounds like disordered thinking is creeping up on you, and you may have to consciously remind yourself that there's nothing wrong with enjoying comfy clothes that don't restrict your abdomen.

Mind you RTR is designer and not so much fast fashion options. I currently have a Temperley London dress from RTR that retails at $1195. Most of their items retail for minimum $150, average around $250. So if ThredUp is getting higher quality pieces, then it might be worth the look.	episode_done:True

The black and white kind, with the pink rubber sole.  I have no idea why- I just want them.  I’ve seen a few pairs online, but I’m hesitant to pull the trigger because I’m not sure how much I’m going to like them and wear them.  I haven’t seen them for much less than around 80.00, which is a price I’m ok with for a shoe I know would get wear, but I’m not sure about spending that on something I kind of just out of the blue want.  I’m imagining pairing them with jeans and a chunky sweater or for a quirky look, my midi length floral / flowy dresses.
text:How do I feel sexy at home in winter?	labels:matching bra and panties. it works wonders. I do this in the summer too (on summer bra days, which with boob sweat there are not many). when I buy a new bra, I typically get 2-3 coordinating panties in different styles so I have some options, and then put them together under all my clothes. I swear there's a posture change when I'm wearing ratty underclothes vs nice ones. even if no one sees it, I know it's there.

I stopped a year later - by that time, I had started seeing wholesale distributers flooding the site and making it alot harder for me to find actual used clothing for decent prices. I'd agree that there are likely too many sellers now compared to buyers - or at least too much merchandise compared to buyers. To me, that makes Poshmark too much like Ebay, and is no longer as distinct a platform as it used to be.  Edit: typos

If someone asks where the piece is from, just say you don’t know so they won’t be tempted to buy from the brand lol

text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:i don’t like when things are “matchy matchy” (as one of my hs teachers used to say), so i go by a color scheme or will wear the one or two colors but different shades of the color(s). so my shoes tend to go well with whatever colors i’m already wearing, or they match my purse, belt, jacket, or other accessories.   i don’t think things have to match exactly or be the same exact colors. as long as it goes well together and looks good, it doesn’t really matter too much.	episode_done:True

text:An Essay on the Navy Blazer with Brass Buttons	labels:I actually thrifted a beat golden fleece brooks brothers blazer last year just so I could salvage the Waterbury buttons. I've recently sewn them onto a Uniqlo Comfort blazer that I use for zoom calls now.    edit: you can also find Waterbury or replacement brass/gold buttons on eBay
text:How do I feel sexy at home in winter?	labels:matching bra and panties. it works wonders. I do this in the summer too (on summer bra days, which with boob sweat there are not many). when I buy a new bra, I typically get 2-3 coordinating panties in different styles so I have some options, and then put them together under all my clothes. I swear there's a posture change when I'm wearing ratty underclothes vs nice ones. even if no one sees it, I know it's there.
text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I'd get a really nice piece of outerwear, either a coat in a quality material like wool or a leather or shearling jacket. If you live somewhere with colder weather during part of the year, outerwear is something you'll be wearing all the time so it's worth investing in a piece that's great quality, keeps you warm and makes a statement. I think an amazing jacket or coat will elevate even the most basic outfit, whether it's a more classic piece, something utilitarian like a puffer jacket or something more extravagant. Personally I think Acne, Chloe and Tibi are brands that make great high-end outerwear in a variety of styles.
text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:My boyfriend tells me not to do this, his words are "fuck them. They don't matter. Dress how you want to" The one thing I'm massively insecure about is over dressing. I've been singled out for this a lot and it's frusting. I just want to look good. I'm not wearing inappropriate for the situation clothes either. It's more like I'm the only one in heels to dinner because I like them. And dinner like a nice place with drinks after not an ihop to a pool hall. The most picked at are a couple form fitting casual tshirt dresses I have. I love them them with some boots in the fall. But my casual clothes are not casual enough for everyone else? and they have to make comments about it. I get so anxious about it now I just sit naked on the floor for like 30 minutes staring at the few clothes I have left while my boyfriend checks in on me to see how my progress is going so we can leave finally.   But when it's just me and him going somewhere there's no problem at all. I'll wear anything confidently and feel great about it. But make me go to some kind of party or events where I know people and I just freak out and cry.   I want to look awesome. My boyfriend wants me to look awesome. Why are we trying to tone down our awesome because of how people want to be buttholes and judge us? For looking good. How are you going to let someone shame you for something you aren't ashamed of? Doesn't mean much comming from a girl who panics about going to dinner with friends but I try to remind myself of this all the time. I shouldn't have to dress down because it makes other people feel uncomfortable.
text:Your AC bill has gotta be crazy.  I saw a SF post about climate change and how we might want to avoid heavy sweaters in the future.  Bah.	labels:Oh I don’t have AC.

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Camoshita | January 23, 2021	labels:Camoshita is one of my favorite brands. Their offerings run the gamut from tailoring, to casual, and you can honestly build an entire wardrobe off of the single brand. I will say that the prices in the west can be a little eye-watering, but it's definitely way more palatable on sale. Kamoshita has an incredible eye, and it really shows in what his brand offers.	episode_done:True
text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:I taught my mom to have a little more fun, and to spoil herself. My mom has great style, but we live in the Midwest and looking at older photos of her I know later took on a sort of “mom” approach to style-to put it nicely, she likes good clothes, but appreciates them on other people. I have lots of photos of her in the 80s with amazing hats, gloves, and other things that had so much presence. I work in fashion so my goal is always to nudge her a bit so that she can feel like the center of attention, but not so far as to make her uncomfortable. This means buying nice and ornate little accessories for her, or introducing her to trends she might not know are age appropriate and easy to find at a good price. Last year I got her a 3/4 length sleeve top in navy from Jcrew with little ostrich feathers on the sleeves, and it was understated enough that it allowed her to feel like a celebrity wearing it, and it seemed to suit her. It BLEW HER MIND! This year she asked for a red clutch, and was afraid it was too specific. I promised that I would search high and low to find something perfect. There is literally no place I won’t go to find something specific if she wants it, and I often know where to look and have my eyes open all year long. I want her to feel special because she is the only reason that I do.	episode_done:True

Boils down to a thermal layer, hiking pants, a quarter zip fleece, a heated jacket, work boots, a vest, and a hard hat  After a couple years, I'm so used to wearing actually practical clothes that I'm annoyed to wear heels or deal with shitty pockets or worry about a skirt flying up.  I'm officially that queer woman who goes to the bar with her keys clipped onto her belt loop with a carabiner so I don't have to carry a purse
text:That’s a really good point, but could you elaborate on what makes a dress appropriate for certain seasons, other than temperature considerations?

Specifically the temperature one though.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 19, 2021	labels:I asked this in yesterday's chat, but I'm sharing again for visibility & hoping someone with experience with this issue:  Does anyone have a recommendation for a specific brand, material, or style of pants (including jeans, slacks, etc.) that are comfortable, stretchy/non-restricting, lightweight, and would fit a taller individual well? My husband usually wears linen shorts but would need to get some new, longer pants for a potential new job. He doesn't like the feel of most typical jeans and slacks and has trouble finding the right fit for his height. Any other guys with a similar issue? Maybe a suggestion for where to shop? Thanks in advance for your help!

text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:As someone who dresses like an absolute nut job I have learned that generally speaking as long as your outfit is overall appropriate for the situation, you can get away with murder. Like I wouldn't wear a sequined micro mini or ballgown to my office job, but I would absolutely wear a velvet suit and a bunch of brooches. I have also noticed that when I wear pieces that I love, my confidence increases throughout the day. Sometimes I have moments in the day where I look down and think "dang, this outfit is cool and I feel cool!" Those moments just give me a boost of confidence all on their own. The last thing is that people are generally too busy with their own lives to notice what you're wearing. They're doing them, so do you and have fun with it!   edit-words

This week has suddenly been all grey, and the evenings are cold enough I need to throw on an overshirt. This is quite a surprise for an area that consistently stays t-shirt weather through Halloween.
text:Feminist clothing	labels:IMO supporting your local seamstress is way better than most organizations.  To me a big part of feminism is supporting local communities and the women in them.

As to your second point, good point. Other than underwear thats true I do wear everything 2-3 times before washing.  Like I do believe people when they say the qash shreds their clothes, to be clear. I just genuinely don't understand what is doing it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I have no problem if it’s a neutral colored hair accessory.  Scrunchies feel more casual, but barrettes, thin hair ties, and headbands could be worn tastefully.  Color, if used, should be limited and not too distracting.    Example:    Red headband and the rest of the outfit is neutral. —> sounds fine  Red headband, red lipstick, red necklace, orange shirt, zebra pants—> too much	episode_done:True
text:I know exactly you how feel. If I have that much money for fashion I immediately think I could buy shoes or a coat and get more use out of it.

text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:Like others have mentioned, it’s entirely how you feel about your look and ultimately your decision when it comes down to it. However my advice would be against it, I find that while they try to be the best of both worlds with glasses and sunglasses they just end up being a worse version of either. Either they’re bad sunglasses because the glasses part is small, or they’re weird looking glasses because it’s a big sunglasses frame. As well I personally find the awkward grey tinge they have in the “mid” light conditions to be very tacky/dorky looking. Like many others have said, with the price of cheap frames now a days you can just get a cheaper pair of both. Prescription sunglasses or contacts for days you need sunglasses is likely the better option for you.

I have all kinds of office appropriate slacks and cardigans and button up shirts in cutesy patterns, casual jeans and sensible shoes. I want to wear plastic corsets and fluorescent clip in braids and platform combat boots.

text:London street style Inspo (circa 1985-1990s)	labels:Hi all! This album is just a collection of street styles taken from London circa 1985-1990s by Mr. Shoichi Aoki.      I was very much surprised when going through the photos today because of how good the fits are considering they're mostly from the mid 80s. These looked like styles from the streets of Tokyo & Seoul but they turned out to from the UK instead. I know in terms of fashion many countries draw inspiration from each other but I never expected the folks in London to be so in command and stylish from such an early period!      Another pleasant surprise was how similar these fits look to the current trend of streetwear, high fashion / avantgarde style in the recent 2-3 years. If I had no clue of the year these photos were taken from, I wouldn't have a problem believing that they were from recent years.

Otherwise I just have a lot of stuff that will rarely get used.

I'm sure that's not what anyone wants to hear, but I don't see this as markedly different than a child who has to learn to put away their toys. Messy eating isn't some genetic anomaly, you can simply exercise more control over how you eat. It may even be as simple as slowing down or leaning forward more over a table/desk.

text:My incomplete guide for buying less in 2021	labels:I cleaned out and organized my entire closet earlier this year. I sold what no longer fit and things I haven't worn in a while. I use the money I make from selling my old clothes to purchase new items. I put my entire capsule wardrobe onto a Powerpoint, so I can see what items I need or would like to add. Then, I shop around for the pieces I want and save them to my Shoptagr extension in Chrome. The extension keeps all my wishlist items in one place, and alerts me then they are discounted. This keeps me from impulse-buying just because something is on sale, since I know these are things I have been wanting for a while.  I also unsubscribed from all newsletters, but I follow the brands I like on a website called Milled, which is a search engine for email newsletters. It lets me follow all the brands I typically shop at, but because the newsletters don't go directly to my inbox, I'm not as tempted to purchase. It's also helpful to look back through the brand's emails, just to get a sense of their sale patterns.	episode_done:True

America is always the good guy, civilizing the natives, spreading democracy worldwide, blah blah blah. Really opened my eyes to how bad things are in poorer regions, schools with even less funding and resources, etc.  /u/badger0511 is right about collegiate education, but that mostly has to do with professors actually knowing their shit and trying to teach history properly rather than spreading propaganda.

text:It's a dated list that only worked for a specific kind of person/lifestyle in a very specific kind of climate/weather. Even thinking of my most successful friends, none of these are relevant to my life or that of my peers, except for jeans lol. It's funny how alien it actually is, when they're supposedly "must haves".	labels:Weirdly, I’m very much a person to whom the list is totally applicable, since I wear suiting to work so I own and wear multiples of almost everything on the list.   But because of that I know exactly how unusual that is, I think, since literally no one in my social circle has the same kind of work wardrobe I have and I’ve seen so much here about what most people consider “work appropriate” but would *never* be acceptable for me. I feel like I work in the world’s last (not business formal) office where jeans are not even a possibility and suit jackets (even ties for men) are the norm, not unusually formal.   I hope that once covid is over and I go back to the office, things will relax a little since we’ve been seeing each other in tees and sweaters over Zoom for so long, but I have a feeling I’m still gonna have to yank on some hosiery and a blazer and toddle on back in my pumps like no one ever saw me wearing a pair of purple floral leggings chasing my dog out of a room on a videoconference.	episode_done:True

text:You know how audiophiles all make jokes about how meaningless the terms used to describe sound are because sound is so hard to define in that way? Same thing here, “warm” and “cold” are very loose terms that probably mean something a little different to everyone.   I can see the argument for grey and cream being cold, brown can be warm or cold depending on the shade, not sure if I’d agree with black.	labels:Now *that's* an argument I understand. Although I still think the way he's communicating is strange. I think he means tonally neutral, bland, desaturated colors. "Cold" is a really strange way to say that, whether or not the term is technically ambiguous.

I think most that are, ahem, aggressive about micro plastics thibk fleece is among the worst offenders.
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:My advice to my past self would be:  GO SLOW. However slowly you think you’re going, it’s still too fast. Find one piece that you really love- beautiful color, perfect fit, quality material, in a style you like- before even thinking about more.  Trying to plan an entire wardrobe (even a tiny one) and then trying to shop for the plan, just landed me with a bunch of stuff that wasn’t quite right. Going slowly, piece by piece, helps to make sure I’m making a good purchase rather than something rushed, trying to fill a perceived wardrobe hole. It’s also helpful, because if you go slowly one piece by one piece, you’ll also be doing “with as few pieces as possible”, and can stop when you have what you need and love.  My second point of advice to myself would be to stay off the internet, focus on what I actually like for myself, and not get distracted by all the pretty things on all the different people.	episode_done:True

text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:I just did the same thing! I created a test capsule and put it in a specific section of my closet. I dressed exclusively from it for 2-3 weeks, and still mostly am (I ordered a couple of wish list items so I added those when they arrived).  I also felt like it was easier to get dressed (fewer choices) and my outfits were more in line with my desired style. That’s actually why I did my capsule — I came to the end of about two years of style exploration and wanted to test whether the conclusions I came to were right for me. They are!   Here’s the list of what I put in my warm weather capsule. I have another list ready for when the weather gets consistently cooler:  [x]2 sundresses  [x]Navy midi skirt  [x]Navy-based floral midi skirt  [x]Pink-based floral midi skirt  [x]2 pairs athletic / long shorts suitable for hiking/adventures – tan long & navy athletic  [x]Floral-print jersey-knit top  [x]Floral-print blouse  [x]Coral top (I think I ended up adding a second one of these so I wouldn’t have to do laundry)  [x]Navy top  [x]Chambray button-down shirt  [x]2 athletic tops for hiking/adventures  [x]1 pair dark green joggers  [x]Brown leather sandals  [x]Gray casual sneakers  [x]Adventure shoes  [x]Gold & rhinestone necklace  My colors are navy, coral/pink, dark green, and a little yellow.   I’ve been outfit repeating a ton for the last several months (wearing the same outfit for 3-5 days in a row), so that made doing a capsule easier as well.	episode_done:True

For me, my college program is extremely small (less than 16 people) and given the context of the course, they’re allowing us to go in for face-to-face instruction. I’m hoping that maybe I could exude more style during my limited time out then, but it may not be realistic given the circumstances :)	labels:First time here so idk what this sub thinks about dressing according to body type, but I've noticed it works out well for me (i.e. I have a short neck and a round face so I know to not buy any high neck sweaters without trying them on first, so I haven't since covid). That being said, you can look in your closet for what you *really* love/looks good on you and find something similarly cut but in a different pattern/colour. Look online and see what you like; this way you know exactly what you're looking for in store thus limiting your time there.

If they're allowed to post photos, you get a better idea of what the item really looks like.

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:YES. I've never paid enough attention to pants in my wardrobe until about two years ago. I mean, years ago when the mom jean/boyfriend jean became I thing, I did hop on the train; but mom jeans and skinny jeans were really the only thing I had, never really paid attention to pants that much. UNTIL TWO YEARS AGO. PANTS CAN SAVE YOU FROM YOUR BORING PANT-LESS LIFESTYLE AND ELEVATE YOUR SOCIAL STATUS.  Well, this was the case for me, at least.  I started with ambitious rips. Then I got more into the loose/baggy jean look. Then I got into joggers, straight-leg, wide-leg, balloon pants, cargo, sweats, patterned pants etc. Now I have a wide assortment of pants that fit every vibe, every minuscule emotion, every single hormone that possesses me that day. Now I'm just a huge pants fan. People are always complimenting me on my pants. Everyone by default pays more attention to what is worn on top when planning an outfit, but when the BOTTOM is factored in -- WOW you really know what you're doing.  There is nothing wrong with skinny jeans -- they're versatile in nature and really can go with everything. But it can get boring quickly. A strong, multi-dimensional pants game can elevate your look and wardrobe. I really do recommend looking at the pants on Aritzia, for example, Or Hailey Bieber's/Kendall Jenner's outfits. I tend to rely on Pinterest a lot for ideas and inspo.  PS. Many times have I failed in my pants journey (bought pieces that were actually quite ugly/didn't work/unflattering/one-time wear kind of thing). BUT BEAUTIFUL PANTS IS A JOURNEY AND A PROCESS. I'd start simple (like a wide-leg or mom jean or patterned loose pant) to ease yourself into a different pant-style. And once you feel more wild and comfortable, explore more.	episode_done:True

text:You raise good points, but I’m going to respectfully disagree - I don’t think there’s ever any valid excuse to buy from a company who openly profits from exploitative third world labour. We can all do better.   Sustainable fashion is expensive, yes. But *usually* buying quality clothing is cheaper in the long run than buying lots of cheap stuff (I know this is easier said than done for people living hand to mouth).   Secondly there are options that don’t exploit people. Namely second hand shops and Depop. I guarantee - no matter what the item is - someone’s already bought it or something VERY similar and wants to get rid of it. Even when I have money I buy from there because... why wouldn’t you?   The “what about poor people” argument always gets made but it just doesn’t sit right with me. What about the people who are being paid 40p a day in sweltering and unsafe Bangladeshi factories? Factories that are dumping toxic dyes into water sources? We all have a responsibility not to perpetuate the monolithic success of these horrible fast fashion conglomerates.	labels:Absolutely agree u/librarygirl. Second hand/preloved/‘vintage’, whatever it goes by atm, is cheaper than new, better quality and ethical.   I have definitely been through periods where I’m calculating every penny and in those times I have bought ‘fast fashion’. And it’s always been terrible quality/fit, made me feel self conscious that it looks ‘cheap’ and I always wished I’d mended or styled up something I already had rather than wasted my money.   It’s part of a bigger problem though, and I would not blame anyone for doing the same.	episode_done:True
text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:Here's the best advice I've ever heard in my life: No one is looking at you, thinking about you, critiquing you as much as you think they are.  Everyone is busy looking at, thinking about, critiquing themselves.  So wear what makes you happy! Try new things!   Edited for concision.

text:Which color palette do you hate wearing?	labels:Ha, my mom looks good in pastels so that's what she always bought me.

text:What's the greatest length you've gone to obtain a much coveted fashion item?	labels:When I was in middle school, I saw a sweater on a fashionable outfits Twitter page.

text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I'd get a really nice piece of outerwear, either a coat in a quality material like wool or a leather or shearling jacket. If you live somewhere with colder weather during part of the year, outerwear is something you'll be wearing all the time so it's worth investing in a piece that's great quality, keeps you warm and makes a statement. I think an amazing jacket or coat will elevate even the most basic outfit, whether it's a more classic piece, something utilitarian like a puffer jacket or something more extravagant. Personally I think Acne, Chloe and Tibi are brands that make great high-end outerwear in a variety of styles.
text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:GIRL, ME. I miss dressing up so much!

I miss being able to wear statement earrings without them getting caught in my mask loops. I miss wearing bronzer and blush. I miss being able to do my hair (I mostly keep it up when I go out, to avoid it getting tangled with my mask loops). I MISS SHOPPING WITH FRIENDS.   Ugh.

text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:I think the advice for "what to wear for job interviews" has changed a *lot* since the sub started. Increasingly suits aren't even a good idea in a lot of industries and you'll be over dressed.  Further, the advice from before was often to get "one good suit" and to spend a lot of money at Suit Supply or similar.   I think for a lot of people, suits will be so infrequently needed that spending $400 on a suit is most likely over kill. Especially if you're a student and on a budget.  Read the guides on how a suit should fit, a lot of that hasn't changed too much. Then go somewhere where you can try the garments on in person (writing this for if/when COVID ends) and go from there. I find it weird to recommend to beginners to try and order a suit online without seeing how the garment fits on you first or spending more than around $200 if it's something you'll need maybe twice a year for the career fairs.  Get something in a basic navy or charcoal, brown dress shoes, a white dress shirt, and a basic grenadine tie to go with it. Easy.

text:General Discussion - January 19, 2021	labels:I never thought I'd become this person, but man, shipping costs really can fuck up my desire to buy something. I was just about to commit to buying another pair of sneakers and it's probably the best deal I'm going to find on them, added to cart, shipping info entered, billing info entered... $20 for the cheapest shipping option. No shipping codes available, no threshold I can cross to get free shipping. $20 period, no exceptions.  It's a $300 pair of sneakers discounted to $180, I guess should be able to rationalize that at $200 (including shipping), I'm still getting a better deal than what's available anywhere else online (only a few select retailers got this colorway, and all but one are sold out in my size), but still, $20 shipping feels *wrong*. My brain has been trained from years of online shopping that there should always be some way to get around paying for shipping, or otherwise, shipping should be cheap.

text:How is sezane quality for you? Do they hold up?   I love the aesthetic, but both times I tried ordering from them, I was so disappointed with the feel of the fabric and thought I wouldn’t want to pay more than Madewell prices for the quality.	labels:It really depends what you get. My Sezane silk pieces are high quality for the price, especially during the archives sale. My 100% merino wool sweater is also super soft, warm, and pretty—as soft as cashmere but warmer and without all the pilling. I don't like the jeans and would avoid the viscose and polyester pieces. The shoes are overpriced; I have a few pairs that I got secondhand but I won't be buying any more. I have some good Sezane dresses too but they aren't as consistently good as the blouses. One thing I quite like about Sezane is that returns are free and easy, even during Archives sale. The customer service has been good in my experience too—if there are issues with your order, you usually get credit notes or free gifts.  The best quality pieces have just really thoughtful details—beautifully designed patterns, nice buttons, buttons up the back (so no gaping in front!), viscose (as opposed to polyester) linings, laces made out of cotton so they sit well and aren't itchy. It you like a tailored fit or have a very curvy body type the fit may not be idea. But I kind of like that tops are boxy/oversized because they fit my larger bust and shoulders, and I can just tuck them in for my preferred silhouette.  It's hard to describe how the pieces have held up over time because they are typically things I wear to work, and I haven't been to work in almost a year. I had one viscose dress that shrank, so I swore off the viscose! My silk shirts have done great with just hand washing. I have a wool coat that I got secondhand that has gotten very pilly, but I think that's just the fabric. I have had it for years, and there are no tears in the lining or loose buttons or misshapenness (issues I have had with many winter coats before). The linen is a little on the rougher side, but my linen pieces have kept their shape and the color didn't bleed with hand washing. I also have a secondhand pink cotton blouse that I put through the washing machine all the time and it still looks great.	episode_done:True

text:The joy of cordovan—and how to wear and maintain it	labels:Cordovan is an Instagram dream - it’s lustrous and has a ton of color depth. Unfortunately I find  actually wearing it is a different story. It’s extremely stiff and inflexible, especially during the first 20-30 wears. It’s the coldest leather I’ve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I’ve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I’m glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there’s no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.

text:FAQ: Why/ when/ how do you cuff jeans?	labels:**Why:** to make the hemline higher, to provide a visual break between your pants and your shoes (useful if they're a similar colour), or because they are raw denim that will bleed on your shoes excessively if you don't. I suppose some people also cuff in order to flex the selvedge ID, but why condemn yourself to a life of fruitlessly hoping that somebody will notice your selvedge ID?  **How:** idk, you just kind of roll them up. Usually a width of about an inch looks good, but experiment with wider or narrower cuffs as well as with the height of the hem and see what looks good.

From what I see, the problem is the thread in the back thats just sorta protruding and jabbing itself into my foot.  From people who have purchased this shoe brand, did any of your experiences relate to mine? Were they fixed by breaking them in?
text:I love the idea of a weekend wardrobe! I work in an office where everybody is super casual (jeans and T-shirts) that whenever I dress up (wear a cute dress or even mini skirt + stockings in the winter), I get asked if I have plans after work or I end up feeling overdressed. So even if I do feel good when I leave the house, I feel super conscious by the time I get to the office. A weekend wardrobe sounds like a good plan!	labels:Thank you. I feel like a lot of my years of shopping for work clothes was just me surviving and not really being too fashion forward or myself  but now that I have a little bit more heads space and time to think about what I wanna wear outside of work I am really excited about creating a great wardrobe. That being said if you have a lot of cute pieces that you want to wear to work it would be Cool challenge to set for yourself to see if you can find a good middle ground  to use some of your nice pieces for work while still keeping it business casual. But yeah I do wish that in the past years I had spent more time on outside of work wear, I feel like having multiple interests and hobbies outside of work is super important and my wardrobe wasn’t reflecting that	episode_done:True

However, when morning comes, I just want to be comfortable and wearing the leather mini-skirt with the 4" heeled booties I imagined the night before sounds unbearable. If I didn't have to adhere to at least a business casual dress code at work, I'd probably wear leggings and massive sweatshirts everyday.	labels:This is why I used to love packing for a business trip, because I'd plan every day's outfits (and throw in a few extra black things, because.)	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: Grandma's Gift	labels:So it was actually my mom this time around. I'm old enough to be a g'ma myself so I figure Mom gets a pass.  I was chatting with some friends a few days ago about that stupid "We try to explain the 1979 Sears Wish Book to a millenial" article and for some reason I uttered (well, typed) the words "I miss velour". Well, I opened the Big Box O Stuff From Mom, and what should be in there but.... a velour zip-up cardigan. In a hideous print. With a zipper pull that's meant to look like metal but is obviously plastic (wouldn't have been surprised if it had come off in my hand). Did I mention the hideous print is BLUE? I don't even like blue.  But on the other hand.... it's SO WARM. And unlike most of the gifts of my childhood, it FITS PERFECTLY. It's not too big, not too tight, and somehow not a million miles too long.  Velour, though. I don't even know where the hell she finds these things.  I'll wear it over the festive Minnie and Mickey sweatshirt she got me last year. God knows what I'll wear under that as the sweatshirt is basically transparent. Hopefully I won't have to get up during the call because all that fits my lower half right now is sweatpants.	episode_done:True

text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:I'd say it's not a must. It all depends on your life and your own style. I don't have an LBD, but I do have a navy dress that I could wear to work and go out and even to weddings - with the right accessories, of course. I think that's the whole point of the LBD - it's supposed to be a "blank canvas" type of clothes that goes with everything and you can accessorize it to fit the occasion. However, if you already have enough clothes for every occasion in your life, then it's definitely not necessary to go out and buy an LBD just because it's on some list of must-haves.

You are correct in that it does take a lot of time. It took me a couple of days to take pictures (or find them online) and upload everything I owned. However I tracked everything including my belts, scarves etc so if you just want to do major pieces (dresses, pants, shirts, shoes) it will probably take less time. I also make sure I catalog new things as soon as I get them so I don't fall behind.  It has been very worth it! It even has a really cool feature that mixes up random outfits from your stuff and I have found a few combos I would never have thought of from that. It is definitely worth at least trying!

text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:No one has ever bothered me, I’ve even had a female sales clerk agree with me that men’s shirts are more comfortable.  I typically only buy men’s tops, tees or hoodies or sweatshirts. I don’t try for fitted, only loose, and usually go for second hand since I mostly wear it as loungewear.  Pants I haven’t had much luck with. If the waist can be cinched small enough, that means the hips barely fit or they are way too tight when I sit down or bend over. A medium is too large and can’t be cinched small enough.  Board shorts/basketball shorts are ok, the leg is loose enough to accommodate the lady hips, regardless of the waist size. I generally don’t like the look of these on me, but you may have different preferences.	episode_done:True

text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:My hair was a bright blue/purple for a while, and I definitely had to alter my wardrobe to accommodate it. The colors I'd been used to wearing clashed badly with my hair, so I shifted my wardrobe toward colors that suited it. I didn't necessarily plan my outfits to match it, but I wanted to be sure that nothing I wore clashed. When I eventually went back to my natural color, I had to once again get rid of some wardrobe pieces and replace them!	episode_done:True
text:I know what you mean and I agree. I don't particularly like the tone of the article, and the man himself is defensive in his instagram bio:   > I am just a straight, happily married guy that loves Porsches, beautiful women and incorporating high heels and skirts into my daily wardrobe.   In other words, "I like cars and hot women, so I'm manly. I just happen to like women's clothes too. But really, I'm manly." It reads like a masc gay guy trying to distance himself from "the fems".   Despite all of that, considering where most of the western world is regarding gender roles and expression, I think highlighting something like this is important because you don't typically see successful corporate boomer men in very obvious womenswear, especially at work. So even though there are plenty of issues here I think the visibility is important.	labels:I absolutely agree. And yet, I kind of get it.   As a guy who likes high heeled boots and silky shirts and racing/motorsports, makeup, musicals and woodworking and design and shooting... it’s almost like I’m two completely different people based on which of my hobbies/pastimes/etc. I’m currently engaged in. but I’m not. I can be selfish and like all these things. they can all inform part of my identity. The me thats wearing a track hoodie and a helmet and going sideways on the autocross course is the same me that’s wearing flowers and done up and belting the lyrics to frozen (frozen 2 because it’s better than the first and y’all can fight me) in the kitchen  (The fact that I only recently discovered I’m bi only adds to the contrast. oh hey look another thing I can’t choose)  But it’s a good reminder to be careful about *how* I remind people that I’m “not just X”, because it can come off exactly like you described.

text:Opals are so lovely. I would agree here, jewelry can be so subjective I would say pearl, diamond, gold and silver/white gold studs (or good looking imitations of any/all depending on budget) are good any occasion go to pieces. Even a standard pearl necklace or even studs isn’t necessarily going to be something someone with an edgier asthmatic would go for, I think standards fall more in to categories- daily wear, statement and fancy. For more of an upper class type of vibe I’d say for necklaces a diamond collar style or choker for fancy, pearl strand and perhaps something with a tasteful small scale  pendant or single colored stone for everyday and a funky maybe chunky mixed metals or stones piece for statement. Edgier might be a sharp glitter crusted but not over large ice pick pendant (icicle? Skinny inverted triangle shape...I’m sure they are called something else but I cannot think of the proper name) on a standard 18-20” braided or box chain for everyday, large round stone on a long  chain for fancy and a chain mail type collar for statement. Personally my go to pendants are a sparkly star which was my first real diamond jewelry and a cz unicorn my husband got me on a thin but not super fine chain and rose gold bezel set cz studs for every day. Little dress I change up the earrings to something with a dangle and if I’m going fancy I have a choker (on me) with white gold alternating small ‘bars’ and geometric balls and I add a long chain with a chunky pendant. Favorite statement piece is a Betsy Johnson with a large fixed crystal pineapple.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I didn't buy clothes for like seven+ years. Now all my clothes are falling apart so I figured their replacements should at the least be a style upgrade and an opportunity to add more fashion diversity in. So I guess that's a big gg ez from me.	episode_done:True
text:> You know what? I 100% blend in. I don't look better or worse than the hundreds of other people who have just come down from the mountain. This is why people specifically wear bright colors. Your party will be able to identify you at a distance from the specific colors you're wearing. >  > I think ski/apres ski style is to skiing what cottage core is to farming/homesteading. It's an aesthetic for people who don't actually do it.  I can agree with this.  I live 20 miles from Breck, and any person you see who has been out on the slopes are wearing fearing athletic and technical looking gear.  For most restaurants, people aren't dressed in furs or look glam at all.  It's mostly basic bitch type winter garb - knit hats with a fur pom pom, long puffer jackets, skinny jeans.    If you go to Aspen though that's a bit of a different story.  More money over there so you'll see "fancier" people.	labels:20 miles is 32.19 km	episode_done:True

text:Stylish ways to carry emergency medication?	labels:Type 1 diabetic here - I can share what I do.  On a casual day when I need to bring my insulin, I use a cross body bag. If I’m carrying more stuff, I can drop it in a backpack.  Going out for dinner, sometimes i put it in my jacket pocket, but sometimes I carry a small carry case. I bought a sweet waxed canvas pencil case from SFBags that can hold my gear and maybe some small stuff for my wife.   Heading to work, I have a nice laptop bag and drop that case in there. During the day, I carry the case around with me.  It’s nice enough not to look out of place, but also blends into the environment enough not to generate a ton of questions.	episode_done:True

text:Boring neutrals have been "in" for like 10 years though. Recession or not, this isn't a new development.	labels:Heck, after years of black, black & more black, the boring neutrals are comparatively colorful.   Personally, I'm thinking about wearing boring neutrals with a strong color. Like greys & beiges with a red coat/shoes/purse (or all 3). Or olives and sages with a purple.
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 31	labels:Using a collar pin as a key holder?

I don't have many keys and thought, what if instead of a horseshoe-shaped screwball holder it was line-shaped instead?

text:Bruce Boyer on Finding Your Wardrobe and Sustainability in Fashion – Put This On (Derek Guy )	labels:i wish articles like this avoided the "expensive clothes sustainability" trope. the systems that lead to people being able to drop several thousand on a suit are inherently not sustainable, and i would love to see more discussion like that in the last question where consumption itself is addressed. imo the answer will involve more people taking responsibility for the origin of their own clothing with a focus on local labor and materials
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:I’m way more environmentally cautious now that I’m in my late 20s. As a teenager, I was into fast fashion because, hey, it’s cheap! But now if I buy new, I look for quality clothing that will last for a long time (perhaps decades). I also have a goal of  not buying more than 3 new items per year. My “new” clothes are generally bought second hand or obtained through Bunz (trading app) or my local “Buy Nothing” Facebook group.	episode_done:True

text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:I think neutrals are a strange choice this year. Spending more time at home, I see people either wanting sweat pants or escapist fashion. Look at the wild popularity of the strawberry dress. The kind of people who would normally buy beige slacks aren’t even returning to the office right now. Obviously there will always be a market for neutrals, but I wish retailers would take advantage of this thirst for a sense of adventure in clothing.	episode_done:True

text:I'm Not a Watch Guy I Swear - Street x Sprezza	labels:I am a watch guy, but very much a relatively broke one.  Had I known how much trouble it would be to break into watches, I might have said never mind and wisely walked away. I didn’t, though.   Some pointers for those interested:  1.	The cost of the watch is only the upfront cost. Like a car, a mechanical watch needs regular maintenance. Generally speaking, this will be anywhere from $300 to $1,000+...every 5-7 years.  2.	Because of point #1, entry level (~ $500) mechanical watches are not pieces you will pass down to your kids. In fact, it is usually cheaper to trash them entirely and buy new than to bother having them serviced.  3.	People will tell you there are deals to be had in the vintage market. That’s true, but it can also be difficult to find parts or people willing to work on them. 4.	There is relatively little offered between entry level and about $3,000.  5.	There is nothing wrong with wearing a quartz or digital watch.   All that being said, I still love my small collection. Just wish I had known those things from the start.
text:Just my personal observations but I think they're trying to pivot a little bit, and moving some deadstock to consolidate their inventory. They just released a field jacket, two winter parkas, and the most knitwear I've seen from them this season.

text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:I actually find most people are in the same boat as you, so I wouldn't worry too much.  It does take a lot of time and effort and money to keep up with fashion.  It helps to think of it as a hobby; and people who are really put together generally go about it with the zeal of, say, a stamp collector and stamps.  Just like how some people are basketball enthusiasts and others are gardening enthusiasts, there's really no reason you have to be into fashion.  I find that there's this really pervasive expectation that women all ought to naturally love clothes and fashion; and any failure to invest in that interest is a failure in some biological sensibility.     If you find yourself struggling, then I really do recommend getting a stylist or tailor or ideally both.  The stylist will push you to try things outside your comfort, the tailor will help you with fit issues, and having both can really be transformative in a very quick and immediate way.  But in terms of continuing your education or interest--that really depends on whether you want to make this a bit of a hobby.  It does take time and effort and money, after all.  And if you don't naturally find yourself interested; well, there's no sense in forcing yourself just in the name of "fitting in" to some perceived societal norm.       I assure you, from Paris to Shanghai, there are plenty of women who would rather learn the nuances of cement than spend any time pondering the fit of a pair of trousers; and there's nothing wrong with that.	episode_done:True

text:Well, I don't think it's just fashion for fashion people. You can just get a pair of the sweatpants. They're fun colors, they're cool... and maybe they're not the best you can get for $185, but they're very nice. The sweaters and scarves each look nice in a vacuum, you can wear each of them anywhere. But you can't expect them to style an entire lookbook based on what you're likelky to wear to work.	labels:Oh yea, for sure.  I meant specifically the more stylized shirt + tie + jacket + sweatpants looks that would be more difficult to incorporate regularly.	episode_done:True

text:Wardrobe not updated	labels:Most of my wardrobe was office appropriate, so I’ve bought some comfy clothes and basics over the past year. I’d love to get some nicer clothes, but I’m WFH and there’s no place or occasion to wear them. I’d love to update my wardrobe, but I don’t want to buy things just to sit in my closet and possibly not fit or be out of style by the time I can wear them. Also, I still don’t know if WFH is temporary or if my employer will decide to keep us remote, so I wouldn’t know yet if I should update my casual or work appropriate wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 10, 2020	labels:Where to buy pants with short legs?  Always been short and stubby. I’m 5’8”, 200 lbs, and I have a short set of legs. So, I’m looking for websites where I can find pants that would be 36”-38” on the waist and 28”-30” on the inseam. So far, the only luck I’ve had is on ASOS, where I got some 38x30’s. Love the way I look in them. All my life I’ve rocked pants straight off the shelf, that were WAY too long and it threw off my whole look. But the selection is still somewhat small on their site so I’m looking for others that may offer my size. I’m in the US if that matters. Thanks in advance for any help!
text:Face Mask Reviews - Round II	labels:My partner and I have the Tom Bihn masks and are very happy with them. Can confirm that the neck lanyard is extremely handy, as you can take off the mask while it still hangs around your neck. The adjustable ear loops are also super handy and comfortable. If I had to find a fault, it's that the mask material is quite thick and muffles your voice significantly, so be prepared to shout at cashiers who are also behind a plastic protection barrier.	episode_done:True

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.

I saw one by Carhartt, seemed super nice, but I just wanna see what you guys recommend for me, cause this may be a jacket that will last a very long time, since I’m pretty close to done growing.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 17, 2021	labels:How are underwear sizes measured?   Every year with Holiday money, I buy a few sets of high quality boxers on sale. My jean size is 33.5, my chino size is 38, so I get the ones that come up to size 42. Yet, somehow I always end up with one set wayyyy too tight. I’m not sure where I’m going wrong. I guess I should say I come from a family notorious for extremely wide hips and I also have massive quadriceps. But, I never thought that would factor in at all because I assumed companies would take that stuff into account.	episode_done:True
text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.
text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:This isn’t a direct answer to your question, but I’ve found I have a ‘hopeful’ sense of style and a ‘realistic’ sense of style.  Hopeful-me will think about buying a teal floral wrap dress because it’s gorgeous. Realistic-me knows it will sit in my closet untouched for 3 years because I don’t wear teal!   I’ve learned to differentiate between the two while I shop, at least. If I was a celebrity suddenly, maybe I would lean towards hopeful-me’s style, but for now I am normal and realistic!

text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:Don't forget that the clothes you see on TV or in films are costumes, even if it's not a "costume drama". They fit well on screen because the whole look has been designed - everyone's outfits, the setting and so on. So unless it's a deliberate choice everything is going to look cohesive. By deliberate choice I mean things like a character wearing obviously different clothes to most of the rest of the cast to show they're old fashioned, or quirky and so on.  I'm certainly not saying don't look to film and TV for inspo, but either try to modify what you see to more match where you are, or accept the fact you might look more dressed up than the majority and go with it anyway.	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Asket | February 6, 2021	labels:Oddly enough, I am wearing one of their hoody's as we speak, so it's a great time for my comments.  I actually interviewed one of their co-founders on my podcast, and decided to treat myself to one of their garments after being really impressed with their brand and company values. I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of product, but as soon as I unboxed the package, I instantly felt the quality in the weight of the hoody.   The organic cotton is soft to the touch, but there is substantial weight in the body of the hoody, which to me is exactly what I want in a garment that gives me comfort, especially in the winter.  I've only had the hoody for a month, but after 20 or so wears and the first wash, it looks like new, which is a great indicator of longevity.  Aside from the quality, I personally love everything Asket is about from an ethos perspective and have nothing but great things to say about my experience with them so far.  Five Stars, IMO.	episode_done:True

text:Almost same here, my family is very pro-traditional gender roles so I dress androgynously. Best part is, my brother does, too, and we often end up having the exact same style of clothes.	labels:Sibling win! That's hilarious.	episode_done:True

text:Agree 100%	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Feeling self-conscious with changing style around family - anyone relate? Tips?	labels:This was me around your age (or about 15-21).  My parents (and all of my relatives) expected me to dress super preppy (like a walking J. Crew catalog-- those were a thing then).  I was secretly alternative and was more about band tees and late 90s era Hot Topic stuff.  But I had very few Hot Topic type things because of my parents.   I remember putting black lipstick on as soon as I got to school and taking it off before I went home.  I hid the lipstick in my locker.    They still give me a hard time about how I dress and I simply reply with "I'm not you.  If you want to see your perfect child, go see \[sister's name\]" (my sister is a clone of my mom in almost every way, shape, and form).	episode_done:True
text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:What those instagrammers depict is that sort of standard put-together-basic-high-life luxury look. I wouldn't be surprised if they had selfies in private jets and resorts with like giant rose bouquets and the like etc. You can get this look by having all your shit together - hair, makeup, manicure perfect, toned body, nice tan. But it's very different from looking elegant.	episode_done:True
text:What age do you think you're too old to follow teenage-type style trends (ie e-girl style etc)? Or are you ever, why/why not?	labels:23 is so young! I work with several people in their early 20s and they follow all the trends of the moment. If you’re not comfortable with going all out with a trend, perhaps adding pieces into your existing wardrobe/style?	episode_done:True

text:It could work, but the execution is tricky. I don't think you could structure these threads too strictly. People wouldn't engage in a thread about strict measurements / proportions, so you'd have to go with generic subjective descriptions of fits, and then you'd have to accept that people don't have exactly the same proportions, and that everything's just an idea, not a promise.  Buuuuut if you get that all right, it could definitely go well.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do men's outerwear differ from women's? I found a really good deal on a 100% wool coat, but in men's...	labels:It'll be fine wearing it open, but it'll be tight around the bust and hips if it's closed.    Plus there might be more shoulder padding to give you an exaggerated V shape. Fine if you're intentionally going for an androgynous look, just don't expect it to look/fit like a women's coat.
text:My biggest problem with Telfar is that there isn’t a size between the small and medium bags. The size difference is massive. I’m not used to carrying around larger bags so the medium is way too big, but the small is so tiny I can only fit my iPhone, sanitizer and a credit card in it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I have made a realization that, apart from school uniforms, I only ever wear polo shirts	labels:I think as long as you avoid the synthetic fabric blends and look for high quality pique or sweater knit styles, polo shirts make an excellent staple.   I would explore polo shirts that have minimal branding and instead explore visual interest with contrast ribbing, or through muted sweater patterns.
text:What are your 2021 Fashion / Style Goals?	labels:I'm going on a super low buy for 2021.  There's a chance that I have to move at the end of the year so I want to pair down my stuff (less boxes to pack).  I'm allowed one item per month in the following categories (with exceptions carved out).  This is one item PERIOD, not one shirt and one lipstick.  I can either get the shirt or the lipstick.  Makeup, clothing (including bras, underwear, and socks), accessories, shoes (can replace only worn out athletic shoes), tech including headphones/charging cables (can replace my laptop or phone should they die), books, craft supplies (unless I get a custom Etsy order and need something for it), stationary/office supplies (I can only buy a 2022 planner).    I'm really trying to fast-track the "financial goals' portion of my budget and I'm hoping this low-buy shifts my habits and diverts money from "wants" to financial goals.	episode_done:True
text:I mean tbh I have a harder time with random people wondering why something they bought at target two years ago isn't worth retail price or above now and arguing that its out of production so it's worth more (girl it's our of production because they don't keep producing the same things season to season oh my God).   I think some of this comes down to the encouragement of bargaining on the platform. People will say they anticipate being offered a lower number so they'll overprice something, but if you're a buyer that's just an additional layer of hassle that would stop impulsive purchases which isn't great for getting things sold.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:I see it as a part of nature with my frame, there's tolerable not fitting quite right then there's fits so off it either isn't bought or is tailored depending on how much I like it.
text:General Discussion - November 25, 2020	labels:Found (one of) the dead rat(s) under my oven and the stench has slightly alleviated, just in time for pie baking. Planning on:  * Pumpkin * Coconut Cream * Ube (Actually Japanese Sweet Potato)
text:Start with shoes and bags/accessories! This is what I did when I started growing out of my younger fashion. It makes it easy to update an outfit and eventually led me to wanting to update to nicer things as I went along. I feel like clothing is a slow collection, don't buy everything at once. Find a couple things you like and that you wear consistently and start to add as you go. So many times I convinced myself that I would wear something and it wound up in the back of my closet so just make sure you take your time!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:So glad you did, the thought and effort really shows. Feels like more of a challenge when you're repurposing items in unexpected ways to fit the theme. I feel bad for doing such a basic fit but I had to go out to pick up a guitar amp so I didn't have much time to fuck around ☹️	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:I associate Gen Z fashion with crop tops and sweatpants, so yeah it makes sense that people in their 30's buying expensive ethical clothes aren't going for the sporty spice look.
text:Aimé Leon Dore for Drake's F/W 2020 Lookbook	labels:So I totally understand that this is a lookbook and highly stylized, but is it actually possible to pull off the sweats + tailored clothing look?  I think it looks sick, but my gut reaction is that while it looks cool in a vacuum, it might look kind of silly in real life.  Has anyone here rocked a similar look/style?
text:Happiest Season Inspo Album because I have a big gay crush on Kristen Stewart	labels:I love it! Kind of reminds me of the dark academic inspo albums I've seen posted with a little  90's grunge thrown in.
text:My body type is essentially a skinny pear haha. Also have a super short torso for my height! I find Madewell’s Rhyme top and Park Popover are really great tucked, French tucked, or untucked. Madewell definitely has a muted color palette overall, so depending on your personal wardrobe that may or may not work. I’ve also had good luck with tops from Splendid. If you’re super short torso’d, you might actually want to try Petite sized tops if you haven’t already, even if you’re not technically “petite” in overall height.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Shopping for clothing items you already own: confessions of an outfit repeater	labels:It meeee.   I have the black sweater in at least 8 iterations. One fuzzy, one ribbed with thick turtleneck neck, one longer ribbed with thinner turtleneck, one cable-knit with pearl buttons, one similar with regular black buttons, one boat neck, one cowl and that's not counting the chunky boyfriend ones.   Don't even get me started with red dresses. Last year I counted 14, but they're too many to now to recall from memory alone.	episode_done:True

text:this is sort of like what happened to me too! i turn 30 in a couple weeks (help) and have never identified with the idea of feeling "too old for" any fashion trend until the latest series of 90s trends started hitting stores/social media. some of it it does look cute on today's teenagers but it reminds me too much of my mom's style in the mid-90s for me to feel motivated to wear it myself. had my fill of it the first time!!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:Idk I believe clothes have no gender. You could wear button ups and be a butch all you want and I’d be proud of you for not following the stereotypes. I’m feminine and attracted to feminine women. I don’t feel pressure chasing the stereotypes bc it’s not who I am.	episode_done:True
text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:not sure if this helps contribute to the conversation, but i gained a little weight during covid, which isnt the problem, the problem is that i was eating shitty food all the time. i went up in bra size and pants about 1-2 sizes.  &#x200B;  so i made a point to go through my pants/shirts (i wear alot of crop tops in warmer months) and put them into a bag and they go in the back of the closet until i want to try them on again. I was spending so much time trying to fit into my old clothes and just having anxiety attacks. i bought a few pairs of pants that fit and am just trying to roll with that and not keep trying on clothes that dont fit and punishing myself.	episode_done:True
text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:The mod team went back and forth on the question of whether meaningful discussion as a result of this post would outweigh the harmful messages of the "article."  Ultimately, we decided that the users of this sub are free to discuss these topics, but we feel as though it's important to note that the views expressed in the "article" are not views we want to promote on this subreddit.   2020 might be a real shitshow, but thank fucking god it's not 1952.  "Part of being a woman is the desire to please a man, a very important part" is the dumbest shit I have ever heard, and I just listened to a press conference being held at The Four Seasons Total Landscaping. You can respect Marilyn Monroe's role in history and like her style and still acknowledge that this is a sexist point of view that reduces the experience and value of women to their relationship with men's pleasure.   Also, as a subreddit, we do not prescribe to the belief that womanliness is tied to a certain type of body. A woman's body is womanly by nature of being the body of a woman.   We have allowed this thread because the discussion of dressing for the male gaze is one that is still relevant in 2020, but we want to be absolutely clear that the mod team finds the views expressed in this article to be out of touch with the current era and demeaning to women.

text:Why I Love Silk Scarves (imgur album in comments)	labels:I have a silk scarf from Tootal and I love wearing it. It is pretty short and also very slippery, making wearing it with just a drape around the neck a bad idea (one time it slipped off in the streets of Southampton and I didn't notice). I quite like an Ascot knot for it though, particularly tucked into a jumper.	episode_done:True

Part of the award includes a photoshoot to be printed in said magazine.   I'm a creative director for a living, I work in an environment that prides itself on comfortable dress. I have tailored suits, I know how to put together a nice outfit. However, I'd like to do something a bit different for this shoot. The suit is obvious, it's expected. How can I switch it up? Show off some more creativity in patterns, materials, or unexpected pieces.

Search online against my favourite brands 5. Search against sales 6. If the stars align and points 4 and 5 meet, it was meant to be and I pull the trigger. If 5 can't be met, I'd muse through a bit longer 7. Be smug in my decision to buy after all that research 8. Itch scratched 9.

text:Tips for feeling confident when wearing stylish clothes around family?	labels:Dress so you feel comfortable and good about yourself!  I went the complete opposite direction with age. As a teenager I was all about tiny skirts, thigh highs, crop tops, high heels and a lot of makeup (frosty lipstick and glitter yikes)... it was the 90s and my parents let this happen.  Now, two decades later I dress a bit more conservatively around my family. Just jeans, a nice top or light sweater and makeup in colors found in the natural world. They think I’ve lost my edge and became a little basic. Oh well.	episode_done:True
text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:There's some variation, but usually:  Phone, keys, wallet, a compact, sunglasses, a pouch with chapstick, Halls, a pen, headphones, and Tylenol, a lipstick or three, a notebook, a book to read, my planner, a phone charger, my keep cup or water bottle (or both), and hand sanitizer and a mask at the moment. Sometimes a travel umbrella.   I manage to fit most of all of that, sometimes with an exclusion or two, in my Fossil Rachel satchel. I love it.	episode_done:True

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:On my first date with my now-husband, I wore a polka-dot shirtdress with simple flats. I wanted to look nice, without being overdressed. He still talks about that dress and can describe it in detail.  It’s not about what you wear. Men don’t care about that. But DO always wear something you feel great about yourself in! I’d say business casual is a good baseline for a first date.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:I think the advice for "what to wear for job interviews" has changed a *lot* since the sub started. Increasingly suits aren't even a good idea in a lot of industries and you'll be over dressed.  Further, the advice from before was often to get "one good suit" and to spend a lot of money at Suit Supply or similar.   I think for a lot of people, suits will be so infrequently needed that spending $400 on a suit is most likely over kill. Especially if you're a student and on a budget.  Read the guides on how a suit should fit, a lot of that hasn't changed too much. Then go somewhere where you can try the garments on in person (writing this for if/when COVID ends) and go from there. I find it weird to recommend to beginners to try and order a suit online without seeing how the garment fits on you first or spending more than around $200 if it's something you'll need maybe twice a year for the career fairs.  Get something in a basic navy or charcoal, brown dress shoes, a white dress shirt, and a basic grenadine tie to go with it. Easy.
text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:I go to work (essential worker) but in my job I'm supposed to look professional, yet approachable.

Also helps to listen to some of your favourite upbeat songs so you start associating the clothes with positive emotions!   In the past, I’ll sometimes tell one friend that I’m testing out a new item, and go out with that friend. That way, they can a) hype me up and b ) act as a buffer between questions. (Ex: “Oh why are you dressed so fancy today?” “Idk, but I’m loving this new look on you buttermybackside!”)

I just bought one a couple weeks ago because, like you, I’m a fan of clean lines and I want to wear certain things that tend to be most flattering on people with smaller chests. Shift dresses always make me look super overweight/shapeless because they don’t fall right on me, but a minimizer bra can help the dress lay a little flatter. They also reduce/eliminate that dreaded gap when wearing a button-up shirt, and I find that they help me to look less....Pamela Anderson-y when wearing tight fitting tops.	episode_done:True

text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:PROBABLY UNPOPULAR OPINION: Since you never loved your work clothes and don't know when you'll go back to the office, I say purge the worst and store the rest.   I'm usually on team "if you don't love it, donate/toss it!", but these are strange times. If you get rid of all your meh work clothes would you be stressed out over buying a new wardrobe when you're called back to the office? If so, just go the purge-n-store route.

text:General Discussion - December 13, 2020	labels:The long comment thread below got me thinking.   I feel like we live in a time where dozens of fashion subcultures are able to exist at once. I've never seen so many designers and brands across several "genres" all thriving so well.  Saying something isn't "in fashion" just seems wild to me right now. Because honestly I think what's "fashionable" is exploring your own personal style and aesthetic. Being yourself is what's currently cool, and I think that's dope.
text:Best and Worst Purchases of 2020?	labels:Best - It's hardly fashion, but I bought a Patagonia Better Sweater a couple weeks ago and I have to say that they live up to the hype. Super warm and comfortable yet also breathes a bit. Been wearing it mostly for early morning dog walking and hiking rather than truly fashionable moments, but super happy with it.  Worst - I misread an eBay listing and accidentally bought a medium tall (rather than large like I intended) J. Crew rugby. It's just too long on me and I don't wear it much (still looks pretty good on Zoom). Nice shirt, though.	episode_done:True

text:That's funny, I have also read an absurd amount of litterate on MM, and I have the exact opposite thoughts of her. I think she was a very smart business woman, who knew how to play the game - I don't think being sweet and naive would carry you to the top in 1950's Hollywood. Especially not when she started off as an orphan with nothing to her name.    That being said, I don't think being conniving when you work in the entertainment industry, is evil or anything. I think it's really hard (actually impossible) to project an image as consistently as she did, without being incredibly self aware. She could have internalized misogyny, but she could have also played the "cool girl" in order to win approval.	labels:She definitely knew how to play the game and did it pretty well for a while.	episode_done:True
text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:Don’t feel pressured to be something you’re not. Less is more. If you’re happy in simple things, wear simple things. Try to buy things that feel high quality. Then, if you get bored with simple things, and see something interesting that you like, try it on and see if you like it on you. If so, you’re finding your style. If not, don’t force it. “Well-dressed” doesn’t have to be “distinctive” or “interesting.”	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 15, 2020	labels:So, I generally think that the phrase "toxic masculinity" gets thrown around too casually nowadays but on the Facebook Red Wing group there is a seemingly weekly post by someone complaining about cuffed jeans and/or bemoaning the fact that RW Heritage are fashion boots. Inevitably the comments use the word "hipster" as an insult when it is so clearly a euphemism for "fag".    The whole thing is so gross and tiring. I guess that can be said for lots of stuff in 2020.
text:Fellow clothing trackers, what coveted items are you tracking now?	labels:I thrifted the PERFECT jeans 8 years ago... American eagle “super stretch” high waisted jeans. They are from the era just before Jeggings. Still enough denim to be warm, thick and resilient. Well I wore them so freaking much I wore them out. Holes and stains the works. They have now become my house project jeans. And every time I put them on I actually sigh they are so comfortable! Just enough give to just move with me. So long story short I have them on poshmark notifications, every time I go into a thrift store I look for them in my size. They aren’t super hard to find but I’m a 0 long and that’s not a size I see often. It’s to the point I know what they feel like compared to other jeans and can spot them really fast. THREE DAYS AGO I FOUND THEM IN MY SIZE AGAIN. I practically ran to the check out. When I pulled them out of the dryer and put them on I actually danced. They are so perfect! Don’t give up on your hunt it might be out there! I’ve decided to start looking for a replacement pair now so I never have to go with out them again.	episode_done:True

The article gets into this, but the account dives into old thousands of old yearbook photos—which show off this “Ivy” style across both diverse people and people engaging in diverse activities. It really contextualizes how the “Ivy” approach can be for everyone and I think it deserves the recognition.	episode_done:True
text:Arc'teryx Radsten Parka (2020) Review	labels:For what it's worth, I have the camosun, one level up in warmth from the radsten.

Otherwise a lot of what you mention here is valid in terms of construction between the two coats.
text:I can’t speak from experience with this, but according to a few people I know the book *I Will Teach You to Be Rich* by Ramit Sethi is really great if you have “enough” money but still have massive anxiety about how to spend it.

text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:So far I've done pretty well just putting my things in mesh laundry bags and washing them on the delicate cycle in the machine, then air drying them.  That being said, we have a machine that was chosen specifically because it had a very good delicate cycle, and most of my pieces weren't terribly expensive to begin with. The tag may say hand wash only, but I'm not too worried about polyester.  For things I really really love and for my bras, I do actually hand wash them, and I'd probably do the same if I were to make a really expensive purchase or if I were handling an extra delicate fabric.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone take their “power color” really seriously? Basing a whole wardrobe around one color - not just choosing an accent color for a neutral capsule?	labels:It sounds very eye catching and unique tbh. I’d say go for it.

That way the eye is forced to divert to something other than the main color.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:Check to see if you have one with Runway near you. On the store locator page it will have an R logo on ones with it. Those are the ones that sell the higher end contemporary/designer pieces (it’s separated into its own section, they have purple price tags). The best deals are when someone returns a runway item to one of the non-runway stores and they put it on clearance though. That’s obviously hit or miss. My absolute best finds are those returns during the yellow tag sales. One year I got a $500 beaded Parker dress for like $5.

text:There is no unmarked woman	labels:I think in my personal experience as  fat woman working in an image heavy career path (entertainment) everything is so stacked against me in terms of job opportunities that I automatically try and appear marked in a positive way. As I am very much an  'other' at work and stick out like a sore thumb anyway, i tend to peacock. I love bright coloured suits and dresses, purposeful makeup (as in, bright eyeshadow or lipstick) and I tend to over match in what is arguably an unfashionable way, according to FFA. It makes me feel good, and I think you can get away with more daring choices in hot climates. I am also very influenced by my recently passed grandma, who had an incredible amount of clothes and always looked impeccable- and very matchy like me!  However, since corona has struck and i've had my livelihood dwindle to nothing....I have take a pedestrian job for a year. The day I purchased my bland 'work wardrobe' of elasticated trousers and black jumpers I felt incredibly sad. I understand that I have a new role now but I just feel unattractive and basic in all the wrong ways.	episode_done:True
text:> Noel is just famous.  I think part of the reason for this kind of collab is that the collaborator brings their followers to the audience for the clothing company’s work.  There are a lot of choices for customers out there nowadays, and to sell high end things you first have to get people to look at them.  Fielding‘s signature look is playful and casual, but still meticulous and of high quality.  For the well-paid WFH crowd, who are no longer spending their clothing budget on daily office wear, I think this collab is a good marketing strategy.  Plus, I like the bold colors, and the cozy tactile stuff - high fashion but comfy - is really perfect right now.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 21, 2020	labels:What’s with all the corduroy all of the sudden.
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Maybe for starters not listen to what your mom has to say. I was a tomboy and got girlie in a second when my first skirt turned out pretty. Mom told me I had scrawny legs which was exactly not a nice thing to say at the time. She also made me wear pantyhose with my skirts AND made me pay for them out of my allowance which was a huge bummer because I loved music and had a hard time buying albums as it was.  From then on I learned to do what I wanted to do.	episode_done:True
text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:Was just pondering this the other day, I have always had hand me downs and thrift store finds and other bonus items as my wardrobe. I still have people comment on my style and saying I'm stylish, but fashion and brand choices aren't an option. I make what I can get my hands on work. I hardly ever get rid of anything just in case it will work well with something I get in the future. I wear a lot of more outlandish stuff simply because people would notice how shitty my clothes are if I was trying to dress like everyone else. I'll often get an item of clothing or a pair of shoes as a big birthday present, but anything over £100 is out of my league. Even if I could save it up, there's no way I can justify spending that much of my budget on shiny clothes, especially since there's hardly ever anywhere to wear them!	episode_done:True

text:Mario Valentino is not Valentino Garavani	labels:At first I thought this was going to be a discussion about the difference between the secondary lines "Marc Jacobs" vs "Marc by Marc Jacobs", which is also sometimes difficult to wade through as well. But I didn't even know about this OTHER naming issue.  Jeez. I definitely feel bad for people thinking they got the deal of the century and just didn't know any better.  Edit: MJ was a bad example because I guess they discontinued MBMJ, maybe McQueen vs McQ would be a better current example
text:Do you feel like your current clothing no longer represents how you want to be seen, or do you just feel a bit uninspired right now? The former is what pushes people to change styles; my current wardrobe has almost no traces of my previous interest in streetwear. The latter might mean you're feeling a bit stuck but still want to keep doing streetwear, in which case I would recommend looking at brands such as OAMC, Noah NY, Cav Empt, Fear of God, Awake NY, or Brain Dead, all of which are "streetwear" but are doing really cool things to present a distinct vision.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Are there any alternatives to a suit that you know about or your culture uses?	labels:>If it was a professional standard to wear shorts to work instead of suit pants, would we be buying designer thermal work shorts made out of wool?  We probably would. Comfort is not the only constraint on clothing — we also must consider what will send the proper message across. If you want to look like a competent professional, in most industries the way to do that is to wear a jacket and tie. There is no way around this; it is entrenched. The important part here is not what *you* think of your appearance, but what *the other person* perceives about you *based* on your appearance.  Attempts to wear other cultures’ formal attire will 1) look very strange, 2) not send the desired message to the other party, because they probably won’t know other cultures’ clothing, and 3) require explanation if you don’t want people to think you don’t know how to dress. In short, it’s probably easier simply to endure a bit of discomfort (or buy nicer clothing) than it is to try to change the cultural perception of business attire.	episode_done:True

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls” catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your “fashion house designers” but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I’ve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.

text:For those who define their style as "classic-traditional" (tailored, fitted, matching, sleek), what are your typical outfits for work, on the weekends, date-night, running errands or lounging around?	labels:I’ve pretty much been something along the lines of modern preppy, though I am incorporating more things as I get older (I am early 40s). I wear a lot of dresses and skirts. Weekend and workdays.   My offices have been casual for around a decade now, so work wardrobe has merged with weekend.  I tend to be more dressed up than my peers.   In the old days my weekend looks were basically less structured versions of my work looks. So instead of a pencil skirt I’d wear a stretchy tube skirt that functioned like a pencil skirt with more ease. If I wore jeans, I paired it with a blouse and cardigan depending on the weather.   Now I am kinda in hiatus from pencil skirts and that shape altogether. But the same idea applies, add a casual element.    I’ll wear a work friendly skirt on the weekend with a tee shirt, probably a graphic on.  Or a more casual tank top. Today I have on straight jeans and a floral blouse. I like t-shirt dresses, and will pair them with a nicer third piece: cardigan, bomber, or maybe a blazer. I love things like a jersey jumpsuit. Or a knit one.  It has a lot of ease and drape and adds a bit of polish. My “weekend” dresses are the same shapes as the work version, but with a casual fabric. Maybe that means a cotton shirt dress instead of a more structured one.   I wear a lot of flats but have also been embracing Birkenstock’s for some outfits.    My weekend purses still have a bit of structure, because that is my preference.   And to keep my outfits kosher for my casual workplace, I always pair something dressy with something casual. And that is a good rule for weekends too.	episode_done:True

Aligns are very popular, I love them they don’t slide down and are very smooth, however the quality isn’t as great. Wonder unders are popular too but they come in two fabrics that are very different from one another so you need to watch for that. The ones mentioned above with the side pocket and draw string are invigorates I like these but I find they slide down.

text:Does anyone else have “irony pieces”?	labels:A long time ago, a friend at work told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheapo pantyhose.  I looked down at my crappy nylons and actually felt cheap. I went to Nordtroms that night and bought presentable nylons and wore them to work the next day. She nodded in approvement and then told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheap sweaters. I then bought a wildly pretty ivory cable knit sweater and wore it to work and feeling quite exactly like 1000000 bucks AND i had fancy nylons too. She told me no one would take me seriously with my unkempt shoes and that's when I learned the power of a shoe shining kit.  The next day I wore crappy slacks...and, well you know how the story goes.  To this very day I wear natty clothes and shoes so shiney they can blind fleet of Greek warriors.

My only problem is I feel ethically wrong about wearing these pants, as they're made of 65% polyester, and washing them releases microplastics into the water.

Looking forward to never having to replace these black tights ever again.

text:What are your tips for dressing a big chest!	labels:As someone in a similar position, I avoid collars that are super high necked or super low. When I worked as a host and had to wear a lot of blouses I wore ones that were a size or two up (mostly to avoid button holes popping open) that could be styled in a French tuck with a tighter jean or pant. Similarly I’ll pair a tighter legging with a loose sweater or sweatshirt, so it’s not entirely frumpy but I’m not wearing something super tight across my chest. Lately I’ve been enjoying layering a nicer fitting cardigan or flannel over a half turtleneck, which doesn’t feel as oversized but the layering also takes some of the focus away from my breasts. When I don’t want to wear a tight pant I’ll wear high waisted sweats or joggers with a looser crop top, so even though it’s all loose comfy clothing it doesn’t feel as frumpy. For dresses I favor ones that are just a little loose but also come in around my waist, so there’s a bit of an hourglass shape to help seem proportional, but again it isn’t super tight.	episode_done:True

text:Thoughts on Shein?	labels:Controversial opinion, but, they aren’t that bad.   Let’s have some empathy for a moment: it is an absolute privilege to be able to shop at a sustainable store and/or to be able to buy secondhand. Imagine being someone who hasn’t bought new to them clothing in years because they can’t afford to and then fast fashion prices are waved in their faces on clothing that fits them and is their style. I’m not going to tell someone to not buy clothing from a place they can afford. I’m absolutely not doing it.   People demonize fast fashion because they look at it as black and white and don’t understand that, if you’re shopping at SHEIN, you likely can’t afford the more sustainable sources/you can’t find what you’re looking for secondhand. I’m plus sized. I can’t fit into and afford a lot of the sustainable brands out there. And, people buy out the “fashionable” plus size items in my local thrift stores to sell on Depop, so, I don’t blame people for shopping on SHEIN.  I’ve bought SHEIN secondhand and I’ve had items for years and I haven’t had any issues. I haven’t bought first hand from them in a long time but when I did, I never had any long shipping times or anything, either. I found the same defects I’d find at Target, like, a long thread here or there that I can easily snip off.   This goes for fast fashion in general—if you take care of your clothes and wear the appropriate size, you can make them last. It’s not like they spontaneously rip apart, you have to do something to make them do that. Steam your clothes to get out wrinkle. Tumble dry, hand wash, etc.
text:Thank you! Textures is one of the things I struggled with for the longest time, I think the thing that helped me the most was jut going for the dumb statement pieces (velvet blazer, the skirt that has a ton of different textures in itself, lace) rather than buying the same mostly cotton/jersey basics.  Cozy fits are my favourites :)  I have a bunch of cool rings, so when I’m in the mood I’ll just put all of them on. But I don’t really see them as part of the outfit since I’m not picking them specifically based on what I’m wearing, if that makes sense? I wish I was more of a jewellery person, but the stuff I like is a bit expensive and I’d rather spend that money on clothes, and I’m also so lazy in putting it on. That’s an amazing compliment that you think my outfits work without, thank you!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How would you store sentimental clothing?	labels:If you want to be able to look at it, depending on how well it folds up (like if there is a design on the torso that could be arranged on top), you could potentially put it in a shadow box to reduce the amount of wall space it takes up.  You could also get a decorative dress form and display it on that.	episode_done:True
text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:I went through this too, and while going through it, did an entire wardrobe overhaul. Instead of lamenting the weight gain, I chose to have a ton of fun buying new clothes for my bigger pandemic size. I’ve had a great time eating really enjoyable food during quarantine, I don’t care that I’m fat now. Also, I had been ready to re-do my style for a while, and this seemed like the perfect time.   However, now knowing how easy it is to fluctuate in size, I used weight fluctuation as a deciding factor in what I chose to buy: I only purchased items that will fit with a fluctuation anywhere from 5-15lbs (I’m 5’2). Seems crazy, but it actually is possible. I stuck to either loose silhouettes, or tight yet forgiving stretchy styles.   What worked for me in choosing what I invested in was just ensuring I put enough time and effort into the process. I downloaded Pinterest and spent an inordinate amount of time looking at street clothes, I set a budget, thought about what items I needed, and did a ton of online window shopping. Once I had a better idea of what I wanted my new style to be, I did a lot of online shopping. I did return a lot of things, but also kept a lot, too.   Think about items of clothing that you gravitate towards, that make you feel really good. Use that to form the basis of your wardrobe. The process does take time and effort, but doing enough prep before buying will really make the process way easier.

text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:Why would it be tonedeaf? This is kind of a U.S.-centric view. Not everyone in the world is still struggling with COVID, and a lot of the rest of the world isn't nearly as casual as America is, fashion-wise.   Call me crazy, but I'm tired of shapeless billowy clothing in earth tones, and I am READY for some structure and interesting textures. All summer has been about beige and washed out green and brown linen, let's see something else.   Plus, it's a weird take anyway, because high fashion doesn't really target loungewear, either way. Do we really expect major fashion houses to all abandon blazers and leather pants and start showing PJs and sweatpants on the runway?   Others have already pointed out that these collections have been designed months in advance, but consider another point - fashion has always been reactive. When forced to stay inside and only wear sweatpants for 6 months, people will rebel and start daydreaming and longing for the opposite. This pandemic was always going to inspire a sort of glam rock aesthetic, imo. BRING IT.

I was just daydreaming of where to find more options on another tab actually.. I'm really short though so I've been shopping in the little boys section.

text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:A lot of my basic items are mens ones, plain tshirts and polo shirts, pyjamas, I tend to buy mens hoodies (or even kids ones because I'm short) and mens sweatshirts too, if I can find them small enough.  I find the primark slim fit muscle tee's for men to be actually pretty good, as in not noticeably masculine when I wear them, but then again I'm not the girliest of girls either so I don't mind wearing mens clothes, or mens watches for that matter	episode_done:True

I also pop into thrift shops regularly for 5-10 mins at a time with a strict list. The list doesn't just include clothes, so my successful trips tend to be high. I don't thrift shop online.

I thought.   It was a nice magazine and had it been more convenient I would have bought it, but it was $25 and fairly large, and we were traveling kind of light and I didn't want to schlep it around for the next two weeks, so back on the shelf it went.
text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:Love hearing about your UGG transformation!  While I have purchased probably my normal amount of items during Rona, I've been resisting the impulse to shop more often and have been pretty successful in seeking and finding those boosts from my existing closet.  I've been challenging myself to approach fashion as a **verb**, not just something that I buy.  Weirdly, when I did a pretty major closet clean out during quarantine, I ended up feeling like I owned \*more\* afterward.    Not nearly as dramatic a transformation as your Uggs, but yesterday I took my ankle boots to be resoled and a belt to be repaired.  Afterward I was like, dang, these are some sharp boots.  Focusing on decent quality within the context of my budget and taking care of my stuff has made me more thankful for the awesome stuff I own, and really how much I have.  I've done a lot of shopping my closet and making new fits out of existing items.  I've found myself feeling more of a sense of abundance and creativity, while I have identified a few gaps and have shopped a bit to fill them, I often have a sense of "I can't wait to wear all these great fits I created!"  \[while working from home as my son rolls his eyes at mom, lol\]  Which feels indulgent, fun, and gives me a boost without shopping.  Like you I also enjoy variety - I can't be a minimalist all the time, sometimes I want big colors, bold patterns, different looks.  Even so I'm finding I'm pretty happy with the mix of colors / patterns / neutrals that I own; my accessories go a long way, and I'm finding myself able to creatively achieve a lot of variety.  I won't pretend I never have the impulse to shop, I research a lot and I do resist that on a regular basis.  But I'm happy to report that I'm having a lot of fun with what I own already.	episode_done:True

text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:I need to stop shopping - full-stop. I did way too much "fill the hole in your soul with stuff" this year, for obvious reasons, but I feel overburdened with the amount of clothing in my life now and I need to make a conscious effort to pare things down. If I run into a genuine need, I'll continue checking secondhand options first before buying new. I'll also continue logging outfits daily with Stylebook, because it helps me be honest with myself about what is and isn't getting worn in my closet (both for getting-rid-of purposes AND for informing-future-purchases purposes), *and* it'll help me focus in on what I gravitate toward in my day-to-day life rather than continually shopping for some nebulously just-out-of-reach fantasy self.   Summed up:  * Buy less, buy secondhand, buy practical, buy for TODAY (not a dream and a half from now), and buy only what is genuinely needed (very likely *nothing* for quite a while).  * Continue evaluating what I really need in my life, and how much, and adjust accordingly as time goes on with the goal of seriously paring down my closet to a manageable size.

text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally.

I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.

Washing helps get them back to shape if they start to bag out too much, and eventually they will start to smell  Workout clothes: 1 wear  PJs: 3 ish wears   Jackets: rarely--fleeces, sweatshirts, really anything soft will be more often, but if it's anything heavier than that I just spot treat stains	episode_done:True

text:I used to agree with this but Nordstrom has changed their algorithms and their site/app has much higher stock accuracy than it used to. And I can promise if it’s a final item in the company, the stock team is 99x more likely to locate it than a sales associate. The stock team needs to find a manager to sign off on a rejected order while a sales person answering the phone just needs to act like they checked (spoiler: they usually don’t).   Just check the app often, maybe multiple times a day, and place the order the second you see it.   Edit for clarity	labels:Used to work there and this isn’t true. Employees in store can check where items are and request other stores to ship it. They’ll typically try hard to do this too because they get commission off of it. There is the chance that the item can be denied if it’s only 1 in stock at another store, but they have a quota on denying items too, so they don’t want to do that often.   Try going into a store to see if they can find another store to ship it directly to you.

text:How do men's outerwear differ from women's? I found a really good deal on a 100% wool coat, but in men's...	labels:Unfortunately men's styles aren't an easy fit on curvy women. You'd have to size up a couple of times to make room for boobs and hips and at that point, the shoulders would be disproportionately large and the fit would be very boxy. That's not something easy to tailor or worth tailoring.  H&M currently has women's coats in 100% wool, around $150, if they're not sold out yet. They had several styles a couple of weeks ago. There are options for women high in wool content, no need to venture into the men's section if it's not a sure fit.

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:Go on Pinterest and pin things that catch your eye. Once you have a board try and find similarities between the pins (for example ruffles, silk, strappy backs etc) and start searching up those things at stores that are within your price range.  In terms of comfort, look for materials you like and what silhouettes you’re into. If you tend to do tighter tops with more volume at the bottom then look for dresses that match that for example. If you know you like cotton blends look for those.    Also look for stores that carry petite sections or find a tailor in your area  Don’t go crazy trying to push yourself too far out of your comfort zone. Look for things that are your style but that you’ve never worn before.

text:Advice needed - Nordstroms Out of Stock items	labels:Have you called a store near you? With Nordstrom specifically, your best bet is to get ahold of a sales rep and pray that they'll want to help you. They can do a stock search and see if there are any units left in the company (aka did someone return it?) that can be shipped from the store to you. You'd probably have to call periodically to check.  If it's something super hype, like the latest Supreme shirt, you're SOL and would have better luck buying it after-market at a higher price than retail.  Calling and having someone ship something to you from a store doesn't work for every company - Sephora won't do it and I don't think most fast fashion places will either. Your chances of getting a sold out item go up if you have an established relationship with a sales associate.

So, instead of looking at myself and judging myself and fantasizing about who I could be in those clothes... I saw my list and the clothes below it. It made things much easier from an emotional standpoint.  My list went something like this:  * You can only wear one pair of pants at a time. (Which applies to all garments but I like the groundedness of pants as the representative of all clothes.)  * You are a stylish and fashionable person no matter what you wear.  * You would rather have the money.  * You enjoy spending time on maintenance, but that does not include organizing your storage!  If I did this exercise again today, I would also include:  * If you don't want to wear it right now, you probably will never want to wear it. (Speaking to emotional reaction to clothes, not situational factors like working from home, etc.)  * If you don't want to mend it or alter it, that might be because you don't actually want to wear it.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 08, 2020	labels:Yesterday we had in here a brief discussion on the potential impending resurgence of square toes (niche designers -> celebs -\*> big designers -> fast fashion -> regular people).  (\*you are here). Lurkers gonna be *mad*.  Upon reflection it really highlighted to me how downright insane the discourse of 10-years-ago-MFA was. Taking the square toes as examples, we had all this "teaching material" about how they were wrong, unflattering and just an all around horrible idea. With the implication that the people who make and wear square toe shoes simply don't know what they are doing.  Yeah, right. The people running one of *the* most profitable and most competitive markets simply didn't know that square toes "don't flatter your foot". They needed randos on the internet to find that out. *Insane*.

text:I'm having the exact same reaction. And I wasn't a huge fan of this style the first time around. But OP I do like several of the work outfits and I think you did a good job at incorporating the Y2K aesthetic into work appropriate pieces.  This style of fashion was a serious reaction to grunge and reflected the more optimistic and hopeful feeling around the early 2000s. I was in high school for grunge and in grad school and working in the 2000s and the kids 5-10 years younger than me absolutely loved this style but I 100% hated it, and I was definitely not optimistic (and unfortunately was correct about a lot of my guesses about the future).

Part of it is equipment - I don’t have a serger which is used a lot in clothing making - and part of it is I’m not that concerned about the seams on the inside of a garment that only I will ever wear. That being said, if I had taken the time to do proper seams, there is no reason those garments wouldn’t last just as long as higher end garments.

text:That's probably the single most recognizable quote of his outside diehard avant-garde fashion circles. It needs some contextualizing though. Like everything else, you have to consider where the speaker is coming from. Rick is addicted to working out. He's on steroids. His addiction is understandable because before he got into working out he was doing drugs and was, by his own admission, on a very unhealthy path. His wife got him into working out instead. But he's effectively swapped one addiction for another. Working out is generally one of the best things you can do for your health, but not when you're pushing 60 and regularly taking steroids. When it comes to that Rick quote, it's worth knowing that he's not speaking from a well-balanced position.  All that is to say, the general spirit of the quote is solid advice. But Rick Owens is probably not a good authority on moderation, which as with all activities, should be a part of your workout routine.	labels:I really appreciate you offering this perspective and context	episode_done:True

text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I think the size of your wardrobe is going to depend on your climate, job, hobbies, and general lifestyle. I have a lot more clothing than that. I also live in a place with four seasons. I have outdoorsy hobbies that require some tougher clothes. I can‘t wear my casual clothing to work (and I’m also holding onto some more professional clothing from a past job in case I return to that field). I don’t have a lot of disposable income either, so I always keep things like dress pants even though I never wear them in my everyday, because I can’t afford to go shopping when interviews and funerals come up.  For instance, I probably have at least 15 dresses alone, once you count all the strappy sundresses, nice work dresses, wool sweater dresses, the cocktail dresses, and the evening gown that’s in the back of my closet - and everything in between.  I swap out my clothing with the seasons and have one closet that I share with my husband, so I try to be judicious about what I keep, while giving myself grace that I don’t need to get rid of something just because I don’t wear it regularly.

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls” catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your “fashion house designers” but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I’ve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.

text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:I worked in an office environment since starting after university, so my "uniform" has been business casual  attire consisting of button up shirts and blouses that I interchange with bottoms (dark trousers or pencil skirts). I find that going for a light and/or neutral coloured top, paired with a dark coloured (black, navy or grey) high waisted bottom has been worked for me.  It's about balance I think. Depending on your personal style, you can try a patterned, or colorful top paired with a dark coloured/neutral bottom, or vice versa. Or try monochromatic pairing, or some kind of color theme to the separates. Starting with neutrals is easier, and then maybe venturing into other color palettes, textures and patterns, depending on what you like.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I am a very ordinary person so take this with a grain of salt. What I would do is a commitment to wear sth "new" every day. It's just not how you put it on and look at the mirror, but it also has to do with how you feel in it all day long.   Sometimes it's gonna work, sometimes it won't but you can have fun with your wardrobe everyday and hopefully you will find what goes well with what you have inside that huge wardrobe.   You are young so you can be daring.  You will be surprised.  Good luck and happy trying :)	episode_done:True

I do, so I own a version of most of these, but that kind of work environment is less and less common, and I think a lot of women no longer have much use for blazers, trench coats, dress pants, etc.

I live in Montana and have put up with many frigid winters without having to sacrifice my love for long skirts and flower-child dresses.

text:Ordered from Shoe The Bear (rant, experience in post)	labels:Sorry, this isn't directly helpful, but I've ordered from Shoe The Bear two or three times. The first time I kept the boots (suede chelseas) and they were uncomfortable and never broke in, but did very soon expand to way outside the size of my feet despite following their guidelines and ordering what was eventually 2 sizes below my normal size (having ordered multiples to test) leaving my feet to flop about at the heel and yet rub on my toes to the point of leaving red and slightly blistered skin.  Each time after that I've sent them back, based both on sizing and the appearance of quality. I would never buy them at the full prices they charge based on the workmanship and materials they use, and even on sale, they are quite sneaky about how returns work - they put it out loudly that they include a return label, but you have to dig to note that that return label is then deducted from the cost of your refund, and it's not cheap.   The last time I did this, I couldn't use the return label at the post office, even though the website said I could, so I paid for my own postage. When they did refund me, not only had they still tried to charge me for usage of the label, but they appeared to have applied it twice. I contacted the customer support to query this, at which point they asked me if I had used the return label, which A) they should really know at that point, and B) wouldn't have explained the extra charge anyway. They said they would refund it and I should see it in my account sometime that week (it was on a Monday). Guess what? No refund - I had to contact them *again* the following Wednesday to remind them, and only then were the accounts department finally moved to action.   Good deal on sale or not, I would never order from Shoe The Bear again.

text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:Honestly, I think if an item brings you joy, fits your budget, and you’re sure you’ve got things to wear it with then it’s ‘worth’ whatever the price is.   I try to spend more on things I’m sure I’ll wear over and over. Like my fake leather jacket I’ve worn every cool day for eight years finally started cracking on me so I decided to throw down the money on a good real leather replacement that will last me a long time. Same thing if I wear through a favorite pair of jeans or have a specific style of top I know I love wearing. Those things are worth the extra cash.   But for a trendy thing I just want to experiment with? I see no harm in tossing out $20 on it, seeing just how often I wear it and then buying a higher quality version later if it starts to wear out. I try to limit these purchases so I’m not wasting money on a closet full of trendy stuff I never end up wearing but I still spend $20-$30 on a new “it” item to feel like my wardrobe is getting refreshed each season.   Tl;dr life is short, value is subjective. If that cheap forever 21 cardigan is calling your name then get it even if you know it’s not gonna last forever. So long as you actually wear it and enjoy it then it’s not money wasted.

text:Help with 2020 post-COVID scrubs style	labels:Hey there! I’m not in medicine (yet! in a postbacc premed program now), but I didn’t volunteer at a hospital during the peak of COVID in my area. My job was sorting through an actual mountain of scrubs in the basement of the hospital. So I spent around 100 hours seeing/feeling/folding almost every brand of scrubs you can imagine.   I agree that Figs are probably the top brand for scrubs. But I also want to plug a brand that I think did a great job on making more fashionable cuts/colors/styles: Med Couture. They have a lot of options for cut, and the fabric was softer than most of the other scrubs that I sorted (all had been laundered several times in industrial machines).	episode_done:True
text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I had this perfect oversized navy and white striped linen tee from LOFT. I loved it for years and then it got a big ol hole and I don't know how to fix linen (can you fix linen idk?) so I had to let her go.   I was heartbroken, she was so good to me, always covering my pasty white skin while keeping me cool, hiding my belly on fatter days and tucking beautifully into some jeans on less fat days.  I wasn't even really aware of resale sites until last year because I hadn't really gotten into secondhand shopping yet. Then it took a while to realize that I can re-buy all my dearly departed favorites.  Then one day I searched for her on posh and we were reunited in less than a week. It was beautiful and I feel whole again.	episode_done:True

text:Wolf vs Goat Fonzie Goes to India t-shirt Review and Fit	labels:I’ve been looking for the perfect white T-shirt for a while. It’s almost an obsession at this time.  Right now the only T-shirt that checks all the marks, except for price, is Velva Sheen.  Wolf vs Goat seems too gimmicky to enter the list as of yet I tried these brands:  Velva Sheen — perfect but too expensive. Not very soft but I don’t really mind it since it holds its shape/fit is the perfect thickness.  Everlane heavyweight cotton — good but too long.  Naked and famous — too long and expensive ($50)  Uniqlo Supima cotton — too thin, shows my nipples  Taylor stitch heavy weight — too thick for the summer  Taylor stitch hemp cotton blend — too thin, shows my nipples. Nice fit though   Random Amazon heavy weight cotton — too long and loose  Next one one on my list is Kuwalla because they have the same barrel stitching construction as Velva Sheen but much cheaper at roughly $25/tshirt, and it will likely be the last one before I bite the bullet and go full Velva sheen for my tshirts.  Edit:  Just noticed WvG is based in DC. Going to give them a try.
text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:Everything eventually comes back in fashion.  Personally I would love for 2000s jeans to come back - not super low rise or the ones that were bedazzled or laced up but just normal rise bootcut and flare jeans. I have a few from that era that I still wear all the time and a couple more that I had to replace with similar ones from poshmark because I couldn't find them in shops.  I also miss 2000s makeup. Sure, there was too much body glitter and candy colors but there was also the fresh dewy look of blush and a light lip gloss - think Britney Spears in her Oops I Did It Again video, or Mandy Moore's makeup in her video for Candy. Not everything in the 2000s was horrible lol.

I'd be all over their wool overcoats. Their vibe is more towards the permanent style crowd but with as much as I spend on clothes I can't really claim the working class hero angle. The Barbour thing is probably more rooted in not wanting to look like I'm emulating the British elite.	episode_done:True
text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:I definitely changed my wardrobe up when I lost weight. I wore a lot of black, a lot of graphic tees, hoodies and straight cut jeans, basketball shorts, cargo shorts. I definitely am now in the “basic bastard” category of dress. No more black, but more subtle natural colors like dark green, navy, browns, etc. avoid sneakers and big logos but instead casual boots and such. Oh and everything slim fit, but obviously not ridiculously slim. Levi’s 511, J crew 484, etc. I definitely experimented when I was dropping weight and still had to dress business casual. But yeah don’t overthink.	episode_done:True

text:I'm Not a Watch Guy I Swear - Street x Sprezza	labels:I am a watch guy, but very much a relatively broke one.  Had I known how much trouble it would be to break into watches, I might have said never mind and wisely walked away. I didn’t, though.   Some pointers for those interested:  1.	The cost of the watch is only the upfront cost. Like a car, a mechanical watch needs regular maintenance. Generally speaking, this will be anywhere from $300 to $1,000+...every 5-7 years.  2.	Because of point #1, entry level (~ $500) mechanical watches are not pieces you will pass down to your kids. In fact, it is usually cheaper to trash them entirely and buy new than to bother having them serviced.  3.	People will tell you there are deals to be had in the vintage market. That’s true, but it can also be difficult to find parts or people willing to work on them. 4.	There is relatively little offered between entry level and about $3,000.  5.	There is nothing wrong with wearing a quartz or digital watch.   All that being said, I still love my small collection. Just wish I had known those things from the start.

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:I have moved to different climates many times. My recommendation would to not purge or change anything until your move is complete. The reason is, you definitely get climatized, where what would consider "warm" in the winter to you now will feel chilly enough to wear heavyweight items you hadn't expected would work once you are climatized. A lot of items that you think will/won't work end up being the opposite, etc. You mentioned having less storage, so it sounds like you will need to offload/purge at some point, but I'd wait to do it once you get there and put it off for as long as you can to truly see what items work. I'll never move to a cold climate again but even moving to different warmer climates, I will wait to do any paring down/purging until I can get a little climatized and adapt.
text:Matching shoes & purse	labels:It’s a dated rule that lives in your head. But if you enjoy matching shoes and purse, go for it! If you like doing it sometimes and not others, that’s cool too.   I grew up in a time and place where matching shoes, belt, and purse was the norm for any remotely dressy outfit. I walked away from that about 15 years ago and love being more creative with combinations.

I learned hand Washing in university when our washing machine broke and the landlord didn't fix it for 3 months.

Plasma edged this one out for me just because Chuck's seemed a bit too similar to last week. I do wish Plasma's trousers leaned a bit more to one extreme of fit, to me they seem in kind of a no man's land of straight.  *Raiora vs. Sal*  Tough one to pick for me. Raiora always brings a crazy mix of pieces together and they always work so well. However, this time I think the trousers were a bit too flat looking in texture compared to the guage of the cardigan. Sals fit was unexpected but good, the overlapping layers and texture mixing was really cool imo.  *Joel vs. Ngo*  I went back and forth on this one for awhile, definitely most difficult match-up for me. Both had some very similar ideas with silhouette, both executed very well. My personal preference is towards Ngo as I really liked the subtle textures displayed in his detail shot, but in the end I copped out and voted for both.  *Chunsak vs. Comeback*  Always love seeing what these guys bring to the table. Both their fits are great, but Chunsak going maximal English countryside estate owner won me over in the end.	episode_done:True

If it doesn't, then it's just not gonna be worn in the fall/winter, it's too cold where I live for bare legs and I have never really found other colors/patterns of tights that I like the look of. Plus it means that everything also matches with black boots so it just makes things easy.  Also I just want to shout the praises of fleece lined tights from the rooftop. Those and loose fitting dress=ultimate comfort, but looks like you tried. I agree with the other commenter who suggested sizing up in tights, they never fit right when I got my true size, now that I size up I don't feel like I'm constantly adjusting them throughout the day anymore.	episode_done:True

I've been wearing t shirts or undershirts under my sweaters so they last longer between washes - this also reduces the scratchiness. Maybe this would help preserve your sweaters?	episode_done:True

text:I've watched a video on this and I think you're right.  Also, I think the argument is that a knock-off is not going to steal market share from the original. Those who want to and can afford a high end designer brand aren't going to buy a knock-off and those who do probably can't afford the original.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:what are your fashion flaws?	labels:I simultaneously buy things I like regardless of having the occasion to wear them and also have a tendency to "save the good stuff" for these nonexistent occasions, which has resulted in a practical overabundance of clothes that are just a little too dressy for my lifestyle, and that this year I have literally had no reason whatsoever to touch...  I also don't know if it's just me but I'm constantly hooking parts of my clothing (belt loops esp) on cabinet handles?

text:How to wear nice casual clothes with a cotton allergy?	labels:Have you tried looking for clothing made out of hemp or linen? You can find casual tshirts and whatnot that are 100% hemp fabric. You can also find causal shoes that are hemp (i have an older pair of Adidas that are 100% hemp fabric uppers). Plenty made out of leather as well.  Do you have a budget for clothes? A lot of companies that use these alternative materials are considered "premium" brands and carry their price tags accordingly.

Of course I stopped using it when quarantine happened - (im no longer going into the office and having the opportunity to wear fun outfits) - but I do like it, and it actually made me realize I was holding onto certain clothes I really didn't like. That and covid made me donate to thredup lol	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:Pre-Covid, I went to several clothing swaps hosted by a friend of a friend. The clothing swap would be at a bar in the area, you could get drinks (friend of friend is a bar tender) and go through the clothing on the tables. You could choose to drop off clothes and take nothing, you could choose to give away nothing and take stuff and anything else in-between. Most people came with stuff and left with different items. Everything left over at the end of the night was donated.   I LOVED going to these swaps. I got so many awesome things and it was a great way to give away things that I was no longer interested in wearing.
text:All things K-Fashion!	labels:I love watching kdramas for fashion!! Partly I get sad though because I know that stuff is sponsored/product placements and I could never afford them 😭   I do enjoy SK fast fashion too though, and had so much fun shopping in Hongdae, Dongdaemun amd Ewha back when travel was a thing. Ditto for Japan! The clothes there are just more fashion forward, well-made and affordable. Whereas a similar looking piece (same quality) would cost $80 or something at Aritzia.	episode_done:True

Runway looks were never talked about. OCBDs literally were the height of fashion.   As I recall it it was just a lot of noobs helping other noobs and trying to bootstrap an understanding of fashion out of that. Actually worked reasonably well for what it was, but the results were sometimes terribly myopic. I think it's better now.  > Timelessness was also very much a product of the post-recession mindset and attributing it to MFA seems a bit grandiose.  Yeah I wasn't sure about "spawned" -- "belonged to" seems definitely right, though. But many of the blogs really pushing for #menswear (DAE spezzatura) seemed to be posted here a lot and gained a lot of their community following from here. Can't really say how much MFA just sat within this zeitgeist and how much it helped shape and propagate it.  You've been here more consistently than most, perhaps you have a more refined impression on how that went?

Exceptions: anything made of wool or silk must be washed in the bathtub by hand with The Laundress Wool and Cashmere Shampoo instead of detergent. This is what I do for anything labelled "dry clean only" as well.  Leather is the only thing I do not wash either in the gentle cycle or the bathtub.

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:i don’t have a strictly capsule wardrobe, but the colors i feel best in are pretty neutral, so i stick to those. black, white, grey, shades of green, navy, some tan/brown. most of these colors go with each other.   in high school and my early college years, i was much more experimental with my style. now i know what i feel good in, and i know i don’t have an unlimited budget, so i try to buy pieces that will go with most of my other clothes. i think there’s a financial benefit to this (getting lots of ‘wears’ per purchase). it also makes putting outfits together faster and easier.   i still buy “fun” pieces and mix them in, but my higher priced items need to be able to go with most of my other clothes.	episode_done:True
text:For a second lets remove the problematic conversation of looking "gay" or acting "straight", we can circle back to that in a moment.  Lets talk about context and clothes and bad habits we all have. When we start to do something new, we often over correct and this can be problematic in our personal lives. A lot of people will start their style journey and go a bit too fast and a bit too hard, styling themselves for an aspirational goal or lifestyle and ignoring where they are and what they're doing. Obviously you should dress how yourself however you feel, but then you've got to be willing to deal with people's reactions to your choices. So what do you do? Making sure your clothes aren't sending a message that doesn't vibe with the rest of your situation. You're 19 and wearing a tan blazer for a kickback with your friends, that's a bold look. In fact wearing a sports coat is super hard to do nowadays in a casual setting, it's almost immediately assumed to be "dressed up". Your peer group might not understand your new interest, but keep at it and being a little bit more stylish will become your thing. I still get teased for how much I like clothing, the number of shoes in the shoe rack, knits in the drawers - wearing chinos when everyone else is wearing sweatpants - that's life.  Now...I want to be really clear about this: There's no correct way to be Gay or Straight, a person's mannerisms, voice, personality, clothing is not dictated by their sexuality. The sooner you come to accept and understand that, the easier ride you're going to have in life and you'll be a better person. Neither is there anything wrong with being assumed to be gay, straight, bisexual, trans, queer, etc. it speaks to the other person more than it speaks to you. Be an Ally.   Finally, I understand that the world isn't awesome and that in some situations it can be dangerous for someone to think you're anything other than Straight. If you're in that situation, or around those people...stop, find new people, find new situations.	labels:	episode_done:True

I put this together from my existing wardrobe, since we didn't want to spend a lot. Covid measures made things a bit weird, but the court officer made a real effort into making it nice, which was great.

It was fun seeing all y'all Americans count down to my wedding day.

text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I think it did for me, however im trying to fix that. Id say my style in general is feminine/pretty and dressy. The weather in one location was mainly rainy, but also had alot of hills. So I ended up wearing jeans, a sweater/shirt and trainers for the majority of my duration there, unless I was going out. In that case, my style showed through more. Ive now moved back to my home country which has all seasons. During the summer, its hot so im normally in a feminine, flowy dress, but once winter hits, its just way too cold lol. Ill kind of go back to swearing jeans, a sweater and boots, but try to style it with more accessories (colorful scarf or a checkered jacket with some mid sized earrings). I bought a pair of knee high boots, a skirt and a couple thicker winter dresses this year to push myself to maintain my style whilst staying warm. We shall see if I stick to it, lol.	episode_done:True
text:Runways have been sending out 2000s vibes. Anyone onboard?	labels:I thought we all agreed that we can't wear low waisted jeans because we're all too fat 😫😭
text:Knee-high boots, classy heels, or trendy sneakers?	labels:Well I have been wearing sneakers with dresses/skirts on a regular basis since I was around 13 or so. Typically minimal types or when I was way younger even Keds. I am 42 now so that is like 30 years.   I also like pointy flats and those are a more walkable and polished option - and have been doing so since my early 20s. I also like ankle boots and have also been wearing those since my 20s.    These 3 are the shoes I wear the most - pointy flats, ankle boots, and sleek sneakers. I wear a lot of flats - those get the most use. The other two are regulars that can be a bit more seasonal.  In the before times it would be something like 4-5 days a week with flats and 2-3 days of sneakers. And in the winter or rainy season the boots replace the flats for many days.   I do not do heels very often and have been swapping out the ones I have for block heels since they do not get messed up on sidewalk grates. I love a slingback or mule so those are the styles I get the most.   I do not do knee high boots for a myriad of reasons.
text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:a home sewer/ knitter, who is relatively experienced or at least willing to put in the time to do a good job can 100% meet or exceed the quality of store bought clothes. It's just a matter of using techniques and good quality materials. If I sew something quickly and don't finish my seams, it might not hold out as long as if I take my time and am careful and thorough with the finishing methods on the inside, then it will almost certainly be better quality and more sturdy than something from H&M, for example.	episode_done:True
text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:The key is actually just learning how to create FABULOUS casual outfits rather than tryin to dull down a dressy outfit. Instead of starting from a place of Dressiness, start with Casual then work on making it the NICEST version of casual possible.    I like to wear jeans and loafers and then some gold earrings, a small scarf, a blazer and maybe a necklace. Where I live even that can be too fancy. So if I see its over the top, I just whip off the scarf and blazer, wipe the lipstick off a little and then I'm looking really cute casual in a t-shirt and jeans.     Overly styled hair and makeup is one thing I notice older women do that "ruins" a casual outfit. The hair is often too stiff and done and the makeup too "nice". So I think having a really pretty, casual go-to hair and makeup routine is important.	episode_done:True

text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I've been on a fashion sustainability journey for a while now - in 2019 I vowed to only buy recycled fibers - and did so until early 2020. Somewhere along the line, I realized that's really not the best thing, and went on a no-buy.  Then I discovered depop.   I was pretty restrained to begin with, then, driven by my love for variety that is quite similar to yours, went on a bit of a spree of buying all the things I've been holding back from for a few years. That said, I probably only purchased 10-15 items in total, and out of those, only one has turned out to be a dud (slightly too small, will sell on), so I'm pretty pleased.  I also naturally tend to buy things that will fit with the rest of my closet, so I never had much of an issue there. It was a little difficult when I decided to transition from a very professional to a more "me" wardrobe, but I did it over time, and now I'm quite happy with how it's gone.   The thing I did recently is branch out into accessories - and I've been getting either second-hand/vintage, or unique handmade items from artisans. That's been a whole lot of fun, and I feel like I'm supporting the right people.  I don't have that many restoration tips, but I've learned some decent care tips over time. My favourite one at the moment concerns white shoes (sue me, I'm a sucker for them) - wipe them down every time you wear them and they likely won't require a huge clean at any point! Depending on where you go, of course. I also like to air out my clothing before I decide they absolutely need a wash, especially blazers. If you're persistent enough, most smells will dissipate over time. Just don't put anything in direct sunlight, colours might get washed out!	episode_done:True

text:I can't necessarily speak to where you live, but in my 28 years of American life I've been to plenty of formal events and I've seen a 3-piece suit worn less than 5 times. It's definitely a more formal choice than a 2-piece suit and the general shift towards casual clothing means even the occasions for a 2-piece are getting rarer. So I would say that it will likely stand out and catch attention as an intentionally formal and possibly somewhat anachronistic choice.  That being said, I don't think it's inherently a *wrong* or *bad* choice - if you work in an area that requires very formal clothing, it could be useful to have the variety, or if you're aiming for that dandy-ish side of menswear that embraces the affectations, it could definitely have its place.	labels:I live in Austria, where things are bit more formal, at least compared to the US (from what I have seen). So more formal suit varations are not as rare but its still definitely the exception to the rule.   I would definitely expect it to stand out, at least somewhat. My main worry was, that it stand out for the wrong reasons.  I do have a shop near me that has a good selection of 3 piece suits. Just haven't been able to make an appointment due to covid. So actually seeing the suit on my body will hopefully help, in terms of getting a better picture.  Thank you very much, for your advice	episode_done:True
text:How to Talk About Collared Shirts	labels:I wear a lot of grey flannel trousers for a while and I'm looking to add some texturred casual shirts to my wardrobe. Would a seersucker shirt or heavy irish linen shirt look bad with flannel trouses since they are usualy asociated with different seasons?  Any recommended shirting for flannel trousers?
text:> I don’t think that any of these groups should be completely separate however I do find them all being lumped into the same spaces very frustrating as someone who does love fashion as a form of art and creativity. > > I like harsh and blunt constructive criticism in pretty much all areas of life and I most certainly want it for my outfits as well. I want to hear what other fashion lovers and artists think of my colour choices, proportions, textures, fit, etc. and be able to refine those things and really flex my creative muscles when creating an outfit.  💯. Bad takes of runway shows or industry inside baseball are easy enough to gloss over, but poor critique actively inhibits people's learning.   If anything, "You do you"-type comments are _even worse_ for people who are only involved out of a sense of obligation; clothing is non-verbal communication, and if you're attempting to portray a certain image you want to make sure it's perceived properly. I frequently interview people who show up in outfits that don't convey an appropriate message (e.g. wearing a suit when it's explicitly called out to not do so in our interviewing materials).  > I’ve been an off and on follower of FFA for a few years and I feel like it’s definitely dominated by the “people who wear clothes” group and unfortunately it limits the amount of critique that is acceptable to give.

text:Discussion: Clay Jewelry?	labels:I love clay earrings. You can find something for anyone if you look for the quality artists. Big kitschy earrings, tiny dainty ones, etc. There are some true artisans out there. We’re seeing a huge surge of small shops of various crafts (bows makers, tumbler makers, sewists, clay) because of the pandemic and people needing to find hobbies. Which I love. Everyone should have an outlet. But not everyone needs to sell their pieces. You can enjoy things without monetizing them. Every hobby doesn’t need to be a hustle.	episode_done:True

Don’t know how to wear it because it’s longish and wide, quite a boxy cut, when almost everything else I own is skinny as fuck.

text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I find skirts work well for me in that there is no tightness around my legs. If it is really cold I will wear tights too, but they have to fit well and not constrict anywhere. No pressure on my knees, no seams or fabric bunches pressing into my nethers like I might have with trousers or jeans.  I like to feel the swish of a skirt, but from the sounds of it, your trousers wrapping around your legs don't make you feel happy so that may not be something that works for you.  I just find I feel less constricted in a skirt.  I tend to go for circle skirts of knee length or longer.  I'm fussy about fabric too, I don't have any patience for polyester or acrylic or anything that might make me feel sweaty or overheated.   With a skirt I just have the one measurement to be worried about, the waist measurement. As long as that fits well and is natural fibre, I'm golden.	episode_done:True

text:I've taken 566 outfit photos over 4 years (my style from mid-20s to 30)	labels:I absolutely love this!  I remember about 10 years ago I saw a story about someone who took a photo a day of their face over an extended period of time and I was floored by the commitment and the progression of how much someone changes facially.  It was presented in one of those flip-book-esque ways.    I was intrigued by the idea of taking a photo a day as some sort of time capsule/chronicle and started taking outfit photos when it was somewhat shameful and indulgent (at least to me then) but now I have a whole archive of outfits from ten years ago.  It does chronicle emotions and whatever period I was going through as well so your piece resonated with me a lot.  I keep the archive of outfits mainly to keep track of what I wore but also I hope to look back at it when I'm old and decrepit to see myself as a youth.	episode_done:True

text:Yes I agree with that - workplaces are getting more casual but any midriff skin is really a big no-no still. You really can’t have ANY midriff skin showing. If you love the overall shape you could wear a cami underneath so instead of a strip of skin you have a strip of cami.  I agree with the general advice to just wear boring things for a few weeks/months while you’re new and getting a feel for the overall vibe. There will almost certainly be a way to dress more interestingly and have fun with it, but there will be “ok” and “not ok” ways of doing that and you’ll need a bit of time to figure out what they are. A few months of dressing boringly isn’t a big deal in the scheme of things.	labels:Agree with this.

text:Schott 538 Nubuck Cowhide Mechanic Jacket	labels:What perfect timing! I also just received this Schott mechanic jacket! It's my first Schott jacket and I love it! People here don't seem to appreciate the contrasting collar, but I think it makes the jacket stand out! It's a little touch that makes the design more unique and not as likely to see the same jacket from other makers. And the goatskin leather for the collar makes it very comfortable against my neck, and I wouldn't want the waxy/oily cowhide rubbing against my skin.  *** I love the chambray liner on the inside. I was turned off by a lot of other Schott jackets having the warm flannel liner as it would make the jacket harder to wear in the warmer seasons.    The buttons are definitely a stand out too! Makes it a lot easier to layer, which I believe was their intention. ***  And I'm very satisfied with the fit! I typically wear size M in my shirts, and I juggled over what size to buy, but eventually settled on sizing up to a L for the Schott, and I'm glad I did! The jacket has enough room to layer a sweater for the winter, but still looks great by itself. I was worried sizing up would make the jacket too boxy, but to my surprise it actually does have a slight V shape in the body, with a slight taper from the chest to the sweep. and the sleeves are not baggy, despite sizing up. If this was a moto or cafe racer style, I would understand the look to keep it super slim. But I feel this jacket style is more of a work-wear style, and that looks better a little boxy. ***  If I had to be very picky, I wish the sleeves were shorter, but I get it's for bikers to keep their wrists warm when riding. And the liner in the sleeves is polyester, which I thought was a little cheap for a 810 dollar jacket.  ***  Overall I'm happy with it. I  did not pay full price either. It was on sale at Nordstrom but it sold out very quick.

I have all kinds of office appropriate slacks and cardigans and button up shirts in cutesy patterns, casual jeans and sensible shoes.

text:The Best Ways To Style A Blazer This Autumn.	labels:Lol, let's play.  1. "Go for a soft blazer" -- shows a gold button blazer with clearly structured shoulders over... an awful full-zip cardigan, for some reason. 2. Awful photo, the jacket could barely sit worse if they tried. 3. One of the least bad things here, and the dude is literally wearing his blazer with a white tee and sweatpants. 4. "Layer it" -- ah, the standard cliche. 5. "Wear it with this expensive moncler vest, who cares if it looks good? That logo is GIGANTIC!" 6. Two completely different suggestions, one of which is their second unhelpful cliche. Somebody clearly took the photo first and they wrote the tip afterwards. 7. "Play with color." Oh, gee, really? I was only going to wear a white shirt and gray trousers with a navy blazer, ever, but gee, you want me to *consider things*? Cool. Thanks. Super helpful, Mr. P. 8. "More formality" -- shows a wide-open denim shirt, sunglasses, a mess of bracelets under an open wrist...  Yay, I caught 'em all, what do I win?

In South Florida, business casual is golf slacks and a polo, or a wrap dress with sandals (and this isn't the entirety of business casual in South Florida, I'm just pointing out things that would not generally be seen as such elsewhere.)   The best bet is to go online, find this group's Facebook or Instagram accounts and look at what people are wearing at their events. I doubt very much that anyone is going to bat an eyelash at you wearing a skirt, and I'm sure that your work clothing is absolutely appropriate for whatever events you're attending.

text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:I think it depends on the bag you want! If you really truly want a specific Dior bag for example but don’t want to spend $3k on it, you could probably spend about $300 on a nice rep. If you actually just want a specific shape/leather type, you can probably look at Coach and Tory Burch, or even smaller contemporary brands like Mansur Gavriel or Polene.  I’d recommend making a wishlist of bags and write out pros and cons of getting authentic pieces vs replicas, including price and how much you actually want it.  For a while I’ve been spending money on contemporary brands and a few auth designer bags, but recently I’ve been fulfilling my bag wishlist through reps and it feels liberating honestly. You can save money and still get the bag you truly want, and if there’s a bag you really like and you want to support the designer in some way besides wearing their logo/brand, you can always save up for and buy the auth.	episode_done:True

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:The best response I’ve ever heard for this question was comparing runway high fashion to the concept cars you’ll see at auto shows.

text:What are your go-to basic fall tops? I’m talking long sleeve tees, sweatshirts, turtlenecks etc!	labels:Uniqlo heattech under shirts! They allow me to actually wear my lighter flannels and other "spring" items like trench coats without freezing. My style tends towards more "tailored" than "cozy" so these are super helpful, but they go great under sweatshirts as well!  Nowadays with the pandemic, I have ended up wearing lounge wear way more often than I normally would have and it's surprised me how different they can feel with longer-term wear! In the past I just kind of thought that a sweatshirt is a sweatshirt, they're so baggy anyway so what does it matter. But now I have a very clear preference. My favourite sweatshirts are definitely Roots, they retain that "coziness" for much longer than my other ones. My Forever 21 ones turned stiff pretty quickly, which wasn't surprising. My H&M ones also turned stiff and kept getting skinnier and skinnier, and I swear it wasn't me gaining weight lol. My Nike ones also got skinnier, but it didn't turn stiff or lose colour, and the zipper kept its shape well.   My favourite tee shirts are actually my old American Apparel ones, they somehow managed to get more cozy with every wash without going ratty, although the screen-print is fading. Although I'm aware that the management of AA (or Los Angeles Apparel now) have justifiably raised questions around ethics and bigotry, so it's up to the individual whether you're comfortable with their products.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:These are the two questions that interest me most, so:   *What does queer fashion mean to you?*    Queer fashion is whatever a person who identifies as Queer identifies as their way of approaching clothes/self expression.  I'm reminded of a Hannah Gadsby quote, where she talks about someone complaining there wasn't enough "lesbian content" in her comedy, to which her reply was "I was on the stage the whole time."  I feel like defining something as "Queer" can be a little...exclusionary, especially when it's used to exclude others. "Oh, you don't dress "gay". Well, ok.  *Bonus question for LGBTQIA+ folks - do you feel pressure to present a certain way based on wanting to signal to others or what the media has stereotyped a certain group to present like?*    Yes, but usually by other LGBTQIA+ folks. The rise of social media has been great because a lot of people feel more comfortable expressing their identities...but it seems like there's this assumed homogenity which has got even stronger (I'm not even that old, but predate social media by a good few years).  I am all for expressing identity! I love that LGBTQIA+ people feel they can do that!    But " are you ever gay if..." shit makes me tired.  Media has stereotyped us enough. Let's not do it to myself. Caveat: I could just be salty that I look bad in cuffed jeans :P	episode_done:True
text:Do you think that designer brands will no longer be as sought after in the future?	labels:I don't get the logic.  Why would people be buying secondhand designer clothing if they didn't want designer clothing?  The pop in secondhand designer does not just *happen* to coincide with multiple major economic recessions and historically low relative wages for working class people.  At the same time we're in the shadow of a fast fashion industry that deliberately produces 'affordable' clothing of an extremely poor quality.  So, for a lot of us, the only way we can obtain good quality clothing is to buy it second-hand.  As for online platforms, I believe those only contribute to the popularity of designer clothing.  Since people can no longer handle clothing in person before we purchase it, we are even more reliant on brand reputation for a clue as to what the garment's quality might be.	episode_done:True
text:Yeah. I kinda feel like "bespoke" feels far more pretentious than it is. Frankly, I wear denim almost every damn day so I'd love to get a pair of denim in a fabric I like that I know will fit me really well.   I'd be much more likely to drop the money on "bespoke" denim than a suit, coat, shirt, or shoes frankly.  Simon gets bespoke everything it seems like but I can see the appeal occasionally outside of just being a nerd.  edit: Not to mention that there are specialty denim tailoring services to hem with a chain-stitch, taper with flat-felled seams, take in the waist, etc. etc. If I'm gonna spend ~$400 on some specialty denim I can see putting that money into getting fittings being entirely worthwhile rather than some special Japanese fabric and shuttle loom.

text:This was my thought OP. I thought that I had straight hair all of my life up until after high school but it turns out that I actually have pretty wavy hair.

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:For Ebay, filter by "auction" vs "buy it now"    If I search for womens cashmere sweater size medium filtering by auction will take search results from 130,000 to 1,900.

text:What are your tips for being stylish when your weight fluctuates like crazy?	labels:Wrap dresses and wrap skirts tend to be flexible with size fluctuations. I don’t know if the same wrap skirt can take you from a size 4 to 14 but they’ll fit longer than other styles do.
text:I also wonder if men tend to buy clothing staples, and clothes for women tend to be on trend. So, we get cheaply made fast fashion that has extra development costs.	labels:100% because it's pretty easy to sell women stuff if you make them feel bad about themselves.

text:"Can people just hate fashion again" - Synecdoche When Talking about the "Industry" Discussion	labels:> Should spaces & industries for fashion lovers, clothes lovers, and people that have to wear clothes be completely separate?  I don’t think that any of these groups should be completely separate however I do find them all being lumped into the same spaces very frustrating as someone who does love fashion as a form of art and creativity.  I like harsh and blunt constructive criticism in pretty much all areas of life and I most certainly want it for my outfits as well. I want to hear what other fashion lovers and artists think of my colour choices, proportions, textures, fit, etc. and be able to refine those things and really flex my creative muscles when creating an outfit. Instead, many fashion spaces are dominated by ‘you do you hun!’ and ‘so long as you like it, that’s all that matters!’ which is great for someone *who has to wear clothes* and doesn’t actually care about fashion but joins fashion spaces because they feel some obligation as a woman to care about it but... those spaces just become unhelpful and bland for those who really love fashion and want to get better at it.  I’ve been an off and on follower of FFA for a few years and I feel like it’s definitely dominated by the “people who wear clothes” group and unfortunately it limits the amount of critique that is acceptable to give.
text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:Here are a few things that helped me get over a skincare addiction:  - Unsubscribe from emailed coupons and deals. Just bc it's on sale doesn't mean you need it.    - Unsubscribe from subreddits (yes, here included if you often get the urge to buy after seeing inspo) and YouTube videos of "hauls" or whatever else makes you want to purchase. Pinterest, maybe?   - Make a list of things you need/want and ONLY buy those things  - Put items in your cart and wait 2 days or more.   - If you don't already, get a budget app (every dollar is free) and use it.	episode_done:True

text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:I store away all my seasonal stuff in sealed totes twice a year (more often if your seasonal clothes are very distinct, but SS and FW works for me).  I have a decorative ladder for the clothes that aren’t ready to be washed but are worn. My husband sucks at this and used to drape his clothes all over the fucking place so I got him the ladder originally but now we both use it and it’s good for keeping clothes off the floor or our couches  But honestly mostly I have an IKEA Pax system that keeps things super organized for me and which I love dearly. It’s a bit pricey but if you have a lot of clothes and are serious about organizing them, I highly recommend
text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:I need to stop shopping - full-stop. I did way too much "fill the hole in your soul with stuff" this year, for obvious reasons, but I feel overburdened with the amount of clothing in my life now and I need to make a conscious effort to pare things down. If I run into a genuine need, I'll continue checking secondhand options first before buying new. I'll also continue logging outfits daily with Stylebook, because it helps me be honest with myself about what is and isn't getting worn in my closet (both for getting-rid-of purposes AND for informing-future-purchases purposes), *and* it'll help me focus in on what I gravitate toward in my day-to-day life rather than continually shopping for some nebulously just-out-of-reach fantasy self.   Summed up:  * Buy less, buy secondhand, buy practical, buy for TODAY (not a dream and a half from now), and buy only what is genuinely needed (very likely *nothing* for quite a while).  * Continue evaluating what I really need in my life, and how much, and adjust accordingly as time goes on with the goal of seriously paring down my closet to a manageable size.

text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:It depends on the crowd, but at the last 3 funerals I went to, I wore a simple black sheath dress, black hose, and black flats, with one piece of jewelry.   I did see people mostly in what I would call "Sunday Best" and this ranged from skirts + heels to nice pants and a simple knit top. However these were all funerals for people who lived in a super small town their whole lives and were farmers most of their lives, so YMMV!	episode_done:True
text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I bought/sold on Poshmark when it was starting to get popular, and found great deals and sold pretty easily on it. I stopped a year later - by that time, I had started seeing wholesale distributers flooding the site and making it alot harder for me to find actual used clothing for decent prices. I'd agree that there are likely too many sellers now compared to buyers - or at least too much merchandise compared to buyers. To me, that makes Poshmark too much like Ebay, and is no longer as distinct a platform as it used to be.  Edit: typos

text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:I generally find its easier to base your outfits around one piece, often an accent piece or statement piece. I got the idea from storytelling/art composition seminars, its infinitely more easy to come up with a composition once you know what your main character is interacting with scene/item wise. The same applies to outfits, once you have your main piece for that outfit you can decide how casual/dressed up you want to be, whether you need to add more textures, and what colors will match with said pieces color.  Generally I stick to the rules of trying to match the metals/detailing of outfits, trying to either go with neutrals for primary pieces with skintone matches to accents, or going with monochrome outfits(which generally look very stylish automatically). Fit wise, I generally make sure that I alternate between loose up top/form fitting below the waist, or vice versa. Silhouette is the most important thing, I try to go for clean lines.  Pattern wise I limit them to one pattern max, the same goes for textured pieces.	episode_done:True

text:What is your favorite clothing purchase of the year, and why?	labels:My 2019-2020 Tweed Jacket. I bought it in the spring of 2020, it was cheap as Uniqlo was phasing out its 2019-2020 autumn/winter collection. I spent only 2000 yen on it  I use it almost every day for work in fall.   I'm glad I got one from the 2019-2020 and not the new 2020-21 line.  This year's one doesn't stretch as well and feels uncomfortable.  &#x200B;  I only wish I could have bought another color from the 2019-20 so I'd have more variation  I guess when I get something that fits well, feels comfortable, and cheap to buy.. I get really happy about the purchase.	episode_done:True

text:I'm a J. Crew loyalist, so I'm acknowledging my potential bias but I'm also a fan of Banana Republic and went through a hardcore BR phase. However, I've kind of forsaken Banana (my young professional wardrobe was full of it) and returned to even more J. Crew -- I've found that, in general, my pieces from J. Crew last longer and hold their shape/quality more than what I have bought from Banana. Also those 50% sales are usually goldmines for me! Just my experience!	labels:I loooove BR - they’re in my price range and their clothes just fit me well - but quality is absolutely hit or miss. I have stuff I’ve had for years, and I also have a dress that I wore twice and then a ribbon on the back just fell off haha. But for my budget, if I’m picky, I do very well there. (Love J Crew for linen pants and shorts, though!)
text:Excercises for personal style	labels:Friends helped me narrow my style over the years. The most important is knowing what Looks Good on you. I love many pieces that don't fit my body. Someone had to help me by pointing out things that look bad & good. I also dressed way too conservatively for my shape and situations. They had to help show me - it's ok:)   Now I'm confident in my choices and help others. A clue that you're on the right track is when people compliment what you are wearing- not just what it is but how the color/style suits  you. Or the way you put it together. Complimenting other people is not only a nice, decent thing to do, it's also a good way to get them talking about clothes/styles/etc.	episode_done:True

The 32x34s I have bunch up really badly if I tighten my belt properly (I can fit my fist in the wasteband without it being too tight).

text:This has always been something I hated! I also think that Black Friday sales are overblown and actually not that good (for clothes). I typically wait until January to shop for sales because that's when retailers are trying to dump inventory to make their year end numbers look better.

I can reliably count on shops like Madewell, Levi's, Abercrombie & Fitch, etc. to have sales at the end of the season. The only problem is whether or not they'll have my size when the sale happens or if they're sold out of everything except XS and XL...	episode_done:True
text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Lots of good advice here already. One thing maybe worth adding: be aware that a lot of women's retailers use soft-feeling but lower quality fabric. At places like Zara and H&M, the men's clothes will be made of nice cotton or wool blends, and then nearly identical garments in the women's section will be flimsy rayon blends (knitwear, especially). It's easy to get duped by something that feels nice in the shop, until you get home and realise it's made of nasty sweaty acrylic. The stitching and construction can also be shoddier, so you'll end up with garments that look warped and awkward after one wash. (My husband is often shocked by the difference in quality when we shop together.) Maybe you've already noticed this, but I wish someone had told me these things when I started shopping for myself :)  Another thing to know is a lot of women's clothes are labeled "dry clean only" or "hand wash only." You'll want to carefully read the labels so you don't ruin anything! The tumble dryer is not your friend, except for socks/undies/workout clothes. That said, most "dry clean only" items that aren't heavily embellished can be gently hand washed and air dried, but if you don't want the hassle, check the label before you buy.	episode_done:True

text:For those who define their style as "classic-traditional" (tailored, fitted, matching, sleek), what are your typical outfits for work, on the weekends, date-night, running errands or lounging around?	labels:I have to dress biz casual lite (aka, not jeans) for work, so my work/weekend outfits are the same - I like button-downs with midi skirts and ballet flats or feminine mule slides, high-waisted trousers with thin fitted tops, linen shorts and button-downs, and dresses (sometimes with a sweater over the top or a cardigan).   I feel like I’ve slowly narrowed in on my favored style via trial and error and I usually focus on the silhouette - I like things that nip in at the waist and I either have a looser top or bottom, but never both. I stick to a neutral palette (lots of camel, light blue, black, and green) and avoid anything too trendy.   For lounging around, I wear sweatpants haha - but I have cute high-waisted ones in a pretty tan color that are slightly “elevated.”	episode_done:True

text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:Honestly, if you’re willing to spend the money on “luxury faux leather” just get the real thing. It’s more durable, able to be restored, and you can actually take care of it in a way that will make it last longer. No matter where you get faux leather from, it’s just plastic at the end of the day. Luxury faux leather is just plastic with a designer label on it.	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Zara | January 30, 2021	labels:twice, I've coincidentally lived right next to a Zara (like a 2-3 minute walk). As a result I often popped into the store and bought a few things.  My experiences were hit and miss, mostly misses  Hits:    Faux suede stuff.  They look and feel nice. I've often get compliments on it. I don't like dealing with actual suede, so the faux stuff is nice.     Sizing. so far sizing for tops has mostly been consistent so its easy to order online and know what to expect  Returns. super easy either online or in person.  Sales. Here they go on sale immediately July 1 and Jan 1.  You can get good deals on many things such as a faux suede jacket for roughly 20 USD, a long coat for roughly 30, etc  Style.  I think thats the reason many go here.  The styling looks really unique and interesting. although yes, there are really strange stuff there too  Blazers/sport coats.  Fits well and looks nice.  Miss:  Stitching. Like some one said earlier, its really bad. things are always loose, buttons fall off, even buckles break. more than half of the Zara items I've bought had some major stitching issues within the first half year.   Jackets. although they are cool, I've had all kinds of problems. A bomber jacket where all texture threads became loose and made a hole.  A linen moto jacket where the buckle just broke off and fixing it costed more than the jacket. My Faux suede sherling denim style jacket looks great and new but all the button stitching around the button holes have all frayed.. and i hardly use the buttons since there are zippers!   Knits. unravels, pills quickly etc  all Bottoms. discolors easily. pills easily. tons of loose threading  when I was a college student it was nice. the sale items are cheap and you can look cool  but after graduating, having more disposable income, etc.. I've mostly moved on.	episode_done:True

text:Thank you for this!  As an update, I spoke to SS HQ this morning. They canceled and refunded me. The representative told me that MTM is no longer in existence. I told them it still says it is available in select markets on their website and they stated that what they offer now is call, "Advanced Alterations" internally and is branded, "Custom Made".  I clarified that with them because it was a shock to me.  My prior suit was purchased under their true MTM program which no longer exists.  The new advances alterations platform does include armhole height, sleeve circumference, waist, chest, shoulder so it doesn't seem like much is being lost. My feedback to them was that the rep should still measure you and should customize every measurement because what are the chances that I happen to be exactly the same waist, chest and shoulder as your 42" pattern. She thanked me for the feedback and said the experience should still include full measurement, but something has been lost in translation as they roll out the new platform.   For a suit I can go $1200, but I'd like to get a blazer done under the SS price of $650.  The most I've ever paid for a suit is $1500 and that was Alan David NY.  I loved their work, but they get expensive fast when you start looking at nicer fabrics. I'm still considering going to another SS and getting properly fitted via this program because I like the totally unstructured shoulder for this more casual blazer.   Does Kent Wang travel or do I have to come to them?	labels:Traveling tailors are hard to find on even a $1500 budget... This would be easier if you could tell me what the nearest city was.

text:I'm with you. It's a different kind of hot you get when you're covered up in hot weather vs when your skin is exposed to sunlight in hot weather.

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.

text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I lost a lot of weight recently (AUS size 18/16 to 8), so this is probably the third time I have rebuilt a wardrobe. I am also a teacher and approaching my 30s so I wanted to appear more put together than what I did in my 20s.  It was difficult as I was anxious when clothes shopping because I had no idea what size I was at the time. My first step was to at least buy some basic but nice quality pants, I started with two pairs of jeans that I could wear to work or casually to figure out my size. She also showed me some blouses they had on sale at the time. I left with two tops and two pairs of jeans.      After knowing my size I went to a store like H&M and purchased a few more basic pieces such as blouses and pants that were suitable for work when I needed to be more professional and opposed to casual. During winter I purchased a couple of pieces that were on sale at MYER that were suitable for our weather, I also got two pencil skirts for variety.  I also took time to walk around my local shopping centre to see what was available close by to my home so I could identify what stores I should keep an eye on or watch for sales. When some of the stores I like are having a sale I will pop in and purchase a couple of things.  I also had to purchase new shoes as I lost half a shoe size (AUS 8 - 7.5)  Overall, start with some basics and keep an eye on the stores you like for sales. Every now and then if you really like something buy it. Even though I purchased all these nice clothes if I were a sim my default outfit would be tights and a denim shirt at the moment.	episode_done:True

text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I finished up grad school last year and started working full time, so I totally went through that transition. For me, I don’t have a set clothing budget, but I do have a monthly “wants” budget that clothing purchases go into. I try to be strategic and identify gaps in my wardrobe and work from there, buying things as I have the money/need for them. It has been a big change going from mostly buying secondhand to having more to spend, but I still love to thrift/posh etc. My budget now is significantly more than it was in grad school though, so I have more flexibility.   One of the more difficult parts for me was feeling like I needed nicer, high quality items for work. Those get expensive! For example I recently bought a wool dress coat since I only had a parka. I am lucky in that my work is quite casual, so most of my wardrobe works for both work and casual stuff.	episode_done:True

text:Become a Tailored Suit Pro - Guide	labels:Went to a tailor for the first time today. £25 to get some chinos shortened and tapered.      I walked in and said “I have some trousers that are too wide. I would like them to not be that way”.        He had me change, said “are we shortening or tapering” - which I took as a very polite way of saying “they’re far too long bro”, so I responded “both!”.      We chatted for a couple minutes while he folded, pinned and measured.       He was polite, respectful, and only scratched my ankle once with a needle - I figure that you accept a certain amount of risk when people put pins in a garment you’re wearing.          7/10, most anxiety inducing part was walking through the door. Will be getting my stuff back on Tuesday. If it goes well I will be throwing a lot of business at them, as I have a lot of clothes which would see more action if they were better fitted.

text:Girl if I go to the trouble to put on a hat and secure it to my head, you better believe I'm keeping that shit on inside.

I wouldnt actually say anything to someone who wore a hat in my house bc thats super awkward and rude lol. Of course this may vary with location and absolutely never applies to religious head coverings.

In spite of that, I still find them way more uncomfortable than skirts. I dislike how they enclose my thighs and how they cut off my range of movements.

text:How to find non-custom tailored clothing for short men (under 5')	labels:>The shortest I can find on sites for short men is 5'2", which isn't super useful for someone at my height.

I'd imagine they would work, and at worst you would have to have a tailor hem things a touch shorter than the off-the-rack size.

I agree, I think this sub is made up of people who enjoy looking at clothes or just want to know how to dress appropriately for work & school. There's a few subjects *related* to the industry as a whole that people are passionate about, like sustainability & ethics, but I don't think this sub is able to appreciate fashion as a form of art.   I agree that a *you do you* isn't very helpful. If someone specifically asks for constructive criticism, they want feedback from people with an eye for detail. If it looks like their blazer or pants need to be tailored a bit, then let them know if they're seeking constructive criticism.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:I wouldn't say I inherently hate the brand but I think Champion is an example of a brand that exploded a few years back/to now basically all because some celebrities or whoever wore it- and everyone who wears it now is most likely a ding dong hypebeast type or the VSCO type girl or whatever. Like I'm old enough to remember it being bottom tier Wal Mart level shit you'd get borderline made fun of for wearing- but now all of the sudden it's enjoying this moment. So it's just that perceived inauthenticity and collective pivot in peoples' minds to a fashion name to people rather than just athletic apparel that irks me somehow.  However though, the Todd Snyder Champion stuff is PHENOMENAL- it's not the mainline stuff. You don't see any of those assholes rocking that.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 06, 2021	labels:Slippers for wide, sweaty feet?  I've been rocking a set of Glerups scuffs around the house for two years, and especially heavily since March. My wife has been non-stop complaining about tiny bits of felt that wear away from the inside, ending up all over the house... and now I've worn a small hole through near my pinky toe on my wider foot, so it's time to give them up. I'm tempted to just get another pair and deal with my wife's complaints about errant felt bits, but despite their excellent moisture management, I'm still a bit sweaty in them after a while. So, I'm on the hunt for a new pair.  I live in Florida so it's rarely ever cold indoors, the tile flooring notwithstanding. And I have very wide feet (9EEE/EEEE.) I like scuffs because I can just step into them without using my hands, but I'm open to alternatives. I've always wanted to be able to rock leather mocs, but going by even my comfiest leather shoes, I'll get far too sweaty, far too quickly, unless I'm wearing good socks... which defeats the purpose.  Any suggestions? I was thinking a set of boiled wool instead of wool felt might work better. I do have some boiled wool Haflinger slippers and I like them overall, though their construction leaves much to be desired for the price - the badly-designed seams are barely holding together, the glue is starting to separate, and the PVA footbed is prone to both sweating and stinking.	episode_done:True

Beauty that gives you energy.”   That speaks pretty directly to how I’m trying to navigate fashion right now. I’m not exactly going out anywhere, but I try to wear clothes that make me really happy to be awake and doing things.

But something about being criticized for looking good really messes me up.   I've had a lot of really negative experiences with it. I don't see any of those people anymore but I've heard women talk about other women so much I know I'm being talked about too. And I'm basically friendless now so I've been actively trying to get new friends. I feel like I can't look too good or I'll just be judged as a snobby attention seeking homewrecker and no one will want to be friends with me. And I body build so I've got a less common shape that gets talked about too. I love my body and I'm so proud of it but I don't feel comfortable around people. Everyone just looks at me.

text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I’ve gone to online shopping only post Covid. It was definitively challenging at first to guess my size and learn to interpret my measurements (def measure yourself, there’s guides online) and the stores’, but it gets better with time!   It is easiest to stick to brands you already have clothes from, or alternatively use online stores that calculate your size for you based on other clothes you have (Saks, Bloomingdales and other large department stores offer this feature). The next part is to shop only on sites that allow returns (original payment, not store credit), preferably for free. Many big retailers do this already - with the final sale caveat. My favorites that I shop at most are Shopbop.com, Reformation, Saks, Aritzia (careful, they only refund to original payment non sale items), Bloomingdales, Lululemon, Farfetch, Banana Republic, J Crew, Abercrombie and Fitch. In general though, I won’t buy anything without checking out the site’s return policy first, and I usually don’t shop at places that don’t accept returns.  I acknowledge that some of these may have allegedly unethical practices, but I can’t afford (time, effort, health, money, etc.) finding alternatives at this time. I kindly ask that we don’t focus on that aspect sub the op didn’t specify they wanted ethic retailers only.	episode_done:True

I wanted to make some new content for the new year, and also explain a little bit where I've been for the past couple of months.   It's been nice speaking with more of you in the Daily Questions Threads, and I hope to interact with more of y'all as time goes on.   Anyway, I hope you enjoy this video and see why I'm falling more and more in love with the New Balance 99x series.
text:Let's Talk about hats	labels:The rules about hats are antiquated and archaic, and you’re not likely to get called out for wearing a hat inside. Of course, there is a time and place but like, literally no one is going to care if you wear a hat to the mall, to go grocery shopping, to hike, etc.	episode_done:True
text:When will I be "too old" to look cute, cool, hip, whatever?	labels:>wanna be the kind of cute, college-age guy people pine over on Instagram, slightly feminine but still solidly masculine.  The question is why do you want this? It seems like you want to do it just for attiention sake and if that's the case you're setting yourself up for a life of unhappiness.  As you grow your style will change, be confident in YOUR style and people will respect you.  Im 25 my style has always been classically masculine, dapper, smart, and a bit artistic. I never dressed like my peers. People close to me started mimicking my style and women always loved the way I dressed.  And I think its because I wrote my clothes confidently.   With that said you can do whatever you want to do. If you want to be 50 with skinny jeans and a graphic-t that's fine.  Be confident and Make sure that's what you want.
text:"Can people just hate fashion again" - Synecdoche When Talking about the "Industry" Discussion	labels:I am not too proud to admit I don’t understand any of this long rambling post or the incoherent interview so I guess I have no opinion =|
text:I agree with this mindset wholeheartedly. Fashion is an incredibly expensive hobby for me, personally, and I let it be because I can afford it now, but you can absolutely build a wardrobe off of thrifting and purchasing secondhand clothes. And in fact, once your mindset shifts to this, or even to concepts like capsule wardrobes, you'll force your mind into building more styling options with what you have, even if it's not the vast wardrobe that you might see from influencers or bloggers.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:I honestly wouldn’t worry about it that much. I remember trying the whole “hipster glasses/ugly christmas sweater” aesthetic when I was in middle school and being paranoid that I would look like a grandma— but when I look back at those photos I just look like a typical baby-faced teen.   If you’re that worried about it, I would maybe throw some trendier pieces like doc martens or dark academia-esque plaid tennis skirts in the mix, since those tend to read young and seem very “in” right now.	episode_done:True

text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:I once got the tip to put everything in your closet with the open part of your hanger hook facing out. Then, when you wear something, turn that hanger the right side out (i.e. round side of the hook facing out). Set a time period that you want to revisit cleaning your closet (i.e. a season/year etc) and after that time period donate or throw out everything that still has the hook turned in. Similarly, pack all the things you aren't sure if you want to keep into a box and set a time frame. If you find yourself wanting to wear something in that box, take it out. At the end of the time-frame, donate what's still there (especially if you forgot that item existed).  Recently due to COVID, I moved across back the country so I had to fit my closet into suitcases. That involved donating a lot of things that are perfectly nice and wearable but what I had to admit to myself that 1)I actually never wore in the 3 years I lived there and 2) didn't miss in the few months that I was living without them (I was living out of a carry on when I got unexpectedly stuck back home).  In terms of the never throw anything out, perhaps donate it to  a charity that's helps dress the less fortunate for work? They're definitely pieces that others will love.

text:FAQ: What are the different use cases of boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes, and loafers?	labels:Bear in mind I'm a traditionalist but boat shoes should only be worn near water. Moccasins are predominately house slippers (unless they have a more constructed sole in which case they're sort of loafers anyway). Driving shoes are the most casual genre of loafer (excluding sneaker/loafer hybrid stuff). Loafers is a super general term for the whole range of slip on leather/suede shoes.	episode_done:True

text:People who work in the fashion industry - what do you wear?	labels:I’ve work as a senior designer for apparel/accessories/shoes for several large corporations. More than 50% of my wardrobe is from the thrift store. I have clothes from companies like Osei Duro, Farm Rio, Hemant and Nandita, Etsy sellers, etc.... as for larger brands, I tend to buy from Madewell/Free People/Anthro. I avoid clothes and accessories with prominent or all over logos on them.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone here has the habit of needing to buy a new clothing/set of clothings when attending an occasion/going somewhere?	labels:Yes! I am so guilty of this.  But then I started to invest in quality blank canvas outfits and use accessories to change them up. So I have a great black cocktail dress that I wear all the time. But I might wear long strings of pearls and gold heels to one event and then the next event swap in red heels and a big gold statement necklace with a red lip. I have cocktail dresses in dark gray, navy, wine and gold and just layer in accessories, shoes and bags to change the look. And if I REALLY want something new, I buy some inexpensive accessory instead of an entire new outfit.  My exceptions are my birthday and our annual family Christmas party. Those are the two times I treat myself. But for all those other weddings, cocktail parties and work events, I stick to my tried and true.	episode_done:True

text:Do you have a childhood fashion icon? If so, does their influence show up in your wardrobe today?	labels:When I was a child, I looked mostly towards like tween and teen fashion rather than adult fashion. I loved Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Mary Kate and Ashley Olson. They were all like the epitome of the sweet-normal-but-stylish-girl-next door characters. Outfits always cute, but accessible/not over the top
text:How do you separate your laundry? I’ve been separating it by “type” but everyone I know does it by color. Now I’m starting to wonder if I’m doing something wrong, but washing black underwear with black jeans just bc theyre the same color sounds so odd to me	labels:I personally wash everything together if I know that the colors won’t bleed. So if you have not washed something in a darker color before, absolutely wash it by itself before tossing it in with whites! If the underwear is delicate, a delicates or lingerie bag is a good (reasonably inexpensive) investment, though I’d still be wary of tossing them in with anything denim or generally rough (t-shirts or blouses are fine). When I was living with the rest of my family, we separated out by “hot water” (socks, underwear, etc) and “cold water” (everything else) more than color.	episode_done:True

text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:This goes for any size, but I think the oversized/shapeless trend is done well with styling.  Perfectly tailored items, luxe fabrics, and generally styling yourself to look polished (hair, makeup, jewelry, whatever your thing is) really helps avoid looking or feeling sloppy.  I really enjoy loose tops, and find if they have a nice drape it helps. I'm short, so I try to offset the volume up top by wearing something slim on the bottom.	episode_done:True

text:I had this coworker. She was Ukrainian and looked amazing every day. Told me I was so pretty but why were my nails bare? Hair not done? Clothes all black? You are a WOMAN, she said.   She always seemed so impressed by each individual change that I kept going. Weekly manicures, nonblack clothing (I discovered that I look great in red!), tasteful makeup. People around the office were gossiping that I was trying to find a man. "No, a man is looking for HER!", she told them.   Then suddenly she disappeared. Quit over the phone and changed her number. I like to think she was an angel in a very impressionable time for me, but I think she might have just had issues with her work visa.	labels:There is a Ukrainian woman who works at my hospital. Her hair is DONE, her nails are DONE, her makeup is DONE. Sadly, she has to wear scrubs at work, but I swear to you, that woman wears 3 inch heels with her scrubs.

text:FAQ: How do I know my clothes weren't made with slave labour?	labels:Same as always, buy used, you can’t trust corporations to tell you the truth about their labour practices, in part because they have a very vested interest in not telling you the truth and in part because actually tracking he supply chains for clothing is incredibly difficult to do accurately, and, yes this applies to the cool mid range denim brand that replies to all your posts on ig. Even Patagonia got busted for using Slave Labor, if you look past the long winded apology letters they put out since they got caught, the reality is that it’s basically intrinsically locked into the supply chain of modern clothing production unless you're paying thousands upon thousands of dollars to have a local tailor make all of your clothes using locally sourced materials.  Buying used is the single most ethical option you have, and, frankly, is the better option anyway	episode_done:True

I recommend everyone learn how to properly launder their clothing.

text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:My first (meaningful) boyfriend gave me a diamond necklace when i was 18. It was lovely, I wore it constantly, and received many compliments. And then we broke up, as one does with their teen boyfriend, and blah blah blah, after a while I was like, "wtf do I do with this?"  I was *never* going to wear it again and selling it felt a little mercenary.   I ended up giving it as a gift to a girl I babysat/nannied for when she turned 18. It was nice because it was a way for me to give it to someone I cared about and I was able to give her a much nicer gift than I normally would have. And now when I think about that particular piece of jewelry, I don't think about my imploded relationship with my ex, but my relationship that I had with this girl as she grew up.

text:Thoughts then and now?	labels:While I can appreciate the aesthetic and social decorum norms of vintage dressing, it strikes me as a kind of sartorial MAGA.  It is a nostalgic viewpoint that largely ignores the social and political structures tied to it. There are a lot of reasons people don't dress up on a daily basis anymore, including:  * women aren't relegated to being homemakers anymore * a woman's value is no longer solely attributed to her appearance * people's lives are a lot more complicated and multifaceted than they were before * people move around a lot more than they did before * people face greater economic pressures that before * lifestyles and social values, in general, have changed  While there will always be social/cultural expectations that dictate what is appropriate to wear in a given situation, it is generally a good thing that we now have more freedom of choice in what to wear on a daily basis.

text:How has lockdown affected new purchases?	labels:I've sold a few clothes I never really wore. Bought one jumper/sweater, a few thermal layers and soft wool casual trousers for working at home. I can wear sweatpants but it doesn't really get me in the working mood, you know?   My best purchase was probably 2 crossbody bags. A cheap one off Uniqlo and a Peak Design bag off eBay for mega cheaps. Easy to throw on, put a mask in, small water bottle, or whatever when I decide to go for a quick walk-break. And the peak design is slightly padded and larger which helps for cameras or small food shops lol.  I *do* have some stuff I want to buy, but honestly it's more lust than utilitarianism. I have enough shoes and jackets as it is. If I bought something new I'd feel obliged to sell something of mine.

text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Some websites (department stores, ASOS) have a true fit tool where you put in your measurements, body type, and well fitting item of clothing and that information is used to recommend sizing.   It’s also a good idea to know your measurements in general if you’re buying secondhand as many sellers will list the measurements of the garment.  But overall sizing can be so wild within one brand, much less across multiple that I dint think there’s much of a rule of thumb.

text:Ordered from Shoe The Bear (rant, experience in post)	labels: On Cyber Monday 2018, I bought a pair of Suede Chelsea boots from Shoe The Bear and they're one of my favorite pairs of kicks. Fit was awesome, quality was amazing for what I paid (~$70). I've worn these boots 100+ time and still holding up great.  Fast forward to this past Cyber Monday. I wanted a pair of cognac/brown colored Chelseas from Shoe The Bear. They arrived within a few days fron Portugal. I was so excited to open the box....and they are completely the wrong color.  They're so far from the correct color, customer service is claiming that I treated the leather myself and they don't carry boots in this color.  To say this experience is bizarre is an understatement - No, I did not treat the leather. I took the picture within minutes of opening the package because I couldn't believe what I received. I'm going to try and return them but now they're claiming I treated the leather so who knows what will happen.
text:Living in a place that has a cold winter and a hot summer makes a capsule wardrobe pretty much impossible.

text:I think the fit is pretty good. The sleeves are long like you said, but you can roll up the cuff one, and the thick leather keeps the cuff pretty much in place so it's not flapping about. I also took a gamble on the size and got a medium. I measure about 37-38in in chest, 33-34 sleeve, 5'11 and about 160lbs. Definitely not the V shape athletic build, but this still fit pretty well at a medium. Overall, definitely happy with the fit as it is not too tight but also not super big on me.	labels:I have a 40 inch chest with broad shoulders, 6'0 and 180 lbs.

I feel good wearing them when I (sadly rarely) go  my partner to get groceries and the like. Now the final step I think is wearing it out one day when I meet up with friends and folks I know again.   For whatever reason I just dread the comments of "oh wow that's new" or "dang all dressed up" but in reality it's not a big deal. People won't have seen me irl in basically a year so what better time to say I changed things up	labels:About the comments from others, this was one that I struggled with for a long time. I think it’s important to think about any and all other reasons that may have led to them making those comments. Honestly, I think it’s more likely that most people say that kind of stuff because they’re searching for a way to start a conversation and that’s all they could quickly come up with it. Not necessarily that they wanted to point out or judge your choice in clothing. It’s also relieving over time to push away the feeling that you’re obligated to explain yourself. If that’s not the conversation you want to have, simply say yep or thanks and move the conversation along :)	episode_done:True

He doesn't like the feel of most typical jeans and slacks and has trouble finding the right fit for his height. Any other guys with a similar issue? Maybe a suggestion for where to shop? Thanks in advance for your help!
text:The best plain t-shirt video guide — 11 t-shirts bought and tested	labels:Just wanted to add an update on the lady white clark tee. Apparently they restocked on the website today. Medium was out for months, I'd actually never seen it in stock even on other retailers (still don't) - so I think it goes without saying I grabbed one.   I'll likely post a review on the LW and RC tees. Hoping they're not just hype.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:As someone who used to exclusively wear black (not exaggerating, it was a manifestation an anxiety/ocd problem- lots of therapy, baby steps, and now I consider leopard and hot pink neutrals), I found it easiest to start with accessories (especially shoes!) and patterns that were mostly black. Dark florals go with just about everything. Once I got used to that, I branched out into floral pants and funky sweaters. There was definitely trial and error, and I spent a ton of money on items that ultimately went to consignment it goodwill. However, now I have a really good idea of what I like, and while I still love a good neutral moment, my wardrobe is probably 1/2 colorful pieces, 1/4 non-black neutrals, and 1/4 black pieces.	episode_done:True

text:A Bespoke Shirtmaker On How A Shirt Should Fit	labels:Sleeves are my eternal issue with shirts, and why for so long I opted for short sleeve shirts. So often with RTW shirts the cuffs are so big they start sliding down my hand (looking at you, Charles Tyrwhitt). If they have a second button quite often it makes a dip in a bit rather than the complete circle and often still goes down my hand enough that the cuff bends when I move my hands. So many RTW shirts also have their sleeves a bit too short for me (kind of acceptable considering overly large cuffs). Some end up being too tight in the upper sleeve, painfully cutting into my arms if I reach forward (looking at you again, Charles Tyrwhitt) no matter the size. I don't remember shirts doing this in the past so perhaps an issue since I gained weight.	episode_done:True

text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:This seems like the makings of a really bad decision to me. Way too much going on. Unless you want to look like a cosplayer all the time I would recommend wearing only one or two statement pieces at any given time.   Perhaps the reason you can’t find any store that sells the times your looking for is a good indication that the style as a whole does not exist to the extent that you might hope.	episode_done:True

text:Those of you who, like me, don't have a closet (sob).. how do you organize your clothing/shoes/accessories/jewelry?	labels:I’m in a railroad apt built in the early 1900s; lots of walls and no closets.   The Ikea closet systems are kind of amazing.  I have the tension rod system (floor to ceiling) with a large deep dresser, clothing rod, and cubbies at the top. I had an old over the door hook rail that I put on the clothes bar so I can hang worn-but-still-clean-clothes on hooks. Clean ones are on hangers. My sister got the PAX system for her place and is really happy with it.    I also have a normal dresser that I put anything foldable in to, including intimates. It’s also my “night stand”.   Shoes - i keep a few high use ones by the door. I have a shoe rack elsewhere. My entryway is nonexistant, otherwise I’d prefer to have the shoe rack near the door too. Got a slim one from Yamazaki. Occasion shoes and seasonal (snow boots for example) stay boxed and under or ontop of my Ikea closet until they’re needed. Then they go in the daily area.   Out of season clothes are in bins under my bed.   Jewelry and accessories - long stuff like necklaces, high use scarves, and long earrings are just hanging on a 5 tier pants hanger. The kind where you can release each bar? I had it laying around and it was cheap.  Smaller earrings and rings are in a jewelry box.   I have a peg rack for coats.   Overall you also have to have less stuff when you don’t have big closet space.	episode_done:True

text:What designer bags and eras do you think will come back in fashion 2021-2022?	labels:In terms of fashion, I think colors and maximalism will come back, after an entire decade of minimalism.   I was watching Twin Peaks, and what amazed me about the 80s 90s fashion in that show is the vibrancy of colors and patterns. We are already immersed in 80s and 90s revival now, esp in terms of oversized and dramatic fits, and I think gradually crazier colors and patterns will become more mainstream.   Bags - I suppose the more dramatic the better, and we are already seeing crazy shapes and colors now. Celine might start with crazier designs as well, with Slimane at its helm.

Sometimes people are appreciating the design or color or novelty of an item and not the big picture of how it works for you.

Also consider the Everlane one, there was a comparison here between RC and Everlane and there was a great similarity between the both. Further, I have their olive and black color ways and feel that they are lighter than Champion or Supreme hoodies, with a more slim fit. Dunno if you want to get two decent hoodies over one premium one. Best of luck.

text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:Start with colors that go with your existing colors. Navy goes really well with mustard yellow. Mustard yellow goes with black and white effortlessly.   Once you have that down, then choose colors that go with the colors you added. So, if you added mustard, than, brown goes with mustard. Viridian goes with mustard. Pink goes with mustard. So on and so forth. Some colors will look good on you, and some won’t, so, the best way to incorporate colors is to just try colors on.
text:The joy of cordovan—and how to wear and maintain it	labels:Cordovan is an Instagram dream - it’s lustrous and has a ton of color depth. Unfortunately I find  actually wearing it is a different story. It’s extremely stiff and inflexible, especially during the first 20-30 wears. It’s the coldest leather I’ve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I’ve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I’m glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there’s no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.
text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:Easiest way? Buy a measuring tape and measure yourself or your best fitting articles of clothing. Noting that your exact body measurements is your bare minimum (and you never need to go that slim anyways).   Uniqlo, Proper cloth, ledbury, kamakura shirts, all have in depth sizing guides, with proper cloth giving you example measurements depending on your fit and data provided. I suggest starting from there with regards to important measures to follow.  Denim websites and similar offering boutiques usually offer measuring guides as well, especially for jeans. Some boutiques like self edge, blue owl have a database to search for jeans based on measurements. Very nifty.  Honestly, its quite a bit of research to buy the right size the first time around. The most foolproof way is to buy multiple sizes and return. That being said, its not always the most economical, location, and/or shipping policies don’t allow this. Barring that, asking the sales team and cross referencing sizing with other vendors’ resources, reddit threads, official company sizing guides, will be your best bet.  Now all said and done, with tops usually measurements like chest, body length, sleeve length, shoulder length may be sufficient. Technically armhole size also matters but is usually never provided, rarely the armhole size will matter as they are in proportion to the aforementioned measurements.	episode_done:True
text:Language actually plays a huge roll in your development, but so do culture and climate.	labels:I never stated language doesn’t play a role in development.

There may be some, but I chalk it down to climate, culture, and, quite frankly, personal preferences.	episode_done:True
text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:If I picture my mom's typical winter outfit it was a sweater with snakes wearing sombreros and margaritas embroidered on it, a burgundy "sweater jacket" with fringe, and a pink/orange/green bucket purse.*  So I guess she taught me "fuck it, wear what you want", but it did take me a while to adopt that attitude.   *tbf, this was a look for moms in the 90s

text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:When I did a shopping detox a few years ago, I found that using shopping to fill time was as big an issue for me as wanting new things. Yes, the fun of the purchase and desire to wear something new contributed to shopping. But the bigger issue for me was that I used shopping to fill downtime. It was an issue at in-person stores, e.g. in between a fitness class and work, and at home when I had plenty of time for online shopping. I had to find other ways to fill my time. I took walks between errands and tasks. I did some errands and maintenance work that I'd been putting off. I read and exercised more. It helped me see how much time I was dedicating to shopping and how much time I had available for other things if I shifted priorities a bit.	episode_done:True

text:Fall Fit Battle - Final Four - Discussion	labels:**NgoKnows** vs Chunsak. I'm a little bit let down by Chunsak's colour palette, whereas Ngo rocks it in this department. I'm also giving points to Ngo for the better trousers-to-footwear transition. Notably, both did a cheeky thing with showing a little bit of a white sock, but this too is nicer in Ngo's fit. Clear winner for me.  8888plasma vs **Rariora**. I'm a little bit let down by both fits (but I am coming into this with extremely high expectations). Rariora feels like a rehash of last week (and last week was a better execution of this concept, maybe). plasma is committing to "very cool textures", but aside from this nothing about the silhouette or palette or other French fashion words excites me here. Besides the cool texture clash, I don't think that sweater and trousers work particularly well (tho the belt is cool).
text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:Do you know Daria Andronescu? She has a youtube channel and a blog that deals with what you are experiencing. A while ago she published a template that allows you to calculate how many outifts you need based on what you do every week. Say you work from home, exercise at home and you only go out twice per week - this means you need much more comfortable clothes than "going out clothes". Based on that, and seeing what your life looks like for an entire season you can adjust your wardrobe accordingly. If you like a romantic/feminine style, you can still have it by picking loungewear that suits that style, that way you are more truthful to yourself and don't have to only wear hoodies. I think if you don't experiment with it you will never now.  I have a very feminine style I hated wearing hoodies around the house because they are not very fitted and make me feel sloppy and unproductive. I now wear tight but comfortable loungewear that is similar to what I would go for in my pre-covid life and I feel much more like myself.	episode_done:True
text:I really like that outdoor format.  Did you bring anything home?	labels:Yeah! A Hawaiian shirt, pajama bottoms, a hat with a marmot on it, a fleece, a t shirt from the arizona sonoran desert museum, and an REI shirt for my man.  It wasn't a very "high fashion" swap haha
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:For a while I struggled with this as well. But then I realized that If you see something that someone else is wearing or is admiring someone’s style, in a way that really is your style too. If you like it on you, you can wear in and have it be a part of you. IMO it doesn’t matter if your style differs from day to day. One time I saw someone with a super cool black outfit on the street and straight up copied it from what I had home, and I loved to wear it! Next day I wore something flowery inspired from a fashion commercial! Felt great in that too.   Clothes can be very fun if you let them! Best of luck.	episode_done:True

text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:A little different but I own several saris and a couple of lehengas, some of which were my mum's and some from my grandma on my dad's side.  With my mum's, I like to style them as she wore them which is pretty traditional and really lean into the 80s style with fluffy hair and major winged eyeliner but I normally add a statement piece of jewellery to make it mine.  My grandma's I tend to mix up with different styles of blouses, different scarves and wear as more of a mishmash to fit in with the trends at the moment. One of the saris she gave, I've had made into a lehenga with two different blouses and the skirt into a ruffled, almost flamenco kind of skirt because the material really suits that kind of thing.
text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:It is a good thing you put the links of the instagrammers, because their looks was not what I imagined from the word "elegant".  They are thin and fit, likely with lots of cosmetic surgery and beauty treatments, one is very tall, they are all very "done". It is a look, and everybody do their own thing. Their look is very body conscious, very revealing, very showing off curves (in the right places since they are very thin.. Always explicitly sexy. It is indeed, maybe stereotypical very russian, or eastern european in general.  Some  observations about those looks and if you want to :  - keep shoes all pristine. High heels or sneakers or combat boots, but keep them as  pristine as possible.  - when in doubt, downsize clothes (this is against my regular advice, but this is a specific look).  - usually always showing one of legs/cleavage/midriff.  - very brand aware but you will find similar pieces everywhere starting from primark up...	episode_done:True

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:Hi! As a stylist I get this question ALOT. For starters don't get rid of too much before buying replacements. What ends up happening is we get rid of everything without establishing what pieces we actually need.   Start with establishing your personal style. What do your want your closet/style to be? What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping! Now that you have a moodboard and list of things you need you can shop to fin in the gaps and more importantly you can shop with intention!   &#x200B;  I hope that wasn't too much and was helpful haha. I'm always happy to help.

text:The Terribly High Cost of Cheap Goods	labels:Don't believe companies when they say something domestically produced will cost tons more. They lie! It's pure green. Unfettered capitalism. Maximum profit, minimal expense. I've discovered many high quality brands that have their goods made ethically and away from China! They do not cost a lot more and I'm happy to support locally made. No I'm not rich. The problem is that big greedy companies have the marketing budget to promote their cheaply made crap and thus make it hard for smaller independent brands to compete. But we have reddit which has been super useful in discovering such independent brands.

I think when on sale (and they have a ton of sales, for example 50% everything during the off xmas season, 40% off black friday), they offer a very good price to quality ratio.  I highly recommend them for their henleys and button down shirts, especially the oxfords. they can be found with out logo too.	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Camoshita | January 23, 2021	labels:I've owned (emphasis on owned) a couple of Camoshita pieces over the years and while I have good things to say about them, I will also add that the brand is practically laser focused in what I think it does (that is, casual contemporary #menswear). I hesitate to use casual because of its manifold definitions in clothing, but I'm talking about bold patterns and detailing, not pretending a chore coat is a suit jacket.  Anyway, the one suit I've had is excellent, though maybe only appropriate at weddings because of its general boldness. In detailing, it is almost identical to my normal United Arrows suit. The buttons are really nice, "lighter" than my american and european suit options with a nice iridescent glow. Is it mother of pearl? I don't know, but it's definitely flashy if you know where to look. The sportcoat I had was similarly detailed and it made me look like a used car salesman with its bold, brown check. This is a good thing, but I unfortunately rarely have call to look like a used car salesman so I moved it on. What made me give up on the brand were the shirts: twice I bought them on deep sale but found them far too trim, especially through the sleeves, and too fussy with the buttons. I can't exactly recall but I remember there being more than one place on both shirts that had more buttons than should be there. More than I care to put up with.  Anyway, the point is to say that if Camoshita fits your life, it's great. I love my suits and still wear them. The materials, work, and design details are, in my limited experience, unimpeachable. But of course, if what Camoshita does isn't what you want, the infinite steez of Kamoshita-san isn't suddenly going to rub off on you and make you the Prince of Pitti.	episode_done:True

They are kinda pricy but they have a lifetime warranty, although I’ve never had to use it. I have pairs that are a few years old that are holding up just fine.

text:Does anyone else wear one brand only?	labels:I only wear Uniqlo. I became obsessed with the brand when when I lived in Seoul 2007-2009 and it's just kinda followed me since. I move a lot between continents and they always end up having an online shop or a location a few hours' drive away, so off I go when possible. It's often one of the few constants that I get to keep when everything else changes.
text:Inspo Album: Vintage Wool Sweaters Need Good, Loving Homes	labels:As a born and raised Norwegian, now living in the UK, my love for wool jumpers is endless and my sadness is twofold. 1) I might be Norwegian, but I've also got extremely sensitive skin. Thus my heart may be set on wool, but my skin is absolutely not, unless it's very fine cashmere or particular blends. 2) When autumn comes my immediate reaction is "WEAR ALL THE WOOL JUMPERS", and then I remember I live in the south of England and it doesn't actually get that cold here, plus it always rains.   Neither of those points are going to keep me from now spending several hours looking at vintage wool jumpers online though.

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:From 2001-2005, clothing I wore as a high schooler/college kid: low rise bootcut jeans, fitted graphic tshirts, fitted polo shirts, fitted shirts in general (shirts were so tight- maybe that’s why we layered??), always layering shirts- and shirts were super long and over your hips, but tight- never tucking them in, cutoff denim skirts, cotton shorts (like soffees) with words on the butt, necklace with my first initial on it, platform flip flops, dresses with Hawaiian prints (like flowers or surfers etc), hoop earrings, fitted hoodies. That’s what I can remember.

text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:A few tips that work for me in thrift stores: - I pick one section and don't feel like i have to check out the entire store.  - I go through racks and touch everything and stop when I touch something that feels like a nice fabric - silk, cashmere, good wool, crisp cotton. This helps me get to the nice stuff when the racks are visually overwhelming. - try on lots of things! Sometimes you fall in love with stuff you didn't expect to.   On websites that are searchable: - have a very specific item in mind or a specific brand you like - narrow the search results by size, brand, color, and fabric - pay attention to the measurements to see if things will fit - don't be afraid to make low offers on sites where you can do that  I find online thrifting very different than in-store thrifting, because online, you can search for all kinds of specific things, where in a store, most of the fun comes from finding something unexpected.
text:General Discussion - November 01	labels:Man I don't know if there's a more satisfying feeling than finding out a piece you never wore suddenly works with the way your wardrobe has moved.

text:Does anyone else have “irony pieces”?	labels:A long time ago, a friend at work told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheapo pantyhose.  I looked down at my crappy nylons and actually felt cheap. I went to Nordtroms that night and bought presentable nylons and wore them to work the next day. She nodded in approvement and then told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheap sweaters. I then bought a wildly pretty ivory cable knit sweater and wore it to work and feeling quite exactly like 1000000 bucks AND i had fancy nylons too. She told me no one would take me seriously with my unkempt shoes and that's when I learned the power of a shoe shining kit.  The next day I wore crappy slacks...and, well you know how the story goes.  To this very day I wear natty clothes and shoes so shiney they can blind fleet of Greek warriors.  The only real irony is no one gave a tootie about nylons and yet I still wear them despite all evidence to the contrary....and she threw al hers away after our company got bought out by another and they were no longer required. (I point at my perfectly appointed knees).

Super weird to think about but so interesting! It’s like I internalized it all those years. Thanks for pointing this out!	labels:Think of it this way.... some of the most powerful people in the world subscribe to a “uniform” so you are in good company.

My basic item is a good quality fitted tee and tank.  Old Navy used to be the place to buy these things but their quality has gone downhill a lot.  I just want a tee or tank that is good for layering, but is not so sheer that I can't wear it alone.  Is something made with fabric heavier than tissue paper too much to ask?  (And by fitted, I don't mean the Everlane oversized/boxy fit.  If I wanted that, I'd shop in the men's section.)
text:Just how revolutionary is Harry Styles’ Vogue cover?	labels:I like the gesture a lot and things like this make me as a queer person feel more safe...  *however*, that doesn't stop me from saying I think this shoot was poorly styled. The looks just don't do it for me and in some ways they look incomplete. It looks like he decided to wear a dress the day he showed up to the shoot. It just seems, for lack of a better term, lazy. Like they didn't really care what this meant. He needed more hair and makeup work in my opinion. Something to make people look at it and be like "wow, he looks really pretty and I bet he feels it”  or some eye color would've pulled the whole thing together. Or a pretty necklace! I think lacking these little details is why people will say he didn't pull it off and is sort of a let down considering what this symbolizes. Open to hearing from other people who support the look, tho
text:It’s 2021.

This sub usually salivates at the thought of athleisure taking over and killing fashion (and fast fashion) but that 100% wouldn't happen. Almost every woman I know is bloody sick and tired of not getting to dress up, not being able to wear lipstick, not having places to wear heels and vacation outfits. People would literally go crazy and it truly would be the roaring twenties. Dresses of all types, miniskirts, sparkle and glitter, heels for days, fun fabrics, bolder colors, leather pants, blouses with impractical sleeves, statement earrings – women would really be dressing to the nines *and* wearing bold lipstick colors to compliment.

I am really struggling to find jogging bottoms or sports trousers (like part of a set) that are long enough in the leg for me.  Every pair I find come up horrendously short and look stupid.  I'm 6ft 1" with fairly long legs. I'm not a massive fan of the 'cuffed' bottom tracksuit bottoms either which is frustrating as this seems to be the current style.   I am between a 32-34" waist and on a pair of M&S jeans I have that fit nicely the inside leg reads 33"  I've tried looking on big and tall sites but they seem to cater more for larger males and not just slim tall guys.   Anyone know anywhere i could look please? I'm UK based down in the south just north of Brighton.   Thanks in advance	episode_done:True
text:Learning to dress better	labels:Seems like the info in the guides would have been useful. Do you have specific questions beyond that?  As far as the hair questions, I think it matters a little bit. Hair color affects which clothing colors will be most flattering on you. Outlandish hair styles may clash with conservative attire, while conservative hair styles may clash with edgy alternative attire. But it's possible to toy with the contrast deliberately. For example, Hardcore, Teddy Boy, Lo Head and early Skinhead styles incorporated elements of "smart" (sort of business casual) attire, but recontextualized with bold hairstyles and subversive styling. Best preppy-styled guy I knew shaved his head. It's not what you expect from the clothing, but I thought that it helped him make the look his own rather than a class costume.  So I'm mostly saying don't overthink the hair thing. Hairstyle is probably more personal than clothing, so just choose a style that you like and that suits you. If it's not harmonious with your clothing then tweak something or enjoy the contrast.	episode_done:True

text:yea, Im pretty sad they are so long. I am not into the crop look for winter but when I was looking at details I just saw regular and assumed they would be around 28 inches( didnt see the 30.5 inch measurment online at the time). As someone that's 5'5 I didnt expect a regular length to be to long. Im not sure if I want to pay the 8 dollar return fee again though to go for the crops since I'm having a hard time getting past other fit issues  I might try the rebel pants instead as its stated they are meant for curvier types. I do not like the fitted look though, I prefer the straight leg, I just think they bunch because they are to long	labels:Eh I think that it’s great piece for fall/winter bc you can wear big sweaters to hide the other fit issues. By the time summer comes, you definitely won’t be wearing them. But if it’s only $8 for something you might like better and actually wear, then I would bite the bullet. Better than these sitting in your closet and never wearing them, or taking a loss and selling them.	episode_done:True

If you want your bag to be relatively timeless, you can invest in something like a Lady Dior or Chanel Classic Flap, or opt for a more simple style bag from most any of the major brands. But if your style is more edgy and youthful like the Saddle Bag love suggests, you might just want to get what makes you feel happiest and what is most practical for your lifestyle and budget, regardless of what people are wearing at this exact moment in fashion.

I'll try to get a board together to put a picture with what I'm describing, but any Youtube video titled Fall 2020 clothing haul will probably give you an idea of what I'll be wearing as I'm not much of a fashion risktaker lol.  I have been searching all the resale sites for vintage wool shackets, as the Zara one I'm interested in keeps selling out and its like 90% polyester anyway. I plan on buying a few vintage pendleton/ll bean/eddie bauer oversized wool flannels to wear as jackets instead.

text:Are jean shorts on men really that bad?	labels:Yes, if you wear them the fashion police will hunt you down and put you in jail.      Nah, but they do seem a lot less acceptable in America than here in Europe. I definitely think cutoffs are the way to go though.
text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items are my Native American Turquoise jewelry and my cowboy boots. Just purchased a huge $900 squash blossom necklace and have worn it constantly. My boots range from $30 for a secondhand pair to $750 for custom made and none are worn more or less than the others.  When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was “saving for good”. Ironically, “good” apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I’m just out running errands.
text:As a Florida girl myself, I really appreciated Jane the Virgin showing looks I can actually wear. Other tv characters are always doing things like wearing a light jacket in the summer, and that would absolutely kill me. They did a great job of styling true hot weather looks in a way that was interesting and appropriate.   I especially loved all of Petra's business casual shorts.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Knit Tie Inspo / Lookbook	labels:I picked up a black knit tie and a navy knit tie at the same time. While for normal woven ties, I'd usually reach for a navy over a black, with the texture of a silk knit, somehow the black knit tie just looks better than the navy knit in so many outfits.   This might be a function of bias because I've read articles extolling the virtues of the black knit tie, but I think the texture of the knit helps to offset the starkness of the colour
text:I’m back in the office 2 days a week and I realized I’ve lost all the calluses that protected my feet from work shoes. Not even heels—broken-in, good quality leather flats now give me blisters if I walk anywhere other than just my car to my office and back.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:I’be always loved dressing over the top and a thing I had to learn to get over quickly was the stares. If I notice someone staring at me, I stare back and give a little wave to let them know I can see them too. If they were admiring my outfit, they wave back or just straight up tell me they like my fit. If they were judging me, they usually go red and pretend I don’t exist. It’s a fun little game >:)	episode_done:True

text:Discussion - “ Odd “ Fashion Inspirations	labels:I can't get enough of the fashion from Korean dramas. I do not have the body type of many of the actresses in there, but all of the pencil skirts and floofy blouses, the blazer combos, the accessories -- I love it!  I even find myself searching for some of the accessories (earrings and necklaces) worn in some of the dramas.
text:It’s 2021. A vaccine for the virus has been made widely available and businesses may operate at full capacity, including bars, clubs, salons, etc. How will this influence fashion?	labels:I have already started going crazy with upping my statements and dressing to impress when I go to work.  I was off for 6months and had nothing to dress up for.  Now I dress extra super cute every day for work (which I absolutely did not do before) just because I want to look good and I have no where else I really go. 🤦🏼‍♀️. I definitely think we are all going to want to look extra when this is all over.

text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:Cost per wear!!   T = How many times a year will I wear this item S= How much? W = worth  S/T=W  EX. Leather boots are $120 (S) Will probably wear them 3x a week for 6 months so that’s 78 round up to 80 times. (T)  120/80= $1.50 per wear  EX.2 Cute summer dress: $200 Will wear once a week for 6 weeks it’s warm where I am. If I find that many excuses to wear it. So about 6 times this year.   200/6= $33 per wear  After a while, you’ll start seeing prices based on cost per wear. It’s helpful to start yearly, but after a while you’ll be able to gage how long the item will last, then you can really do cost per wear.	episode_done:True
text:When will I be "too old" to look cute, cool, hip, whatever?	labels:As you get older you stop caring as much about that stuff. Focus on developing your style now at a young age and the rest will kind of fall in place. As you get older you’ll already know what you like and what works well for your body. There won’t be a need to “look” hip or cool because you’ll just...be.	episode_done:True

Don’t mind if I do! Comfy shoes on all but the most special occasions? Yay!	episode_done:True

text:Style rut: Pinterest vs reality	labels:Okay, so people are heckin' rude. What inspires us can be unwearable on our particular bodies, and we're not obligated to wear it. Or maybe we don't want to wear that exact item, but some part of it excites us. It's okay to translate what you loved in a picture into something you feel fits into your everyday life. What gives with your "friend"?  Now, if you find yourself unable to do that -- you're STILL okay. And if you need help, obviously that's why Daily Questions etc exist. Because we weren't any of us born knowing how to style.

text:How does one incorporate haute couture into everyday work outfits?	labels:More info needed: What luxury designer* pieces do you tend to fall in love with? If evening wear or voluminous skirts are what makes your heart beat faster, there might not really be a good way of bringing that into your 9-5... but if you’re drawn to something like Balmain blazers (a personal weakness), it’s a lot easier to just throw one of these into your work rotation in place of a “normal” blazer. If you’re into a particular brand’s prints, textures, use of color, etc., then accessories are an easy place to start as well - a full blown Pucci dress may be a bit “too loud” for an engineering firm, but you should be able to get away with a silk Pucci scarf.   *Assuming you meant fashion house runway / main line pieces, not true haute couture which is really not work-appropriate unless you’re a model or actual royalty...	episode_done:True

text:Thank all of you	labels:It sounds like you had an outstanding in store experience and I'm delighted for you. Congratulations on finally having shoes you're excited to put on and I hope they live up to every little bit of that excitement for you.  The best bit is that good quality shoes get *more* comfortable as you imprint on the cork inside and the leather conforms to your feet. It's joyful to slip on a pair of shoes that you've owned for a few years. It's like working in a butt groove on your favourite chair but for your feet.	episode_done:True
text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:Someone recently posted on the fragrance subreddit about how they started the day in sweats but once they put on one of their strong sexy perfumes they described it as “the scent taking over” and forcing them to change into a super cool outfit, and throughout the day the scent kept inspiring them to do more like add red lipstick, etc even though they weren’t leaving the house.

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:This comes up here a lot, but many of the outdoors brands have turned into mostly fashion brands, and the quality has dropped as a result. The North Face, with the exception of a few of their collections (e.g. Summit); Columbia, and Mountain Hardware which they bought; and Marmot are some of the more famous examples.  Patagonia, Arc'teryx, Outdoor Reaearch, Fjallraven, and Kuhl are currently good alternatives, but I like to check the ultralight / camping subreddits for the most up to date info.	episode_done:True

Never again.	labels:omg and the tearing of jeans at hem the ends because of the breakdown from snow and salt.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:You're kinda making a mountain out of a molehill here. It's not hard to wear colors. Relax about it. It's not a disaster if things clash slightly. You'll be fine. There are no fashion police.   My usual style is I get either brightly colored top or a bright bottom (or a bright dress). The other is relatively neutral to avoid clashing or being overwhelming. This is not a hard and fast rule. There are times when it's fine to break it. It's just a guideline for when I'm in a hurry.  Match saturation and brightness. Burgundy and plum are fine together because both are relatively saturated and dark. Pale pink and lavender work together. Burgundy and lavender are harder because they don't match in saturation and brightness. They aren't impossible to put together and look good but it's a bit harder.  You will not look good in some colors. This is 100% fine. Try things on. Figure out what makes you look awful. You can do this. It doesn't need any special knowledge.
text:The war 100% made those things acceptable for women to wear. It also finally killed off the corset, shortened skirts, and introduced sportswear. It’s also a big reason why 1920s fashion features a lot of sportswear and more straight, androgynous silhouettes for women.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Runways have been sending out 2000s vibes. Anyone onboard?	labels:I'm just going to lay it out there: I hate it. I hate the return of the Mean Girls/bitchy rich white girl/fucking velour Juicy tracksuit look. Probably because I started high school in 2001 and it was like the hey day of bland tackiness and Paris Hilton and I'm too close to it, lived it a little too much, to find any novelty in it. SO vapid. I was slightly vapid and a little mean for a while around that time before I came into myself and I don't like the reminders.  What I do like about the looks above though, is that I see the 60s and 90s Spice Girls influences and I can get into that.  Edit: also, on occasion, I wear low rise pants, but I like looking at trends for inspiration and new ideas, not dictating what I can or can't wear. If you like low rise jeans and hipster minis, rock em. If not, fuck em forever, who cares.

Some American companies make good quality products but even American integrity is mostly long gone due to stuff being outsourced and it’s just a circle of corporations fucking regular people because of greed.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:Have you done a styling session with your current wardrobe to put together looks? If so, how did that go? It sounds like there is a chance you could/may need to work in your closet a little to put together outfits if you have not already. This is also a great exercise to identify what you really have to work with, and what you need. That'll help you round out what's missing and make your wardrobe more workable.	episode_done:True

text:Messy eaters? Tell your stories and hacks / fixes.	labels:Why do extra work when you can just git gud at putting food in your mouth hole? Changing your wardrobe, carrying a bib, or changing clothes to eat is a bit silly of a solution to a problem that can be remedied by becoming less messy, no?    I'm sure that's not what anyone wants to hear, but I don't see this as markedly different than a child who has to learn to put away their toys. Messy eating isn't some genetic anomaly, you can simply exercise more control over how you eat. It may even be as simple as slowing down or leaning forward more over a table/desk.
text:I'm also in my 30ies. Not getting stuck in one particular style is not about making radical changes every few years, it's just incrementally growing your wardrobe with you. You don't have to fully committ to W I D E if that's not your thing, but perhaps gradually phase out the skinny jeans for some straight cut trousers. See what of the stuff that you have already works with that, see what doesn't, take it from there etc.  But really, the best advice I have is just to wear what you like and own it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How to build an age-suitable varied chic wardrobe?	labels:>French chic and preppy school girl  Have you ever heard of the brand Claudie Pierot? It's suitable for your age, but it's really perfect for this. It's probably too pricey, but maybe you can copy that style elsewere. Also, I am East Asian - women tend to look very young and our fashion is geared a lot towards looking youthful as well. Maybe you can get some inspiration with how we style stuff too.  Anyways, I remember how hard it was as a teen to hear "dress however you want and don't worry about it" from people and have it mean anything (hell, that's the case for me even now in my mid-thirties). So I'll just say this - people will definitely notice if you dress differently than them, but they are less likely to think you're trying "too hard" if you don't act differently (better or different than them, seeking validation, etc. etc.) because of how you dress or if you avoid drawing attention to your clothes specifically (like name dropping brands or styles or being not willing to go certain places or do certain things because you're not dressed appropriately).	episode_done:True

text:I actually hate my Ruggable. I love the design, but it is horrible for a house with dogs that shed a lot. The only way I’ve found to get hair out of the rug is to get down and scrape it with my hands.

Ok, end rant!	labels:Yeah the edges roll up like crazy on mine. And they are so flat, like zero plush at all. I do really like their designs though.	episode_done:True

The other day there was a post and some guy said that he should be trusted because;   -	He drives a Subaru -	Plays Lacrosse  -	is from New England  Instead of saying “nice dog”, the people there say “your dog is so NavyBlazer”. It’s really a cesspool.   Ivy is a breakdown of ‘Trad’ style, whichever way you cut it leaves room for interpretation and that’s the beauty of it. The whole point of Ivy style was rebellion. Kids were tired of wearing the same uniform their fathers wore, so they decided to wear their sweaters under jackets, sneakers with ties, etc.
text:Can we talk sleepwear?	labels:I was very into this idea as well and invested in some Lunya PJs...but that elegant person I invisioned didn't magically appear. I still had a big messy bun, acne patches on my face and slept with my mouth wiiide open. I didn't feel as comfortable in those PJs and that fantasy I had didn't come true, ya know? I don't want to discourage you, just my two cents as someone who had a very similar thought process  I went back to tank tops and sweatpants and I find I appreciate them a lot more now. I make sure they fit properly and don't have stains or holes so I still feel reasonably put together.

For the past few winters I've been looking at winter parkas to buy and stores like LL Bean, REI, The North Face, Columbia, Eddie Bauer, etc. straight up don't carry XS for most of their offerings. And I'm swimming in their size small. It's so discouraging and borderline humiliating. I either have to shell out for Patagonia or I'm stuck with Uniqlo and other fast fashion bs.

text:I bought a gorgeous teal wedding kaftan with matching floor length vest and beaded waist belt in Morocco. It was really unique from all the others as it was much more understated and all the beadwork was also done with teal beads (different from most which have a lot of gold accents). I was particularly proud because I bargained down to 450 dirhams or around $45 for it.   Wore it once in Jardin Majorelle but without the floor length waist coat but was so excited to wear that piece with western clothes. Was even considering wearing it at my wedding.  Well, we make it back to a hostel in Madrid and since I can’t sleep, I take a little thc tincture to help put me to sleep. Well, I wake up high, 5 min before checkout and obviously, since my bag is quite full with gifts and Moroccan goodies now, my clothes are having a hard time fitting, so naturally, I put MY FAVORITE REFORMATION OUTFIT AND NEW MOROCCAN GOWN IN A PLASTIC BAG AND TIE IT TO THE OUTSIDE OF MY BACKPACK.   As we’re walking through the train to go to Seville, I realize that, SURPRISE!, bag is no longer attached and I lost it somewhere on the walk.   Obviously we called the hostel but it wasn’t there...3 hour train ride with my fiancé was SILENT. I don’t think I’ve ever been more angry and everytime I looked at that backpack for days it would make so angry.   Teal Kaftan, please know how sorry I am and how much I miss you.	labels:	episode_done:True

Hands thrust in pockets, lounging on a picnic blanket, feet up binging Netflix?  An interesting thought exists that as mens casual wear became more acceptable that suiting became more structured and stiff. Thoughts?

Cause I might like some of the fabrics used or the way the cut highlights the figure but none of this stuff is wearable for me at least.

I think that my way of buying is the same idea, just less formula and more general in approach. I never take the time to compare, but I’m aware of enough brands and price range to have as a guide.   I know a few people mentioned like spend your money as you please, wear what you like, and I get that on SOME level. However, I do think that fashion in particular is guilty of playing the person with this mentality.   Great post. Appreciate the effort you put into it.	episode_done:True

text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:So, look, I don't want to tell you _not_ to do this, but if I've understood correctly you're looking at creating a bloodborne-inspired victorian/traditional wardrobe. There are elements of that style that have mainstream appeal today, high-waisted wool trousers being one example. However, when you take them in context with the more "interesting" elements you picked out it gives off serious cosplay vibes. Perhaps you should take the fact that the only places offering this sort of clothing are Etsy/cosplay stores as a hint that you should reconsider this idea.  You might be thinking, _what about the cyber goth vampire Rick Owens fits I see on this sub?_ It's a valid question. The key difference is that the style you're going for here has _such_ a strong association with cosplay and videogames and so little mainstream appeal that the number one association people are going to make is that you are cosplaying. Doubly-so if you're wearing cosplay-quality clothes from cosplay vendors. While the Rick Owens aesthetic may not have mainstream appeal it _is_ very accepted within fashion circles and _doesn't_ have that strong cosplay association.  So with that said my advice is to take what you've got and tone it down. Treat it like a high-fashion runway show and take inspiration from it instead of trying to recreate it 1:1. High-waisted trousers, great. Gaiters? Maybe just get some actual boots. Bloodborne-style woolen collars/scarves/hooded shawls? Wear a regular scarf that has an interesting shape or texture, or a shirt with a more exaggerated collar. Maybe the fact that you can't find retailers selling this kind of stuff is the limitation you need to make it work in the real world.  Or maybe I'm just talking complete shite and someone smarter than me can help you more. I hope that I've at least broken the ice and said what needed to be said so that people can try to constructively help you.

But if you look at the brands of all my cashmere sweaters (Grana, Halogen, C by Bloomingdales) I'm wearing the materials of the wealthy, but from pedestrian brands! I AM A POOR PERSON MASQUERADING AS A RICH PERSON!  And honestly, that's pretty much the most disgusting personality flaw one can have.

She specifically asked for the one I got; she provided the link and all. It arrived and was a major disappointment. The fabric was thin, the cuts and seams were weird as hell, sleeves were short, and more. It was obvious that it was just a "straight from crappy manufacturer" product with lies on the website. What's unfortunate is that I had a feeling prior to ordering it that it wasn't going to be good.

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:I think it’s unavoidable, so yep like another commenter said, just choose wisely, and I would also add don’t ‘give in’ to any whims and infatuations. I put something in my online shopping cart (or even hold it and walk around the actual shop), and a few moments later I realise I don’t need it and close the tab/put it back.  For me the biggest thing is knowing my style. I know what things I look best (yes ‘best’, not just ‘good’) in, so I have these items in my closet and I am not likely to randomly get more clothes whenever I feel like it. And knowing your style, you’ll also know you’ll wear the items you buy a lot, so you’ll not feel bad about spending more money and ‘investing’ in pieces. :)	episode_done:True

text:The joy of cordovan—and how to wear and maintain it	labels:Cordovan is an Instagram dream - it’s lustrous and has a ton of color depth. Unfortunately I find  actually wearing it is a different story. It’s extremely stiff and inflexible, especially during the first 20-30 wears. It’s the coldest leather I’ve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I’ve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I’m glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there’s no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.

Also I eliminate fast fashion from my menu. And most of inspo these days come from japanese magazines like Fudge or from Pinterest, not instagram. French chic fashion is the only type which worth checking out on insta. Oh also some girls with very cool 70s like inspo style are pretty cool, but it's not something I d wear. The only minus is that they are all way too skinny, as someone in a normal body weight, I find these influencers , not depending on their style, almost unrelatable.	labels:Swannandtheberries is really good if you’re looking for a plus-sized French fashion Instagrammer.

text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:Everything eventually comes back in fashion.  Personally I would love for 2000s jeans to come back - not super low rise or the ones that were bedazzled or laced up but just normal rise bootcut and flare jeans. I have a few from that era that I still wear all the time and a couple more that I had to replace with similar ones from poshmark because I couldn't find them in shops.  I also miss 2000s makeup. Sure, there was too much body glitter and candy colors but there was also the fresh dewy look of blush and a light lip gloss - think Britney Spears in her Oops I Did It Again video, or Mandy Moore's makeup in her video for Candy. Not everything in the 2000s was horrible lol.

text:This might be a stupid question but I’ve never used eBay to buy clothes. Is there a certain way to do it? Lol I stopped using eBay years ago when I kept getting ripped off 🙄	labels:Personally I only use ebay when I'm looking for something really specific, usually either an exact item that I know my size in or a specific type of vintage item.  That makes the search function much easier to use.  (You can also set alerts to tell you when something that fits your parameters is posted.)    Check measurements, look at the photos carefully (and make sure they're the seller's photos, not stock photos, with the possible exception of new overstock items), and read the condition description.  Ask questions if you need to.  I don't order anything without measurements unless it's a contemporary item and I already know my size in it.    In terms of getting ripped off, check the seller's feedback.  You want both positive feedback and a lot of feedback.  But ebay's changed a lot since the early days.  I've never not gotten what I thought I was getting.

This bag gets the most use (and abuse), and when it wears out, I replace it.  I have one casual bag that I bought easily a decade ago. It's the ThinkGeek Handbag of Holding, and it has so many pockets. It was my daily bag at a different phase of my life. It isn't dressy enough for the office, but I'll use it on camping/beach trips when I don't want to throw my work purse into the sand.  I also have 4-5 smaller purses that I've received as gifts over the years. I don't use those very often, as I prefer larger bags, but I save them for job interviews, weddings, and other special occasions. And since they don't get much use, they tend to stay in great condition.	episode_done:True

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I have similar connotations as you about them being kind of cheap or tacky looking, but would add one other angle to it. While I'm 100% against the use of real fur/exotic hides, I think part of the cheapness animal prints comes from taking something that in its natural state exists on fur and copy-pasting it onto all different kinds of fabrics. Real cheetahs look beautiful and elegant. A poorly rendered cheetah print on thin polyester leggings just looks like a terrible imitation. There isn't this mental comparison going on with other patterns, like stripes or polka dots, because there's no "real" standard to compare to. They're just decorative patterns.  Even if you attempt to create a faux fur that more closely imitates a real animal hide, it's going to look cheap and fake (to me) unless it is really well done.

To give you an example: I find myself drawn to drapey, flowy, bohemian, artsy types of clothes. The sort that tend to look good on taller women with small busts. Now I'm a firm believer in wearing things you like regardless of whether conventional wisdom says they look "good" on you. But in this case what I was being drawn to was the lifestyle I felt those clothes represented, not the clothes themselves - which it turned out did not fit my lifestyle, my personality or my shape. It took quite a few expensive mistakes to realise this.	episode_done:True

text:How would you style or rebuild your wardrobe around your holy grail fashion piece?	labels:Red leather jacket in a cool, slightly muted red. Hip or waist length, with minimal silver hardware. Something that is elegant, polished, but has this undercurrent of danger. It's sexy, but not in an in-your-face kind of way. I would wear it with the tailored jeans I'm yet to buy and anyone of my dresses or skirts. The wardrobe is already there- I just need the jacket.	episode_done:True

Oof.

text:Is Chanel going to be better off without Karl?	labels:I feel like Karl Lagerfeld's legacy & tenure really glossed over his last decade or so of design. Sure there were some good shows in the 2010s, but a lot of it was just....   Virginie Viard is always going to come up short because she's Lagerfeld-esque and has the misfortune of coming directly after Lagerfeld. Lagerfeld was good at making his name and Chanel synonymous so that if you see a tweed jacket - you immediately think of both. As Viard tries to draw upon Chanel classics & house standards, it's seen as copying Lagerfeld (and failing) rather than her being referential. She hasn't really presented her point of view, separate from Chanel or Lagerfeld, either, so it's really hard to pick up on the specific aspects of her designs that are *hers.*

I also almost exclusively wear my thigh high boots in winter/fall	episode_done:True
text:Yeah. I low key hate this. Not for the gender non-conformity, but for perpetuating the notion that uncomfortable and restrictive clothing and high heeled shoes are aesthetically desirable for anyone.	labels:They're aesthetically desirable for the people who like them. There's an unfair pressure on women to wear them, but that's not the case here. This man is under no obligations to wear them; he does so for no other reason than he likes them. I also wear restrictive clothing and high heeled shoes. They're aesthetically desirable for me because I like how they look. But my wearing them doesn't obligate anyone else to, and I'd argue that a man wearing them doesn't contribute to the pressure on women to wear them (and that's the only pressure because there isn't one on men). There's no victim in this case, at least not the way you're framing it.	episode_done:True

I think you are right about suiting; nowadays it seems exclusively reserved for weddings, special events, etc. and is rarely intended for every day wear.

text:Future of fibers?	labels:Personally I don’t find it very difficult or expensive to shop for clothing made with natural fibers — if anything it’s gotten even easier to do so with online shopping and websites showing fiber content right in the product description. I don’t have to seek out brands that specialize in natural materials either — my clothing is mostly from Madewell, which doesn’t really market itself as being all that environmentally conscious or sustainable, and is definitely not a high end brand, but they have tons of options for clothing made of cotton, silk, etc.   I will say it’s gotten harder to find sweaters made of 100% wool over the years, however. I have several wool sweaters from mall brands that I bought just a few years ago. I gained some weight since then and have been looking for replacements from the same exact brands and it seems like they don’t even bother with 100% wool anymore, all of their sweaters are now made with acrylic, nylon, polyester, etc. That’s the only natural fiber that I feel has all but disappeared from the mainstream for some reason.   I will also add that I don’t think man made fibers are necessarily “cheap”, either. We’ve come a long way from man made materials of the 80s and 90s. When I think of man made fibers of today, I think of technical clothing and gear such as outdoor or sportswear. Patagonia for example is the poster child for environmentally friendly brands, but most of their clothing is made from man made materials, and their products are far from cheap. Partly because it performs better for its purpose, and partly because it’s supposed last a lifetime.  Which leads me to my last thought — IMO man made materials aren’t necessarily bad for the environment. It’s really our habits that are bad, and the industries that cater to these habits. If we all bought a few items of clothing that were all man made and lasted our lifetime, that is arguably *more* environmentally friendly than if we were constantly buying and throwing away natural fibered clothing.
text:So jealous! I want a squash blossom badly, I love a big statement necklace worn with all black.	labels:Meeee toooooo!

Or maybe we don't want to wear that exact item, but some part of it excites us. It's okay to translate what you loved in a picture into something you feel fits into your everyday life. What gives with your "friend"?  Now, if you find yourself unable to do that -- you're STILL okay. And if you need help, obviously that's why Daily Questions etc exist.

text:Do you feel the black Friday sales better or worse than usually this year? Is it worth to buy clothing you won't wear until next year?	labels:I always think Black Friday is overhyped.

I’ve found way better deals shopping end-of-season sales where brands are actually motivated to clear out their inventory for the new season.
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:A few years ago, I had recently gotten a promotion and wanted to dress a bit fancier. I went a bit ham on Old Navy's pixie pants. I bought some really fun colours, mustard yellow, light pink, floral patterns, pastel blue, etc.   I used to style them primarily with black, dark, grey, white, chambray tops/blouses.  I grew bored of this phase and went back to blue jeans, but it was a fun experiment for the summer time!

Looked fine in the photos though the condition was obviously used.  The fabric started tearing almost immediately after using it for daily wear. Holes in the elbows, under the arms from pulling it off, etc.  The fabric had obviously weakened over the years. Can’t say I would bother going vintage Patagonia again.	episode_done:True
text:What is something you've heard as fashion advice that isn't worth following?	labels:Probably the advice that anything I wear as a fat person has to be slimming or flattering. Yes I wear a lot of black, but just because it's easy not because it makes me look thinner. My size isn't a big secret or anything.   Also this is taking a really broad view but the fashion culture of planned obsolescence, declaring certain things "out" and other things "in," is super classist and unsustainable, so even though I enjoy reading about new trends I don't really care to follow them.

text:TBH I feel as if there’s this underlying feeling of moral superiority that’s rooted in the minimalistic wardrobe (for some people). I’ll keep myself from getting too bashed by saying, yes for some people it’s an economic or environmental choice but for a lot it seems like... Ascetic nomad seeking moral high ground.  It’s similar to the painting community where there’s a fetish for having a minimal paint palette. Wow! You were able to paint that using only four colors?!? Who cares so long as the final product looks good??	labels:There are tons of valid reasons for wanting or needing a smaller wardrobe, for sure! But one thing that doesn't come up in the conversation often (at least that I've seen, and it was something that honestly didn't occur to me until I'd been seeing these conversations for a long time) is *laundry*. Like, if you have only a handful of items, do you also have the time and space to do washing at least once a week? That could mean having to go to a laundromat or it could mean handwashing in a sink and hanging things to dry. If you have an in-home washer and dryer (or at least washer) it's a little different, but otherwise, that is something to consider when you don't have many options...I'm not saying capsules are bad at all! Again, I think there are tons of reasons why people like them. But it was something that came up that I was like, oh yeah, that's another factor that involves some amount of privilege (because it does require time or space in a way that having 25+ shirts can give you wiggle room with...) Pros and cons to both...

text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I had a general style from a relatively young age, like teenage years. Kind of preppy, kind of quirky, lots of animals on my tops, lots of jewel tones, etc. I'd play around with buying other types of looks, but most of them left my closet pretty quickly. In my early/mid 20s, I did have this horrible period where I thought I needed to "grow up" so I purged a *ton* of stuff and thought I was just going to stick to neutrals and sleek lines and be very polished, or my idea of polished...I was miserable and by the time I was in my late 20s, began rebuilding my wardrobe to be filled with more things that just make me smile. I do have some of my neutrals hanging around. I learned I don't hate them, as long as they have texture or dramatic sleeves or things like that. So I guess the experience wasn't a total wash...  But yeah, I'm 31 and my style journey is just kind of ending up where I was at like 3. (I mean, I just bought a sweater of a giraffe, haha) But it was really about just kind of accepting who I am and realizing I'm probably not going to outgrow a lot the idiosyncrasies the way I thought I "should" 🤷‍♀️	episode_done:True

text:Help with 2020 post-COVID scrubs style	labels:Hospital social worker, new to scrubs during COVID. I love my Figs bottoms. I wear hospital logo tees and a track jacket style zip up often.

Ready for action floor staff with snappy tennis shoes and an athletic headband?

text:General Discussion - November 10, 2020	labels:My partner and I are picking out my wedding band this weekend. I guess this will be my first true BIFL purchase for myself and I'm simultaneously thrilled and a little worried I'll screw it up.  I'm considering one of the bands with a hinge/clasp to account for my giant knuckles.
text:I though this when reading, but then you could have an 'ethics' (for want of a better word) section for each fabric. Maybe a note at the top that all industries have issues when it comes to production standards, and to research the company you're buying from to ensure they are sourcing their textiles responsibly.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:All good points, but I think that’s why we can’t always look at just clothing. We need to look at how someone carries themselves.  To use myself as an example, I think on paper i might sound like I dress like a rich American WASP heir, but if you look further, I think I make many choices that. WASP wouldn’t do. The same goes for the other dressers in the article who wear brass button jackets- none of them *overtly* looks like a college Republican	labels:I think you're right that on paper you fit into this, but really looking at your fits you don't dress at all in the way that I think is bad. I was talking more about (what I imagine to be) the typical r/navyblazer user, not you specifically. You dress very "trad" but not at all like "I (want people to believe that I) come from old money", which is what I find icky.  I really like your navy blazer too. I'd buy something like this in black.	episode_done:True
text:Sneakers trends FW 20/21	labels:I'm super interested in this since I've noticed people are kinda over the super chunky, Balenciaga-style sneakers and go for something more laid back.

I would like them in white too but I'm trying to steer away from leather, if anyone knows some faux leather dupes let me know!	episode_done:True

Obvs there are many exceptions but general trend is all black and trying to look like you look cool without trying	episode_done:True
text:Interesting article on luxury fashion made in Italy.	labels:I think ethical concerns are at the root of most luxury brands, we just don't see it. Whether that be material sourcing, animal cruelty, slave or child labour/wages etc.  One would have to go out of their way quite a bit to avoid brands that operate like this. Even Nike etc is the same story.

text:What is your favorite clothing purchase of the year, and why?	labels:If I'm honest, with this year being what it was, the purchase I'm most excited about is four pairs of slim-fitting fleece joggers from Gap. A close second would be two pairs of decent-looking New Balance 574s.  I've been working from home since March and really only go out to get groceries, get a haircut, and occasionally go for a walk on a nearby biking trail. My uniform for the last few months has been joggers and a polo shirt, sometimes an Oxford. It's just enough that I still feel professional at work (I do video calls with clients), but it's the most comfortable I've ever been at work.  When I have to leave, throw those New Balance sneakers on. Cold? Grad a denim jacket. Had I worn this outfit somewhere nice a year or two ago, yeah, I can see that being a cause for ridicule. But now, I'm frequently the best dressed person I run across when I go outside. At work, some people dress a bit better, but it's still comparable.  I look forward to seeing what happens to fashion when we get this pandemic taken care of. Some people have been putting effort together to make things like joggers and sneakers work and look great, I wonder if fashion in general will adopt more of the comfortable trends.	episode_done:True

Basically I find a thing I like and I get it in every color.  The only thing I don't do that for is pants, because I don't like wearing pants that often, and dresses are their own thing and don't need to be monochromatic.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 27, 2020	labels:What do you all think of a user starter pack thread? Design your own starter pack for your style/wardrobe?
text:What is the breakdown of $ spent for various outfits you actually wear?	labels:Maybe £100-300 for the whole outfit. More so £300 at this time of the year I'd guess.  Most expensive things are jacket and shoes which make up about 3/4 of the price for me.  Shoes I always buy new and expensive cause my feet suck. So £50-150.  Jackets are second most expensive and I try to always buy second hand. Got a few Barbour's and vintage coats for £10-50.  Jeans/trousers are a pain to buy second hand because the fit is normally crap. Maybe £50.  The rest is all second hand. Jumpers/shirts/t shirts. Can easily find that all super cheap on eBay, depop or in thrift stores.  Or my full suit which is £300 including tailoring. SO used to work in a suit shop and got discount on that one. I think it was 50% off.	episode_done:True

text:Better With Age: 10 Things Better Bought Used – Put This On	labels:Can confirm that Brian at Wooden Sleepers is an encyclopedia on vintage. If there's some specific vintage item you've been looking for, definitely send him an email and he'll probably come up with something.  I agree with most things on this list except for vintage knitwear; maybe I just haven't seen a good example, but old sweaters are scratchy + don't really look good beat up + hold smells deeper than things made of cotton. Especially with the premium on nice vintage these days, I'd rather get something new.  Vintage OG fatigues and vintage chamois shirts are incredible though. Both fabrics are so much more comfy when worn-in, and you get to continue telling a story by wearing them doing work / making art / going on hikes / etc.	episode_done:True

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Nothing that needs to be dry cleaned except winter coats. Hate the smell, hate the bother, hate the expense.  No glitter, no metallic thread. I like it on other people, but on me it makes me feel like I’m wearing a costume. Sequins and paillettes only on formal evening wear (for me).  No dolman sleeves (for me). I don’t like how they look on my busty inverted triangle shape.

text:Covid Dilemna - Finding my style	labels:I have been using Le Tote for three years now as a way to try out new styles. It’s a rental box service, but it has “normal” clothes - things I would wear to the office or to dinner with the hubs. Even during quarantine I’ve continued because it gives me new things to look forward to wearing without the need to shop outside my home. And I’ve found brands I really like that I wouldn’t have discovered in my normal routine of Target and JCPenney runs.   I discovered I actually can wear column dresses with my super curvy silhouette as a result. And I’ve tried cropped pants, cold shoulder tops, paper bag waists (they are awful on me), and all sorts of trends I would never have purchased without wearing for a day to make sure it worked for me.  I average 2-3 boxes a month with 5 clothing items, so that would be a slower but safe way to try lots of things.  I’m not trying to spam or anything, but I do have a promo code that gets us both a discount, if anyone has interest.
text:It’s 2021. A vaccine for the virus has been made widely available and businesses may operate at full capacity, including bars, clubs, salons, etc. How will this influence fashion?	labels:People will go ALL OUT. This sub usually salivates at the thought of athleisure taking over and killing fashion (and fast fashion) but that 100% wouldn't happen. Almost every woman I know is bloody sick and tired of not getting to dress up, not being able to wear lipstick, not having places to wear heels and vacation outfits. People would literally go crazy and it truly would be the roaring twenties. Dresses of all types, miniskirts, sparkle and glitter, heels for days, fun fabrics, bolder colors, leather pants, blouses with impractical sleeves, statement earrings – women would really be dressing to the nines *and* wearing bold lipstick colors to compliment.
text:For the parents of girls	labels:I don’t have kids, but I really loved how my mom handled it, and plan to do something similar: I had a clothing “budget” for each year, and I was free to ask for money for anything I wanted as long as it fit into the budget (or I could use my pocket money). I just had to keep receipts, and subtract the cost when we got home. Besides cutting down on “you don’t really need this” arguments, I actually ended up learning some useful lessons from the process—in order to set my budget for the year, it was my job to figure out what I needed and lay out a proposal, which was negotiating practice (my sister and I competed to see who could get a bigger one approved!), and we had to use Excel to log everything. I might’ve whined a bit about the process in the moment, but now I see that it was a neat strategy, and I’m grateful for it.
text:Does your language affect how you wear colors?	labels:I think it is less language as in words and more language as in semantics and groupings. While some of us may consider colors based on ROYGBIV, others may look at them based on whether they are hot or color or yin or yang or phlegmatic or spiritual or earthy.   The WAYS to see color vary as much as the names.  I might not want to wear pink and red, someone else might not want to wear a happy color with a sad one, or an east one with a west one.	episode_done:True
text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:I think a lot of people here that say their clothing falls apart quickly aren't properly caring for their clothes. Growing up I learned to wash everything together on cold. As an adult I had to read articles and watch YouTube videos on how to care for my clothing. I recommend everyone learn how to properly launder their clothing.
text:What are your go-to, everyday shoes?	labels:Blundstone 585 in light brown, pairs well with lots of jeans for causal looks especially jeans and t shirt/sweater combo. Been rocking them with rag and bone jeans and BR tees and feel sharp af. They’re so comfortable for me to walk in and I have no fear of getting them dirty or banging them up which I always worry about in other shoes.
text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:Honestly I think you have to give way more detail on your old pair and what you’re looking for.  In my mind the biggest hurdle to perfect jeans is the fit, and since every body is different this is highly individual. Some people might prefer stretchier denim for a more forgiving fit, while others look for stiffer fabric, and have less leeway.   Personally I still struggle to find a high rise, non cropped, fits my thighs and waist, plain dark wash, straight/skinny, 90% or more cotton, pair of jeans. But hopefully I’ll find it eventually!
text:Do you think fashion or style has age restrictions?	labels:I'm 35 and wear crop tops and high waisted jeans. Why do so many people on this sub care so much about what others think about them? Wear trendy items, don't wear them, just stop trying to make some women "other" than you due to some fashion superiority complex. Lord.

text:What’s your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:I'm waiting until we get to the part of the baggy jeans trend when people learn about the ripped, soggy backs of their pant legs that come from the jeans dragging on the ground. Enough of that this time around and the trend will cycle to something else.  signed,  someone who dealt with many, many ripped jean legs.
text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:Everything eventually comes back in fashion.  Personally I would love for 2000s jeans to come back - not super low rise or the ones that were bedazzled or laced up but just normal rise bootcut and flare jeans. I have a few from that era that I still wear all the time and a couple more that I had to replace with similar ones from poshmark because I couldn't find them in shops.  I also miss 2000s makeup. Sure, there was too much body glitter and candy colors but there was also the fresh dewy look of blush and a light lip gloss - think Britney Spears in her Oops I Did It Again video, or Mandy Moore's makeup in her video for Candy. Not everything in the 2000s was horrible lol.

text:How do you guys who like a formal/business look manage to not look the same all the time?	labels:Alright, since a lot of people already have commented great ways to style formal/business attire.   For style reference, look up Lydia Pang (lydia\_pang\_) on IG. She has a highlight that is dedicated to her outfits. She's my style icon so maybe I'm biased. I don't know if you intend to wear THAT much black, but her sense of style is out of this world for business and casual. She makes formal attire a bit more fun and quirky while still being professional.
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:Security here.   My non-work wardrobe is extensive and colourful and very 1950s.  I don't like wearing my security uniform into work unless it's freezing cold and I can hide it under a winter coat, because it's made by the same uniform supplier as our local PD.   So I end up wearing most of my clothes anyways, because I don't want to be mistaken for something I'm not.      Plus i've had incidents where people threaten to wait outside for me after I get off work (because I've kicked them out, or caught them stealing) and I've walked right by them and they have NO IDEA because I look so different in my regular clothes.   So it's a safety thing too.	episode_done:True

Better to wait some months and take a short shopping trip to the US and buy many things at once.	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I have shopped the men's department before and never had issues with sales associates. The biggest thing was once, they wouldn't let me in the dressing room and I had to go to one on another floor, because there were already men in there (but everyone had their own room and the only communal space was the mirror area? Like, not sure why it mattered, I ended up making the purchase at the register near the other dressing room and the guy lost a sale, which may have been petty but...I'd used that dressing room before with zero issue, so 🤷‍♀️) But I have had issues with some cuts of men's clothes--they aren't really cut for boobs and hips, so I had to get them tailored. There are some companies that do masculine/androgynous looks for those bodies, like Kirrin Finch, that might be worth checking out!	episode_done:True
text:I agree, I've never understood what people are doing in the laundry to make their clothes literally fall apart after a few washes. Washing on the hottest setting and drying high heat, maybe?  Ive legitimately never had anything fall apart in the wash ever and I dont take particular care other than cold water and low heat in the dryer (plus not chucking things like sweaters, dress shirts and leggings in the dryer at all). And I used the communal machines in my apartment!	labels:Washing clothes after wearing them only once and doing it on a high setting, I imagine?  Obviously clothes need to be washed if they're smelly, grubby, or you've been sweating in them but it's perfectly fine to wear something a few times before it needs washing.  Also: buying poor quality clothes made from synthetic materials.
text:What are your go-to, everyday shoes?	labels:Blundstones in the winter, white keds in the summer. I'm a simple gal. 🤷‍♀️  Side note, I wear orthodics so my shoe choices are based on whether I can rip out the insole and fit my orthodics. Unfortunately this means no sandals during the summer unless I really think it's worth it to sacrifice cuteness for knee pain!
text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:Work in fashion so hopefully can give some insight,   First thing to say is that some people do wear full runway looks on the daily, many many Comme Des garçons fans who wear increasingly full looks daily, crazy suits and dresses, pieces that don’t even look wearable. Although it is a small portion of people, it does happen (even see it now and again around london)   For the top conceptual brands (again I’ll take comme as an example) a fashion week show is as a form of expression, to present your concept in its fullest form - an art piece. This will then be watered down and made more commercial and sold, some brands sell their exact runway looks, some make it more commercial  It’s also important to add, what you see in this group is a small “subculture”, in other groups in in, most people do wear runway clothes daily, and even full looks daily, just depends what your seeing on your feed	episode_done:True

Didn't put quite enough information to pass the score for "developing self and others". God damn I'm annoyed. I hope another vacancy pops up before my contract ends and I am going to make sure I really big up that I'm now training people.
text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.

text:Lurker concept of dressing better is dressing “good” in a mainstream sense. Something that is restrained without being flashy. Something that other guys will say “cool jacket!” But won’t be scary to wear.   It’s how the basic Bastard came around. Inoffensive but still good.   It’s hard to talk to my friend who clearly wants to dress better and cooler but just can’t. He loves all the stuff I wear cause it’s cool and preppy (he’s also New England born and bred) but he’s in the more jock/frat category than I am (engineering nerd/artsy) and I think the idea of stepping too far out of line will be met with ridicule. I don’t really notice that stuff cause I’ve been doing it for so long, but for him even a new jacket or sneakers is really stretching it and he’s hesitant to step away from normal guy stuff.	labels:Yeah, I think I fall into the trap of dressing like this for so long that it’s sorta second nature at this point. So what is out of the norm for some people feels comfortable for me. I understand the fear of stepping away from the norm, and also understand that’s where most lurkers are. But I don’t understand the mindset of different=always bad. Idk maybe it just boils down to simply wanting to fit in

text:“I'm all locked down with nowhere to go – but that hasn't killed my lust for fashion”	labels:I have one suggestion, get dressed and take pictures. It doesn't have to be for Instagram/facebook. It can be for just yourself. If you really like an outfit, remember it with a picture. You can take it in a park, or at a location that is memorable for you, with your SO, or with your cat. You should at least get a few good pictures with you pet in the 10+ years they reside with you.  It's actually a fun learning experience, on how to use the cameras. I am interested in photography and usually use a dslr, but for selfies, dslrs are not as good. With an iphone, I think it's an entirely different genre of photography. You have to use completely different lighting system, etc., to use it to its full potential.

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:Personally, I really like thrift shopping. I can't afford high quality brands, and hate fast fashion. By thrifting, I am often able to find old, quality clothing. I got a pair of 90's calvin klein jeans, and some old levi's, and I've even gotten some very quality pants from the 60's-70's that still have tags.   I got a pair of Docs back when they were still made in England, very sturdy and will last me a good while.   A recent find was a very nice custom made elk hide jacket, and it was only $6.   It can definitely take a little bit of time, but it's very worth it. All of the things I have mentioned seem, from text, like they would be worn, ugly, old. But they're very fashionable, almost completely new, and of very high quality. It's a lot of fun, very rewarding, and kind to your budget!	episode_done:True

text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I’m Op but I’ll share mine -  At around 14 I had a quick phase of really liking the very early sort of e- kid bright and trendy fashion. Hot topic forever 21 sort of edgy stuff. Skinny jeans only. Small wardrobe. Didn’t look great and got bullied a little for my new look. Lowkey wanted to look like a gorillaz character. Still kinda do though lol.  Then there was a transitional trendy masculine street wear phase from when I was late 14 to late 15 . I only really wore ripped jeans, graphic tees , always a belt , with vans or converse that matched the shirt. I started getting of compliments on my style from peers.  I then had an art kid style phase late 15 - 16 years old . Very similar to before but I started adding different style jackets and pants. This was an important phase because I started adding different accessories like print socks and hair stuff.   Really quick 90’s inspired phase. I tried dressing like 90’s Britpop singers lol. A small step back I’d say.   Late 16 to current ( I’m seventeen ) changed my style over quarantaine . Asking questions here changed everything. I realized how much I loved my more dressy clothes and fell in love with the l’ecole des femmes clothes. I stopped following trends and went for mature more romantic and currently Victorian styles. Man repeller slightly masculine inspiration too. I wear skirts, tights , blazers, dresses, hats, neck scarves and blouses now. I also sold my years worth of converse and vans to buy oxfords and heeled dress shoes. Though my peers understand it a little less I have never been happier. Very confident in my style currently.    [Quick note - It may seem crazy to change my style so quickly but when your young you tend to go through clothes more quickly as you grow and teens tend to be more rough on clothes ]   Thank you for reading : )

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:Fashion is to style as reading is to wisdom.  If you only read the rainbow press you're not gaining wisdom.  Likewise if all your contact with fashion is the fast fashion catalogs you're not gaining style.  Still reading comes at different levels if you give a book by let's say Boudrillard to somebody who never read you're not doing them a favor.  Same with haute coture.  People need to already have a fashion framework to understand it.  Also if you read something and just vomit it out again verbatim at the next opportunity you definitely don't demonstrate any wisdom.  Same way if you copy a model's clothes you're not getting her style.  The way reading furthers wisdom is because you would try to integrate ideas of what you have read into your existing cognitive framework, and the effort you spend on your framework improves it.  Same with fashion, you integrate inspirations from what you see on the runway into your existing stylistish framework and the effort you spend on it improves it.	episode_done:True

text:Kibbe System and Body Inclusivity	labels:I've taken this quiz a dozen times in different platforms and my largest gripe is still the same. I'm not white and I'm really not sure where to put myself in this system, especially regarding facial features.   The descriptions say "exotic" or "not too exotic" features. I feel they are referring to more striking features, perhaps something a high fashion runway model may have (exaggerated lip shape, dramatic cheek bones, aquiline nose) but what do I do as an east asian person? My nose and eyes are smaller than the reference photos so I am automatically labeled "delicate"?   The label names are pretentious (flamboyent natural?) but I think there's potential. It could be a fun tool to chat about fashion. It could help people understand themselves better. It can't be worse than our current terminology of fruits and objects. It just needs to be expanded and updated.	episode_done:True

text:Craig Green Spring 2021 Menswear Collection	labels:Call me crazy, but Craig Green has never done anything for me.

Fashion-as-art-onto-itself stuff like 10, 17, 22 also looks good (and I guess it earns him his avantgarde cred), but doesn't filter down to the stores.  So there is this gap between fairly ordinary stuff and out-there artworks that he can't seem to fill. But in that gap lives the stuff I'd like to wear.

I've accepted the shit, and now it's time to...not move on because social distancing and wearing masks are still important, but I guess to just make do how best we can.   i've been feeling a lot more comfortable wearing weird clothes and experimenting with new things lately. i feel anonymous behind my mask, like i can get away with something i might not have been able to otherwise. and that is such a great feeling. not only is it liberating but i feel so confident and happy. i went grocery shopping last weekend in punk boots with high-waisted sparkly camo leggings and a cropped hoodie. i'd never have worn that out before! (at least maybe not during the day, and definitely not grocery shopping!!)  and it feels sort of great to feel that way now. yeah things suck but i'm wearing sparkly camo leggings right now and i feel great!  i'm hoping that when this is all over and things settle into a new normal maybe that experience will help others like it's been helping me. maybe people will be more comfortable being themselves, and feel less pressure to dress a certain way, and just do what makes them happy!	episode_done:True

Until then I’m also in the oversized T-shirt camp.
text:While I agree with you, I don’t think a large segment of of the world aspires (strongly at least) to dress vastly different from what makes sense to Wear in their climate. I don’t think there are guys who work at the factory and dress up in bespoke suits; they’re smart enough to discern context.  Even urbancomposition, a union electrician, is able to dress how he wants, and that means dressing for his context.   I also think figuring out your aesthetic is also finding how to mix context with what vibe you want. Cotton knitwear turtlenecks exist, so you can definitely wear a roll neck in LA (within reason). There are cotton flannel aloha shirts that are long sleeve.  You can have a linen over shirt or a flannel overshirt. Open weave, high twist wool suits exist as much as flannel and tweed. Flannel lined chinos are a thing.  Apart from drastic things like wanting a to wear outerwear, there are definitely ways to make a personal desired aesthetic work for your context.	labels:	episode_done:True

I got married in a pair of shiny Dr Martens with a tea length dress to show them off because I love the look so much!	episode_done:True
text:Madewell feels like it's a bit less expensive and has better sales than J. Crew but better quality as long as you're not just getting t-shirts there... I have Madewell sweaters that I've had for going on 5 years that are in regular rotation and look mostly new and yet my J Crew ones have holes or have stretched oddly.   Also seconding the sizing that someone else mentioned, I can order online with Madewell and almost guarantee that something will fit, but J Crew has been insanely inconsistent to the point where I just don't shop there anymore.	labels:> I have Madewell sweaters that I've had for going on 5 years that are in regular rotation   Ah... sigh... I had a handful of really awesome Jcrew sweaters purchased 20 years ago.... I grew out of them when I hit menopause but they were still going strong and I imagine someone thrifted them and is still wearing them to this day.....   Overall, quality has gone way way down everywhere.  ETA: as I think fondly of these sweaters, they were classic styles (cable knit t-necks) but in super rich, bright and vibrant colors. I miss those sweaters. I have not found anything close in 2 decades to replace, but as a petite my options are usually limited to black, grey, and just one trendy color that sells out super fast.	episode_done:True
text:What are your tips for being stylish when your weight fluctuates like crazy?	labels:I’m not exactly sure the details of your weight fluctuation but if you always fluctuate between 4-14, depending on your salary you could have 2-3 different closets for a size range.  Example, Closet 1: sizes 4-6 closet 2: sizes 8-10 and closet 3: sizes 12-14 and have truly just the basics in each closet (t’s, button ups, jeans, a jacket so on...) and then have a few “statement” pieces in each closet you know will look good on your body and make you feel good in that particular size range.    Depending on how minimal you want to be you could have at the minimum, 8-10 pieces in each “closet” (black and white T shirt, two jeans, two button ups, a couple of sweaters and 1-2 statement pieces.  With all three closets maybe 30 items?).  You could have accessories (purses, scarves, jewelry and shoes) that would always fit with each closet as well, which you probably already have.  Hope this helps!	episode_done:True

text:Sweats and Hoodies	labels:In defence of sweatpants (the comment I was responding to got deleted but I spent a few minutes typing a response on my phone so didn’t want to just delete what I typed):  I can certainly see where you are coming from in regards to sweatpants. I can’t (or haven’t yet at least) worn them outside because I’m too concerned about what other people think and self-conscious (which is ridiculous in the grand scheme of things). I think part of the draw for me is how unbelievably effortless and confident some of these fits are. The impossibly laid back styling that Japanese magazines like popeye, cluel and fudge for some reason really interests me. To me these fits aren’t all exactly what I’d like to replicate, but I think they give me some useful tips in dressing down some coats and jackets which can often come across as too formal.	episode_done:True
text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:For trousers/ pants I'd go with 2-pleat or ghurka trousers, both are high-waisted and look similar to what are featured in your general fashion board, actually I can see there are definitely Ghurka trousers in there. Same with Herringbone wool vests. Just by learning the names of the garments you'll have an easier time finding good brands.   The flecked suit you linked with the filson looking bag looks like Our Legacy's Midnight Sheep Jacket/Trousers from 2012. Good luck finding the exact thing, if you want to try grailed, Marrkt or ebay depending on where you live. Otherwise just include search times like "flecked" or "nep".  A lot of the clothing in the general fashion board looks to me like vintage workwear. I don't know what your budget is like but if you want to put a lot of money into it then brands like Belafonte, RRL and Pherrows might be quite good.   For the avant garde "Unique" stuff you have going on, try Rick Owens, Damir Doma, Julius, Number (N)ine, ann demeulemeester, and spend enough time in that circle and you'll figure out what you like
text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:Not buying Uniqlo was super hard this Aussie winter, because their thermal underwear is so good and so well priced.

text:Hats - discussion	labels:I don't know anything about "hat energy" but I know that hats, like hair, look best when they're shaped, colored, and styled in a way that suits your face and outfit.  The bolder the hat, the more obvious it may be if you don't know what you're doing, but even with a more understated hat, a clumsy choice is going to be pretty obvious.  I mean, it's *on top of your head.*  I wear a lot of hats and I've been told I wear them well, but I dress in vintage style so I have outfits that are made to be worn with hats, a pretty good frame of reference in terms which hats to wear with which outfits.  More recent maintstream fashion is really not styled to be worn with hats, so fitting a hat in there requires a bit of crafty innovation, and it probably requires reducing your range of hats to the most basic casuals; floppy sunhats, berets, cabbies, beanies and baseball caps.  Each of those styles has an existing set of visual conventions:  While you don't necessarily *need* the whole tweed jacket and oxford shoe getup to pull off a cabbie, for example, taking some queues from that genre of style will help contextualize the cabbie in a way that makes it less jarring to look at.	episode_done:True

text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:In the Before Times I would host one or two per year--I would make a facebook event and invite maybe 20 people (and just text friends who didn't have social media) and I'd usually get around 10 folks that showed up. I usually served mimosas and encouraged people to bring hors d'oeuvres so that it was also a little brunch gathering too. Some of the pieces I got from those have given me the most mileage over the years, and often they're items I never would have thought to look for!   I don't know if I'd do the digital ones, feels more like thrifting given the shipping cost and these days I prefer to buy secondhand via poshmark and whatnot since I am better able to find exactly what I'm looking for. Personally I'd be comfortable right now with an in person swap that takes place entirely outside (with mask required to use the bathroom) with a very small group of people I know, but I don't want to put pressure to do that on anyone else so I've just donated my clean-out clothes. Plus half the fun is trying something on and having your friends help you decide to keep it or leave it, and I don't know how I'd make that work outdoors. God I miss pre-2020...

text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I'm autistic and I have a lot of sensory issues so I can relate. I've found that wearing a layer underneath other things helps. For example, I have uniqlo leggings and a long-sleeve undershirt that I know I like the feeling of against my skin, so if I want to wear a sweater that's kind of scratchy or something else similar I'll just wear an undershirt that protects me. Another thing that helps me is tight sleeveless undershirts tucked into my jeans/skirt/bottom half whatever so that my shirt and waistband don't rub against my skin. (edit: I don't know if this will work in warmer climates, it works where I'm from because it's cold pretty much all year)  I also have a strict policy of not buying things that I know I'll find uncomfortable (and that I don't have a workaround for), wishing that maybe this time it will work. Because it won't, I'll just wear the thing out once and feel bad the entire time and then feel guilty for never wearing it again. If I find something that I really love, I cling to that and try to find similar things in the future and things that will complement those items.	episode_done:True
text:I'm convinced that there's something deeper than just boho styled, edgy, punk, professional styled etc. that we find ourselves liking, that creates our style.   Like music. There's something deeper than simply genre that makes me like a song. It's not genres that define my music taste. It's a combination of all my songs I like that creates my taste.	labels:My favorite songs blend two distinct genres together, like metal and synthwave (with a sprinkle of rap?!). And my style I can't have distinct very well, never straight up punk, never fully professional (I firmly believe I am a professional because I work professionally - they can take my badass spreadsheets and perfect grammar, but they will also get my dyed and shaved hair and eclectic clothing). I have to blend them because there's so much I want to express! Yes, I am punk/emo, glam, neon, normcore all at once. I was probably inspired by my early childhood fascination with Queen, and then Danger Days as an adult. Eclectic doesn't even begin to cover it!	episode_done:True
text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:Why would it be tonedeaf? This is kind of a U.S.-centric view. Not everyone in the world is still struggling with COVID, and a lot of the rest of the world isn't nearly as casual as America is, fashion-wise.   Call me crazy, but I'm tired of shapeless billowy clothing in earth tones, and I am READY for some structure and interesting textures. All summer has been about beige and washed out green and brown linen, let's see something else.   Plus, it's a weird take anyway, because high fashion doesn't really target loungewear, either way. Do we really expect major fashion houses to all abandon blazers and leather pants and start showing PJs and sweatpants on the runway?   Others have already pointed out that these collections have been designed months in advance, but consider another point - fashion has always been reactive. When forced to stay inside and only wear sweatpants for 6 months, people will rebel and start daydreaming and longing for the opposite. This pandemic was always going to inspire a sort of glam rock aesthetic, imo. BRING IT.
text:How do I feel sexy at home in winter?	labels:Not so much an outfit thing, but I took burlesque lessons in the fall, and along with a performance, came some great accessories: fishnets, heels, sparkly panties and bra, and gem covered PASTIES.

text:I love the eye for clothing that will fit with a weight fluctuation -- especially since I am now trying to be a bit more conscious of that! Do you have any particular examples of items that have worked well for you?  I think part of my problem is that the silhouettes that used to work for my pear/hourglass body now do not at all with a bigger stomach, and it's slow to figure out what will. The other part of the issue I'm finding is that clothes quality and silhouette fit is a challenge in plus sizes for me, even with brands I trusted before. I'm having issues with things riding up or sliding down over time even when they seemed my proper size.	labels:I’m also an hourglass/pear! In terms of oversized fits, I made sure everything I bought hit me at my smallest spot so that it looked correct for my shape. For example, I bought an oversized cashmere sweater, and it ends mid thigh. I wear it with tight pants (I often follow the baggy top/loose bottom vice versa) and a shoe with a heel to balance it out. The sweater is big enough to fit a huge weight range and still look good. Oversized is in, and I think it looks trendy.   In terms of plus size clothing, I haven’t yet ventured into that because I stuck to brands that offered already oversized clothing. The sweater I mentioned is Ben Taverniti (bought on deep discount) and was already marketed as oversized, so I bought the biggest size and it fits great. It’s an easy way to not have to find new brands or learn how to style yourself with plus sized clothing.	episode_done:True

text:Was coming here to say this as well. I recently moved from the Midwest to Florida and my body adjusted pretty quickly to the higher temps here. It’s my first winter and I find myself still wearing my warmest wool and cashmere sweaters, winter coat, and gloves. It’s all relative, so a 30F degree drop day to day is going to feel cold regardless of if you started at 90F or 60F. I would also recommend trying to wait a year if you can before purging. I think I could safely purge my snow pants if I wasn’t planning on using them when I visit my parents. It’s also hotter longer here though, so I could definitely reduce my sweaters by 20% (the ones I reach for last anyway) to make room for more hot weather clothing. Hope this helps and good luck with your move!	labels:In regards to the snow pants: I personally would definitely find a way to store stuff like that if you like to travel or visit family. I have always lived in southeastern Texas but my husband and I tend to be able to travel when it is winter up north and I *definitely* have super cold weather (for me) items I only break out when I travel. Even though they only get used once a year or less, it is worth it to have for me.	episode_done:True

text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I think the size of your wardrobe is going to depend on your climate, job, hobbies, and general lifestyle. I have a lot more clothing than that. I also live in a place with four seasons. I have outdoorsy hobbies that require some tougher clothes. I can‘t wear my casual clothing to work (and I’m also holding onto some more professional clothing from a past job in case I return to that field). I don’t have a lot of disposable income either, so I always keep things like dress pants even though I never wear them in my everyday, because I can’t afford to go shopping when interviews and funerals come up.  For instance, I probably have at least 15 dresses alone, once you count all the strappy sundresses, nice work dresses, wool sweater dresses, the cocktail dresses, and the evening gown that’s in the back of my closet - and everything in between.  I swap out my clothing with the seasons and have one closet that I share with my husband, so I try to be judicious about what I keep, while giving myself grace that I don’t need to get rid of something just because I don’t wear it regularly.

text:I think of how most people used to work physical jobs all their lives, and as they aged, their bodies would be shaped by that work - whether muscular, sinewy, bent, etc.  Nowadays though, honestly the dad bod is the same thing.  I'm older than the average redditor and I think of all the people I've known who would rather be moving around more, but have spent decades at a desk because that's what our economy is and because they love and want to care for their families.  That work shapes their bodies in a different way.  My dad went from young & chiseled to old & paunchy as he worked and paid for most of our house, food, education, etc.  So this whole "REAL work vs desk work" thing hits a little hollow for me.  I do think that exploring the sociology behind trends can be very interesting - perhaps we ARE pining for the time when we wore chore jackets to do chores.  But while I'm pretty sympathetic to a lot of legit "haves/have nots" type discussions, this article doesn't hit the mark for me.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:If the heel height is graded for size the angle of the footbed should remain constant between sizes.   IME wearer weight, fitness, and tolerance for discomfort play a more significant role than anything else. I’m 176cm, IT38, wear heels more than is probably good for me, and can comfortably manage a 100-105mm pump sans platform to dinner, and 85mm or so for days at the office if needed. With an enclosed wedge or block heel style I can easily do ten miles of walking at the same height, more with alcohol ;) I’m a former rock climber and lifelong endurance athlete, so discomfort and chafing are not foreign to me. Even the worst heel is much more comfortable than trying to jam a thin crack! I have former dancer friends who report a similar experience, while other less grin-and-bear-it types find anything more constrictive than Uggs unbearable.   I drop weight in the late summer and early fall for races, and even the 2-3kg shift makes a huge difference in comfort.	episode_done:True

Then, every two months, I'll have a leap week, where I don't wear any underwear at all, so that I can "reset" to the proper days of the week.   A flawless plan!

text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:I don't know about the other ladies out there, but for me there's no magic formula. In my humble opinion, I look good because I take the time to really plan out my outfit, hair, shoes, etc. It really is just practice, repetition, and routine. If it seems daunting to you, here are some smaller steps you can take:  1. Use a website to organize your thoughts - like Pinterest.  2. A lot of department stores have looks and outfit ideas when you are looking for products! It's a great way to go from - 'oh that dress is cute' in a vacuum to figuring out an outfit around it.  3. Practice makes perfect.  4. Practice makes perfect.  5. Try to make one part of your outfit really satisfying to yourself if it seems to much to do the whole thing. For example pick a bag that goes well with your dress. That way, even if your makeup/shoes don't work as well with the outfit you don't get worried about not having the perfect look. You'll still be happy with part of it and you can build from there for next time!  Sometimes, I try to do the 'just woke up but looking fresh effortlessly' look but I don't know if it's actually successful, lol.

text:Using Pinterest to Help Find Your Style (or: how to tell Pinterest it is no longer 2012)	labels:Great tips, I definitely have not been using the "More Ideas" button to its full potential.    I've been trying to pin fashion and style again, and I find I really miss the website Polyvore.  I never used it, but the ease with which other people made outfits and shared them meant that there was always something new to pin.    I follow a few fashion bloggers who seem to be popular, but I sometimes forget the work that goes into doing a blog post, styling things just right, taking the photos, etc.  Not to mention buying the clothes!  With that old Polyvore website, users were pushing out complete outfits everyday.  I hope something like that comes back around again soon, because I found the flat lay design of the pins easy to identify with.  With real people or models, I start to worry about whether something would work with my proportions, what kind of style tips they're using, etc	episode_done:True

text:Is anyone into MBTI? Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels:INTJ.

Everything is solid color; some color blocking when I am feeling adventurous. Everything I wear in public fits well, and any structured piece gets tailored. I like nice fabrics, and the clothing \*must\* make \*me\* look good.  If I could get away with it, everything in my closet would be navy (or at least a dark color). After being accused many times of wearing the same outfit multiple times a week, I have learned to add in flashes of color/accessories to make it clear that yes I am indeed wearing a different outfit than yesterday thanks.
text:Fashion Inspo Albums: Bold Feminine Professional, Feminine Dapper, and Flamboyant Androgynous Overlord	labels:Feminine Dapper, short of wearing ties, is actually precisely the look I prefer to wear in Medical School.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 13, 2020	labels:Heyo,   I'm looking for some chino pants and am mostly concerned about the material.   Around a year ago, I bought some RSQ chinos and they were great, I liked the material, the fit (slim straight) was just right, and the cost was worth it ($45 a pair, BOGO 50% off)!   I decided to buy some recently and despite the website (Tilly's) saying they were the same fit/style, they felt off. The material isn't what it used to be I guess despite having the same ratio (97% cotton/3% cotton), it feels thinner. The pants also feel more loose on me, I made sure to order the same fit but I guess that changed too.   I'm interested in any recommendations where the pant material definitely felt nice and worth the asking price.   As for my price range, I wouldn't feel right spending more than $50 per pair as I'm just a college student.	episode_done:True

text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:For me, (retired, age 75) real leather bags are not an investment I would make now. In the past I was able to find excellent vintage Coach bags at consignment shops at a great price. One of these is still in rotation. My current favorite bag is “pleather” cost $15.00 new, and has good zippered pockets. It actually looks decent and definitely classier than the price would suggest. The chief advantage of this bag is that it’s durable and waterproof when set down in rain or snow. One drawback of both real leather and faux leather bags is they’re heavy.  A wonderful alternative to both real and vegan leather is nylon, such as Baggalini or Haiku brands.  Light weight, practical sizing, fun colors and quality construction. Just not waterproof enough for winter wear where I live! Fun question 👍🏽	episode_done:True

For example, that jacket accentuates the model's waist, is a good length in the arms, flatters their neck, and has a lot of interesting structural details and textures. The idea for me isn't baggy for bagginess sake, but usually some interesting structure or contrast in tandem with a more fitted piece or the natural outline of my body.	episode_done:True

Even just for an hour or two on your day off then hang them up again in the closet 3) Do you love to look at dresses or wear them? I really like to look at high heels, but I just don't buy them because they make me uncomfortable. If the dresses are making you uncomfortable, then maybe they're not really "you." Maybe you just enjoy collecting them?

If I love something but I'm either not able to afford it or just not ready to pull the trigger, I take a photo of myself in the item, a photo of the store tag, and a photo of the tags on the clothing (especially any tag with a style number). I spent 3 years looking for a specific out of my budget Paige denim jacket that I tried on at Nordstrom Rack by scouring ebay, etsy, poshmark, etc.   Last month I finally found the exact jacket (confirmed by the style number and tag information) on Poshmark in excellent shape for a great price. Unfortunately in those 3 years I've gained a bit more weight than I realized and it's a bit tighter than my original try on photos, but still wearable!

text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Confidence usually comes as a result of doing things. Part of this is trying new things and facing the fact that you might make mistakes; and that's okay, because it's a learning experience. It is not a crime to buy something and realise later it's not for you. Everyone does it.   Some people don't like the idea of making mistakes, so they try and protect themselves and the people they love from them. Sounds like your mother is like that. But at the end of the day, your clothes are for you to wear and wash. Her opinion is just an opinion. The only way you'll know is by wearing the clothes, washing the clothes and seeing how YOU feel about it.	episode_done:True
text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:From a logical perspective, it makes a lot of sense and this system would work for most people. I think everyone naturally has a different idea of what "on par" means to them given their budget and taste and there's a saying that the value of a piece is what the buyer is willing to pay for it. Sometimes there will be those pieces that just speak to you regardless of the price and while those are a rarity, I would like to see that incorporated into this system. This is more true when you start going up the scale where fashion becomes more of an art form instead of "clothes". For me, I would pay $1000 for a Craig Green jacket because I love his work and it speaks to me on a deeper level like a '97 Honda NSX would; to me the experience is worth the money. While the numbers are important, to match your golf analogy, it's still a game to have fun.

text:My take on this is that it’s easier for Moncler, a premium/high fashion brand to venture into street wear realm with collaborations, than to elevate SI, a streetwear/sort of techwear brand into high fashion - where Moncler operates. I also love how Moncler is pretty selective with who they collaborate with, and on that note, I’m weary of the route Arcteryx (one of my favorite brand for outdoor wear) is going with their recent collaboration with Palace. My fear is they diverge away from their outdoor focus and become another The North Face. But there is still hope - there’s apparently a Jil Sander x Arcteryx in the works.	labels:	episode_done:True

Beauty that gives you energy.”   That speaks pretty directly to how I’m trying to navigate fashion right now. I’m not exactly going out anywhere, but I try to wear clothes that make me really happy to be awake and doing things. And I’ve been consuming a lot of fashion media, history, shows, etc because some clothes—including a lot of these!—are so engaging even just over the screen.

text:I like it precisely because it looks slightly unfinished or unconsidered. Harry Styles has a really intense stylist and it’s vogue, there is absolutely no chance that these outfits were not considered to death by a bunch of really knowledgeable people.   He is definitely not meant to look pretty, and to me that’s part of the point. He’s just ... wearing a dress. It doesn’t even really look feminine per se, which I guess is what you’re reacting too. I think the point was really to not associate the dress with femininity, but to just treat it as another piece of clothing. That’s kind of how he deals with his sexuality: he studiously avoids making any statements whatsoever.   I think the place that I see something historical is not in the dress but in the fact that it’s a vogue cover. I don’t know if this was a one time thing or if vogue is going to now be more gender diverse with their cover models. To me that’s the question: is the point that he is a feminine man or rather that Vogue can set these categories aside on one of their covers, which is a really culturally significant object.  This made waves precisely because it was a Vogue cover. He has worn dresses before without this reaction. But it doesn’t clarify vogue’s position on gender really. My sense is that to they will occasionally feature male-identified models on their cover, and just generally observe more fluid norms around gender. In a way Harry is just the tool for Vogue to make a big move within their own history, maybe...	labels:Thanks for that response. I can totally see how my angle was gendered. I was projecting my personal aesthetic and not considering the greater statement. I’m glad it resonates with you both symbolically and in the visual presentation. I love conversations like this.

You can often find like new or barely used pairs. The orthotic models often go for under $50 used in my experience (I sell used dress shoes online).   I can help find you a pair.

And the way the fabric drapes and flows as you walk.	episode_done:True
text:Riches to rags: The myth of sustainable fashion (The Financial Times).	labels:The whole 'sustainable' tag always bothered me. It be came the solution to the supposed fast-fashion consumer culture that was extreme with companies like Forever21.  Forever21 flew too close to the sun and now have filed for chapter 11. Some companies like H&M saw the writing on the wall and has a made pivot to 'sustainability' marketing in their products and have since been successful.    Now I see the word 'sustainable' tossed everywhere, Instagram, TikTok, in higher volume, the marketing has changed but the culture hasn't.

text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:Skiing is a strenuous sport, often done in a dangerous alpine climate. I wear technical gear: bright loose waterproof jacket and pants for visibility and mobility, wicking warm base layers, balaclavas and goggles to protect my eyes and skin, a helmet, and a backpack or fanny pack with an emergency kit.   After skiing, I strip off the outer layers and walk around in uggs, tights, and turtleneck.   You know what? I 100% blend in. I don't look better or worse than the hundreds of other people who have just come down from the mountain. This is why people specifically wear bright colors. Your party will be able to identify you at a distance from the specific colors you're wearing.   I think ski/apres ski style is to skiing what cottage core is to farming/homesteading. It's an aesthetic for people who don't actually do it.   If you like the look and aren't interested in skiing, then look into some New England heritage preppy looks. The bean boots, scandi wool sweaters, thick stretchy stirrup pants, fluffy trimmed accessories, and parkas may appeal to you. Uniqlo has some cute stuff in their recent collab that has that cozy lux vibe. Moncler and Gorsuch are some OG European ski fashion wear companies. You could look into those for inspiration.   But definitely don't try to go skiing without a waterproof pant and jacket combo. You will have a terrible time, given how much you will likely fall. (Assuming that you're a beginner.)
text:People who work in the fashion industry - what do you wear?	labels:I worked as a household assistant for a fashion designer and I agree- most her team (and the household staff) wore neutrals and very understated outfits. We all put more detail into making sure that everything looked nice (was clean, ironed, no pet hair, rolled or tucked in) and a lot of my co-workers would have pieces tailored- especially things like pants to ensure that they looked put together.	episode_done:True
text:What bag(s) are you eying for Spring/Summer 2021?	labels:Anyone have a wandler bag and can shed some light on the quality?   I am majorly lusting after the Bvlgari serpenti bags. They are fairly inexpensive for the quality of leather (compared to a chanel/gucci). I was in store a while back and they are seriously even more beautiful in person. They had a bubblegum pink one with the serpent on it and I want it so badly! I highly recommend everyone google their bags as I think they are less popular than they should be. I also like that they are less popular because they look like a super good quality bag but only those “in the know” so to speak, will know where it is from!   I am also curious about hunting season bags. They have piqued my interest a bit as well.

text:General Discussion - December 10, 2020	labels:tfw your wife lists something on her gift list that you already bought for her
text:Exactly, a matter of personal taste. I grew up with two billionaire's daughters (both going back at least three generations of extreme wealth), one would never wear (and still doesn't) any obvious logos or luxury designer items, the other would wear head-to-toe Chanel on the regular- she was gifted her first Chanel bag at age ten. She didn't care that "classy" people aren't supposed to wear one designer head-to-toe. When your inheritance is in hundreds of millions, you don't give a fuck what "classy" is supposed to be. That's for upper-middle class trying to be upwardly mobile.	labels:>When your inheritance is in hundreds of millions, you don't give a fuck what "classy" is supposed to be.  Yes! 100% this. And honestly, I think everybody should not care and just wear whatever they want (as long as it's appropriate lol).	episode_done:True
text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:If you like skinny jeans, American Eagle are my favorite “affordable” (for me) jeans. I am tall, slender, and not very curvy and their “next level super high-waisted jegging” is my favorite. If you can spend more, my holy grail skinny jeans are the Good American Good Waist jeans. They’re super flattering, they hold in my belly, and they don’t get baggy in the waist even after multiple wears. To extend the life of your jeans, try to wash them as little as possible and keep them out of the dryer! If your jeans have any kind of elastic in them, the heat of the dryer basically melts it over time so your jeans don’t look as good or last as long.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 08	labels:I'm looking to get a trench coat/overcoat before winter enters full swing, but I have a problem... I'm a tad skinny, 5'10" 130lbs. I'm not quite  wiry, but I'm getting there and this makes finding anything like what  I'm looking for a bit difficult.  While in highschool (I was even smaller back then) I wore a coat by London Fog and was able to make it work and probably could again but, it would be nice to be able to wear something a little less baggy as I won't *always* be layered up.  Does anyone have any recommendations in the sub $300 (my other limiting factor) range?... beyond simply getting bigger (I figured that one out  believe it or not). On a side note; what's london fog's quality like  these days?	episode_done:True

It's a matter of semantics about the title and core theme of the article. If you can't explain what he means by "cold" then I don't know what the article is about. If he means "neutral" the article is *much more confusing*.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:Short of getting a bit of insider info, I think the only way to really have success at those stores is to browse them at least once a week (probably twice).  My aunt tends to go every other day and finds some amazing stuff…because she goes *every other day*.  She says it doesn’t take her long because she’s so familiar with their stock, but it still seems exhausting to me.  (As opposed to spending three hours scrolling through Poshmark in bed every night…)
text:Shopping my own closet for the perfect tee	labels:I wish more people still did this type of "help me with my closet" post. It used to be semi trendy on this sub a few years ago and I loved browsing through peoples wardrobes. I thought maybe it would come back with the YouTube trend "trying everything on in my closet" but no :(  Anyways, it's crazy to see how different shaped every t-shirt is considering they are all so the same.

text:How are the Veja trainies? I keep eyeing those up	labels:I have the V-lock sneakers. I bought my first pair \~2 years ago and replaced them with a newer pair this summer. The only ones were in wearable condition, they just were very worn and dirty looking because the shoes are white and stuff gets into the velcro. I wear those as a backup now. Vejas are not the most comfortable sneakers ever—they take a while to break in and aren't made for running/sports. But once you replace the insole and break them in, the leather softens up and they really do last. The seams of the sneakers got dirty, but the white leather itself did not scuff or stain despite heavy use. The soles are very thick and only seem to have minor wear after a year of very frequent wear—usually I will destroy sneaker soles within a few months. Veja leather sneakers are great for walking around cities and just throwing on as casual shoes. They also seem pretty weather resistant and are comfortable in most weather. I definitely recommend them as long as you are prepared for them to be uncomfortable at first! And definitely replace the insole.

text:General Discussion - November 22, 2020	labels:So I've been lurking / participating here for about a month and I think I have a good feel for the types of posts that generally end up on this sub, common opinions etc.  I see this same pattern - posts that align pretty well with what's discussed in WAYWT/Discussion threads, like the Rick Owens post from today or the coats post from last week, getting thousands of votes and comments from people posting things like "he looks like he's shit his pants", and "nobody would wear this".  Why do people who spend their time lurking this sub, silently absorbing whatever opinions and discussion, decide to come out of the woodwork to post _this_ hot take? Really - you had to put some thought and energy into typing that out. If that's what you think, why are you here?  I just don't understand. At least the post-meta-discussion here is good for a few laughs.

text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:I recommend doing two things:   1 - look at your current wardrobe and pick out what outfits you consider your favorite. Ask yourself why you gravitate to those items. Is it a color? A theme? A certain look? Those are some clues to your style.   2 - if you follow fashion bloggers or general fashion posts, ask yourself why you follow them. There is a likelihood that you follow them because you like their look/style.    Now, with more insight into what style you currently have and styles you aspire to have, you may get closer to defining your style. Don't feel too bad if you can't explicitly name it (ie: preppy, vintage, casual, etc). Your personal style is more nuanced and probably a combination of multiple categories.

text:When your personality and aesthetic don't quite match?	labels:I’m going to echo what others have said - this is *his* problem, not yours. It seems like to some extent he’s expressing that he knows what your “true style” is better than you - when more likely it’s just about what he likes best. I’m going to apply the benefit of the doubt here too... but I think you need to express to him that you’re happy with how you dress.  My partner once said early on that I dressed too colorfully for the area where we live - I was pretty firm that I was happy with how I dress and it’s never come up since then. In the past few years he’s even come to encourage my habits.   It’s someone reflecting their feelings on to you - hopefully when you let them know you don’t feel the same way, they’ll understand and their point of view will change. If it doesn’t, it’s probably not a good sign.	episode_done:True

text:"Can people just hate fashion again" - Synecdoche When Talking about the "Industry" Discussion	labels:> Should spaces & industries for fashion lovers, clothes lovers, and people that have to wear clothes be completely separate?  I don’t think that any of these groups should be completely separate however I do find them all being lumped into the same spaces very frustrating as someone who does love fashion as a form of art and creativity.  I like harsh and blunt constructive criticism in pretty much all areas of life and I most certainly want it for my outfits as well. I want to hear what other fashion lovers and artists think of my colour choices, proportions, textures, fit, etc. and be able to refine those things and really flex my creative muscles when creating an outfit. Instead, many fashion spaces are dominated by ‘you do you hun!’ and ‘so long as you like it, that’s all that matters!’ which is great for someone *who has to wear clothes* and doesn’t actually care about fashion but joins fashion spaces because they feel some obligation as a woman to care about it but... those spaces just become unhelpful and bland for those who really love fashion and want to get better at it.  I’ve been an off and on follower of FFA for a few years and I feel like it’s definitely dominated by the “people who wear clothes” group and unfortunately it limits the amount of critique that is acceptable to give.
text:I totally agree, but to be honest one caveat I find when shopping online is that if it's multiple materials that's usually (but not always) a sign of it being higher quality. 100% polyester is sketch unless it's like intended to be shiny sports-clothes material, but 99% polyester 1% something else is more likely to be a bit better for some reason	labels:Agree!

If you have broader shoulders and narrower hips (inverted triangle), a broad-shouldered jacket and narrow pencil skirt will accentuate those attributes; that may be why you like them.

In fact, I reject the idea that I should want to look taller. Maybe all those 5'7 women should be taking advice on how to make their legs look as stubby as mine. <--Obviously a joke but to make a point. How stupid is it that I should feel like my natural body is something to correct?  I'm an old woman, lol, and over the course of my life I have never found that my stubby legs (that I was once self-conscious about) have kept me from career advancement or from finding people who thought I was beautiful and wanted to have sex with me, so what's the freaking problem?  Fuck conventional figure flattery.  That being said, of course there are things I think look better on me than other things and I tend to wear the things I think look better in ways I think look better most of the time.  Except when the comfort or beauty of a garment is so outstanding it overrules that.  Thanks for coming to my TED talk.  There are cookies on the table in the back.

I hate social gatherings, and have only ever attended one wedding in my entire life. I even missed my brother's wedding earlier this year. I've never attended a funeral, but if it comes to it then I have an all black Adidas tracksuit ready to go.  So yeah... I don't think wearing all Adidas would work for everyone.

text:Somebody else loosing so much time to choose the right item to buy when looking for something? I feel it cost me more in time when I try to buy responsibly.	labels:A while back I was watching a YouTube video that mentioned the best way to learn about something is to make all of your passive entertainment geared towards that thing.  It was specifically talking about designer fashion, but I think it's something that can be applied to any kind of fashion.  Personally, I'm more of a shop local/thrift sort of person, but if I were to go out of my way to find a specific product, it would take a lot less time on my part because I follow people with a similar outlook.  The Youtubers I watch are concerned about buying ethically/in an environmentally conscious way.  Most people I follow on Instagram are about my height/size.  When I'm watching TV I'll open up Depop and to my lists when something catches my eye.  About half the work is done for me, and when I need something, I spend a lot less time actively searching.  I started a wardrobe overhaul last year so I do get how sometimes it can feel like you'll never find exactly what you're looking for, but maybe finding some people doing the same can help.	episode_done:True

Alas. The styles changed just a bit, and now I can't find the plain white tanks and tees I want because the sleeves and the neckline and the length are all just a tiny bit off. Thank you for reading along, this not-a-real-problem is very frustrating at times.

text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)?

I forsee a similar trend as I also have gotten way more playful and outgoing with my \[desired\] style. Makes sense to me

I used to abide by that idea 100 percent when I had no confidence and felt I needed to try to look as skinny as possible - because that’s what figure flattering means. F that.

They are fairly inexpensive for the quality of leather (compared to a chanel/gucci). I was in store a while back and they are seriously even more beautiful in person. They had a bubblegum pink one with the serpent on it and I want it so badly! I highly recommend everyone google their bags as I think they are less popular than they should be. I also like that they are less popular because they look like a super good quality bag but only those “in the know” so to speak, will know where it is from!   I am also curious about hunting season bags. They have piqued my interest a bit as well.

For when I'm at a new job that involves being in an office all day, travelling through snow and sleet and rain and sunshine 😄 Right now I'm working from home and my outfits are pajamas and slippers.  Also, there was a lot of comfort shopping too, this year has been brutal and painful. If some new boots can make me smile for a week, it's worth it.

Yes, buying clothes secondhand is best, but buying something new and wearing it out is pretty damn close.

Inevitably the comments use the word "hipster" as an insult when it is so clearly a euphemism for "fag".    The whole thing is so gross and tiring. I guess that can be said for lots of stuff in 2020.

text:Where do you get good quality, legit wool sweaters that won't rip/shrink after washing?	labels:Check out soak detergent for handwashing sweaters. But personally I like Lord and Taylor cashmere. At the end of the season it goes in deep sale. Also easy to find secondhand.
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I definitely feel this. I have a large butt/hips and do often find that they impact the shape of silhouettes that I'm trying to wear. I'm very inspired by menswear as well and dress fairly androgynously. I tend to modify menswear silhouettes slightly so that I can achieve something similar. I personally feel much better in high waisted pants with a tucked in shirt/sweater - somehow I feel like it emphasizes my lower body less and gives me a sleeker line from top to bottom, so when I'm drawing influence from menswear I tend to modify it with a higher waistline. I also make sure that I'm defining my upper body with tops that are more structured around the shoulder. Drop shoulders don't play well with me.  I find with these tweaks I'm able to both find a nice balance where I don't feel like I'm fighting against my body and I'm also able to invoke more masculine references and play with most silhouettes I like. Although it did take me a lot of trial and error to figure out it out.	episode_done:True

text:Thank all of you	labels:So a number of people are telling you not to buy a bunch of AE shoes because they are “entry-level” and that you may eventually want to move up in price. This is true, but consider that anyone saying this has become a hobbyist who appreciates and collects high-end footwear, and therefore retroactively views AE as a gateway drug that led them to discover a new hobby. This implies a linear progression from spending $350 on shoes — an amount 98% of men would find insane — to eventually spending $1000+ on shoes, which is completely bonkers to all but a very small number of people.  Definitely wait a bit and avoid buying a dozen pairs of AEs too quickly. But also consider that if AE makes you happy and your goal is to amass a rotation of multiple good-quality shoes in different styles and colors, it’a perfectly acceptable to avoid leveling up. You don’t *have* to keep buying progressively more expensive stuff, and can instead enjoy what’s in a price tier you’re comfortable with.

The window for wearing the basic clothing you've suggested is huge, you're not going to be perceived as cute when you're in your 40s but none of the basic clothing you've suggested is going to make you look like a desperate old man, and your tastes will probably have changed by the time you get there anyway.	episode_done:True

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items are my Native American Turquoise jewelry and my cowboy boots. Just purchased a huge $900 squash blossom necklace and have worn it constantly. My boots range from $30 for a secondhand pair to $750 for custom made and none are worn more or less than the others.  When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was “saving for good”. Ironically, “good” apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I’m just out running errands.

I AM A POOR PERSON MASQUERADING AS A RICH PERSON!  And honestly, that's pretty much the most disgusting personality flaw one can have.

I had plenty of smaller crossbody bags in a similar size to the Stylist and wanted something a bit bigger that could hold a few more things for longer days out without being a giant handbag (a size of bag I don’t currently have) and also able to be used at work, which is why I settled on the Allegro.

text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:Hmmm ... Yes, but ...  I look at clothing as a cost-over-time  So an £80 pair of shoes that will last £8-10 years is 'par' because that's what I'm used to - a £300 pair that lasts 20 years is 50% over par at least  Likewise I have a £2 T-shirt from Primark that hasn't shrunk, pilled, nor gotten baggy after 5+ years - no other T-shirt is going to come close to that setting for par  People say you should buy 'quality' clothes that will last decades, but a £20 or £50 T-shirt will be just as ruined as the £2 one by a tear or stain, so buying 'over par' clothes can be financially ridiculous

text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:So, look, I don't want to tell you _not_ to do this, but if I've understood correctly you're looking at creating a bloodborne-inspired victorian/traditional wardrobe. There are elements of that style that have mainstream appeal today, high-waisted wool trousers being one example. However, when you take them in context with the more "interesting" elements you picked out it gives off serious cosplay vibes. Perhaps you should take the fact that the only places offering this sort of clothing are Etsy/cosplay stores as a hint that you should reconsider this idea.  You might be thinking, _what about the cyber goth vampire Rick Owens fits I see on this sub?_ It's a valid question. The key difference is that the style you're going for here has _such_ a strong association with cosplay and videogames and so little mainstream appeal that the number one association people are going to make is that you are cosplaying. Doubly-so if you're wearing cosplay-quality clothes from cosplay vendors. While the Rick Owens aesthetic may not have mainstream appeal it _is_ very accepted within fashion circles and _doesn't_ have that strong cosplay association.  So with that said my advice is to take what you've got and tone it down. Treat it like a high-fashion runway show and take inspiration from it instead of trying to recreate it 1:1. High-waisted trousers, great. Gaiters? Maybe just get some actual boots. Bloodborne-style woolen collars/scarves/hooded shawls? Wear a regular scarf that has an interesting shape or texture, or a shirt with a more exaggerated collar. Maybe the fact that you can't find retailers selling this kind of stuff is the limitation you need to make it work in the real world.  Or maybe I'm just talking complete shite and someone smarter than me can help you more. I hope that I've at least broken the ice and said what needed to be said so that people can try to constructively help you.

For that you can also "randomize" your outfits! Count how many tops and how many bottoms you have, then let something choose 2 numbers for you (Google has a random number generator when you search for "random number"). If you get, let's say, 8 and 3, take the 8th top and the 3rd bottom in you wardrobe, then try to make an outfit out of them by choosing a jacket, accessories, etc.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:The best advice I've ever heard about fashion was that (and I'm badly paraphrasing here) if you wear something more than once, it just becomes something you wear. If you wear a hat a couple times, you can be a "hat person". If you dress up often, you're a just person who dresses up.   It's cliché, but I feel like all about confidence. I have friends who like to dress up for all occasions, but nobody ever bats an eye because they just act as if their fully choreographed fit is a tshirt and jeans. People are almost never thinking about you as much as you think they are (you can google the "spotlight effect"). Also, I feel like wearing fun outfits around the house can help you get used to feeling "dressed up" in a casual environment, and is a good place to safely test-drive fun outfits.   I think there's a weird societal stigma against trying hard, which I think is so lame. It's cool to try hard if you want to try hard! I don't get why people feel the need to comment on how you're dressed. Honestly, I think that saying that it makes you happy is enough of a justification for being """"overdressed"""" (by their standards).   The last thing is think about all of those people you see dressed up on the street, where you think they look great, but you're too shy to say anything. When you're dressed up in a way that makes you feel good, the right people will notice, even if they don't say anything. The world is full of silent admirers!!	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:Skiing is a strenuous sport, often done in a dangerous alpine climate. I wear technical gear: bright loose waterproof jacket and pants for visibility and mobility, wicking warm base layers, balaclavas and goggles to protect my eyes and skin, a helmet, and a backpack or fanny pack with an emergency kit.   After skiing, I strip off the outer layers and walk around in uggs, tights, and turtleneck.   You know what? I 100% blend in. I don't look better or worse than the hundreds of other people who have just come down from the mountain. This is why people specifically wear bright colors. Your party will be able to identify you at a distance from the specific colors you're wearing.   I think ski/apres ski style is to skiing what cottage core is to farming/homesteading. It's an aesthetic for people who don't actually do it.   If you like the look and aren't interested in skiing, then look into some New England heritage preppy looks. The bean boots, scandi wool sweaters, thick stretchy stirrup pants, fluffy trimmed accessories, and parkas may appeal to you. Uniqlo has some cute stuff in their recent collab that has that cozy lux vibe. Moncler and Gorsuch are some OG European ski fashion wear companies. You could look into those for inspiration.   But definitely don't try to go skiing without a waterproof pant and jacket combo. You will have a terrible time, given how much you will likely fall. (Assuming that you're a beginner.)

text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:I think you can still look fashionable while ignoring heels etc.   I agree with you on heels, and my foot shape finds them quite uncomfortable, so unless they’re a platform or quite chunky (like with most booties), I just don’t do them.   Now, I personally love high waist (the higher the better, gimme that steve urkle shit 😂) but lower waist, softer fabrics, or even high quality leggings (like faux leather styles) will look much nicer than sweats.   Well-fitting basic t’s look great. They just need to fit properly across your shoulders and chest. Plenty of flat shoes exist that look nice. Vans, leather or leather-ish ballet flats, nice sneakers (e.g. New Balance or similar) with a well-tailored outfit.  Honestly a lot of it comes down to the fit of clothing, the FABRICS (I mean, put on anything pilled and it looks 🥴 immediately), and other styling elements like hair. Hair thrown into a ratty bun with sweats and uggs? Yeah I look sloppy. Straightened hair with joggers and vans? Now I look stylish! Ha.  ETA: that unfortunately body type also comes into play here. There have been quite a few posts detailing how basics look “timeless” and “stylish” on thin frames, and sloppy or unstylish on larger bodies. I thought I would throw this in there just in case, although I think most of my comments still apply regardless of body size!

Is it worth to buy clothing you won't wear until next year?	labels:I was going to get some work clothes but we're working back from home so I'll get some lounging around clothes.  I did buy some skirts and sweaters on Poshmark because at the time we were in the office.	episode_done:True

text:Pairing with a neutral is totally fair, but this album was intended to show us how we might step out of our comfort zones a little :)  As for the other two “don’t” pics, well, I still stand by the fact that both of those outfits are getting a bit dated lol!  maybe it’s the striped circle scarf and flats in the last pic or the yellow hobo bag and 2010’s accessories in the first pic that really place it in that time frame for me. While they wouldn’t look out of place in most cities, they’re not exactly fashion forward in my opinion.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Is anyone into MBTI? Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels:At one point on the INTP subreddit everyone was talking about how they wish they could wear a cape without it being seen as weird. I would interpret the INTP relationship to fashion as a little bit more nuanced than "drab and careless". I think the common theme is that INTPs don't generally care what others think - and so that can manifest on a spectrum from "wears whatever because does not care about their appearance at all" to "wears completely outlandish things because they care about their appearance but do not care at all what others think of it".      As an INTP myself I fall somewhere between the two. Like... I *want* fashion to be a higher priority for me, but when it comes down to it my attitude is more often just "whatever" because social pressure to look good  doesn't register to me nearly as much as it could.
text:This.   Our gear is made for the cold.  We have lots of items at resale shops because coats are fashion.         My personal favorite is silk long underwear.  It is lightweight and easy to wear under clothes.    Expect to wear a hoody indoors.  Heck, I like to port around my scarf indoors too.     Respect the cold and dont do dumb stuff.  When you go somewhere in a car dress like you will have an accident and need to walk a mile.  Do not jump into your car with shorts and boots just because you look cute.	labels:You don’t always need to dress like you are going to walk a mile. You can still be stylish in the winter. Just be prepared and make sure you have warm gear with you in the car in case. I wear heels to work, so I make sure I have a pair of boots in the car. For comfort and safety. Or I wear the boots and bring the heels and change at work. You aren’t banned from wearing anything. I have an ankle length coat so I comfortably wear dresses/skirts with tights most days. I also do have a blanket, hat and extra gloves in my car just in case, but I don’t let the cold stop me from wearing anything. You just have to make the proper modifications. I grew up in one of the snowiest, coldest places my whole life  but I love fashion and just make sure I am prepared.

text:I'll admit, I'm not gonna be mad, but I'm never gonna buy in. I dunno if they're the right terms, but the squared off corners are too brutalist and inelegant to me, and shoes with a formality level higher than a sneaker seem to need softness and elegance in my book.  That said, I think I've been less open-minded about shoes in general for a long time. I've got a laundry list of shoe/boots styles that I don't like but can't really articulate why.	labels:Footwear is probably where I’m most picky so I get the sentiment, it seems like it’s the easiest item of clothing to totally mess up. All that said the fact that only low end brands have been putting out(poorly designed) square toe shoes for the past couple decades now is probably a big reason why you have that perception, once you start seeing better designed versions of them it may change that opinion

text:>I think he means tonally neutral, bland, desaturated colors  I would argue that’s what cold means, while blue is generally cold, I don’t think cold means “more blue”, it’s more about the relative saturation and intensity of the color, basically you have to judge what makes a certain color warm or cold totally in comparison to other similar shades, not as a general sliding scale of “brown is warm, blue is cold, always”, though, like I said this is all a semi useable way of describing it.  Going back to the audio examples, I always see vinyl described as sounding “warmer” than digital, when I first heard albums I knew on vinyl my first reaction was “wow that sounds really different”, immediately followed by “wow, I _definitely_ wouldn’t describe that as warmer”, so, I do get the confusion	labels:Exactly, which is best exemplified when Simon talks about certain blues being warmer (more saturated) vs cooler (less saturated)	episode_done:True

Those are divided again into spring/summer and fall/winter (obviously there are overlaps, I'm ok with these.)   Dresses, blouses, blazers/jackets, skirts, and dress pants go on the hangers; tees, sweaters, and jeans are folded. Socks, underwears, and scarves go in the drawers. I also have a coat stand where I hang my worn-but-not-dirty clothes.

text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:People usually compliment clothes and items that stand out. It's usually not something that looks good, at least to ourselves.   I remember Karen from Karenbritchick, who often looks amazing in her clothes and designer items, talk about her most complimented item, and it's not the designer bags, cool clothes that she owns, but some wack, elaborate guitar strap for her bag.   So, our own gut feelings are important. Also, what looks good might not feel good.

text:Uh what? Domestic stuff is more expensive period. That's not meaning that it's bad, it's just reality. If you do manage to find something from America that's as cheap as a cheap Chinese item then that item was very likely made in similar conditions to what the sweatshop workers there do.   The sad truth is clothing takes a lot of effort to make and because America has had stagnant wages for decades that means that is getting harder and harder for people to afford even basic domestic clothing. It's still worth it if you can manage it, these domestic manufacturers are operating on super thin budgets with extremely small profits, they need any help they can get.  The real problem is Americans are broke as fuck despite working more than ever, being more productive than ever, in the richest country on Earth.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Casual Blazer Inspo	labels:Can't say that any of these work for me as I generally don't wear blazers of any kind, but there certainly were a lot of interesting looks here.

text:What brands do you recommend that are higher quality and can last longer?	labels:Here is a bunch of personal examples:  Norse Projects, A kind of Guise Red Wing boots, Asket, Aime Leon Dore, Ebbets Field Flannels, Mont St Michel, Portuguese Flannel, NN07  For example, I from Norse Projects I have a pair of Thomas Wool Flannel trousers and an Anton OCBD, both are like 7 years old and I wear them very regularly. They both still hold up extremly well. I can also really vouch for A kind of Guise, Asket & Ebbets Field Flannels.	episode_done:True
text:Fellow clothing trackers, what coveted items are you tracking now?	labels:A black monki dress with big buttons, midi length, slits on the side, pockets and a waist band. I bought one a year or two ago and it's my perfect dress for everything. I've been dying to get another one or, if I recall correctly, they also sold it in orange with some sort of print but I haven't found it so far	episode_done:True
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Also, this is a common rule, but no clothing that requires anything special to wear it - eg a shirt that only works when you switch around the bra straps of your convertible bra, a dress that requires shapewear to look how you want it to look, a wrap blouse that has to be pinned into place after you put it on, a shirt that requires another shirt underneath because it’s see-through - all of those are a no for me. If it doesn’t work with just my regular underclothing (except for choosing nude underclothing for light pieces) I won’t buy it - I just know by now I’m not going to make the effort to wear it when I could just put on something easier that I like just as much.

text:For the parents of girls	labels:I have three kids, one girl, one boy and one trans-boy (13, 10, 15) who still dresses fairly feminine. My kids have always been allowed to pick their own clothes and style them how they want. Sometimes I give them advice on their fashion choices which they are free to ignore. They love my style and frequently steal stuff from my closet.  We don't have a lot of body type discussions in regards to clothes, because I don't want that to be their focus. I want them to focus on creativity and enjoyment of their clothes. Plus for my trans kid, their hourglass figure is a stressor for them. If they are struggling to style something, I help them out.	episode_done:True

text:Tips for easily looking more modern/in style?	labels:Depends on what you have, what you like. Assuming you have basics you like, the easiest and quickest way to "modernize" is to get one top or bottom in the shape or color of the season, and a pair of shoes.  Right now loafers are having a moment, extra modern is ones with chunkier soles. Chunky knit tops are having a moment, particularly cardigans. So you can get a chunky knit cardigan, chunky loafers, and pair with jeans and you are more "current."   Or you can swap your normal jeans with a straight legged faux leather trouser and those same loafers.   I like to follow sites like Coveteur, Who What Wear, or the Zoe Report and read their trend roundups and adopt accordingly (for me that means after I have vetted it is the sort of trend I would like.)	episode_done:True

Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:i just feel like their price points are so high and the quality can be kind of mediocre. they’re stuck in a weird place where their pricing is too expensive for the average consumer who’s trained to expect bargains and too cheap for someone who buys luxury or higher end pieces.   even with their random extra 50% off sales, it’s still above what people expect to pay. but then again, madewell is thriving. (though i think that has more to do with being able to capture an on-trend aesthetic.)
text:yeah it's weird. in my experience with talking to people about this specific thing i feel like it's really clear that the reason they have trouble dating isn't really the height, it's usually bc of *at least* one pretty evident character flaw that overshadows their height. they might be really insecure (either about their height or something else), poorly groomed or dressed, or honestly just kind of disagreeable lol. the list goes on but you get it  from talking with my friends who date men i really don't think people care that much and it's not a problem for most people unless you make it one	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:I think that this really depends on what type of washing machine you have access to. If you have a modern, front loading machine, with multiple wash settings, you can relatively easily machine wash many “hand wash only” items. I’ve had varying results with top loaders or old front loading washers-I find them more rough on clothes. Most items do ok on a delicates cycle with cold water for both stages. I often wash sweaters on the wool setting (cold water, low spin) or soak my sweaters with euclean and spin dry-er in the machine before laying flat to dry. Most of the damage to clothes happens in the dryer IMO. Also, brands often put dry clean only or hand wash only because they haven’t tested the fabric for machine wash and want plausible deniability-thus many things can survive with machine wash cold and air dry. But your results may naturally vary based on the piece of clothing. I personally only buy stuff that I feel is very special that is not machine wash air dry safe. Otherwise I feel like laundry ends up taking too much of my life, and it isn’t worth it to me.

text:Ellen McArthur Circular Economy Report: by 2029 Resale is expected to be bigger than Fast Fashion	labels:Eh, I'm pretty skeptical about claims that fast fashion will die down any time soon. Especially this claim that resale will overtake it. How will that happen? Resale depends on new items being purchased. If people aren't buying as many new items, the stock at resale will drop. And if a ton of people are buying resale, the prices on the good stuff will continue to go up and result in a lot of people buying fast fashion because it's cheaper.  Fast fashion may not be high quality or eco-friendly, but it's inexpensive and offers a lot of variety, and that's always going to be in demand. Fast fashion won't die out unless a lot of governments put in strict regulations on labor and pollution and whatnot.	episode_done:True
text:What are you planning on getting rid of this year?	labels:The clothes I had to buy due to "Working during the pandemic and  the only food options being gas station and fast food." weight gain. (Plus losing the weight)  And not technically getting rid of entirely, but I kept some older graphic tees to either stretch over a frame like a canvas or turn into throw pillows. It's time I get that taken care of.  Kenneth Cole Reaction suede chukka boots that have no sole texture left.  I really need to go through my cables box and get rid of old cables I'll never use again.	episode_done:True
text:Topman is now a part of ASOS	labels:I just received an email myself from ASOS stating that the Topman brand is being brought under their website. I also had a couple of Topman items I had my eye on, and their website has been replaced with the "part of ASOS" message.  Generally not a problem for me; I only made an order with Topman once and it was because I had some vouchers to heavily reduce the price. I only considered Topman items when they were in the sale anyways.  Since I shop semi-regularly at ASOS, this change won't affect me too much. I'm not concerned about the uality of ASOS products either; they seem fine enough for what I need. I'd rather have a good quality item at a sensible price, than an excellent quality item at a much higher price than what I could possibly afford.	episode_done:True

text:Thanks for chiming in! I was reading your answers and felt like you were trying to convey something like that, but people had already had the image of sweaters and loungewear in their head so it was hard to communicate that.

It’s definitely a lot slower to build my closet this way, but I just want a closet that I love so I can eventually just “shop” my closet every morning instead of always feeling the need to add to it. For a lot of my high end pieces, I’ve been going for secondhand sites so I don’t have to worry about quality or authenticity. Personally, I don’t mind spending several hundreds of dollars on a pair of designer shoes that I know I’m going to love for the next 10 year (and are actually made to last that long) rather than cycling through low end finds all the time. But that’s just me.	episode_done:True

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:The clothes on the runway are designed to represent, as closely as possible, the idea and sentiment that the designer is using to inspire the new line.  It's analogous to the Platonic ideal. Because the ideas can be so abstract, so too must the clothes. In fact, you can think of it as a series of progressive dilutions, from the designer's mind, to the runway, and then to the clothes that you wear in your day-to-day.
text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:I spent like two months investing in a bunch of nice wool sweaters that I could wear through the winter, put them in a separate laundry bin after wearing so I could launder them myself, but my ex washed and dried them on high heat and they all shrunk so badly that I couldn't even fit them on my dog. About $1500 gone.

text:Excercises for personal style	labels:I recently watched a tedx "Dressing for Confidence and Joy", where the presenter Stasia Savasuk asked people to think about how they wanted to be perceived in the world by thinking about key words, and then to think about articles of clothing or accessories that fit in that keyword category. For example, if  Person A wanted to be perceived as confident, they would ask themselves if the article of clothing or whatever fit inside the "confident" bubble.  I found that idea to be useful. So the first step is choosing your keywords, and then considering them when you shop or dress yourself.
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I actually did a bit of a wardrobe overhaul right before COVID started (just happened to be around my birthday which is the only time I really do much clothing/jewelry shopping), and then promptly didn't get a chance to wear any of it, so I haven't purchased much outside of basics during the pandemic. I bought a few pieces I had been hunting down (a pair of Jeffrey Campbell booties, an embroidered "kimono") and filled some holes (fashion-over-function sandals, an easy summer dress) but other than that, I've taken the pandemic as an opportunity to focus on bulking out my basics. Finding the "perfect" undies, socks, etc and then stocking up. So nothing where I really needed to try anything on first or do returns, for the most part. All online, which isn't too much different than pre-pandemic minus the odd thrifting excursion. It's actually been nice, being on a limited income I tend to feel pressured to prioritize the clothing people can actually see. But since my "regular" wardrobe isn't getting worn practically at all, I finally have some flexibility to splurge on a nice pair of joggers or buy a couple camis specifically for lounging in (instead of having to "save" them for wearing with outfits). I'm definitely a maximalist and still get dressed up for certain meetings, but I haven't been getting dressed up "just because" mostly to avoid wear and tear on clothes that I haven't had a chance to wear anywhere yet.	episode_done:True

I recently bought 2 sets from Cyber Jammies (not sure if they're UK only) and I love them. Really comfy and so many cute styles. I also loved that I could mix and match type of bottoms and tops i.e. shorts/ trousers and cami/ t-shirt/ button up and I could get different sizes for top and bottom (hello pear shape).
text:Walmart fashion a “new” thing as seen on IG bloggers?	labels:Are they marked as sponsored posts? A couple of fashion influencers I follow are showing a lot of Wal-Mart clothes these days and the posts are always marked as sponsored. Any time an influencer is getting paid to wear something I assume they're wearing it for that reason and not because they genuinely like the clothes. I'm always way more interested in what they're wearing when they're not getting paid by some megacorp.  I will say I have weird love for some of the older George (edit: from Wal-Mart) stuff (like from years ago) that I can find on ThredUp periodically, some of the dresses from 10 or so years ago are actually pretty great and wear well. Anything else I've ever seen or purchased is very meh.

text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I can't for the life of me handle tight clothing. I'm not diagnosed with adhd but two gps have independently brought up the possibility and I'll look into it with a specialist soon.  I can't handle tights, tight long sleeves, pantyhose, or (and they're the worst ever) skinny trousers, especially jeans. Luckily, with my awkward proportions, almost all clothes that fit me are either too wide, too short (I just don't go for those), or made for boys. So I just go with slightly oversized most of the time. I vary between androgynous styles with inspiration from malefashionadvice or old fashioned looking, almost frumpy dresses, or a combination of a wide, drapy blouse and a flowing wide skirt. The drawback is that I can't really be feminine in winter because tights and leggings are off the table for me and I'd be too cold with bare shins.   That gives me a decent amount of variation! So it might be worth checking men's fashion if you're similar to me, or going for retro/vintage style blouses, skirts, and dresses.	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I work at a mid-higher end men's clothing store and we have women come in regularly for themselves. I can honestly say we 100% don't care who tries on/buys our clothes! We're just happy to help you find something you like and are comfortable in :) The only reason I can think of why you might not be able to try clothes on is if the store doesn't have their dressing rooms open, which unfortunately is the case for a decent amount of retailers around me. If you feel uncomfortable you can always just buy items you think you might like and return them. When it comes to pants I do know they're cut to have extra room in the "bulge" area. I'd recommend finding a lower-cut mens pant just so there will be less room in the fly. Welcome to the world of actually opaque white clothing!	episode_done:True

It’s really a cesspool.   Ivy is a breakdown of ‘Trad’ style, whichever way you cut it leaves room for interpretation and that’s the beauty of it. The whole point of Ivy style was rebellion. Kids were tired of wearing the same uniform their fathers wore, so they decided to wear their sweaters under jackets, sneakers with ties, etc.

I recently realized that my spending problem was extremely similar to the way Binge Eating works , and have been trying to do things in moderation (financial version of intuitive eating ) and it’s been working ! It’s frustrating though because a lot of people , my friends specifically, don’t realize how much of a problem it is , and mock me for not just “stop spending and use all your money to pay your debt” , the spending in moderation has been helping me pay off debt without accumulating more !	labels:This is super interesting to me because I’m in a unique financial situation. My husband and I paid off all debt except mortgage when we were 22 and 25. It was the crazy Dave Ramsey intense debt reduction on very small salaries (nonprofit work and jr enlisted military), but we paid off $35k in 20 months...and then we had to move and I lost my job. Things went from VERY tight (due to our priorities) to a little looser, but still no real money. Don’t think I bought new clothes except for running shoes, and a few bras in 2+ years. Now, fast forward another year+, I ended up going back to school and we are still living on one salary. Husband has been promoted so our budget is looser...and I have a hard time controlling my miscellaneous budget because I went through like a spending drought for SO long that every time I see a good deal on something, I’m like “Oh I should get that because idk when we might need it and not be able to afford it,” especially basics like jeans, bras, etc.  I’m worried for when I graduate in a few months and our income like quadruples. Ain’t no telling where that money is going to end up.

text:Guidance organizing a suit for my fiancé for his father's funeral during lockdown	labels:I'm going to be real, he needs a new suit jacket if he can afford it. A 10 year old budget suit from high school is the opposite of high quality.  Do you live near a Suit Supply? They are a Dutch company so will probably have high quality clothes that fit him. I'd suggest getting an entire outfit from there. They have EXCELLENT customer service and will handhold him through the process in as pain free a way as possible.
text:Is anyone into MBTI?

I love wearing knitwear, jeans or corduroy in winter and organic cotton/lace dresses the summer😊 I also love cute accessories, or small details on garments. In shoes I prefer flat ones, mostly sneakers,Oxford shoes, or platform shoes.
text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:Yes!

Most petites are first of all still not short enough for someone under 5 feet (like, why is 5’4 considered petite?), and second are cut narrower, which is the opposite of what I need.  I typically end up with pants with stretch so it fits at my waist while also fitting around my thighs and sweaters/tops that are a size or two too big for my stomach so that my shoulders don’t look ridiculous.	episode_done:True
text:MFA Theme WAYWT Challenge: Food Inspired - Reminder	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:I used to work in a funeral home and can tell you that I've seen it all. There will always be the guy that shows up in jeans and a barely nice t shirt, for some reason. There will always be a woman who shows up wearing a skin tight tiny club dress that barely covers her bum, but I guess she thought it was okay because it was black and also a dress? I've seen people wear sheer black clothing like somehow that's supposed to be a shirt. I've also been to funerals with wacky dress codes: everyone wears Hawaiian shirts or the everyone wears a chosen colour associated with the deceased.   But good rules to stick by: Wear clothes that are darker in colour; black, navy, dark green/purple. White dress shirts are appropriate, but having a jacket to go over it is ideal. If it's the summer and it's hot; boys, skip the jacket, but wear a tie and tuck in the shirt and girls, wear a flowy dress, ideally to the knee, with a light shawl or dress pants and a light blouse.   The purpose of the funeral is to pay respect to the deceased, and you want to keep the focus there. Wearing something too bright, or tight, or short, or casual can distract from what's going on and the importance of the funeral. The goal is essentially to blend in, not stand out, because the funeral isn't about anyone other than the deceased, so the attention goes to them. It's one of the few times that I believe everyone should put aside their own ego and allow the day to be about the deceased.	episode_done:True

text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:Don’t forget to check out thrift stores. This is where I stock up on cashmere sweaters for a few dollars a piece, wool skirts, kilts, sweaters, vests, and cardigans, and amazing wool blazers and coats. I’ve found mint condition mohair and camel hair 3/4 coats for as low as $10, black cashmere sweaters for $2-3 and up, and cable knit pullovers for as low as $4. It’s amazing what people get rid of, not realizing how expensive it all is new. I also loooove wool in the fall and winter, and so this has been a super affordable way to build a dream cold-weather wardrobe.   The only thing wool I buy new are socks for the most part, everything else I’ve found at estate sales, garage sales, and thrift shops. When/if you go, definitely go through the boys and men’s departments, too. A bit of tailoring can make anything look custom like some of the pieces on Walker Slater maybe.

text:Shitpost Saturday: What do your shoes say about you?	labels:My shoes reveal absolutely nothing about me because one of my stepsisters got blood all over them in an attempt to steal my man. Luckily he saw (he’s not very good with faces btw) but I am still left without shoes! I suppose you could argue that I am poor since I can’t yet afford new shoes. Makes sense given the fact I have been living in a drafty attic for the past decade or so...
text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:I think I need to go to bed. I just read the title as Jesus: Recommendations and Reviews. Sorry fellow fashion lover, I have no messiah tips for you tonight. 😂
text:Its not about assessing fashion and art. I can understand what she was doing and why its significant - and I can also be skeptical of its significance. Its goofy to me people would simp so hard for someone who "wanted to change the system from within" and apply leftist politics to market what is and remains a luxury brand - she even admits a fashion designer was antithetical to her political stance growing up, but she was too seduced by beauty to leave the world of fashion.   So color me none surprised when she goes on to become a billionaire off the backs of slaves.   My point isnt "nylon isnt luxury so she shouldnt sell cheap synthetics to rich people as a statement against fashion" its "being a luxury brand is antithetical in its very nature to the same politics you so self ascribe and market with - but the fact you found out a way to both use cheap materials with same upcharge and feel good about yourself is a perfect cherry to top it off"	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Not just you, thrashed and vintage clothing really took off in the mainstream this year and sellers acted accordingly, I had some guy on Grailed listing a pair of destroyed, ripped up APC’s for like $80 and halfway through the summer re listed them for almost $500	labels:Oofta
text:Thanks! A lot of guides make it difficult to go from the visual warp-and-weft structure of a weave to the practical effect, and I thought it made more sense to focus on the latter.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:the worst for me is if I’m wearing the shiny new outfit that I love and something negative happens - I embarrass myself, or I get into a fight with a friend, or I just feel particularly self-conscious one day - it’s ruined forever, and I’ll never feel confident when I wear it again. 🙃	labels:I totally feel that. I get the opposite too where I can’t let go of dresses because I wore it on a first date or to a memorable evening with friends I don’t want to forget. I think about these events whenever I’m rifling through my closet and come across these pieces and it makes me smile. I’ll probably never be able to tidy up Marie Kondo style for this reason.	episode_done:True
text:Bodysuits better than skims (important)	labels:I absolutely love bodysuits and I wish that they were a more popularized article of clothing. It's amazing to be able to avoid the frustrating dance of trying to tuck in a shirt without making fabric lumps. I've only been able to find a few stores that have a wide variety of basic bodysuit options, so thank you for sharing these finds

text:I bought a Tory Burch bag on inpulse after my divorce. It was so liberating to know I didn't have to explain the purchase to anyone. Not as much of an investment piece as LV but I still use it to this day!	labels:Its unhealthy but I always celebrate impulse spending when a woman does it solely for her happiness and no one else lol	episode_done:True
text:What pieces would you love "backups" of?	labels:Rihanna Fenty x Puma oversized boxy shirt.   Perfectly oversized and thick fabric. I have eBay alerts for these shirts I love them so much. I wish I bought ten of them but sadly only have one	episode_done:True
text:What were your favorite menswear collections that showed in 2020?	labels:I was gonna say Undercover but then you already have it in the post!   Loved everything about the collection, I have a soft spot for blending Japanese or Eastern traditions into modern garments. Sucks that it cost like $10k for that Samurai leather jacket.	episode_done:True
text:Inspo Album: Vintage Wool Sweaters Need Good, Loving Homes	labels:As a born and raised Norwegian, now living in the UK, my love for wool jumpers is endless and my sadness is twofold. 1) I might be Norwegian, but I've also got extremely sensitive skin. Thus my heart may be set on wool, but my skin is absolutely not, unless it's very fine cashmere or particular blends. 2) When autumn comes my immediate reaction is "WEAR ALL THE WOOL JUMPERS", and then I remember I live in the south of England and it doesn't actually get that cold here, plus it always rains.   Neither of those points are going to keep me from now spending several hours looking at vintage wool jumpers online though.
text:Yep, 6 fits like in the "Full Cycle" thread I linked in my post.  The dress like another user theme was done last year April I think.  We could do that again around the same time	labels:okay schweet schweet!  Ah didn’t realize there was one that recent. Excited for the next one! :)	episode_done:True
text:Interesting, I have some experience with Arc'teryx but never heard of Norwegian Rain. I'm probably pretty good for now on most cold weather clothing but I'll have to look them up.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 07	labels:YOU’RE FIRED
text:Best and Worst Purchases of 2020?	labels:Best: I snagged an olive Mack style rain coat off of poshmark from Club Monaco and I really dig how it goes with literally everything I wear consistently. I wear suits to work and it looks unique but subtle with them. Got a great deal too.   Worst: the 4 different attempts to buy a Patagonia Better Sweater Vest from grailed/ebay. I want one in navy but keep buying ones that look dark colored in the photos but then they get in and are a medium blue. Thankful for PayPal protection on those.	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Let's Talk About Purses	labels:I make ten million dollars a year at my wall street job BUT I only have one purse from madewell because I like to be humble unlike certain women I see with multiple fancy expensive purses (no judgement!! just not the way I was raised :)).  I love it because it’s a pretty tiny bag— perfect for me since I don’t need to carry any makeup around because I don’t wear it! I couldn’t focus at work with all that cake on my face, I don’t know how those other girls do it. they probably aren’t hitting their performance targets like I am!   I also love that it’s vegan— I wouldn’t want to do any harm to my fellow living beings! anyway gtg, I have to go sell bets on the value of someone’s family home :).
text:Noel Fielding X Fendi menswear colab	labels:I see Noel Fielding. I remember the Great British Bake Off. I updoot.  When I think of Fendi, I'm not a fan due to the overt branding on the baguettes. I don't think this collection really strikes me as interesting, though I am a fan of look 31 and the blue piping detail. The graphics also don't excite me a ton, except for the cursive Fendi coat in 23 (and I actually love the pop of the turtleneck and gloves and piping - so whimsical!) This collection confuses me as it's simultaneously very muted but also funky, but I don't feel as though there's cohesive messaging. I don't know Noel from anything besides GBBO, but I would have expected or liked a l'il more goth and/or more color out of the collab.	episode_done:True
text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Patagonia Primo. I got a used on on eBay.	episode_done:True
text:SAME! I really like the simple/expensive/feminine look that they all seem to pull off so well.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:2020 in Hindsight: A Year in Fashion — Die, Workwear!	labels:Athleisure’s popularity was already sky-high. I think this cemented it’s status as the new status-quo. At least from my perspective in North America.    I don’t know if it will last forever but probably at least the first half of this decade.
text:MFA Theme WAYWT: Corduroy	labels:I absolutely love cords! I like to wear tailoring, but dislike looking up "corporate". My aesthetic leans something like "sixties college professor", and cords are bang on for creating that more relaxed and academic look.   And then five-pocket cords just look great whenever you go casual!	episode_done:True
text:I'm glad you like it! I agree, long button coats give me strong dark academia vibes.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I can’t blame you for taking advantage of the $100 referral but your free $100 dress shirt will probably be something you could’ve picked up for $30 elsewhere.  If the prospect of a free $30 dress shirt excites you then go ahead. I’d probably just try to get $100 in free socks or tshirts, though.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:Figure out what your signature thing is. It is fine to pull from a myriad of influences, and evolve over time.   I have found that over the years I have incorporated other things but I have some unofficial style signatures:  * probably something colorful or patterned * I love pointy flats * I like to add one casual thing to a nicer outfit and vice versa * I mostly wear skirts and dresses * I have a few outfit templates: dress plus cardigan or jacket, slimmer pant/looser top, longer skirt/shorter top or tucked (this is a new one) * bigger earrings in mostly metal and geometric shapes (I do not really do colorful jewelry) * I love sneakers with skirts and dresses (since I was a preteen)  After that most stuff is fair game. Most outfits follow one of my templates and incorporate my rules. Over time you’ll find your rules too.
text:What are your go-to, everyday shoes?	labels:Blundstones in the winter, white keds in the summer. I'm a simple gal. 🤷‍♀️  Side note, I wear orthodics so my shoe choices are based on whether I can rip out the insole and fit my orthodics. Unfortunately this means no sandals during the summer unless I really think it's worth it to sacrifice cuteness for knee pain!
text:If you care to post, or direct us to where we can read your stuff, I would be interested in checking it out.  Also, congratulations on the acknowledgement.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:Give shoes a day break between wearings.  A shoe repair guy said that even with socks, shoes absorb a lot of moisture from our feet. He suggested going  at least day on day off with shoes to give them time to dry and regain their shape. Otherwise he said they stay in that moist, malleable state and get out of shape more quickly.  Anecdotally I’ve seen a major difference in the lifespan of my shoes.
text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:I manage a farmers market and can wind up doing tons of different things throughout the day. I normally wear sneakers but I always have a pair of timberland hiking boots with me incase I need to go in the fields. I usually wear two different outfit styles- black skinny jeans with black Nike airmax, loose graphic/solid tee, with an open flannel or oversized denim jacket. Other style is dirty-white converse, loose vintage mom jeans, tight solid colored top and either no jacket or a cropped hoodie. I keep my nails neat and painted and wear a thin gold necklace and diamond studs, so this helps me look a little nicer. Obviously my styles don't have to be as formal as yours but I'm also a manager so I usually look more put together than my coworkers who often wear leggings/athletic clothes.	episode_done:True
text:Ohhh this is me!! Who would have thought it would be so hard to replace basic white and black t-shirts and tank tops.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:The red one is super nice! It was lower on my list since my main priority was getting something slight more muted.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Who is your ultimate style icon?	labels:Right now for me it’s Gemma Chan. She’s always wearing the most beautiful, feminine dresses that are pretty yet statement-making. I love her color choices.
text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:If you have the space, start by taking out from your closet anything you’re considering getting rid of. Put them somewhere else (in a tote/box, or a different room, some kind of storage area). Wait for a while to actually get rid of them, a few weeks, a few months, up to you. If you don’t go searching for them in that time, you’re probably ready to get rid of them, so without opening the box, just get rid of them/donate them. If you went searching for something in that time, put it back in your closet.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - October 19	labels:My country went back into lockdown and so I have finally conceded to the new way of life.  Realistically, I'll be wearing homewear most days, but most of my other clothes just *feel nicer* than the cheapass sweatpants I own. So I got a new pair of sweatpants + a sweatshirt from Sunspel.  I really wish It hadn't had to come to this. I promise I won't leave the house in them.

text:Where do you get good quality, legit wool sweaters that won't rip/shrink after washing?	labels:Lots of good tips here but I wanted to add, if your husband's sweaters are very scratchy, get Eucalan or Soak and give them a soak, the lanolin softens them back up a bit! You can put it in a mesh lingerie bag and run them through spin cycle, then lay flat and shape gently to air dry.
text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I don’t know about “everyone should own,” but I have a pair of square opal studs that I wear allll the time. The white goes with everything, the colored specks add interest, the shape is unique, and they don’t look as fancy as pearls. I can wear them grocery shopping or to an event. I love opals so much!
text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:Some random ones off the top of my head:  - Lightweight popover shirt. I’ve got one in olive seersucker that I wear constantly in the summer. - A really good grey sweatshirt. Works as a mid layer in cold months or as the only thing over a pair of shorts in the summer and will be at home in a bunch of different styles. I like my Todd Snyder / champion one.  - Slim straight or straight dark wash or black jeans. As close to a “must own” piece of clothing as exists. - A good pair of boots. I like my RM Williams a lot at the moment, but something like a service boot or Chukka is equally useful. Great for all the situations “in between” sneakers and something more formal.  - Long coat like a duffle or balmacaan. Cool way to standout when it seems like every dude in existence has transitioned to patagonia or other down jackets for winter casual outerwear.
text:Do you name your favorite outfits?	labels:Hahahah, I love this! my boyfriend started saying “you look like a ....” and I remember that every time I wear these two outfits:  1. Sicilian widow - black maxi skirt, lace turtleneck under a black camisole 2. 80s real estate agent in Arizona - teal suit, teal turtleneck, pink lipstick, big ish hair

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:To put it bluntly, 100% privilege plays a role in the way people dress because there is increased access to options (including natural fibres, so called “sustainable” clothing, tailoring, etc) that are completely inaccessible for the majority of others.

text:Shitpost Saturday: Body Types (no fruit answers allowed)	labels:Ok, true story. My boyfriend’s daughter and I were talking about body types, and how I’m a pear. He overhears and disagrees vehemently.   He’s a quick-thinking guy, and I know he’ll have a good answer, so I say, “ok smart guy, what shape am I?”  “Well, you’ve got good hips and butt, and a long but slender torso. You’re male genitalia. Penis and balls.”  So, apparently I’m genitalia shaped. Sorry, that’s not a food, but it’s what I’ve got.

text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:I dunno, I have no problem looking ‘overdressed’. I’ve always had the motto of ‘don’t dress down for anybody’ in my head. If you’re looking to look fancy, you do you. Don’t dull your shine, life is way too short.
text:What trousers do people wear these days?	labels:Right now my kick is the paper bag waist pants. The right material can make it very classy and is so flattering. H&M and Macy’s or JCP has great options.  Aritzia is also great but can run pricey.	episode_done:True
text:Le Château is closing all stores (most likely)	labels:They might be okay still! Danier went under and someone bought them and they're back. I have hope.

So many memories 😢
text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process? What would you prioritize?	labels:You know what? I’m middle aged and secure in my job. I’d go full cyber goth. Not even joking. I’ve spent my whole life trying to dress appropriately for my work and lifestyle and it’s boring me. I have all kinds of office appropriate slacks and cardigans and button up shirts in cutesy patterns, casual jeans and sensible shoes. I want to wear plastic corsets and fluorescent clip in braids and platform combat boots.

text:Thank all of you	labels:Do not do what you are thinking about doing in the last part of your post. You are experiencing the beginner's high; you found something new and exciting and want to replace everything with it. One common rookie mistake for people that are new but not limited to fashion is to throw everything away and buy a completely new wardrobe only to regret it down the road because when the high went down, they realize they did not really enjoy some of the pieces.  You need time to process and enjoy your first part of AE. Let the initial 'honeymoon phase' calm down and see if you really like shoes. If you do and want to spend money, there are thousands of great shoe brands ($$-$$$) that you can read up on /r/goodyearwelt. AE is just a starting point.

text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:Gosh when I was a teen my style was all over the place. A little bit preppy mixed with animal print and glam/bling, etc. I was a lot more adventurous with color and styles, but now being 29 and a mom, I prefer all dark colors (a lot of black), and have a more refined but edgy style. Think the kooples and all saints. Dark tops, fitted bottoms, clubmaster style sunglasses, structured coats. I won’t ever give up my black vans eras, or Adidas r1s though.	episode_done:True

text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I moved to a big city in 2012 and driving and parking is miserable, so I have been online shopping for years now.  I use Zappos and Amazon a lot. For Zappos returns, you print a label, tape it up and take to any UPS place. I have a very difficult time buying shoes, so I might order a dozen pair and sometimes return them all. If the business wants to do this, I am cooperative.  You have to check on Amazon before you purchase and make certain it's returnable. UPS will box it up for you, it's amazing.  I hear Kohl's does also, but I never go there. You can print your own label and return it to an Amazon locker, that's even easier than a UPS store.  I check my measurements carefully and read a lot of reviews. I don't actually return much that I buy except for shoes.  I buy everything online, but bras? I don't know, that might be difficult.	episode_done:True
text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:try to mimic in your clothes what your body does, but more in terms of structure and sharp vs soft lines rather than "broad hips need x". If you have a sharp bone structure, try sharp and crisp styles, if you look fleshy go with soft draping fabrics, if you look short then split the silhouette by colors or a belt. These are just examples but they can be extended to anything. This is basically what the kibbe system does. You can apply this idea without going into the whole thing as it can be a bit of a rabbit hole.	episode_done:True

text:Hedi Slimane’s CELINE- an idealized look at 1960s rock & roll (large inspiration album)	labels:Love the inspiration folder, showing the clear influences and understanding of Celine under Slimane.  I do really enjoy Celine before Dancing Kid, but the latest collection wasn’t targeted to me.  The Dancing Kid is really to appeal to a new generation of buyers, when the past collections were to appeal to people who knew him as a designer.  I do like Dancing Kid though as a collection, I think it fits in with his more androgynous side that used to be more common with his days at Dior.  But it’ll be interesting to see where the brand goes post S/S 21 because I honestly don’t know what will happen.  I personally love the style and influences he had for Celine pre Dancing Kid.  As a kid who grew up watching French New Wave and listening to music from the British Invasion, I can definitely see myself transitioning to wearing clothes like that when I get back into an office.  It’ll always look cool.

I wore all black both times because I thought that was what you were supposed to wear but lots of people wore casual clothing. I’m talking singlet (tank top), shorts and thongs (flip flops). I was very taken aback that people would wear that to a funeral but I guess them being there is the most important thing.
text:2020 Christmas Gifts Thread	labels:Oh my, I go all out of Christmas gifts for my family. My brother and my mom do a lot for me and have supported me immensely through years of mental illness and addiction issues (sober for 6 1/2 years wooo) so I try and do something special for them.  For mom I got her a jersey, lime green Bottega Veneta shirt, and a golden yellow scarf from Bottega as well. I initially only bought the shirt and then I saw the scarf and knew I had to include that as well!  For my brother, not fashion, but I got him an authentic Penguin pitcher from Argentina, where our dad was from.  Sister in law and best friend, I got her a black hooded Apparis coat that I found on sale for $150!  Aunt and Uncle got puzzles and flannels from LL Bean, their favorite.  For my fiance, I got him a simple black windbreaker from Bottega.  Now on to what I got!  My fiance got me rainbow huggie earrings from Stone and Strand and I'm never taking them off!

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:It would depend on the skill and machinery of the sewist - I have definitely made clothes that I like and will likely keep wearing, but they’re not the most structurally beautiful garments and are not the same quality craftsmanship you’d get from a higher end brand. Part of it is equipment - I don’t have a serger which is used a lot in clothing making - and part of it is I’m not that concerned about the seams on the inside of a garment that only I will ever wear. That being said, if I had taken the time to do proper seams, there is no reason those garments wouldn’t last just as long as higher end garments.

text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:> should I try to incorporate things one at a time or just muddle though the vaguely uncomfortable period of time until I feel comfortable?  Yes. Fake it till you make it. Wear one nice, "dressy" thing at a time until you feel comfortable enough to dress up in an entire outfit. Wear it around the house until you feel comfortable enough to wear it outside. I used to be a tomboy who lived in baggy t-shirts and jeans, and I remembered being so self-conscious the first time I wore a skirt and flats, but I just kept wearing them, and soon the feeling wore off - I got used to being dressed up, and people got used to seeing me dressed up, so nobody commented on it anymore.  &#x200B;  > what to say when people make the, "why are you all dressed up" comment  because, "I just felt like it" never seems to be good enough.

text:Do you guys default to a set of a few pieces even though you own a ton?	labels:yeah absolutely. i have a fairly small wardrobe (i counted and i have i think… 33 pieces total), but i've noticed that as it grows, there are definitely pieces that i reach for more often. i think you can use that information sometimes to figure out what you want. there are some things that i try not to wear much because i discovered that they don't resonate with me.  as for worrying about ruining nice stuff, i bought a deveaux cashmere sweater recently and remember that i was a little antsy about wearing it at first. then i realized: it'd be a shame if i spent all that money not to wear it, even if i paid nowhere near retail. as cool as i think some of the clothes i own are, i'm buying nice clothes to wear them, not to collect them!  if it helps, whenever i buy a new piece of clothing, i usually make a point to wear it as much as possible—even if it's just at home—until it's not a 'nice thing' to me, it's just another shirt or pair of pants that i own. maybe you can ease into wearing your nicer things by just spending a bit of time wearing them in the house?	episode_done:True

text:For those who define their style as "classic-traditional" (tailored, fitted, matching, sleek), what are your typical outfits for work, on the weekends, date-night, running errands or lounging around?	labels:I have a pseudo-capsule wardrobe. I technically own only a few clothing items, but in several versions. For instance, several white blouses: 4 x poplin (different fits and collars), 2 x linen, silk in a minimalist version and more  dressy one with flowing sleeves, you get the idea. I too like pencil skirts, and most of my pants are either dark jeans or straight leg or slightly tapered pants in black, navy, grey, and white, depending on the fabric and/or cut they are more or less smart/casual. I don't get too trendy so I can get longer wear without looking dated. I love scarves and if I want a pop of color I'll usually go for a colorful scarf.    Work is boring, most of the time dark jeans or dark pants and a blouse or tee and a cardigan. And flats. I need to feel comfortable or I won't get anything done. During spring and fall, when the AC isn't turning my workplace into a freezer, I get a lot of wear out of my grey wool sheath dress, 4 years and still going strong!  Going out: I switch out a cardigan for a blazer, flats to heels, and put on makeup. Grab a fancier purse than my usual work black leather tote. I have some pearl and gold inherited pieces of jewelry I might bring out for special occasions.  At home I'm a slob, sorry, I have nobody to impress. Yoga pants and tees it is, as well as  everyday clothing that shows signs of wear and is comfortable enough to lounge around.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 02	labels:I turn 33 in a few months.  This is an unusual time in life for clothing.  On one hand, I've gotten too old to really follow trends closely, but on the other hand, I don't want to be one of those people who wears what was popular when he was 26 forever.  I'd feel goofy in a pair of wide-leg ankle-cut pants and a Carhartt jacket, but I also realize that black skinny jeans and plaid button-ups are past their prime.  So what's a man my age to do?  I've been working on finding a balance lately, but it's not as clear-cut as I'd hoped.

text:Tailoring is so often maligned as being uncomfortable by design, but I think the trends towards slim and skinny cuts over the last fifteen years are to blame -- to the point where many people have no idea how a suit is supposed to fit.  If jackets or formal trousers are too uncomfortable, the two most likely factors at fault are a) you are wearing an inappropriate fabric for the season and b) they are too tight. It's true that a suit is unlikely to ever feel as soft and flexible as a pair of joggers and a t-shirt, but for the most part there's no reason why it should be uncomfortable.  Some general tips: higher waists and wider thighs for trousers than what is currently trendy is much more comfortable - as is holding them up with braces rather than a belt, if that is a style you're happy with. Jackets should have wide enough shoulders and narrow enough armholes that they do not affect your movement at all; the fabric should just drape off you.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Drake's | January 16, 2021	labels:I have a handful ties from Drake's: one is Easyday, one is MTM, and the others are mainline.  I don't deny that other makers are better made, especially since Drake's ties are getting much more expensive than when I first saw the brand in 2014.  However, I think that mainly applies if you're buying solids or repps. I like buying their more abstract designs or "soft squares", as most other geometric ties out there simply don't have the same vibe (unless you're buying vintage).  The same could be said about their tapestry motif scarves, of which I also one own.  There's also their sleeveless cardigans which I really like. The wide rib on the "V", chunky buttons, and shorter length appeal to me, because again, not many other knitwear companies do it that way. Maybe if rubato made sweater vests.   I also own one Drake's shirt, which is a bold awning-esque multistripe. It seems okay, as like with the ties, I bought it for the pattern rather than the quality. It was acquired during a sale, so it was only $120~ compared to the 200+ it retailed for. In fact, all my Drake's items were bought on sale!	episode_done:True

text:I feel bad for these people, I think Twitter really pushed the narrative that anything under 6’ is “short”, and now there’s a whole generation of dudes out there living with an anxiety about being taller than or average height, despite it not being a large problem to most people irl	labels:I'm shorter than average and like to think I don't care, but when a girl is taller than me I suddenly care ); Otherwise I honestly don't care.	episode_done:True
text:Model poses while online shopping	labels:They do that when the fit if the garment is inferior. It is intentional.  Beware items that have this kind of photography, because most of the time it means the garment has bad construction, weird seam placement, or unfortunate details.  Well constructed items are not shot in this manner. Brands want to show off their excellent construction. It is known.  Hope that helps!
text:This 100%. I packed so many cozy apres outfits when I last went skiiing and then never at any point wanted to get into real clothes after shower. So my real apres style was just the leggings I wore skiing with technical underlayers and a big unzipped ski parka.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:Most of my secondhand finds are from online auctions or poshmark-type sites. I’d say about half my wardrobe is from these places (more like 80% for shoes).  - Have a pattern. Search for the same items/brands/keywords over time and get a good idea of what’s available and what a fair price is.   - Buy fabrics, brands and cuts you already know and like. I’ve made some big mistakes with things like second hand cashmere because I don’t normally wear it and I didn’t know what to look for.   - Be picky. There’s so much choice that it becomes overwhelming, so you’ve got to have a firm idea of what your dislikes are. No matter how cute the garment is, I won’t buy certain things... for example, visible distressing, suede footwear and polka dot are all off the table because I just won’t wear them.   You’ve got to be willing to take the hits with the misses when you’re doing this online - I’d say my success rate is around 50/50 for things that make it into my regular wardrobe rotation. I do my best to resell my fails, and I’d say I probably break even on average, but it’s a lot of effort and not for the faint hearted. But I love doing it so it’s more like a hobby than a chore - but it’s not for everyone, and there’s no shame in that!	episode_done:True

text:My thoughts of the Cote&Ciel Isar L after a year	labels:Just want to chime in as another C&C Isar (I think mine is M, not L) user. Eco-yarn construction. Context: I'm in a doctoral program, live in another city, commute to campus when necessary. Pre-COVID, that was 2-3x/week. East Coast/New England, so a good amount of exposure to rain, snow, etc.   I bought mine circa 2014/15 in Copenhagen. It's been my go-to for pretty much everything since then. Everyday commute stuff fits very easily. As OP describes, space is massive, yet the construction of the backpack allows you to cinch everything down to a pretty small (if tall) package. I've used it for 2-3 day conference trips. The open duffel compartment really fits a lot. The more structured "backpack" compartment has cushioned dividers, pockets, etc. for flatter or more delicate/smaller objects.  Frankly, I love it and its one of the most interesting and functional backpacks I've ever come across. And the design, which variously recalls elements of modernist architecture, is pretty distinctive. My best experience with it was when I fit an absolutely massive doorstopper of an exhibition catalogue (600+pgs, oversized art book, hardcover) into the duffel compartment and it just...swallowed it up.	episode_done:True

text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:Yes, I do think our age definitely affects what looks dated to our eye.   I’m noticing that some younger men are wearing some strange iterations of 80’s color-blocked track suits that to me look very Golden Girls. Also, I’ve seen shirt and shorts sets on rappers made out of wild print fabrics exactly like the ones I made for my toddler 25 years ago.  I’m older, so I’ve seen a lot of trends come and go. We are now at the point where they are starting to repeat and are designated as “Vintage”.  I have cultivated my personal style over many years (boho/western), and have seen it done well by Ralph Lauren and most recently Christian Dior in 2018(?) and enjoy the idea of wearing the beautiful things I’ve collected until the end of my life.

text:General Discussion - January 19, 2021	labels:I never thought I'd become this person, but man, shipping costs really can fuck up my desire to buy something. I was just about to commit to buying another pair of sneakers and it's probably the best deal I'm going to find on them, added to cart, shipping info entered, billing info entered... $20 for the cheapest shipping option. No shipping codes available, no threshold I can cross to get free shipping. $20 period, no exceptions.  It's a $300 pair of sneakers discounted to $180, I guess should be able to rationalize that at $200 (including shipping), I'm still getting a better deal than what's available anywhere else online (only a few select retailers got this colorway, and all but one are sold out in my size), but still, $20 shipping feels *wrong*. My brain has been trained from years of online shopping that there should always be some way to get around paying for shipping, or otherwise, shipping should be cheap.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 28	labels:I love the way I look and feel in a nice pullover with a collared shirt peeking out the top.  But  I also tend to overheat easily, and most sweaters I've tried are too heavy for me to wear in the office when the heat is on. Is there a sweater brand that tends to be lightweight or more breathable that I can try? Is there a certain sweater material or knit that works this way?  Budget $130 Location US / EU  Side note: I'm pretty wedded to the crewneck, and I avoid cashmere because I've always found it to be too delicate. If I brush gently against a hedge on the sidewalk, I don't want to end up with a big hole in my sweater. I don't need the softest feel, and I appreciate all textures.
text:So you think putting my head down for 1.5 years and getting the Marketing and Fashion Bachelors. Then move onto a grad/MA in fashion design would be more with it?	labels:Oh yes certainly, although I would talk to your advisors and see if grad school is even necessary. I worked in digital marketing (not fashion) with a BS in Psychology and no one cared about masters at my agency.  I started my masters this summer and in two weeks I’ll be over the halfway mark to graduation. A year is nothing and a year and a half is a little more than nothing ;) You’re still so young, I really wouldn’t worry about it!

text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:Everything eventually comes back in fashion.  Personally I would love for 2000s jeans to come back - not super low rise or the ones that were bedazzled or laced up but just normal rise bootcut and flare jeans. I have a few from that era that I still wear all the time and a couple more that I had to replace with similar ones from poshmark because I couldn't find them in shops.  I also miss 2000s makeup. Sure, there was too much body glitter and candy colors but there was also the fresh dewy look of blush and a light lip gloss - think Britney Spears in her Oops I Did It Again video, or Mandy Moore's makeup in her video for Candy. Not everything in the 2000s was horrible lol.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 09, 2020	labels:Is there a way to wear a black denim trucker jacket without being inherently “bad boy” looking? My style is what I’d consider to be prep/ivy with a little bit of Americana thrown in (lots of OCBDs, donegal sweaters, chinos, with more rugged boots like Viberg and the occasional Chelsea). My concern is that it might look a little costume-y, as if I’m missing the motorcycle and everything else that’s required with a black denim jacket.
text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:First off congrats. I'm curious how you made the transition during the quarantine, but that's a big accomplishment and give yourself a pat on the back.  It sounds like you have gone from chubby to skinny but you are about to put on more muscle. I wouldn't go super-slim if you're still gymming and putting on muscle. I basically went from  medium to a small then back to a medium from putting on muscle.  I probably would hold off on investing in more rigid pieces like jeans for a bit, but if you work out a lot I would invest in better gym clothes (i.e. Nike Tech Pack is something I really like), and get nice stretchy clothes that can accomodate your physique like cardigans. I would also invest in a good fleece (i.e. Patagonia or North Face). Essentially anything that you imagine stretches a bit and is something you wear every day, I would get nicer versions of. T-shirts should not be a big investment and I would just get from Uniqlo for slightly oversized from any brand really.  I think pants are a bigger question mark and for now it would help to go with an elastic waistband or wear something inexpensive that you can experiement with (i.e. Uniqlo, Levis, Unbranded, J. Crew if on sale). Honestly I don't really wear either much these days and don't recommend buying them if you're expecting to be at home for the majority of the time, as you'll want things that you wear a lot (IMO).  If you provide your height and weight I'm happy to provide my input there too. I went from \~170ish to \~150ish at 5'8" a few years ago, then put on muscle, then am back to being a fatass so will be making a similar transition over the next few weeks.	episode_done:True
text:I like a mid-calf wool skirt that has plenty of folds, a wide hem, and a satin lining. The shape allows freedom of movement and room for other layers, and the smooth lining defeats friction so the hem doesn’t bunch up.

text:Ever been censored at work because of what you wear?	labels:What kids wear isn't really relevant, it's what other teachers wear. I likely wouldn't be allowed to wear a feminist shirt to my work if someone complained even though 99% of my coworkers agree. It is inherently politically - that's the point of it!   I would get them to write down explicitly how they define political. Allowing vague rules allows them to apply it unevenly as it suits them, so get them to **write** it out. Plus, once it's in writing, you have evidence to give to your union rep if they try to hassle you over something not outside of their guidelines.  When I worked at a restaurant with older customers,, I got an upper ear piercing, so I had to wear my hair in a super weird low ponytail that covered the tops of my ears because non-lobe piercings weren't allowed.   I live in a liberal area and though political speech/expression isn't allowed at work because we're government employees, solidarity with marginalized people that doesn't specify a political issue wouldn't be considered polticial. our union literally handed out buttons in solidarity with George Floyd to wear on our work lanyards, and PRIDE/ally stuff is handed our by an employee resource group. As long as it's not saying "defund the police" or "keep gay marriage legal!" or something, then that's not politicial thats at most a social issue	episode_done:True

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:First for cardigans and sweaters is I either go fully wool or fully cotton. Can’t be any sort of blend, and I avoid mohair. I have a cotton cardigan from urban outfitters that’s like 5-6 years old and looks brand new, so you don’t even need to go super pricey, just look at fabric content.  Second is I wash everything on cold, and hang dry as often as possible. Heat basically transforms fabric, so using it is unnecessary. I also find that it sets pit stains instead of removes them.  Shoes I have no idea. I walk a lot and constantly wear out shoes. I find leather with a sewn in sole lasts a lot longer, but flats and heels never last that long. I’ve also had luck with shoes that have wooden soles which I’ve added a sole with traction to.  For bags, I’ve always heard it’s bad luck to keep them on the ground, but that’s more superstition than keeping it nice lol.

Sometimes people are appreciating the design or color or novelty of an item and not the big picture of how it works for you.
text:Let me ask you a few questions here...do you even like these clothes or are you more comfortable in something else? Are you dressing for you or for men? If for men, if a man is disappointed by what you're "hiding" then he's not worth it. There are plenty of great men out there who like you and your body just the way you are and they don't really care what you're wearing.   I would say we are all hiding some flaw...for me, I'm hiding my mom pooch belly. I can hide it well in clothes, but naked...nope! It is right out there. If someone doesn't like that then that's on them and speaks to how shallow they are, which is an instant turn off for me.  Love yourself first.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Thank all of you	labels:So a number of people are telling you not to buy a bunch of AE shoes because they are “entry-level” and that you may eventually want to move up in price. This is true, but consider that anyone saying this has become a hobbyist who appreciates and collects high-end footwear, and therefore retroactively views AE as a gateway drug that led them to discover a new hobby. This implies a linear progression from spending $350 on shoes — an amount 98% of men would find insane — to eventually spending $1000+ on shoes, which is completely bonkers to all but a very small number of people.  Definitely wait a bit and avoid buying a dozen pairs of AEs too quickly. But also consider that if AE makes you happy and your goal is to amass a rotation of multiple good-quality shoes in different styles and colors, it’a perfectly acceptable to avoid leveling up. You don’t *have* to keep buying progressively more expensive stuff, and can instead enjoy what’s in a price tier you’re comfortable with.

text:I recently bought a very fine-gauge cashmere sweater that was advertised as “in excellent condition”, but when I received it, it had a tiny hole. It was only $10, so I bought a skein of close-enough wool tapestry yarn, separated the yarn into very thin, small strands, and “sewed“ the hole up with an embroidery needle. I'm planning on dyeing the entire sweater black with acid dye, to disguise the slightly-different color of the repair, but it's not very noticeable as is.   I'm not a knitter, so I don't have experience with darning or mending (other than needle-felting tiny tiny holes in already-felted wool). I've had one cashmere sweater for ages, and when it developed holes from constant wear (it wasn’t the best quality) I was able to felt them with matching wool roving.  However, if you know how to Swiss darn (duplicate stitch) you can fix really large holes, provided that you have the right color thread or yarn. If you find a sweater that you absolutely love but it has holes, you can also drop it off or mail it to a repair service to be fixed (but it is pricey).	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Justin Guitar is probably the most popular starting point for learning to play guitar online. If you want a more personal experience I'm sure some teachers in your area that might be doing zoom lessons.  Semi-serious rec for sports, Rocket League e-sports league has a couple of tournaments over the next few weeks. It's really easy to follow and pretty fun to watch, and also the game itself went free to play recently and is pretty addicting.	labels:I’ll check out Justin guitar and if it doesn’t work I’ll look locally! Thanks!   I dig rocket league! Played a good amount from 2016-2017. I’ll check the league out thanks :)	episode_done:True
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:1) Two pairs of olive wide leg pants - one dressier and one casual. Great with greys, warmer blues, purples (incl eggplant and berries), white, pink 2) Ginger - basically wear with white only (ginger + black “wears me”) 3) Sand - wear with neutrals or slightly warm colors  ETA - I also have a pair of tropical print pants in red, pink, ginger and black. Just love them. Wear with any of the print colors or white	episode_done:True

text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I worked at Kohl's in college and spent my fair share of time cleaning out fitting rooms.  In normal times, those are the grossest places ever (you don't even want to know what kind of shit I found in there-- including literal shit).    TBH the only clothes I've purchased since Covid were PJ pants (because my old ones split in the ass).  They were from Walmart (so I could go even during a lockdown).   Oh and I bought a sweater dress at Primark.  Now, most of the clothes I buy run SML as opposed to numbered sizes.  Even dresses.  I generally just hold them up to my body and pray that they work (and return if they do not).    I tend not to buy clothes online because the quality is so inconsistent from store to store (and even within a store).  I need to actually feel the quality.	episode_done:True
text:I love the idea of this, although really good custom tailoring as they describe in the article is not exactly easy to come by. I think you are right about suiting; nowadays it seems exclusively reserved for weddings, special events, etc. and is rarely intended for every day wear.   Still, I almost always get dressed up to some extent when I’m WFH. I can’t bear to sit around in sweatpants and an old tee all day like a lot of people seem to do. Look good, feel good!	labels:>	I can’t bear to sit around in sweatpants and an old tee all day like a lot of people seem to do. Look good, feel good!  I really feel this. I work as a personal trainer so I have a lot tracksuits but now that my country (Ireland) is back in lockdown I found my self constantly just wearing whatever I grabbed. I noticed this was adversely affecting my mood because as you said look good, feel good.  I have now decided I’m only going to wear workout gear/tracksuits if I am working out or doing house work.   Jeans, chinos, shirts, boots and sweaters all the way and I feel so much better for it.	episode_done:True
text:can you tell me the major difference b/w style and fashion?!	labels:One of my favorite quotes is by Coco Chanel: "Etiquette are for those without manners, in the same way as fashion is for those without style."  What this means to me is that fashion is a series of "rules" and transient ideas about what "good style" is, but isn't really a substitute for having your own well-defined, more solid and long-lasting style.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:I’d agree that personal comfort is the big thing.    I’d also pay attention to the content of the compliment. “That’s a cool sweater” is NOT the same thing as “you look great in that sweater”, KWIM?   Sometimes people are appreciating the design or color or novelty of an item and not the big picture of how it works for you.
text:The my-socks-become-my-wifes-socks-because-she-never-*invests*-in-socks is far more insidious.  Actually, now that I think about it, nice socks would be pretty perfect in her stocking.

If you do that she'll continue only wearing your socks and you'll either a) end up wearing her socks or b) be out several pairs of socks and still have no socks.

text:General Discussion - November 24, 2020	labels:Is StyleForum just MFA with a massive 18East boner?
text:They're either incapable of understanding the basics of doing laundry that even a teenager can manage or they're lying, girl.   Any excuse to distance themselves from the poors and justify overpriced clothes because paying over $100 on a shirt means it's "better quality" than the $20 all the poors can afford. It's not.  They're just treating their cheap clothes like shit because they're cheap. The name brand stuff gets handwashed with angel tears by virgins with long hair in sundresses. Then they're surprised pikachu when the H&M sweater pills and the Sezane one does not.   Or even better, the h&m sweater is *obviously* shit because it pilled, but when your sweater is $300, pilling is suddenly "inevitable" and just use an electric shaver.	labels:Someone asked how to avoid sweaters disintegrating in the wash, so i asked what they meant, and they meant literally just pilling.  So I guess you're spitting truth lol
text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:You all do a lot of laundry!  I only wash base layers (panties, socks, camis, undershirts, leggings, hosiery) regularly. Everything else I hang up on a garment rack to air out. I hit it with cheap vodka in a spray bottle to deodorize/sanitize. I learned that trick in costume class in college, much more skin safe than febreze. I use a steamer to get out the wrinkles and reshape. I recycle my old toothbrush brushes/cut up tshirt rags to spot clean with felsnaptha or oxi clean.  If you have good hygiene and aren’t sweating, there’s really no need to wash most things, especially with a washing machine. Clothing experiences a lot of friction while being agitated in the machine and that will wear your fibers out. I have shirts I bought at 16 that still look brand new and spot care preserves all my vintage/handmade pieces. The hang/vodka/steam combo is great for bras too, which should only be hand washed if they need to be thoroughly cleaned.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - October 27	labels:I think early MFA and the attendant blogosphere it spawned / belonged to / helped popularise is partially to blame for the whole "timeless" nonsense.  We've come a long way from "well dressed men wear suits" to "actually shirts and blazers can be dressed down" to "actually you can wear what you want and look good", and maybe the whole "timeless", "dapper", "classic", "gentleman" thing was a necessary part of the journey, but... would it just fucking die please.
text:When did skinny jeans go out of fashion?	labels:skinny jeans haven't been on trend since at least 2015-2016 imo. that's when mom jeans became all the rage.  That being said, skinny jeans are pretty much staples for most people. They go with a lot of outfits and make a lot of looks.   Just because something isn't currently on trend, does not mean it can't be stylish.
text:I worked in a restaurant that said something similar to me, I had straight leg black dress pants (the uniform was black dress pants-no requirement on cut) and they said my pants were too tight and revealing and I had to wear flared ones.

text:Maybe because my feed is a lot of plus size/fat bodies, but I find this type of thinking terribly depressing. I won't pretend that terms like "effortless" are meant for us, but it also can feel even more exclusionary in a way when I see other fat people being like "never will I be considered to look this good!! no matter the effort I put in!!!".	labels:That’s not what I’m saying. Plus size can be beautiful, but never effortless. I don’t wear makeup, mostly wear sneakers because good luck finding feminine shoes in 11.5 women’s, and I alternate between jeans + T-shirt and dresses.

I think it speaks to the power of strong branding, recognizability, and building a core customer base that his line is doing so well right now. Because honestly I can’t imagine what Thom Browne leisure collection would look like if he did try to jump on that trend! More sweaters?  I’m very much not the target customer (relaxed Bay Area and all that) but looking though the website really gives me the idea that I could be that kind of immaculately tailored prep school person. Really speaks to how strong the overall image is within the brand.  I also didn’t realize about Billy Porter’s Oscars gown. I really wanted to like it, but the proportions seemed kinda weird. Guess it makes sense now coming from a designer who’s known for odd proportions.

text:Why It's Important to have a Style POV & Desired Aesthetic	labels:I only skimmed this (I do enjoy reading your posts, just on a lunch break and today's a long day) but I can totally get so much of it. It's only been recently that I've really gotten what I want to look like, and it really is great to not feel tied down by what "works" in a traditional sense. Sometimes there are more meh days and such but the fun for me has been getting to the look that I want to see myself in, and it has really helped me feel more confident and not like I'm just wearing a costume. Though that isn't to say my days arent frequently pretty basic, but even then there's always a piece in an outfit that I wanted there to be, whether it's a specific shirt that I like the pattern, or how a specific bracelet goes with my colors.  Though I will add something, I do find it quite frustrating when someone asks me for advice. Not because I don't like helping people with clothes (I quite love it sometimes), but because a lot of these people don't know what they want to look like and while I *can* dress them it's not really *them*.
text:1 Year - A Kmn6784 2020 Wardrobe Album	labels:I love this. I am currently working on overhauling my entire wardrobe because of two reasons:  1) I outgrew almost every single shirt and sweater that I own because I started going to the gym 2 years ago and I don't fit a medium top anymore.  2) I used to only shop at sort of street style or skate style shops and that is just not the kind of look that I want anymore (plus those clothes don't fit anymore anyways)  Your wardrobe looks so great! I feel like you've got everything for any occasion, and I agree that it looks like you can just shop for whatever you **want**, rather than what you **need**.  I really like the Greats shoes that you've got. I never heard of that brand but I was actually looking for shoes just like those. I have a pair of vans and a pair of blundstone chelsea's, but I really wanted something in between; something that says: "I am here casually, but I care about what I'm wearing". I may get myself a pair of Greats!  Also, I noticed a lot of stuff from J. Crew. I have bought from them once, a Kashmir sweater, and it was actually kind of itchy so I almost never wear it. Should I give them another chance? It seems like it's one of your go-to places.
text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:I’ve had them on and off since the 90s...

As others have mentioned glasses are pretty cheap nowadays so getting spare shades is the way to go. At the moment my back up pair is transition. Oh and no one will ever notice or care that your glasses are transition, and people don’t actually have an opinion on them. Also— when you’re inside they’re completely clear like regular glasses.

text:“Sadd” Colors: 1620s Puritans to 2021	labels:Any idea what colors the Puritan colonies would have even had access to make locally?   I'm wondering if the association with more garish colors related in their minds to foreign trade and is maybe more about how they feel towards external cultures.
text:Yeah I like conversations like this too. I can suddenly see how it would just like weird and uninteresting if you had pretty clear gender categories. I feel more in the mix like he seems to, so it definitely does resonate with me. I think the thread below is interesting too, that it’s because he was seen as a hot male celebrity in One Direction and has gradually wound up wearing a dress on the cover of Vogue. I am not actually a super radical gender person, but there is something about Harry Styles that resonates extremely strongly with me. I frankly can’t say why.  The ppl in the other thread are emphasizing how there’s nothing inherently new about what he is doing but I disagree. I think he represents a very widely-consumable version of a gender queering position. He is at once legible as a British rock star and something very contemporary. It comes back to the sense of insouciance. I know everything he is doing is deliberate, but his attitude is that none of it should matter. I think other instances of celebrity gender bending were framed as being subversive, whereas he is trying to treat us as precisely not subversive but nothing. It’s a complicated move, for his radical thing to be to pretend that what he is doing isn’t radical. But for me it works and is quite smart and meaningful (even if it is, as the ppl in the other thread are saying, a series of calculated decisions, I don’t think it’s only that. I think he is following something genuine and internal, even if he is a professional concerned with having a successful career. He does strike me as being actually genuine in a sort of rare way. Idk. This was a long response, which shows how intensely his dress thing is impacting me.	labels:I’m glad you feel safe to express yourself here. I like what you had to say. I work to live without gender categories and I definitely projected just some of my aesthetic choices. I go for polished looks that are “complete” from head to toe so my first reaction was “needs some makeup”. But you’ve pointed out it’s more of a dejection of all that instead of just putting together a feminine look.   I wanna pose a question to you.

I feel it cost me more in time when I try to buy responsibly.	labels:Yeah, shopping responsibly and buying only from more sustainable/ethical brands can be frustrating and time consuming.   I've found having a go to list of brands I've purchased from before is a good way to narrow down a search. For one-off more specialist purchases, I start looking early and just accept it's going to take a while before I buy what I need.

I'd agree that there are likely too many sellers now compared to buyers - or at least too much merchandise compared to buyers. To me, that makes Poshmark too much like Ebay, and is no longer as distinct a platform as it used to be.  Edit: typos

text:What are your go-to, everyday shoes?	labels:Blundstones in the winter, white keds in the summer. I'm a simple gal. 🤷‍♀️  Side note, I wear orthodics so my shoe choices are based on whether I can rip out the insole and fit my orthodics. Unfortunately this means no sandals during the summer unless I really think it's worth it to sacrifice cuteness for knee pain!
text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I've written about this before, but as someone who is 5'2 on a good day, I have stopped giving a shit about looking "longer and leaner."  In fact, I reject the idea that I should want to look taller. Maybe all those 5'7 women should be taking advice on how to make their legs look as stubby as mine. <--Obviously a joke but to make a point. How stupid is it that I should feel like my natural body is something to correct?  I'm an old woman, lol, and over the course of my life I have never found that my stubby legs (that I was once self-conscious about) have kept me from career advancement or from finding people who thought I was beautiful and wanted to have sex with me, so what's the freaking problem?  Fuck conventional figure flattery.  That being said, of course there are things I think look better on me than other things and I tend to wear the things I think look better in ways I think look better most of the time.  Except when the comfort or beauty of a garment is so outstanding it overrules that.  Thanks for coming to my TED talk.  There are cookies on the table in the back.

text:Fall 2020 Fit Battle - Elite 8 - Discussion	labels:HalfTheGoldTreasure vs **8888plasma**. plasma goes for restrained maximalism with a peacock print shirt and textured trousers. Shirt is interesting without being obnoxious and works well with the trousers. I feel that more could have been done with the footwear. Chuck feels like a (weaker?) rehash of last week with the lazy collar over a white sweater. I enjoyed last week's all-white more, felt more conceptual. The shirt looks interesting, but is hidden by the sweater.  Salutatorian vs **Rariora**. Rariora gives me great wfh vibes, with a cozy duster cardigan (dropped shoulders make it appropriately slouchy) over an eyecatching print. Trousers add further visual interest without being distrcting.  Salutatorian does something unexpected here by pairing winter socks in sandals with a very wintery pair of trousers. The jacket+turtleneck matches the cold weather theme, but its not as interesting as Rariora's offering.  NgoKnows vs **DeLaJoel**. Both come in hard. Joel's main is really amazingly well paired between the coat, the jacket, tee and trousers. Very pleasing. I'm not into the sandals but that might just be me. Ngo has a very cool vibe, bit more rugged and casual. I'm a sucker for the kind of refinement that Joel displays here, so he gets my vote.  thecomebackkid vs **Chunsak**. Chunsak's main made me audibly gasp. The fluffy coat over *that suit* is just too good. I'm even okay with these shoes under that suit, even though I normally ~~detest~~ don't like the wallabee shape. Thecomebackkid's tweed, flannel and (I think?) corduroy combo is great (and seasonally appropriate), but pales in comparison.

text:I think I’ve heard of the allegations but yeah as a long-time fan, I could notice design quality dropping GREATLY. Even for the mainstake GUESS brand. It sucks, really. And GBG never really got its footing in the market because it came out at a time when F21 and H&M started expanding in the US. And when you compare prices, people would rather pay less. GBG did have some unique stuff 2010-2012 it seems because that’s when I bought the most stuff from the brand.	labels:You’re absolutely right. GBG did not have a chance standing against the Goliaths that were F21, Zara and H&M. Their price points were much higher, with similar, if not the same quality. They did have more design injected into their clothing, but unfortunately customers tend to favor price over design and quality. Glad to know you were able to at least experience GBG at its peak :)

I’m wondering if anyone has any recommendations for the best places to shop for tall, athletically built men? I am 6’4” and about 195 lbs. I have a decently muscular build (nothing crazy), and as such I like outfits that accentuate my frame. I generally find that drop cut shirts work well for me. Being as tall as I am, I often have difficulty finding pants (36” inseam, ~32/33 inch waist). I usually go for jeans/pants on the slimmer side. Anyways, I’m mainly just looking to see if anyone with a similar build has had success finding outfits anywhere in particular. Thanks!	episode_done:True

Kids were tired of wearing the same uniform their fathers wore, so they decided to wear their sweaters under jackets, sneakers with ties, etc.

My open knit cardigan works all year round. You really have to be realistic and ask if you’re going to wear it in the next couple of years and how you’re going to store it. I would get rid of things that you could easily replace and polyester/polyamide (because it’s not as breathable and caused me bacne).   For the third piece, consider accessories.

text:Similar experience with END Clothing.  My friend asked for wallet suggestions for her BF and she settled on a new one full price from END, shipped to the US. Shipping was ~$12. Return policy is 30 days, but you have to ship it back to the UK on your own dime.  It gets delivered 7 days later. Next day, END starts their seasonal sale and the wallet gets reduced by $70. Wallet is still in stock. I help her message support for a price adjustment, and they told her to shove it.   Regardless of whether she had already opened and used the wallet (she hadn't, because it's a gift...), she *could* place a new order at the lower price, wait less than a week for it to be delivered and ship the new one back on the first order for a full refund minus shipping.  We explained this to the reps and they said 'ok, you're free to do that.'  Nevermind that we'd be shipping the identical wallet across the world and then back for no fucking reason. Nevermind that we'd be out another $20+ for having to pay return shipping on a small item to the UK AND their shipping fee on the second order. I even asked if they could refund the adjustment amount minus the shipping. Nope.  Fuck END, fuck their policies. Support Mr. Porter or SSENSE instead.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Craig Green Spring 2021 Menswear Collection	labels:Call me crazy, but Craig Green has never done anything for me.

Fashion-as-art-onto-itself stuff like 10, 17, 22 also looks good (and I guess it earns him his avantgarde cred), but doesn't filter down to the stores.  So there is this gap between fairly ordinary stuff and out-there artworks that he can't seem to fill. But in that gap lives the stuff I'd like to wear.

Couple that with expensive shipping, no returns, and the high occurrence of issues with orders it just isn't worth it. The last time I was on this site was the summer and everything that I made reasonable offers is still sitting, now cheaper than what I originally offered, and because the sellers gave me attitude they lost my sale. I don't see Posh being successful for much longer, honestly. Mercari is just as bad and harder to find things on.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Eh, that's not really true. There are a number of environmental impacts from leather/suede. Even when sustainably raised.  1. Cattle actually suppress growth of native grasses(coming from a US centric perspective) due to the shape of their hooves. Buffalo have a different shaped hoof (more of a spade) and actually stimulate growth. So if you got your hands on some buffalo hide boots thats a great start.  2. The dyes and softening agents can be incredibly toxic and harmful. Traditional practices actually employ human excrement (both urine and feces) but modern practice focuses on more... palatable but also less environmentally friendly chemical agents.  3. Discerning origins of hides is difficult. There is quite a bit of disingenuous advertising as far as what is sustainably farmed and what standards it meets. There are many different verification organizations, looking into who has partnered with them (ie. NGOs or government programs) and who provided foundational funding is a good start to finding a reputable org.  So, you are totally right. But only if you account for all of those point as well as sourcing the materials/labor/sales locally. To be honest I think just making sure what you buy lasts a long time, taking care of your clothes/shoes, and limiting your future purchases will have a more meaningful impact.	labels:so, I'm an ag and soils researcher, and the research is really up in the air right now as far as grazing and soil carbon. we havent really figured it out yet, and the field is in a major state of flux with new research coming out all the time. maybe we can grow cattle in an environmentally friendly way that is carbon neutral or even positive (this would require much lower stocking rates and innovative new techniques that are far from common today), but maybe we can't	episode_done:True

text:Sewing your own clothes	labels:Having basic sewing skills to repair or slightly modify existing clothes is a fundamental skill most people should have and is absolutely worth the time. Novice tailoring is a great skill to have too and can save you some money. Beyond that, sewing clothes from scratch is more of a hobby than a necessity for most people, due to the widely available nature of inexpensive and functional clothing. So like most hobbies, whether or not it is "worth the time" (and cost! Sewing is expensive and it's frequently cheaper to just buy an item unless you're looking for a custom fit or something super unique) is more dependent on your enjoyment of the activity than it is on more "functional" motivators like cost-savings.

text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:I suggest organizing and developing categories based on how you work through creating an outfit. Do you need to see items to choose them? If yes, maybe focus on hanging the items you need to see. When you go to pick out a top, how do you decided what you are looking for? Is it color, sleeve length, pattern? Do you mentally group crop tops in the same category as other shirts, or do you specifically look for crop tops? Have you designated some items as work clothes or more formal clothes vs casual? Group your clothing in the categories you put thing into in your head, even if they wouldn't make sense to others (it's your closet after all).     For example, when I'm picking out shirts think about sleeve length and pattern, and I need to see and feel the shirt to make a final decision on what to wear. For what ever reason, sorting by color isnt as big of a priority, but whether I want to wear stripes, plaid, floral, or solid is. So my shirts are hung, divided by sleeve length, then arranged by pattern (like patterns together). I also have separated out my formal clothes and my gold clothes, as those are only used at specific times and dont need to be visually cluttering my daily wardrobe.	episode_done:True
text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I have three or four distinct styles. Most of the time I like wearing dark, edgy punk-inspired clothes. However, I’m a style chameleon. If I need to be professional, I have a whole separate wardrobe of high-quality suiting. Take out my piercings, and I’ll have anyone fooled that that’s the realest me. In the summer and family gatherings I often wear more earthy boho and beachy surfer looks. Fashion is a great tool for self-expression, matching the mood, and setting the mood.

I also tried to aim for the middle ground between “covered enough to wear to a conservative wedding” and “not so dowdy I feel 30 years older than I am”.

Just because you don’t have the word to distinguish a color, does not mean you cannot visually appreciate the difference or incorporate it into your outfits?  Most men I know have a very limited color vocabulary - pretty much the basic colors of the rainbow (and honestly you may get some blank stares if you say “indigo” and “violet” outside of the rainbow context instead of “blue” and “purple.”) But my husband can see colors and visually distinguish between my coral top and my blush blouse even though both he would describe as “pink.” He even owns shirts that incorporate salmon pink and lavender and turquoise although he has no idea what they are called. I also doubt that he knows his sports gear feature “chartreuse” and “teal.” His clothing color limitations are more gender-limited than word-limited.	episode_done:True

text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:On a good month I have £120. This is to be split on everything that's not groceries & basic household consumables, healthcare, rent or bills. So it's spent on going out, clothes, skincare, stuff for the house that's not consumables, presents, etc. I would spend £100-£200 on a new item of clothing, less on second-hand. So as you might guess, I don't buy a lot of clothes! What I buy I wear until THE END.   Edit: I should mention that I work part-time so I would spend less than an average person. It's a trade off - more time, less golds.	episode_done:True

text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:I was just thinking about this the other day because i feel like I have cracked the code! Maybe I'll do a whole post sometime. I'm also in the cusp/extended sizing realm of things.  Caveat - i only buy second hand, generally from ThredUp.   Favorite brands:  J.Jill and PureJill. I hear they have good sales if you prefer to buy new. Most items dont have tags at all, a LOT of 100% cotton items, and things are soft and loose in the best way. Partly because all sizes run half to a full size large.    Max Studio runs smaller, but they also have some extremely soft fabrics, and they have really good options for those tight skirts that you can wear with leggings and loose tops.    Eddie Bauer runs fairly large, very few synthetic blends, easy to find super duper cheap second hand.    More generally, I look at fabric content. Usually with my trusted brands and ALWAYS with anywhere new.  I find that the closer I get to 100% cotton or cashmere for things that Im wearing next to my skin (tops and dresses and sleep clothes) the more I go to that item over the long term.    I also like Aerie for underwear and leggings. A lot of seamless options and breathable fabrics.    And finally - sending so much love to my sensory sensitive ladies! I'm really glad this got posted and has had so much engagement.	episode_done:True
text:Unique brands/boutiques in your city?	labels:Paris there Was this boutique called Chemise Blanc and it literally just sold white blouses and shirts and it was INSPIRATIONAL. It taught me there were a million ways to have variation on one thing and be it unique and beautiful.  It was truly transformative for me to encounter this.

text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:Honestly I think you have to give way more detail on your old pair and what you’re looking for.  In my mind the biggest hurdle to perfect jeans is the fit, and since every body is different this is highly individual. Some people might prefer stretchier denim for a more forgiving fit, while others look for stiffer fabric, and have less leeway.   Personally I still struggle to find a high rise, non cropped, fits my thighs and waist, plain dark wash, straight/skinny, 90% or more cotton, pair of jeans. But hopefully I’ll find it eventually!

I feel that this type of graphics can be interchangeable. Any local graffiti artist could do something interesting. Noel is just famous.
text:Naked and Famous Raw Denim Review/Fit/Experience	labels:I’m a personal stylist who focuses JUST on women’s jeans and in all my years of experience I’ve only put raw denim on 2 of my clients for this exact reason. It’s too difficult to really nail the fit.... and if you do, there’s a good chance it’ll change as the jeans settle out or if your body changes. Plus, cutting around curves is super tough.   Raw denim is awesome in theory. It ages with you and confirms to your body. And the look of it over time is so cool. But I’ve almost never seen it work with women, especially in skinnier cuts. There’s just no give.   I would otherwise recommend vintage Levi’s or 100% cotton premium denim in a heartier weight for a more structured jean. The difference it that it’s been rinsed/washed so the fit is more predictable and longer lasting than raw denim.

text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:Oof, I definitely know those thoughts. I'm sorry your brain is being a jerk right now. <3  Something I've had some success with (and YMMV) is to constantly remind myself that "Clothes are supposed to fit ME, I'm under no obligation to fit THEM." If a pair of pants doesn't fit me comfortably, then the problem is with the pants, not my body. Items of clothing are inanimate objects and I owe them nothing. It's far from a perfect system and I don't always succeed, but it does help sometimes.  On a more practical front, have you considered using a tailor? From the problems you describe it sounds like you've got more of a waist-to-hip/leg difference than most brands allow for, and if that's the case, it's actually something that a tailor can fix pretty easily (and often relatively cheaply.) You would just buy pants that fit your legs comfortably and get the waist taken in. Fair warning, though: once you've worn clothes that actually fit you the way they're supposed to you'll never be satisfied with ill-fitting pieces again.	episode_done:True
text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:I moved from Seattle to the Midwest about a year ago and everything on my Christmas list was warm clothes because I kept being told how cold it gets. Thusfar they've had some of the mildest winters in years and NOW I am moving again to England where I have been told the weather is basically the same as Seattle. I definitely second what others have said about waiting until you need something to purchase. I am also glad I kept the clothes that I could wear freely in Seattle but get weird looks for in Nebraska for traversing the UK and Europe (post covid)	episode_done:True
text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Many years ago I moved from Hawaii to college in the Northeast. I would recommend 1) Buying it all there, because they'll have what's good for their climate and 2) starting out with cheaper options (thrifted, Old Navy, Target range) even if it's not quite your style. Don't spend much time, effort, and money until you see how you really feel after at least a year of seasons. Maybe you want warmer stuff than you thought you would, or realize you should invest in nicer socks, or discover you don't actually like turtlenecks, or shift to a different style when you're surrounded by a new area's vibe. Let yourself experience it for a bit without pressuring yourself to do it all right.

When I'm traveling, all the extra space in the bag is used for things like carrying a light cardigan, small water bottle, headphones, small notebook, and other necessities for the day. It's been great for it's versatility.  I've thought about the idea of getting a higher end purse, (I think the Neverfull Tote from LV looks nice) but I honestly can't seem to confidently justify spending 10x more on basically the same thing (large tote bag) I currently have. Would like to hear more on why people buy luxury items and their experiences!

I only wear them as an alternative to a scarf if I know I'm going to be outside all day and it's freezing cold. As soon as I go inside it's just _too_ hot, I feel like I'm going to pass out. It's like wearing a winter jacket and scarf in a sauna.

text:I love this answer, and I think that’s also why certain looks on certain people end up looking so costume-y. If a look is not authentic to your life and to who you are, it’s not going to have the effect you’re hoping to achieve.  The notion of appreciating fashion without feeling compelled to wear it yourself also ties into the conversations around cultural appropriation. As beautiful as I find traditional attire from other countries and cultures, or as cool as the fashion is in many countercultures, I don’t NEED to wear those outfits on my own body to appreciate and enjoy them.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Permanent Style - The Cold-Colour Capsule	labels:The way he handles the idea of cool/warm colors is strange. Like, he writes blue is a warm color. What? There aren't really, in itself, cool and warm colors, like, you can't say green as a whole is warm or cool. It's about undertones. You can easily find warm green and cool green, so is blue, so is every color.
text:Love your username!	labels:haha thank you! im actually a little embarrassed about my patronus, but that made me feel a bit better 😅	episode_done:True
text:How has your style grown/changed since before quarantine?	labels:Months of not being seen by anyone has helped me become more confident in whatever I want to wear - regardless of what anyone thinks. I stopped thinking "what will so-and-so be wearing" or "will I look too dressed \[up/down\]" and started wearing what I actually felt like. That has spilled over into the "not lockdown" part of my life and I feel amazing, because I broke a bad cycle of caring what anyone thinks. Because of this, I feel like I've finally figured out what my style is.	episode_done:True
text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.

text:Best way to buy clothes locally?	labels:There are websites that feature many different “local” boutiques that you can shop at with one click, so to speak. I use Trouva and Avocadostore to buy from different sustainable boutiques across Europe for clothes and home wear. I can even narrow my search to just my particular city. Even though I use one online site, I have to pay shipping if shopping from different stores. There is an incentive to shop at one place though, like they give a discount on shipping or something.   I know some local boutiques use farfetch as well.	episode_done:True

text:Your Chore Coat Isn’t Up to the Task	labels:The author of this article comes across as a pretentious loser, tbh.    Just be happy about people wearing things they think looks good for fuck’s sake. No one’s gonna be asking you for your fuckin tradesman credentials for wearin a jacket with four pockets. I look like a 16 year old on crack. No one gets on my ass about wearing Carhartt/Dickies/Ben Davis or whatever cause people *don’t care how you dress.*   These shits also didn’t just come into the mainstream from GQ and whatever the fuck in 2018. People have been wearing stuff like this since the 90’s. I’ve been wearing this type of stuff for 7+ years.    Anyways stop feeling self conscious of your masculinity and white collar job and wear chore coats and Carhartt and other workwear cause they’re fucking awesome. Feel self conscious about saying you “detox” from the city without irony instead. End rant.	episode_done:True

I went into it super skeptical but I think it was a worthy successor to Avatar, although I don't think anything can top that show (it was the only TV series I followed as a kid and I've rewatched it a ton since).
text:We had some rain here this week, (California), I got to wear mine for the first time since March.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:This... is not actually a problem.  You should have a certain amount of your what you make set aside for fun stuff (which should depend on your lifestyle and financial situation) and if you prioritize social activities and saving over clothing, there's nothing wrong with that.  Chances are that your friends are finding good deals because some of their leisure time is dedicated that, whether in person are online, so if that's not something you enjoy, you do you.  With the way things are going, in a few months time, you'll probably be thankful to have some money saved up.  Personally, I live in an area where, if you enjoy cooking and don't drink, shopping constitutes as going out, which means my discretionary income is mainly going to clothes.  I've been rebuilding my closet and the *most* I've spent in a month is $90 which... actually equated to a horrifying amount of, mostly thrifted, stuff (which was fortunate, since I axed most my spring/summer wardrobe and went for it about a week before lockdown.)  I do have years where I don't really buy clothes and that money will instead go to games, or uncommon ingredients, or art supplies, or going out.	episode_done:True

text:What is the breakdown of $ spent for various outfits you actually wear?	labels:This is a fun way to see how much I’ve spent on the hobby of dressing myself!   A lot of my stuff is secondhand so I paid a lot less for some of this. Thank fuck.   • €110~ Folk grey sweater  • €50~ APC charcoal t-shirt  • €100 Levi’s black slim jeans  • €60  Etnies grey sneakers or chocolate desert boots  • €140 minimum blue rain jacket  • €300 Vapaus Vorcut (casual watch)   = €760. But €460 without the watch.   I haven’t been in a situation this outfit wouldn’t suit in years. If anything I’m overdressed half the time. If I need to wear a tie I’ve already made several mistakes	episode_done:True
text:What are your favourite ways to style a black leather moto jacket?	labels:People have already covered the dresses, but the dress/leather jacket combo is for sure one of my favorite ways to style them. If there's enough room in the sleeves/body, i sometimes layer a hoodie underneath during colder weather for a more skater girl type of look. I love wearing it with a white top, light wash jeans, and my black leather combat boots (for me, doc martens but could be any boot with a similar color/texture to the jacket) bc i feel like a rocker from the 80s.

Why would they bring that back? It was terrible the first time around!" and *realized I sounded like my mother*.

text:Your 2021 trend predictions?	labels:Here in the states prior to march 2020, i was seeing a lot of texture. Recognizable styles with a twist on the texture (motorcycle jackets, but instead of leather, tweed; baseball jackets with dyed sherpa fleece sleeves and quilted satin torso).  For 2021? Maybe a continuation of that trend, plus your idea of matching sets. beyond jewelry, i think it will stretch to all accessories. matching masks and scrunchies, matching jewelry, matching hats and scarves as we roll through winter.	episode_done:True
text:Favorite outfit?	labels:I have a black long sleeve shirt I wear under a green plaid spaghetti strap dress with some black boots and knee socks. It’s cute and easy :D	episode_done:True
text:What is your favorite clothing/accessories subscription box?	labels:I've tried Trunk club and Allume. I felt like I got one or two nice things from Trunk Club but they never really nailed my style either. Allume actually put together some very cute outfits from a wide variety of brands. They did seem to understand my taste and many of the items I didn't purchase only because I owned something similar.
text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I often buy multiples of items I love. I bought several of the same cardigan after I realized that I wore it more than any other sweater I owned. It's great!  Another thing I do is, when I see an item I like, I mentally run through my closet and see if it will mesh with what I already own. If it works, I get it. If I'd have to buy several new items to make it work, I don't. For this reason, I don't own many t-shirts, but I do own lots of sweaters and dresses.
text:Is it just me, or does it seem like the clothes being sold since the pandemic began have become very limited?	labels:The supply chains have been disrupted and demand for certain items is probably way down. I still see plenty of options, even if it is slightly less variety than we're used to. I don't know how much of this applies to the fashion industry, but right now a lot of industries are shifting focus to more basic, broad appeal items because of limitations.	episode_done:True

text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:In my experience, style is more about HOW you wear your clothes than it is about the clothes themselves. My advice is to start with items you can wear every day like accessories, footwear, outerwear, hair/cosmetics that fit your style so you can mix those with your current wardrobe instead of having to buy a ton of new stuff all at once again.	episode_done:True

text:Yup. There are so many things I've seen on the Zara website that are photographed in that highly editorial style that have intrigued me enough to seek them out in-store, only to realize upon trying them on how badly made and ill-fitting they are in reality.

text:Feminist clothing	labels:I’m confused, what do you mean by “feminist clothing”? Do you just mean stuff with slogans on it?
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:Love this question! After I’ve determined my outfit, sometimes I have shoes already in mind if I want a specific silhouette, but if not I think about a purse and shoe combo to fit based on if I need to carry things or if I’ll be walking a bit. Most of my shoes, purses, and belts are either cognac brown leather (my weakness) or black leather, and in the styles I wear most like oxfords I like to have a version in each color leather.  Now that I think about it, the only color among my footwear is a pair of red pumps. Even my more casual shoes like Supergas are tan or white. I’d love to add more color to my footwear but I opt for quality first, which is more expensive, which makes me more likely to choose a color thats versatile (like cognac brown, which is again, my absolute weakness).	episode_done:True

text:How has your style grown/changed since before quarantine?	labels:I’ve been through so many different phases. In the beginning, I was used to dressing business casual for work and had very little loungewear since I usually just sleep in a big t-shirt or fleece pajamas. For the first few months, I still did a full face of makeup everyday and wore a dress or a skirt just to work remotely. I also was obsessed with The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel during this time lol so I was always dressed in feminine florals, bouncy curls, and bright red lipstick.   However, since then I’ve somehow become more of a pants person? I used to exclusively wear dresses and skirts every day but now I find comfort in a good paperbag pant or soft lived in jeans. I also have gradually dulled my previously pastel color scheme into a few neutral pieces that all go together. My wardrobe has definitely become more practical and comfortable and honestly it’s hard to see myself going back to my old ways.	episode_done:True

Grey is a neutral tone.  I understand if the premise excludes navy, but if it does, shouldn't th title be a "Neutral-Colour Capsule" or something like that?

Personally, most of the skirts I chose to wear were 100% cotton denim, leather, or suede!

If you need to have new clothes now, buy some things you are absolutely sure you like and they will fit, but dont buy too much, don't spend too much money, just in case something goes wrong.
text:I was also considering getting the Mulberry Alexa (which I wanted back in the day), but it reads a little too cutesy to me, and in general Mulberry I associate with upper middle class 40+ Londoner, though I think their designs are really beautiful.   Agree with you on Chloe designs being nice but too trendy/iconic, I swear when I was younger there were so many nice bag designs (celine luggage, alexander wang cylinder satchel, proenza schouler etc.). I just can't with the boxy BV bags either or any bags that look like a hard square...  Feel like these bags are going to be out before they are in. Heavy branding on YSL bags has already cheapened their look to me. Love Cos/Madewell bags but the colour selection is boring (just black/tan). Meh!

Yeah, because every single country on earth hates Donald Trump and the Republicans so much that they'd be on board with perpetrating a massive conspiracy that has killed more than a million people and sent the global economy into a recession.  Never does the thought occur that had Trump and the GOP just responded to it like people that actually possess empathy and compassion for other human beings, they could have rode a wave of popularity into a White House victory and maybe even flipped the House back.

Just do it and after the first couple of times it'll feel easy. Anybody who is rude to you has the problem, not you, but it's never happened to me, including while shopping in other countries - - in Japan I wouldn't fit in most women's clothes, so I basically have to shop the men's and they seemed to think it was interesting and were happy to make the sale.  Maybe not the most apposite comment for your situation but wanted you to have the perspective that there are a lot of reasons you might be shopping there so you don't even have to feel like you're under undue scrutiny.

text:What are your most loved ride-or-die winter clothing items?	labels:How fun to hear how different places make such a difference in what you need for winter! Great question, as we are having snow as we speak! Winter here (inter mountain west US) lasts til April when we might see the ground again, so warm, wind proof and dry are key attributes for clothing for keeping you alive and well. We like Sorel boots with the heavy felt liners for below zero outdoor activities. But since they’re lighter LLBean insulated boots for snowshoeing and general wear around town . Inside the house  the warmest footwear is Hafflinger felt clogs. Socks we use heavy wool blend Darn Tough. All of these items last a long time so worth the money. Since we’re both retired we don’t have to gussy up much so I only need one or two warm  long skirts for church. He likes Duluth work jeans and plaid flannel shirts and always a ball cap on his head. I have a couple of fleece jackets (Columbia) and 2 Orvis cashmere sweaters that were on sale 2 years ago. For me under the sweaters I like 3/4 or short sleeve t-shirts . Neither of us likes turtle neck shirts. Our outdoor coats are: his Columbia and mine Jack Wolfskin both with integrated hood. A surprisingly warm kind of gloves is Kinko work gloves. They come in mittens as well as regular gloves, but need to be waterproofed before shoveling snow. They are very reasonable in price and sturdy. If it’s below zero and blowing out a nice wool scarf to protect your face. We don’t need snow pants or long underwear for our daily walks, but probably would for snowshoeing.

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:First for cardigans and sweaters is I either go fully wool or fully cotton. Can’t be any sort of blend, and I avoid mohair. I have a cotton cardigan from urban outfitters that’s like 5-6 years old and looks brand new, so you don’t even need to go super pricey, just look at fabric content.  Second is I wash everything on cold, and hang dry as often as possible. Heat basically transforms fabric, so using it is unnecessary. I also find that it sets pit stains instead of removes them.  Shoes I have no idea. I walk a lot and constantly wear out shoes. I find leather with a sewn in sole lasts a lot longer, but flats and heels never last that long. I’ve also had luck with shoes that have wooden soles which I’ve added a sole with traction to.  For bags, I’ve always heard it’s bad luck to keep them on the ground, but that’s more superstition than keeping it nice lol.

text:IMO - the quality of the fabric does not justify paying the retail price. The construction is on par with all other high fashion brands and I often find no loose construction threading which is indicative of good QC. Whether that justifies the $500 upcharge vs a quality denim brand would be up to you to decide.   I find they make an excellent  taupe, pebble, and white five pocket that works well with tailoring. I would not suggest getting their indigo or washed colorations.   My suggestion would be to purchase their casual bottoms second hand which are routinely found for sub $300-$400 on eBay in 9/10 condition or BNWT.	labels:Good advice. Thank you	episode_done:True

text:What are your most loved ride-or-die winter clothing items?	labels:A parka I got from Target last year. It wasn't even $50, and it's the *warmest* jacket I've ever had in my life. I live in the northeast, where the snow and wind can be brutal, and I was used to spending upwards of $150 on coats that didn't even do anything.  I'm in the process of losing weight, so I figured spending $50 on a winter coat I would wear for maybe two seasons wasn't bad at all. Cue my surprise when I spent a weekend in the Adirondacks last November, where everybody else around me was freezing, and I'm snug as a bug in my cheap Target winter jacket!  I'm hoping come next winter, it'll still fit well enough to be warm, because it's honestly my favorite winter clothing purchase I've ever made.

text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:>	This system seems okay to me, but I don't really know how to differentiate each category based on function. For example, with the system I work with now, button-downs I wear in formal situations are currently grouped with tops I wear in informal situations AND workout-tops I wear for exercising. And this stresses me out so, so much. Then there's the issue of how effective my groupings are; like, should crop tops be with tank tops? Or maybe they're more like tees? And how do I deal with seasonal clothes?   You’re way overthinking it. You don’t have to be so strict about the categories or follow a plan to a T. Do what feels natural/right to you. If it doesn’t end up working, change it. It’s not set in stone.   1.	How do you mentally construct an outfit?  I would use those groupings because that’s what you already gravitate to. I personally sort by general type, then seasonality or formality. For example, my dresses/pants are split into formal (eg cocktail dress and up) and everything else. Within those subgroups, I sort by color.  Skirts are only sorted by color. Tops are split into sleeveless/short sleeved/long sleeved (3/4 sleeves go here), and those groups are subsorted by color.  Workout/swimwear/PJs/sweaters/underwear/socks/leggings/bras are their own categories that get dedicated drawer sections for their specific groups.  2.	Crop tops would be sorted by sleeves with other tops.  3.	worn but not dirty clothes go on a purposely dedicated row of hooks the wall (basically a fancy coat hook array that you might see in an entryway).  I’ve done this since I was a child and recommend.	episode_done:True

Natural is always better, generally speaking (excluding rayon/bamboo which is a natural derived synthetic, but including tencell which is eucalyptus.) And construction matters too, as does fabric weave. It’s so hard to judge quality online! I usually judge by touch and fabric hand and stitching quality. I have a degree in fashion design though so touch is the easiest way for me to identify a fabric! Personally I avoid nylon or polyester and consider it cheap. It is rarely high quality unless it is a high performance weave or treated, and even then it gets stinky easily. I only wear it for technical outdoor gear, like for hiking or swimming, for everyday wear, natural is always worth paying more!	episode_done:True

text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:Actually, this is a great time to address this. Once you come out of the pandemic, people will have somewhat forgotten what your normal is so you can set a new tone. Dress it up the first few times you see people and it will set the tone for a new normal. No one will even think it's weird because I bet everyone is sitting at home just wishing they would wear anything other than sweats. So, for the first couple of times at least, make sure you dress up. After that it'll be your normal. I kinda dealt with this too. I live in the bay area, the most people wear here are jeans and a tee. I hate it so will go with dresses and other things often and feel really overdressed. I realized that for me the best way to not feel weird about that was to dress down my shoes. So wearing ankle boots was the fanciest I would go with shoes and that was only on rare occasions. Most of the time I would pair sandals or sneakers with my outfits and look like I fit in again.	episode_done:True

text:THIS. I have been working on a lot of \~self improvement\~ this year and part of making my goals for 2021 has been distinguishing "the person I aspire to be" from "the person I am willing to be" from "the person I can afford to be."   I too have been on a journey to live a budget life of luxury especially when it comes to things like matching lingerie all the time and sleepwear and what I've realized is that I'm not actually interested in luxurious sleepwear. I'm actually interested in being the person that has two hours to unwind every night, takes a warm bath in a massive tub with a v expensive lush bath bomb, does a full face care routine, brushes her hair out, has little tinctures on her vanity to apply just a bit of perfume, puts on a silk gown, lights a candle, reads in bed, and turns out her lamp at a generous 9:30pm.   The truth is that the desire for the sleepwear is really a desire to have more silence, more time spent on me, and more time doing things that look and feel good simply because I like them and not because they serve any kind of real function.   I have moved away from using old t-shirts because I like the idea of dedicated sleepwear but I usually just go with a solid color cami / tank top / shirt and either some shorts or some sweat pants depending on how cold it is. They're cheaper but still look thoughtful.	labels:I want to be the same person as you but psyche myself out of it.   I always want to take a long relaxing bath but the reality of cleaning the bath first, then relaxing, the  showering off the remains of the bath bomb and washing my hair if i havent already. When it comes to it i feel like it’s a time sink. I also prefer to be alone in the house so I know I wont be interrupted.   I also want to always have perfume on but feel like it’s a waste to wear it round the house. I only bother lighting candles when i have hours for it to burn evenly.   I do the full skincare every day and hair masks and face masks fairly regularly and feel really good when i have shaved moisturised legs and clean sheets but relaxing baths are something I want but never seem to manage.	episode_done:True

text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I have a pretty extensive budget that I still have plenty of room for clothes shopping in! I have had a budget since I started working professionally 3 years ago.  I have three sections: Bills (phone, rent, student loans, power etc), Expenses (food, gas, “fun”) and Savings (anything I’m saving up for: laptop, trips, gifts, my niece’s college fund, hobbies, and clothes! As well as an emergency fund where everything else goes).  I generally consider the clothing fund to be a low priority so I set about $40 a paycheque to it, but I don’t necessarily spend that much every two weeks. I also usually cap it at $500, where if it’s grown to that amount then I take my $40 every two weeks and put it to something else.   Generally I don’t spend all of it before a new paycheque comes along but if I do, I will use some of my “fun” money in expenses to cover the rest.   I have gotten two pay increases in the last two years as well as moved houses twice + paid off my loan (different bill amounts) so whenever I readjust my budget I start with my bills, generally keep my fun + grocery amounts the same, and then increase my savings categories a bit while mostly prioritizing putting the excess into my emergency account. When I started working I think I was setting aside $20 or $25 for clothes, now up to $40.  Maybe more long-winded than you wanted but that’s the jist :)	episode_done:True
text:Just how revolutionary is Harry Styles’ Vogue cover?	labels:Women look better in dresses.  You can be as progressive and woke as you want, and encourage whatever you want so people can express themselves, but aesthetics dont care about that stuff. Womens clothing is typically styled to cater to the female (sex) body. People always comment on the dress itself, or whether it works, but never how that same outfit would just look better on a female.  This is a matter of aesthetic and taste to some extent, and thinking that men generally look bad in dresses is a justified opinion.

text:Polo is the hardest sub-brand to place. To simplify, there are two different tiers: department store Polo and RL store Polo. If you buy it from a department store  you'll get clothing at that level -- made pretty cheaply, a lot of basics, materials aren't special, etc. I can't remember if suits are half or full canvassed  At an RL or Polo store, though, some of it is pretty good. They have runway stuff. Some cowichans that will remind you of RRL's. I don't know if they still make Polo suits in the US or Italy, but if they do, those might be fully canvassed. Maaaybe some c&j footwear, although that's still mostly RLPL. Of course, most of this stuff will be overpriced, and still not actual RRL quality.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I love this comment. It’s so freeing to appreciate fashion (and fashion photography) as an art and not only from a consumer perspective or through the lens of your own wardrobe needs. I have tons of Pinterest boards for aesthetics that are totally impractical for me, but I just enjoy looking at them and imagining the lifestyle of those characters. I only have a couple of boards that are for items I would practically wear. Those boards have purpose too, but I have a definite mental distinction between looking at outfits for fun and trying to fill holes in my wardrobe.	labels:	episode_done:True

Good news is that I only buy 3 or 4 new items a year as stuff wears out (gets more holes than I can patch). Occasionally I can get stuff second hand or thrifted which is nice. In the scheme of things clothing doesn't work out that expensive, my helmet is over 600, chaps 200, other gear I wear 200, chainsaw 3000.	episode_done:True

text:What are your predictions for 2021 suit style?	labels:I would say that suits in general have been on the downtrend among white-collar types; a lot of jobs just don’t demand it anymore. I think the pandemic and bankruptcies you mentioned may push that trend further, but it was already on its way.  As far a changes in the style of common suits: I think super wide/skinny lapels are definitely on their way out (if they’re not already there), looser fits may make a comeback, and I feel that somewhat bolder colors might be a bit more popular.   As for the more fashion-forward: I feel like I’ve been seeing more belted suits, skirt suits/skirts + blazers (on men; @ Harry Styles), and asymmetric details. Obviously that’s getting into the world of fashion show stuff, so it doesn’t influence most of us that much, but it’s worth talking about.
text:Underwear review: Soma vs. Parade after 6 months	labels:In terms of lace pilling, I've always had the best luck with Calvin Klein.

text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:It’s different for me now that I’m in my 30s and working full time. I’d guess around 10% of my salary (after taxes) averaged out... like some months I spend a lot more, others I don’t buy anything.   Back when I was in college, I did a lot of thrifting and shopping clearance racks! I still like second hand shopping and getting a good deal,  but now saving up for high quality items feels a lot more feasible.  Back in college when I really could only expect tiny amounts of money left over from my income after I paid my bills, it was much more fun to buy a pair of crazy leggings for $5 off the target clearance rack then to try to save up for something nice.  I also feel like I thought of shopping as a fun activity! It was much cheaper to go to the thrift store with my BFFs and get a fun/weird new outfit than to go for dinner and a movie.	episode_done:True

text:Women who have moved for extended periods of time on 1 or 2 suitcases only, how did you do it? Here's the beginning of my process	labels:Vacuum bags and packing cubes, and find square trunks or even boxes that are the maximum size that the airline will allow. Also, if you have a relative/friend that might come visit you leave a bag with them and pay the luggage fee.   For a less minimalist feel, look into some workhorse peices- I usually go for solid dresses or solid blouses + skirts. Then accessorize your little maximalist heart out. It's amazing how many scarves you can cram into a small packing cube. Maybe add a few chains of different lengths and pendants that can switch between them, &t. Just think small things that make the outfit different.   Finally, don't underestimate how different you can look and feel changing your perfume and lipstick- both of which are easy to pack.  ps: artsy facemasks are also a thing for a bit longer.

I wash my jeans every 5-8 wears same as other pants because all of mine bag out regardless. Sweaters I usually handwash every 1-2 years lol.

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls” catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your “fashion house designers” but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I’ve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:First for cardigans and sweaters is I either go fully wool or fully cotton. Can’t be any sort of blend, and I avoid mohair. I have a cotton cardigan from urban outfitters that’s like 5-6 years old and looks brand new, so you don’t even need to go super pricey, just look at fabric content.  Second is I wash everything on cold, and hang dry as often as possible. Heat basically transforms fabric, so using it is unnecessary. I also find that it sets pit stains instead of removes them.  Shoes I have no idea. I walk a lot and constantly wear out shoes. I find leather with a sewn in sole lasts a lot longer, but flats and heels never last that long. I’ve also had luck with shoes that have wooden soles which I’ve added a sole with traction to.  For bags, I’ve always heard it’s bad luck to keep them on the ground, but that’s more superstition than keeping it nice lol.

text:Brooks Brothers's Future Looks a Lot Like Menswear’s Past	labels:* Less SKUs. The amount of stuff BB sells is overwhelming.  * Do away with there weirdly named fit system. Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.

Almost every woman I know is bloody sick and tired of not getting to dress up, not being able to wear lipstick, not having places to wear heels and vacation outfits. People would literally go crazy and it truly would be the roaring twenties. Dresses of all types, miniskirts, sparkle and glitter, heels for days, fun fabrics, bolder colors, leather pants, blouses with impractical sleeves, statement earrings – women would really be dressing to the nines *and* wearing bold lipstick colors to compliment.

text:That's funny, I have also read an absurd amount of litterate on MM, and I have the exact opposite thoughts of her. I think she was a very smart business woman, who knew how to play the game - I don't think being sweet and naive would carry you to the top in 1950's Hollywood. Especially not when she started off as an orphan with nothing to her name.    That being said, I don't think being conniving when you work in the entertainment industry, is evil or anything. I think it's really hard (actually impossible) to project an image as consistently as she did, without being incredibly self aware. She could have internalized misogyny, but she could have also played the "cool girl" in order to win approval.	labels:But see, don’t most women who do “cool girl” have internalized misogyny though?   Also wasn’t MM pretty much abused by her studio? It doesn’t seem very astute or a smart business decision of MM to not have changed studios or given them a side eye. So why didn’t she?  It doesn’t take a lot of brains to make it to the top like MM did, plenty of other pretty girls have done it before and after her. What takes brains is staying at the top and still staying relevant.

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:Sustainable consumption complicated and everyone is going to have their own ways to go about it. It's good that you're keeping and using what you buy for years (no matter what the brand), so that's a start.  Synthetics are made of plastic and can release microplastics into the environment when they are worn and washed. Cotton takes up lots of land and water. Leather lasts way longer than pleather but then you have the cruelty aspect and tanning leather does require a lot of harmful chemicals. Expensive doesn't always mean ethical, but ethical clothing does tend to cost more. There is always going to be a footprint - not buying anything at all is probably the safest and most sustainable way but obviously we still need things now and then!   It's taken me YEARS to change my habits and transition to a better wardrobe, and even then I'm still not fast fashion-free. I had to wait to use up what I had and be able to afford something better. It took time to refine and define my style to determine what pieces would give me the most mileage. Each person will have to determine what is important to them when it comes to sustainability. Like, I'm not very picky about my purses but I tend to vet my shoes and what my options are when it comes time to repair or dispose of them.	episode_done:True

I miss going to the office and feeling cute, and being seen by others. A woman I work with told me ‘you always have the cutest dresses’ about a year ago and I absolutely loved hearing that. I’ve learned in quarantine that I don’t dress for myself, I dress for other people.   I’ll probably dress up a bit more when I can go back and wear more lipstick, since I’ve been in comfy slouch mode for so long.

text:Sculptural Fashion Inspiration Album	labels:Not a regular poster here but I wanted to stop and thank you for this album and the conversations it's inspired. I've never really taken the time to consider the purpose behind this kind of wild stuff. It's always seemed like kind of a joke, or a deliberate waste of resources.  Zoolander-y, if you will.   Having read through the comments I'm really warming to the idea of, to borrow a phrase I just learned here, "fashion as pure art" without a purpose other than to experiment with fabrication and create something nobody's seen before.   Even as a jeans+t-shirt wearer I think after a second look I can see at least one desirable trait in every single image, even if I wasn't down with the whole ensemble outright (though I was more into more of them than I expected, too).  Definitely more interesting than another post about dress shoes or sweaters.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: what does your shopping process look like?	labels:I'm a year into a wardrobe overhaul so the current system is, 1) consult my ridiculously extensive list, 2) walk the whole store, touch everything, pick up way too much, 3) edit, 4) try on, if possible, 5) check fabric content &refer back to the list, 6) leave with maybe one item.  I stopped impulse buying a for while, but I've realized that the wilder stuff I like is consistent, so I have a list for that too (current craving is chartreuse.)  I adore prints though, so now I make myself just take a picture if the fit/colours don't make sense for me.  Actual impulse buys are now either really practical pieces with prints or loud colour (i.e. my bright purple turtleneck,) or things that feel nice with weird cuts.  I don't shop online much, since I get either overwhelmed by choice or frustrated that I can't find exactly what I'm looking for, and most my enjoyment comes from touching all the things, which is now bad, so I've been using Depop since quarantine started mainly because if feels...more casual or something.  I'll hop on it when I'm bored, do a quick search on whatever I was thinking of, like a ton of stuff, save whatever actually looks like it'll fit and is a good deal, and either buy it immediately or sit on it until it goes on sale.	episode_done:True
text:From 'Doctor Who' to 'Outlander': How Fans Craft Reverse Engineer Knits	labels:Thanks for sharing this article! I've been knitting for over 20 years, and I would love to try my hand at some replica design, I just have to get through more of my queue and stash first.   I'm always excited when pop culture knits inspire more people to get into knitting. I've found taking this step to make my own socks and accessories to be eye opening about the value of garments and clothing. And as one of the interviewed knitters said, it is very fun to chose different fibers and yarn weights to make exactly what you want in the project.

text:Shitpost Saturday: Fashion AITA	labels:I am fairly well-known in my community for my unique fashion sense, ropes of pearls, zebra-striped roadster, and two-tone hair. A woman I knew from my school days has a lot of spotted dogs. When I commented that they would make a beautiful coat, she became offended! AITA?   Edit to add: My husband is a furrier, if that helps your decision.  Edit again to add: I may also be a lot older than the woman with the spotted dogs and have a red and black roadster and no husband, depending.

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I got my first fancy bag after calling off my wedding lol I figured it cost around the same amount as the dress I wouldn’t ever wear so why not? The woman at the LV store thought I was on drugs ... “are you celebrating something?” And I’m like as a matter of fact, yes, yes I am. I just lost a ton of money on a wedding but I dodged a bullet and left that POS. All she said was “well you can always make more money” anyway, I’m getting a Chanel bag for my next milestone birthday. Not sure which one but it’s gonna happen soon.

If you don't wear them much, then perhaps bright colours are not for you, at least now, and you won't have spent much to find out.	episode_done:True

text:Overhauling my wardrobe with lasting pieces	labels:I would generally be cautious of "cut out the middle-man" or "luxury without the logo" companies - I'm sure some of them exist that make genuinely good products but there's a lot of them that don't come anywhere near the quality. It's often just another sales pitch.  I'd also be cautious with trying to buy a new wardrobe all at once, especially with the goal of everything in it lasting a long time, as tastes and bodies both change. If you happen to stay in the same place aesthetically and physically for the next ten years, more power to you, but having been here a while I'd say that kind of thing is rare.
text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:I absolutely have this dilemma too. I’m starting to invest in more modest professional clothes for my personal time. At first it was hard because I kept being drawn to what’s popular at the moment that are more casual but I’m starting to find things I don’t mind wearing to a friends dinner or the office. Ex: sheath dresses	episode_done:True
text:I like working with my local cobbler way more than the AE recraft service. In addition to being able to customize every detail, my local cobbler has never lost any of my shoes (AE has lost or couldn’t recraft 3 pairs).

text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Some websites (department stores, ASOS) have a true fit tool where you put in your measurements, body type, and well fitting item of clothing and that information is used to recommend sizing.   It’s also a good idea to know your measurements in general if you’re buying secondhand as many sellers will list the measurements of the garment.  But overall sizing can be so wild within one brand, much less across multiple that I dint think there’s much of a rule of thumb.

text:There was a reddit shower thought awhile back about how Dads are like time capsules because they wear whatever was popular / in style when they had kids... as if they just stopped buying clothes and keeping up with trends once they had the first kid.  It seems like mid-20s/early-30s white guys in tech are the same. Based on what they're wearing, you can tell when they first started paying attention to how they dress. And they're all convinced that whatever they wear is timeless or classic, without recognizing that they just bought in to whatever was trending at that time (menswear, minimalism, streetwear, etc.) and that they already are starting to look dated.	labels:I dunno about this. I've been watching a lot of 70s-80s horror schlock and one thing has stuck out is how often people look normal, with the Cool People looking really out of time. It seems like around sometime in the early 80s, things just sort of...stuck and your average casual clothes haven't changed too much. If you go back to the 50s, people weren't really dressed like today, but 40 years ago it's all jeans and tees. Sure we erred on the side of slim when the Big Internet Fashion Boom of 2012 happened, but the fundamentals stick around and if all you do is buy 501s and the OCBD you get off the rack at whatever store is closest, you'll probably look Fine, which is what 90% of the people coming through here care about and also assume other people care about.	episode_done:True

text:What's the greatest length you've gone to obtain a much coveted fashion item?	labels:When I was in middle school, I saw a sweater on a fashionable outfits Twitter page. I reverse googled the image to find it came from a shop in the UK (I’m in the US). Forgot about conversion and I ended up paying over $60 just for the sweater, not including shipping. My parents were so angry I spent all the money I had on one single clothing item but I still have the sweater about 10 years later and it continues to be a staple item
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:From 2001-2005, clothing I wore as a high schooler/college kid: low rise bootcut jeans, fitted graphic tshirts, fitted polo shirts, fitted shirts in general (shirts were so tight- maybe that’s why we layered??), always layering shirts- and shirts were super long and over your hips, but tight- never tucking them in, cutoff denim skirts, cotton shorts (like soffees) with words on the butt, necklace with my first initial on it, platform flip flops, dresses with Hawaiian prints (like flowers or surfers etc), hoop earrings, fitted hoodies. That’s what I can remember.
text:This is such a good point and I think it's the reason I struggle with my style. I live in a working class rural area, and the fashion is more geared towards sportswear. It's a struggle to marry how I want my wardrobe to be with my surroundings.	labels:that is how i feel every time i go home to visit my parents, who live in a rural town in NH. i feel like an eyesore with my heeled booties and oversized jackets and pink hair and all black when everyone else is wearing hiking shoes and camo.   i feel pressured to conform (why?!) but i want to be my own person. it's a hard balance.	episode_done:True
text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:I've taken a couple of laps before writing this comment, but up-front I think aesthetics section should be split, because I think the most basic question, which is answered aesthetically but not functionally, is what do you want your clothes to **do**? Giving off a vibe is mentioned, but there's an even more functional level of "are these clothes sensible for how I live my life?" Are you buying lots of hawaiian shirts even though live at the north pole, or buying down parkas when you live in Hawaii? Do you regularly find yourself cold and wet because you don't own any raincoats, or find that your fishnet sleeves keep getting caught on the mill in the machine shop, or that your raw denim really doesn't give you the flexibility you need to dance?   I think what the clothes do should meet you where you do what you do, and at the most basic level that's physically enabling you to do things, and you can build a vibe from that.

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items are my Native American Turquoise jewelry and my cowboy boots. Just purchased a huge $900 squash blossom necklace and have worn it constantly. My boots range from $30 for a secondhand pair to $750 for custom made and none are worn more or less than the others.  When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was “saving for good”. Ironically, “good” apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I’m just out running errands.

text:Women who have moved for extended periods of time on 1 or 2 suitcases only, how did you do it? Here's the beginning of my process	labels:I travel for work often, or I use too. Yay COVID. I usually spent at minimum 1 month and maximum 6 months, it’s usually 3 months.   When I pack I only take 2 weeks worth of clothes. I like you and NOT a minimalist. But when I pack I make sure things are all mix and match, sort of a capsule. That doesn’t mean I don’t have a few louder pieces, I just make sure that it will go with a few other things. Like a crazy top can go with pants, a skirt and the jacket. I always have a scarf and hat.   Look into extra baggage from the airline. I often check luggage for work, in excess to my personal luggage. Work pays for it. I’m taking west coast US to India, west coast US to eastern Africa long flights. It is usually around $200US, which is a lot, but for a year it might be worth it you. Also you can ship things via UPS, DHL etc. they do less expensive freight options. I work with people who will ship personal things ahead of them.
