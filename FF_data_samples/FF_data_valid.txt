text:Shopping for clothing items you already own: confessions of an outfit repeater	labels:My issue is I buy 80 percent of my wardrobe from thrift stores.

But when I find something I love and buy it brand new I always buy two!	episode_done:True

text:BBall Low is like a sleek Air Force 1, basically, so there are def some options. Greats Royale and Court could do it. Everlane Court is also very similar but no perforations. Koio Metro also a similar vibe. Beckett Simonon Garcia is basically a BBall Low copy straight up. Those are all I can think of off the top of my head, but I'm sure there are plenty more.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I would hold of on buying anything until you get a sense of your style. I would look at End clothing, Mr. Porter, SSense, and No Man Walks Alone to get some ideas. It's a long process and you don't want to make expensive mistakes. You should also shop at fast fashion places like H&M and Uniqlo to try out styles without spending big bucks. You should also read the sidebar of this subreddit to get ideas and inspiration.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:I always need to have a black peacoat for cold weather, since it's super stylish and goes with every outfit! A pair of slim-fitting, black combat boots is also essential for me. I can wear them in so many different ways to add an instant edge to an outfit. For example, I'll wear them with dark-wash skinny jeans and a floral tank top or pair them with a sundress. So many options!   I have to admit that boots of all kinds are my shoe of choice. I'll even wear them with shorts in the summer!
text:Being a combat boot person myself, i just posted elsewhere in this thread that I have a black wool peacoat that I love. But I'm too self conscious to actually wear it very often - i feel like a total fraud in my gothy and sensible  BDUs and combat boots, and a fancy ass peacoat. Like, who do I think i am, to trying to pretend I'm fancy when I'm clearly too low class for such frippery.	labels:I went through this too with my first peacoat. But they are awesome and go with a lot of things. Just lie to yourself and pretend that you're power clashing. Or rewatch Boondock Saints and decide that you're a badass.	episode_done:True

text:>I'm too scarred from growing up homeschooled lmao  Solidarity, friend! I see and appreciate them on other people, but I will never wear one. I'd get flashbacks to waist-length ponytails in scrunchies and oversized hand-me-down church t-shirts tucked into mid-calf denim skirts and worn with dirty trainers and bunchy socks. Which actually sounds on trend for 2020, LMAO.	labels:My ~trendy public school~ friends used to laugh at me all the time for only being allowed to wear long skirts & boxy oversized shirts. I have severe PTSD from my childhood, but I can also cry/laugh now about how cool I would have been if only I had been born a decade later.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 26, 2020	labels:what brands should I look out for relaxed/relaxed taper fit pants and jeans? my budget is ~$150, stretch fabric would be nice as well, but rigid is fine too  I've outgrown most of my wardrobe and need some new pants. I used to get pants from JCrew & BR mostly, but they don't really carry what I want. I always find stuff too narrow
text:You say you've tried BR but their Athletic Tapered Fit sounds exactly like what you would like.  If you've tried it and don't like it I suggest searching for that term from other brands.	labels:Thanks. I've tried it and find it too narrow, but maybe sizing up and tailoring the waist is a good idea. J.Crew's athletic fit is hit or miss for me, I have a few pairs that fit and some that are too tight. Maybe I'll just start sizing up though   taylor stitch's democratic fit looks promising so I might try that as well
text:That sounds like a good idea. It's a bit more expensive but that's just how it's going to be with an irregular body shape.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:I know I'll get alot of hate for this, but leggings are NOT pants. Sure, its cute with an oversized sweater that covers your booty and some nice boots or if you wanna workout or lounge around at home. But I always thought it was weird when adults where leggings like they're pants. I know they're comfortable but I don't think they should be considered "fashionable" imo.   Leggings look cute on toddlers tho.
text:I think it depends on the leggings.. if they are good quality then I think they work well with certain outfits. I love wearing them with an oversized jumper, my also oversized long wool style coat, a big scarf and Docs.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Feminist clothing	labels:I have to laugh at a request for feminist clothing being downvoted on a women's fashion sub.    The ladies who fought tooth and nail so yall could vote, own property, have careers, and take for granted the notion that you can be your own person would be *so proud*.
text:I was not expecting this to apparently be controversial.	labels:Because it's honestly a bit weird? Like why wouldn't you simply donate money/goods to a charity/shelter? Or volunteer? It doesn't take much effort on your part, and it helps your local community. Or as someone else said, support local seamstresses and use their services.  Idk, to me clothing with feminist statements will always scream "i need to let people know how woke I am without actually doing anything"
text:Idk about OP but I live in a county that voted nearly 80/20 for Trump in this past election. Having a couple of "performative" shirts, car stickers, or yard signs is a good way to show that the 20% exists and is hopefully going to grow it, *along with* "actually doing something".	labels:Giving visible support to a politician who is trying to run a fascist out of the office is a bit different than wanting to find more brands with empty slogans and #bossbabe ceos.
text:I'm not talking about having Biden signs or Bernie decals, I'm talking about things like a "Teaching Is Political" shirt, Hate Has No Home Here sign, a Human Rights Campaign sticker, etc. And I personally would equate all of those to stuff with feminist messages on them.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I bought these very popular aritzia melina leather pants..an inspo album and fit pictures	labels:Are they worth the hype do you think?
text:They have fit issues (please see my fit photos) and do not work well with people that have curves. My pictures are taken mid day when im most bloated but I definitely have gapping in them. Whiskering is also a sign of poor fit as well. I do not think they are worth the price and know that you can get dupes at zara and express. I have not had them long though (the tag is still on them in pictures) so I am not sure on how well they wear over time. I know a lot of complaints of faux leather is that it peels or chips. The faux leather of these pants feels very very soft which i find nice but I worry about scratching them too. Stretching is something I worry about because of the gapping I am getting but I have not had these long. My issues with them so far is that the inside kinda itches when touching my legs and they do make a slight swishing noise	labels:I think whiskering is par for the course for any type of fitted thick faux leather pant. Stretching would probably be more of a problem with real leather pants over faux leather, the faux kind is usually pretty static. I think if you just got an inch or two off the bottom they would look good!	episode_done:True

text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:Check out if there is a "Buy Nothing" (or similar) group on Facebook for your area. I see posts for clothing items all the time. Most commonly, I see posts for clothing swap trains where someone posts a bag of clothing in X size, and it get's passed on to the first person interested who then takes whatever they like from it and add in their unwanted clothing to the bag, then passes that bag to the next person interested.  As for how to make those decisions on what to get rid of - I started putting all of the "nice but I don't wear it" items in a box in my closet. I give the item several months and if I never reach for it, then I know it is time to let it go. If I do end up deciding that it is a good component to an outfit, then it gets hung back up in my closet. Right now though, I am putting a moratorium on all of my "work" outfits since I also am working from home and my daily outfit is basically slippers + sweat pants/yoga pants + t shirt.	episode_done:True

text:Just singing the praises of wool	labels:I LOVE wool. It's amazing. It's warm, doesn't get stinky as fast as thin cheaper materials, it absorbs 30% of the moisture around it so it doesn't catch fire as fast...I could go on, don't even get me started on wool socks! So cozy. I knit and weave and it has really taught me to love natural fibers such as wool and linen. Plus, making my own garments has really taught me to appreciate the work that goes into a quality piece of clothing and how to take care of them so they last extra long!	episode_done:True

text:Fellow clothing trackers, what coveted items are you tracking now?	labels:I'm afraid of telling y'all and leading you to buy it from in front of me, but maybe you'll sell to me instead?  A specific Kit and Ace cashmere scarf - I think "Shay" line - specifically the cream/black printed one that is absolutely huge. I had one, it was my favorite, and I lost it. The brand stopped making it years ago. I have written to them asking them to make more or sell me an archive - no dice. I almost paid $80 used for one that was bundled with several other things I didn't want, just for the one scarf - but someone outbid me (I should have done with $200 or something insane). I'm heartbroken	episode_done:True
text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:No longer dating but I would go for an outfit that  1) reflected my overall everyday style (which is pretty casual)  2) incorporates one or two of my all time favorite pieces from my wardrobe--things I feel best in  3) some mildly romantic flair to it  My last first date I wore olive green jeans, my everyday tan Sperry's (I debated wearing tan wedges but decided since we'd be walking a lot I went for comfort) and a favorite top of mine: a red rosey floral print with black lace sleeves. I was comfy, wearing my favorite clothes, and liked to think I was subtly dressed like a rose~	episode_done:True

text:Chelsea boots under €200	labels:Honestly... if your feet aren't done growing just pick up a pair of ASOS brand chelseas. Not many other brands under $300 attempt the sleek SLP silhouette (even ASOS doesn't do it that well).   In my experience while the ASOS chelseas aren't amazing and don't compare to my Story et Falls at all, they're great for trying out the look and also holding yourself over while your feet are still growing. While they aren't great, they'll last you at least a decent amount of time. Lots of "budget" boot companies make chelseas but they're often chunky or have a very short and wide shaft which oftentimes isn't exactly what people who want chelseas are looking for	episode_done:True
text:There is no unmarked woman	labels:I honestly have been normalized to being marked. Maybe I would actually feel unsettled if I was given "unlimited" freedom? Rompers, dresses, and skirts tend to be the clothes that I get the most feedback on. On one hand, I really do love compliments and conversations with others. In general, I love people.  But I've had awful experiences where being "marked" has had traumatic effects on my life. Maybe it would be different if I had more bad then good. Maybe my attitudes will change as I grow through life?  One of my supervisors made me laugh when he complimented my shirt saying "that's a museum person shirt". I think being marked can be good, when the intentions of a person are good.	episode_done:True
text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:During the party celebrating my First Communion (so seven or so), I refused to take off my pretty white dress, despite my mother telling me that I had to be really careful not to stain it.

My mother has never let me, nor my sister, live it down (despite the fact that it's been 25 years...) and I have been too scared to wear white ever since.

text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:This sounds counterintuative, but you should try colourful patterns.

For axample, I have a top with  white, orange, blue and olive stripes, and I can easily pair it with any bottoms in these colours.	episode_done:True

Another side of it is also that I hesitate to buy nice things for going out because I live in a place thats super casual so even when I "dress up" into something more than jeans/tights and sneakers even for regular day wear I feel like I'm standing out or in costume. I'm trying to overcome that and just go with it, of course I'm hardly out now due to covid.	episode_done:True

I really love how the tighter ones look like a harness or something on top when paired with something that shows skin on the neckline. For the big ones, I think they'd look great with high waisted items and can't wait to try one with a high waist circle skirt and tighter shirt.

I've got a bit of nerve hypersensitivity due to a ruptured disk and back surgery, so sweatpants are kind of my only option atm. I don't want to look like a slob though haha. Does anyone have any recommendation for sweatpants that look like normal pants or jeans? Uniqlo seemed to come up quite often in my searches.

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mother didn't teach me anything about fashion, aside from not mixing gold and silver(outdated advice). My father, however, taught me: the importance of buying quality clothing that fits your body type, compatible colors, not wearing more than three colors at a time(I don't necessarily follow this),  matching a tight shirt with looser pants and vice versa, how to identify good stitching and solid leather, what proper shoe construction looks like and how to clean and maintain shoes, to always check where the clothing item is from and what materials are used, and finally to add a personal touch to every outfit. Despite all his guidance, I still committed countless fashion blunders and experimented with fast fashion for years.

text:For watches:  * Match them with the dress code. Be sure to think about the watch strap as well as the watch face itself. Ex: wear a nice dressy watch with nicer clothes, wear a field watch with more casual clothes * Match the band/strap to your shoes and belt  * Silver & black looks good with blacks, grays, and blues * Gold & brown look good with earth tones.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:The Terribly High Cost of Cheap Goods	labels:Don't believe companies when they say something domestically produced will cost tons more. They lie! It's pure green. Unfettered capitalism. Maximum profit, minimal expense. I've discovered many high quality brands that have their goods made ethically and away from China! They do not cost a lot more and I'm happy to support locally made. No I'm not rich. The problem is that big greedy companies have the marketing budget to promote their cheaply made crap and thus make it hard for smaller independent brands to compete. But we have reddit which has been super useful in discovering such independent brands.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 05	labels:Jean sizing question:  I bought 2 pairs of jeans; one with 32 waist and one with 31 waist.  The 32 waist is borderline huge on me in the waist but fits perfect around the legs, while the 31 fits perfectly around the waist but is borderline tight around my legs.  I assume I am better off keeping the 32s as I can always just wear a belt?
text:I don't know what "borderline" tight is like, but denim will stretch to fit once you break them in. If it's not too bad, I'd keep the 31s.	labels:I guess tight to the point they kind of make my legs look like sausages lol.    Good username btw

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:In humid places - def bring a cardigan. The difference from a hot outdoors to cold dry indoors is really stark. Both in humid or dry places with lots of sun I will wear linen. Long sleeved linen shirts are my favorite because I can fold up the sleeves. And I learned to wear long linen pants to avoid mosquitos!	episode_done:True

I still had a big messy bun, acne patches on my face and slept with my mouth wiiide open. I didn't feel as comfortable in those PJs and that fantasy I had didn't come true, ya know? I don't want to discourage you, just my two cents as someone who had a very similar thought process  I went back to tank tops and sweatpants and I find I appreciate them a lot more now. I make sure they fit properly and don't have stains or holes so I still feel reasonably put together.
text:I just wanted to add to this that I love wearing MEN's sweatpants. They have pockets haha comfy wear with pockets are so good	labels:My boyfriend bought some supima cotton joggers from banana republic that are so much nicer than the sweats I've seen in the women's section. I went and bought myself a pair after seeing them. I've also been browsing their men's clearance section for cotton tshirts.  The seams are flat and sturdy, the joggers have *pockets* which I greatly appreciate when lounging around the house. The materials is also substantially better than women's wear I've purchased in the past. The cotton is smooth, has a good weight to it and again the seams are flat so they don't irritate my skin and they're sturdy!	episode_done:True

text:Which higher end brands do you find to be "worth it" and for what?	labels:Not sure how high-end you're thinking, but I love my Frye boots. My black Veronica Combat boots in particular are an absolute cold-weather staple for me- I've put them through the ringer and they still look good, walked for miles over cobblestones in them and not had issues.   I also love Frank and Eileen button-up shirts. When I was first introduced to them I thought the price point was absolutely bonkers but as I got to know more about quality clothes and what actually goes into them I decided to give them a try and yeah. They fit me PERFECTLY. Hang on me just right, buttons are in exactly the right place, last for years- I can barely tell the difference between the first ones I bought five-ish years ago (and have had in heavy rotation ever since) and the one that arrived yesterday that I'm wearing now.
text:I was gonna comment and say Frye for boots. I have a pair from 2017? And I loved them so much I bought the same exact pair for future use.  The leather quality is soooooooo soft and the craftsman of the shoe is solid IMO.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Dress Sneakers Are Alarmingly Popular	labels:If you're gonna wear dress sneakers, just wear a pair of Deer Stags, Clarks, Cole Haans, or Florsheim comfort dress shoes with the rubber soles.

text:Work From Home Outfits I Should Wear More Often	labels:Highly depends on your working environment but in my case, I would only go as far as wearing a nice shirt. Tie and a suit would send the opposite message I'm trying to convey. From "Nice, this guy knows how to dress and keeps it professional" to "why is this guy trying so hard? No need to dress up for a meeting."  I work in software and regularly meet with clients and colleagues. I can't remember the last time I saw someone wearing a shirt. Tees and pants are the go-to dress code for us.
text:It's more common and normal to see a software engineer in sweatpants, a hoodie, and flip-flops, than one in a button-down, slacks, and leather dress shoes. Hell, I probably see bare feet up on a cabinet in the office more often than I see dress shoes, lol.  This would only be amplified during WFH. Any software engineer that wears a button-down in their own home is probably a serial killer.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I bought a sexy bralette from Thistle and Spire. Not sure how well known that brand is, I had never heard of it.   I was literally sitting around drinking wine with my girlfriends talking about how I needed to get railed and this ad kept coming up on my Insta and I was like "if I buy this I think guys would fuck me?" and I was egged on by my friends to buy it on a whim.  It's a sexy ass bralette. I have bigger boobs, so I was concerned the XL (biggest size) wouldn't fit, but it does quite comfortably. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and the company seems legit.   If you're buying online for the first time, use a credit card and save the company's return policy.

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom flat out refused to give me any input if I asked for her opinion on things. However, she definitely thought I had no taste in fashion; which I know from her coming home after visiting my school one day and saying "I didn't know other people dressed like you!"  She 'taught' me how to do my hair by abandoning me one morning when I needed her help. For years I would get massive knot nests in the back of my head until my hairdresser finally showed me how to properly brush back there.   When I asked my mom to teach me how to shave my legs her response was "you don't already know how to do that?" as if it was knowledge acquired by a magic fairy.   Thank god for youtube and friends.	episode_done:True
text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:Currently only buying second hand and only buying Ann Taylor/J.Crew level or nicer (often much much nicer). I got sick of having cheap clothes that wore and washed horribly. You can find second hand blazers and dresses that look unworn for almost nothing if you have an eye. My wardrobe has improved substantially and I feel like I look more pulled together. No more facings when a lining is needed, etc.

Quick note, I know someone who works in the jewelry business (works in a workshop that mass produces jewelry for retailors) and it was clearly stated that Tiffany's quality is relatively the same as others. Of course it looks nice due to the higher attention to details (polish/finish) but quality shouldn't be the determinant factor in the purchase from his opinion.
text:Given the price that makes sense - you're paying for the name, really. I did a bit more research and it seems like rhodium plating silver is more expensive than it's worth. The plating is expensive and needs to be renewed every few years but many jewelers won't rhodium plate silver because they would need to maintain a supply of material specifically for silver jewelry. If you find one who will it'll likely cost the same as the original price of the jewelry.  I did find a few comments from people who were pissed when they found out their jewelry was rhodium plated because of how expensive it would be to re-plate it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:Whoa... I am an adult woman with ADHD and I never thought about this somehow. I have MAJOR issues with restrictive clothing. Winter coats feel like a straitjacket, turtlenecks \*literally\* made me vomit when I was younger, and anything that's even slightly itchy or makes a weird noise (like a swishy windbreaker) drives me insane. I can't wear bracelets or watches because the sound of them clicking on my desk grates against my soul.  I usually live in American Eagle jeggings (soft joggers as soon as I get home), comfortable shirts, soft and loose sweaters/cardigans, comfortable ankle boots/Converse, and sometimes a well-fitting skirt with tights.  Interestingly, I have no issue with wearing tights, which I know a lot of women find uncomfortable. I don't mind wearing a bra, either.
text:I have tons of sensory issues and I LOVE tights. I think it's because they're usually so smooth and, like others have said, provide uniform pressure.	labels:Don't the seams bother you, though?

When I'm not in a pandemic/WFH world, I wear a pair of flats. During the cooler months, I wear one of my four greige cardigans.

text:Do you have any pieces that "should not" work with your body that just seems to work?	labels:I have an inverted triangle body type and I really like puff sleeved blouses that are trendy rn! They're so good because my shoulders have a bit of extra wiggle room. I think they somehow make my shoulders appear a little slimmer (because the shoulder seams end up sitting closer to my  neck, if that makes sense?) I also find that I have enough bone structure to physically fill out the blouse, so the sleeves don't slip down my arms.

text:Do you feel the black Friday sales better or worse than usually this year? Is it worth to buy clothing you won't wear until next year?	labels:Re: buying stuff you won't wear for months, NO! I also keep almost falling for that trap. They keep pushing the date I'll return to the office, and who knows what the office is even going to be like after a year of everyone wearing sweatpants every day. Even though I'm definitely going to need work pants after all this (thanks covid 15) I'm determined to not buy them until I'll actually need them.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:I haven't had a lot of success with boutiques found on ig - I have a hard time deciphering if they are drop shipping like you mentioned.   You could try Poshmark - I find it helpful when I'm looking for something specific. Other than "shopping your own closet", shopping secondhand is also thinking more ethical and sustainable.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 05, 2020	labels:Hey all - due to some unfortunate medical reasons beyond my control this year, I ended up losing a lot of weight. While getting a lot of new clothes has been entertaining for the most part, I have a few pieces that I am loathe to lose from my normal rotation.   Chief among them is my billy reid bond peacoat. It still fits great in the arms and shoulders/upper chest, but the abdomen/stomach/waist area is now very "billowy", particularly in the back. While I realize a peacoat shouldn't be skin tight, it feels like the back is flailing all over even when the top buttons are buttoned. Is this something a tailor could bring in (given that the arms and shoulders are still great) - or is it not worth it to have them try and do this kind of downsizing on a mostly wool coat?  Thanks.

text:As Chanel Raises Prices For A Second Time this Year, What Do Luxury Brands’ Inflating Prices Mean for Them & for the Industry at Large?	labels:Luxury brands inflating prices means creating another pricepoint at higher categories. When fashion tees at $300 a pop becomes the norm, why wouldn't the luxury brands jack up the price on other products to increase their margins?  The only way this can be curbed is through the consumers. When we stop falling into the hype cycle and scramble to buy up everything just for the gram and social media likes, these products will sit and go into the 50-60% off discount during the sale seasons. All these brands have data; when they see that stuff is sitting and mostly selling at lower price points, they'll need to curb their expectations and set price points accordingly.   It doesn't help right now during COVID that I see people whose jobs/income did not get affected by COVID, and therefore has additional disposable income because they aren't eating out, partying etc. They justify spending more on items at MSRP instead of waiting for a sale.

text:Which higher end brands do you find to be "worth it" and for what?	labels:Arche shoes and M0851 accessories. Those don't really qualify as "high end", but they're well made in classic styles.  Edit: downvote without a reason is a bit weird. Both these brands are worth paying for, and if someone disagrees I'd love to hear why.	episode_done:True
text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:Apparently neon is going, but I feel like I have read that somewhere or other since 2017 and it just keeps coming back in a slightly different form. Very distressed denim is looking a bit overdone. Massive oversaturation there. One of my friends says sock boots but IDK about that, they seem like they have a few more years in 'em with different heel and toe shapes.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 05	labels:I've read a ton of advice about going to eBay and buying lightly used sweaters as opposed to buying brand new.  I'm into it, my problem is that I'm a tall slim guy, and it seems like the some of the sweaters I can buy need to be tailored a bit.  If I can get the shoulders and length to fit, my sense is I could have my tailor get the sides taken in to remove all the excess fabric.  Has anyone here tailored a sweater?  I'm looking at 2-3 eBay sweaters that will cost me $100 total +$20 tailoring for each one ($160).  Or, I could buy a brand new piece for $160 and I pretty much know it will fit.   I know the obvious route would be go new if you're unsure, but maybe tailoring a sweater isn't as risky as I'm thinking.  Anyone here have experience they can share with tailoring a sweater?

text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:The current reality won't be reflected in the styles until 2021. Fashion collections are produced and created 12-18 months ahead of the actual season.   I think as designers are creating the upcoming seasons, with all of the challenges get and changes in this economy, we will see way more seasonless clothing. Those will be brand staples and hallmarks.  And a few special pieces each season. It will feel a lot like direct to consumer brand drops. A lot of standard shapes, special seasonal colors.	episode_done:True
text:Best and Worst Purchase of 2020	labels:Best: black Asics running shoes; neutral and easy to mix for athleisure looks and absolutely essential for all the sanity walks I've taken in 2020, very comfy and great for travel as well  Worst: I hate to say this, but... my wedding dress. I got it just a few months before lockdown, and I probably wouldn't have spent quite as much, or at least gone for something quite as fancy, if I knew it was going to be socially distanced, outdoors, and largely on Zoom.	episode_done:True

As someone who isn't white, it's also fun to see fashion on those closer to my ethnicity. That being said, most actresses and models are still super skinny.  I love the femininity of South Korean fashion without being too over the top and also modest. It definitely runs in with the styles I like, the girliness and also the street styles

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I agree with you about black tights looking weird with certain outfits...my answer is that I specifically buy my winter skirts/dresses to look good with black tights lol. If it doesn't, then it's just not gonna be worn in the fall/winter, it's too cold where I live for bare legs and I have never really found other colors/patterns of tights that I like the look of. Plus it means that everything also matches with black boots so it just makes things easy.  Also I just want to shout the praises of fleece lined tights from the rooftop. Those and loose fitting dress=ultimate comfort, but looks like you tried. I agree with the other commenter who suggested sizing up in tights, they never fit right when I got my true size, now that I size up I don't feel like I'm constantly adjusting them throughout the day anymore.	episode_done:True

My favorite clothing gift would be the camel colored Coach cape I received that is not too heavy for our mild winters and will hopefully go with a lot of my vintage clothing!

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:I learned to research the heck out of a piece before I buy it, and really consider how it fits in my the rest of my wardrobe. It can take me months to make a decision, which gives me time to budget for it. An example: my last purchase was pair of bamboo "Romperalls" - like overalls but soft and flowey. They work with most of my sweaters and crop-tops, and are comfortable to work at my desk in.   I'm not gonna buy a piece that only works if I wear it with _____, or I don't get to wear on a regular basis.   I have completely broken up with jeans, gave my last two pairs to my mom. Zero tolerance for uncomfortable pants nowadays.

Like, in a vacuum they could be the platonic ideal of yellow and gray, so I can kind of appreciate how they are both true mid-tones, but I don't like them together (for some reason it's giving me flashbacks to the chevrons and turquoise of 2010 decor) and I don't find them particularly inspiring right off the bat.  Or it could be that as a warm-toned olive I know they will both look terrible on me, lol.

text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:You could be me, only I am about 4 kg heavier. But I was also never comfortable and tried to hide my hips and nothing fit right and all the pants were too short on me. I now mostly wear sweater dresses and skirts to work, since it's more comfy and not too tight. Plus you can't really tell I have knock knees if skirt ends right at the knees.  But my best tip for pants is S'Oliver. Not the cheapest, but they have decent sales and their 36" length jeans were the only ones that were long enough. I would stay away from high waisted dresses and skirts, as they make me look completely disproportionate, but that depends, maybe your torso isn't that short.  Sorry for the ramble, I am just excited to find someone with the same problems I had.

So unless you plan on shampooing after every use then find something else. Personally I've dropped all gel/spray/wax etc. products and stopped shampooing entirely and my hair feels significantly healthier.	labels:I don't think cutting out shampoo entirely is a good idea, your hair still does get grimy over time.
text:it really depends on your hair type, my hair is THICK and absorbs oils like crazy. After the adjustment period my scalp stopped over producing oils and my hair balanced itself out and hasn't felt grimy or smelled bad at all, I still do the occasional mask or condition, but shampoo did nothing positive for my hair except dry it out. but again ymmv, depends on your hair type.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:Pretty basic, but tees and button-downs that dont pull my shoulders forward. Most shirts, even decent fitted ones, dont have enough room to accommodate my (quite average sized) chest. So then either I have to slouch for them to hang right, or I stand with good posture and they strain at the front and are baggy in the back.

text:You grew into it as a person	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:I learned retail in Germany, so, what i do look for:  * double stitched > single stitched, speaks for itself * weight of the cloth, even light cloth should have a certain weight (density of fiber) * is it wool > synthetic (personal preference) * is the wool soft < rougher (fiber length is longer, so less ends stick out) it is more washable * How does it look on the inside, quality is well stitched  I can wear my clothes easily between 5 to 10 years. Buying clothes because of a certain fashion and throw it away after wearing it once is a crime, you should feel shame.
text:This kills me. This year we exceeded temperatures of 100 degrees F (38 degrees celsius) for 144 days. Of those, 52 days were above 110 (43 degrees celsius).     I cannot wear wool. Ever. Even during our "colder" months.   If something is heavy, I know I won't be wearing it for more than three weeks, tops, out of the year. I want to shop sustainable, well-made items but there's no way I'd actually end up *wearing* those items for more than three weeks a year. Fast fashion is where it's at for me because everything is thin and light and won't give me heatstroke. But I have to replace these items frequently, too. I hate it.	labels:You could look into lighter weight fabrics that are better for temperature regulation and moisture wicking? Stuff made out of cotton, tencel, linen, silk and stuff like that? Theres a lot of companies that are putting more emphasis on eco friendly manufacturing processes too. Tencel or lyocell is cropping up in a lot of brands now too, I've seen it at gap and banana republic recently.  I'm really sensitive to heat and I lived in cotton and tencel dresses and tank tops all summer when my AC died. I've got cotton tshirts that have lasted for years without any special care, but if you're living somewhere super warm it also means your clothes would dry super fast on a line if that's possible for you, which tends to be gentler on stuff than a drying machine.	episode_done:True

I had a dress covered in stars, did my hair up in an elaborate crown studded with crystal stars and moons, black knee-high boots, and -for the most dramatic "look" - I sewed three sets of blue and white string lights into a black cloak so that I wore a cape of stars. Also I covered myself in glitter! The battery pack made dancing difficult but it was so worth it haha.

Double denim - can look cool if you know what you're doing.

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:The most expensive bag I bought was a $500 Tory Burch bag, and I have already sold it. I regretted the purchase. I always wanted a Chanel bag, but after the pandemic, my perspective has changed a lot and I am happy with my Madewell leather bags I have collected over the years.
text:As someone who lusted after the classic Chanel flap for close to 20 years and finally acquired it, I honestly wish I had the change in perspective that you did. I bought it second-hand after I got promoted and while it is beautiful, it was all very anticlimactic, and I barely even use it.  I guess it was always fun to have "THE GOAL" bag, but after idolizing something for that long, I feel like it was inevitable for it to fall short of my expectations. I definitely need to re-evalute whether it's worth keeping, or just selling it.	labels:Gosh I can relate to this so well!  However I think if it stops me from lusting and pulling the trigger on more, it's ultimately saving me money in some strange way. Feeling like I've attained the goal means I'm less itchy to search and buy more, especially as it's often the search that yields dangerous temptations which I then succumb to!

text:Hard to really give a definitive answer for why fashion is the way it is. You seem to be thinking of fitted clothes as the default and anything loose as a deliberate deviation from that. Really they are just different looks that appeal to different people and give off a different vibe.	labels:Yes, but I'm confused about said "vibe" and its appeal.
text:The vibe is generally more relaxed, in a literal character sense. it feels casual, breezy, and nonchalant. It communicates a sense of being less finnicky, less "curated." There's also more room to play with silhouette if you want the overall shape to look different. In warm weather it can promote airflow around the body, in cool weather it's easy to layer loose upper layers over tight lower layers without the upper layers being affected or the tight lower layers demanding control of the overall look.   If you're slim and you want to emphasize slimness, large garments can make you look slimmer. If you're slim and you want to create some sense of mass, that's possible too. If you're bigger and you want to look smaller, it's easier to play with proportioning rather than just having your exact body shape on display.  Motion- how a garment actually MOVES relative to the body- can also be a factor, which generally isn't communicated in photos but you can see in person.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:Hey all.   About a year ago I bit the bullet on a pair of 40mm SLP Wyatt harness boots (Calfskin). I'm normally a 43EU but I sized down by half. For my feet, this was a terrible idea that cost me a lot of money and irritation. I have narrow feet but for some reason I just kept getting blisters and pains after months of wear and stretching.   Anyway, I'm planning on going and buying a pair of 30mm SLP Chelseas in Calfskin and I was wondering if this time I should go down half a size? I know it seems ridiculous to even consider it given my past experience but the way I see it, the Chelsea heel gives less of an incline and apparently is made of thinner and softer leather.  I'm just really desperate to get the perfect fitting boot and not waste money again.  What have some of your experiences been with the 30mm Chelsea sizing?  Thanks in advance!

text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:I get the same holes near the crotch of all of my jeans - Thighs rubbing together just wears that area out.   My other main consistent issue with shirt/sweaters is holes in the arm pit seams. Not totally sure what causes that.
text:Ugh the tshirt armpit holes are so annoying! I guess the fabric there is weakened bc your arm is rubbing against your side, and then somehow it goes through the wash one time too many...?	labels:I think a lot of times with tshirt or sweatshirt armpit seams it's bad construction. Instead of properly finishing the end of the serger chain, they just cut the thread, and it starts to un-stitch from the agitation when you run it through the washing machine.	episode_done:True

But on the other hand, I always look quite put together and if I wear more normal clothes I look like a child wearing their mum's clothes so!
text:This is probably me as well - my inspo would fall under "preppy nerd/goth" - and I LOVE a cutesy pattern (see: Run & Fly).  I look much younger than I am (early 30s) so I have to be careful because if I lean into it too much I definitely look like a child - I bought a gorgeous mulberry coloured corduroy pinafore last winter, my BF asked me to never wear it around him because I looked like a little kid and it made him feel icky, it was promptly donated.	labels:I too had a pinafore just like that, potentially the same one!

I packed away one skirt, 2 pairs of jeans, a few dress shirts, and a few slim fit dresses. It's all in a small box so it's not much.

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:When I was living poverty growing up all I could buy was from WalMart and thrift stores and I only bought clothes once a year or when I got bigger. I used to have such low self esteem because of it and thought I was ugly but I was just actually poor. People looked better because they were able to afford better clothes. When I got in college I was able to afford my own clothes and shop at better places. It took a while for me to get the hang of dressing better with the access I had that now I look way better than when I was younger. Also as a plus size girl finding clothes that are plus size friendly and affordable. Walmart clothes made me cry so much I looked so ugly but it was all I had. Now Walmart kinda has cuter clothes but when I was younger they looked so bad.	episode_done:True

When i need a refresh of normal boring collared shirts, i turn to them first.  Though, my oldest 2 collared shirts are Avenue, but i don't know if they are as good as they were 10-ish years ago when i bought those 2 shirts.  For trousers that can survive work, 511 and Rothco are the best.  The stitching on Rothco is slightly more rugged, IMHO, but 511 is a smidge cheaper, so i will buy it if i find it with free shipping.  For really really really gorgeous clothes that are too fancy for work that so far (N = 3) appear indestructible, Verillas.  I wish i could build my entire wardrobe out of them, everything is just so gorgeous, but priced accordingly.	episode_done:True

text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:Isn't Haute Couture bespoke by definition? I thought Haute Couture meant an exclusive creation for a single high profile client. Perhaps I was wrong.  Regardless of the semantics, between the two options you are proposing I would definitely chose the bespoke route over something off the rack, especially in a fashion hub like NYC and if money is no object.
text:> Isn't Haute Couture bespoke by definition?  No. They're different terms with different usage. Bespoke involves a pattern that is made from scratch for the wearer, and accounts for physical details you'd never think of, like the slope of your shoulders, the half inch difference in length between your legs, whether you over or under-pronate, etc.   Haute couture is a restricted term based on inclusion in the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture in France. In order to use the term haute couture, a label has to be part of the club and show a couture collection twice a year (although they do permit guests). A piece is considered couture if it's part of such a collection. That will involve patterning to make the piece. Of course there's a very high degree of personalization when it comes to fitting clients with dresses that start at 5 figures, but I believe they start from the existing pattern of the piece. So haute couture is not bespoke.	labels:I didn't know before, thank you!

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:What has really helped me with "growing up" my wardrobe is trying to wear my existing clothes in different ways, and documenting my outfits.  I have also been trying to adjust current go-to looks with different accessories to see if that gives the results I want.   The documenting part has really helped me hone in on what items I want to invest in (what suits me, what fits well, what shapes I like etc).  At the same time, the trying new combos/classing it up with jewellery has helped me feel like I have tons of new outfits to try even though I'm only adding a piece every month or so.	episode_done:True

text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:One thing that really helped me, especially when there was a sale, was thinking through the price of the item *once I will be able to pay it off my credit card*. At one point, that was months away for me. So a $30 top with interest could be double by the time I pay it off. Is it worth the potential $60? There are a lot of quick compounding interest calculators online to save you time, where you can enter a starting amount, your credit card interest, and how long til you plan to pay it. Hope this helps!	episode_done:True
text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:I agree with you OP, when I'm going to a birthday party or some kind of party celebrating a particular person, I'll make sure to dress nicely but not overshadow the person.   Weddings are another major one. If I'm just a regular guest (so obviously not the bride or in the bridal party) I'll try my hardest not to overshadow either the bride or the bridal party. That's a major fashion faux pas to me.  On the other hand, if it's my birthday, or a party I'm hosting I will go all out. I love dressing up fancy especially when I'm the host!
text:This is me too. I only ever really go ALL OUT when I'm hosting.	labels:See, I'm the opposite on this one. I normally like to err on side of being over-dressed a bit. Except when I am hosting! I love being comfortable in my own home. I am not going to be wearing heels in my own house. I also don't want my guests to feel uncomfortable if they are under-dressed and would rather have them shine if they are over-dressed because they are my guests!	episode_done:True

I also forced myself to only keep pieces I loved, which was way easier than I thought. Was actually considering making a separate self post because it was so much fun. Felt like a walk down memory lane for my personal style and menswear in general. I also learned a lot about brands I thought I liked (Uniqlo definitely isn't it for me, reigning champ is too long and slim, off the rack naked and the famous fits me terribly, etc.).

text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:I wouldn't say I inherently hate the brand but I think Champion is an example of a brand that exploded a few years back/to now basically all because some celebrities or whoever wore it- and everyone who wears it now is most likely a ding dong hypebeast type or the VSCO type girl or whatever. Like I'm old enough to remember it being bottom tier Wal Mart level shit you'd get borderline made fun of for wearing- but now all of the sudden it's enjoying this moment. So it's just that perceived inauthenticity and collective pivot in peoples' minds to a fashion name to people rather than just athletic apparel that irks me somehow.  However though, the Todd Snyder Champion stuff is PHENOMENAL- it's not the mainline stuff. You don't see any of those assholes rocking that.

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:My clothes, jewelry, shoes etc usually last a long time. I hardly ever sweat, I have noticed that clothes wear out a lot sooner for people who sweat a lot. Since I don't sweat, I can wear my outside clothes a few times before washing. Less frequent washing helps to preserve quality. If I can, I hand wash my good clothes & hang them dry in the house itself, inside out without exposing to sunlight. Also, I squeeze out water without twisting & wringing them hard. I let them drip a bit in the bathroom & then dry. If I put them in the wash, it is inside out on gentle cycle, & then air dried. Ironing is also done inside out.   I don't know if it helps, but while storing, I don't expose my jewelry, bags etc to direct sunlight. Most of my jewelry stay in boxes, with the metallic ones wrapped in tissue. Good shoes are in the box.	episode_done:True
text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:Personally, I'm with you OP I look horribly washed out in beige and cream colors.  I'm also always a bit confused by the way people talk about "neutrals" in fashion. There are neutrals that most everyone agrees are neutral colors like your whites, blacks, greys, beige, etc. But I think your own closet can have neutrals that others wouldn't consider a neutral color. In my own wardrobe I use pastel and millennial pink as my main neutral color. Idk I'm just rambling at this point, I just feel like a lot of people in fashion and in this sub take the word neutral too seriously.  (Also how many times can I say the word neutral in one post)

text:How do you challenge yourself?	labels:I just bought one of those dresses that's transparent and looks like a meadow of embroidered flowers - so I guess I challenge myself by wearing things that are SO ME but that I would've shied away from before because no one I know wears stuff like it.  Like something that looks like my favorite paintings.
text:I did not know this was a thing but now I need it. I wonder if I could do the embroidery myself? It would take forever, but not like coronavirus is going away anytime soon.	labels:If you sew I've seen fabrics you can buy that are already embroidered.	episode_done:True

text:How is feminism not political? It's a movement for cultural, political, and economic change. It has policy demands. Obviously "feminism" is too broad to cover more than the very basics (abortion access, equal pay, etc) but those are still very much political.	labels:It's inherently political, but much like "should pedophilia be kept illegal?"

A woman I knew from my school days has a lot of spotted dogs. When I commented that they would make a beautiful coat, she became offended! AITA?   Edit to add: My husband is a furrier, if that helps your decision.  Edit again to add: I may also be a lot older than the woman with the spotted dogs and have a red and black roadster and no husband, depending.

text:Just singing the praises of wool	labels:I love love wool. Most of my clothes are wool now, it's taken a while of collecting but I'm happy with it. :) I recently got a 1940s wool coat with a fur trim collar and it's my favorite thing ever.   Softening tip: get your itchy wool and leave it in a bucket of water/softener/vinegar for a few hours, roll dry with a towel, then throw in in the dryer on no heat air fluff. It'll look brand new afterwards and you shouldn't have to worry about it getting itchy again for the rest of the season/year. I like to throw in wool dryer balls with essential oil on top to add a smell.	episode_done:True
text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:Louis Vuitton and Dior.  Virgil Abloh and Kim Jones have turned two heritage luxury brands into their streetwear playground, and while they were tacky to begin with, it's still sad to see them ripping off other designers for the sake of hype.
text:Kim Jones is criminally overrated	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Fellow clothing trackers, what coveted items are you tracking now?	labels:A good, buttery brown leather crossbody purse. After two years of searching, I found the PERFECT shape and size at MadeWell. I placed my order in late August 2020, and still had not received the item by November. I knew it was a 6 week waiting time for shipping, but since it was well over 9 weeks by then, I finally called MadeWell asking where my purse was.  Turns out they had sold out of the item and erroneously did not take it off their website, and it still allowed you to purchase the purse. I was livid, but if anything, extremely heartbroken because I was sooo looking forward to this purse, and one of the few bright and good things I had to look forward to at that time in my life (life was throwing me some crazy curveballs).  I have yet to find the perfect buttery brown leather crossbody, the right size, color and a smooth surface. And under $300. Keeping my fingers crossed!
text:Do you remember the name of the bag or have a pic? Madewell purses pop up on resale sites quite a bit!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I got a tshirt from Parks Project. They have kind of vintage-poster looking graphic tshirts that celebrate America's national parks. I was happy with the price and the quality. The biggest downside is maybe that it isn't totally clear that its a for-profit company not actually run by the Parks Department? At least some of their ads were a little misleading, but they do donate some proceeds to various national park/nature groups...but overall, I've managed to steer clear of buying from most Instagram ads! I don't know what my algorithm suggests, but almost all of my ads are things that fit my aesthetic but in no way my budget. Like, I'm not dropping $350 on a dress from a random ad!
text:Parks Project is a legit brand, even REI sells them!	labels:That's good to know! I had only ever seen them through Instagram and figured it was tied to the fact that in early 2020, I'd been doing lots of national park research because the plan had been to take a trip...I think I'm fairly lucky in that most of the Instagram ads I see seem to be legit companies, because I'll see them tagged in celebrity feeds (which may be why they are advertising on my feed?) When I went on Facebook, that's where I saw a lot of the sketchier stuff...
text:Yeah I definitely receive a lot of targeted ads based on web searches, ha. If you like Parks Project check out Landmark Project. Also very legit/carried by REI, and sometimes cheaper/better sales, but also donating to national parks/wildlife.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are some stores/brands that have surprised you?	labels:Kirkland and Costco in general. I lost weight right at the beginning of the pandemic when fitting rooms were being closed and the only place I go outside of my house is costco to get groceries so I've started getting clothes there too. Prices are good, quality is good, and the return policy is amazing. I've been surprised with the quality of Kirkland brand leggings and tops and I've been able to restock my wardrobe with coats, basics, and work from home outfits (mostly leggings!) for very cheap. Recently got a plush, warm, long robe for only $9! And there are good online deals pretty regularly as well. They also have lower prices on designer clothing/purses/perfumes/make-up.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 19	labels:What's the official method for cleaning the midsole of a sneaker? Any differences depending on their colors?
text:The biggest thing to keep in mind is material- some are encased in rubber, some are exposed foam, some are painted, and so on. For rubber you can use a medium or stiff bristle brush with basic dish soap or a little laundry detergent, though, your best bet would be a dedicated sneaker cleaner formula. For raw foam or anything painted, I'd recommend using a magic eraser (aka melamine foam sponge) and patience. A softer bristle toothbrush is a also good to have for getting into crevices without scratching it up. Be mindful of upper type too of course, a really stiff brush could scratch leather, which'll be especially evident on bad quality leather (Nike especially being guilty of using bad leather).	labels:	episode_done:True

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I was 24, my then fiance (now husband) bought me a Chanel bag to congratulate me on achieving a major life milestone. It's a beige calfskin, classic double flap with the interlocking C's and gold hardware. I use it on every suitable special occasion. It's been more than a decade and is still in damn good condition, I'll probably hand it down to one of my daughters.  Then when I got married, my parents very generously surprised me with a Chanel bag as well. It's the same handbag style, just a size larger and black with silver hardware. Still in great shape, and will probably also be handed down to my girls.   Honestly I don't feel the urge to acquire more / other high end bags, though I certaintly wouldn't object if they were gifted to me!	episode_done:True

Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:I've added literally nothing to my wardrobe since last year, because I'm currently working on losing weight, and there's no point since we can't go anywhere.  However! I did buy a new winter coat a year and a half ago from Target, for only $50, and it's the *warmest* winter coat I've ever had. I couldn't find it online at all, but it's thigh/knee length, and it's by the brand Universal Thread.  I live in upstate New York, where this morning was 3 degrees Fahrenheit, but even so, the coat kept me warm. I've spent upwards of $100 on winter coats before that did nothing for me, so I'll be holding onto this coat until it starts unraveling at the seams.	episode_done:True

text:Good quality men's jeans?	labels:Just wanted to reply that I'm a raw denim guy, but a lot of people are going to throw out raw denim recommendations to you.  One thing to be wary of.  Raw denim is unforgiving, so in the slimmer cuts I have found them **MORE** likely to have crotch blowouts than other jeans.    I've never had issues with crotch blowouts in your standard levis/gap/j. crew brands.  My first 2 pairs of raw denim had crotch blowouts, because I wore slim fits, and the point of tension is in the crotch.  My 21.5 oz and 16 oz raws had holes forming within 6 months.  I've since bought a pair of Samurai's in a straight cut and they seem as if they will last forever, but they are NOT slim.
text:Hi there! Thanks for the heads up, I suppose I won't count on the raw denim to fix this issue. Based on what you and others have said, I may have to give the sizing a closer look!  Very helpful :)	labels:	episode_done:True

These I wear on the weekends or date nights. Honestly the pandemic hasn't altered my style much at all. I'm in my thirties and quit following fashion trends years ago.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 15, 2021	labels:# How acceptable are tailored shorts really as you get older?  I am reconsidering my outfits for my planned summer vacation in Italy.  I had planned for the daytime white, light blue and light pink slim-fit polo shirts, paired with light blue, pale red, and pale yellow tailored shorts. Boat shoes and Espadrilles for footwear. Basically my tried-and-true combos for hot weather vacays.  But as I reach the tail-end of my late 30s, **I wonder if shorts are appropriate at all anymore**. I always strive to look extremely put together, rarely wear anything without a collar, no denim, etc.  Shall I just wear my night-time outfits (pants and long-sleeve button-down shirts, both in linen or linen-cotton mix, in white and light pastel colors) during the day also?  Looking forward to feedback mainly from well-off guys my age or older.
text:Shorts are acceptable at any age if worn appropriately. Daytime during a summer vacation in Italy is certainly an appropriate shorts occasion.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:I feel like dressing in the winter is so difficult (although the clothes are so much cuter/look better on me lol) because it'll be like 20F outside and 110F inside, and then a balmy 80F on the metro (crammed with smelly people pre-covid). so I usually wear a pretty thick coat (I got a really nice one on LL Bean last winter) and light layers underneath - J Crew tissue turtlenecks are my staples, Docs, and a scarf.  I try not to leave my apt during the summer haha...still trying to figure out cute clothes that won't make me feel/look miserable
text:Farenheit and metro, farenheit and metro... where do you live?	labels:Washington DC, Miami-Dade, Los Angeles, Minneapolis-St Paul, Houston, St Louis, Buffalo, Phoenix and Baltimore all have a rail called the metro. Chicago has the Metra, which could get autocorrected. Context clues in re: temperature narrow it down somewhat from there.

text:If you were a villain in a movie, what would you wear?	labels:I honestly loved what Luv in Blader Runner 2049 wore so something as that. Both her office wear and her kill mode wear.   Even her hoodie was awesome. Its also practical in case you need to break some bones. Kind of like a shadow person who comes from the shadow to suprise you and still looks effortlessly amazing.  I also loved what Joi wore, so I am just gonna steal those.  But if its not an office wear or wanna look cool wear, no high heels. I hate high heels on people who fight. With passion. Sexi female outfits with heels are my number one hate thing for action films. I will never be able to take Wonder Woman or Black widow seriously because of this. So there is no way my battle outfit will ever ever have high heels. It will be a proper steel both with covered angles, because there is no way I am ever twisting my ankle.	episode_done:True
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:Honestly I get pretty much everything tailored--but especially blouses and dresses. It's so hard to get things off-the-rack that will work for all your fit points--especially shoulders, bust, and waist. There's no limit to what you *can* have done, only what you have time to fiddle with! Sometimes I'll even take something in and just say "I love this but it doesn't look quite right, what do you think needs tweaked?" Any good tailor should be able to run with it from there.   My caveat for this practice, though, is that nearly everything I buy is secondhand. If I grab a $5 top from the thrift shop and have $30 of alterations done on it, I've spent $35 on a custom piece that looks great. I'll take that over the $35(+) new top any day!	episode_done:True

I thought if I could shrink it a bit, it would be perfect.   It's 42% cotton, 26% acrylic, 26% nylon, 4% wool, and 3% spandex.  Frank & Oak told me that if I soak it hot water, and let it air dry, it should shrink a bit. So I submerged it in hot water for about 20 minutes and let it air dry in the house for about 2 days, and I don't think it shrunk at all.  Any advice?  Thanks!

text:Let's talk about sneakers	labels:Probably depends on where you live.   When I was in elementary school in the 90's, the chunky adidas were popular like the superstar. In middle school, the nike AF1s high tops were really popular and also the K Swiss sneakers and the Phat farm ones (throwback). But they resembled the classic adidas stan smith/superstars. In high school, I remember wearing really chunky "skater" sneakers and slip-ons. I remember wearing DCs. In college it was the chucks. Then after I graduated it was those suede vans, and the slip on vans as well as the keds. Now I see a lot of stan smiths, superstars, AF1s, chucks, common projects and those adidas NMD / yeezy. I have yet to encounter more than a hand full of people wearing those big chunky sneakers at all. Only a few who were tourists.  TBH it just feels like everyone just wears whatever the popular sneaker of X company is, and since all of the above are still around, and because social media bubble aesthetics influence groups of people to choose whatever shoe suits them from whatever popular company, the outcome is that all of those sneakers are still very much alive and kicking....	episode_done:True

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:My first husband gifted me a vintage Bottega Veneta clutch purse I'd been eyeing at a shop but never could make up my mind if I should buy it or not - it was WAY overpriced for a used BV. It was supposed  to a make-up gift after a huge fight right we had before I caught him secretly spending our money on nonsense, mostly tech gadgets. Shopping addiction isn't for ladies only!  Anyway, I ditched the guy but kept the purse. After 17 years, I still find ways to use it. The first purse I got for myself? You bet it was a Bottega!
text:Ha! I own two now-vintage Dooney & Bourke's becaue my boss dumped a guy who spent way too much money on him. She just wanted those bags gone! She was also a recovered alcoholic so I also got ALL of her wine gifts. YAY, I loved working for her, taught me a lot of things that improved my career.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:I buy mainly mid-range designer/independent designers secondhand- so I have a bunch of Isabel Marant that would retail 300+ but I get for less than 100 euros typically. My most expensive item that I paid retail for was my Isabel Marant Dicker boots as a gift to myself for passing a high level language competency exam for French. So 345 euros.  However, the most valuable items if they were new is my Chanel pencil skirt and my Ferragamo Vara Pumps that I got really good prices for secondhand, particularly the Chanel.   Like anything, shopping for high quality clothes takes practice. Once you know what to look for quality wise, it's very easy to scan in person to see what is worth the money on the racks.	episode_done:True

text:Shawl cardigans	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:It absolutely depends on where we're going, but in general my goal would be to be very practical while looking super cute -- I want to give off that I'm an independent, capable woman who also looks great in a flirty but not overtly sexy way. I should look attractive, but I want the guy to walk away talking about my personality instead of my outfit.   Dark wash skinny jeans, a nice top that's worn tucked in (maybe a fitted black tanktop or an off-the-shoulder blue sweater or a white top with lace sleeves). Black riding boots or other footwear I can walk long distances in. Then I use accessories to bring in some glam/color -- sparkly stud earrings (nothing distractingly dangly), a pendant necklace (maybe pick a talking point pendant, something with a story or that reflects my hobbies), shimmery eye makeup.    I always bring a sweater/scarf so I can be prepared for the cold AC (practical!). I have a burgundy one that I love because it goes great with all my black and white tops.	episode_done:True

text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:My hair was a bright blue/purple for a while, and I definitely had to alter my wardrobe to accommodate it. The colors I'd been used to wearing clashed badly with my hair, so I shifted my wardrobe toward colors that suited it. I didn't necessarily plan my outfits to match it, but I wanted to be sure that nothing I wore clashed. When I eventually went back to my natural color, I had to once again get rid of some wardrobe pieces and replace them!	episode_done:True
text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Many years ago I moved from Hawaii to college in the Northeast. I would recommend 1) Buying it all there, because they'll have what's good for their climate and 2) starting out with cheaper options (thrifted, Old Navy, Target range) even if it's not quite your style. Don't spend much time, effort, and money until you see how you really feel after at least a year of seasons. Maybe you want warmer stuff than you thought you would, or realize you should invest in nicer socks, or discover you don't actually like turtlenecks, or shift to a different style when you're surrounded by a new area's vibe. Let yourself experience it for a bit without pressuring yourself to do it all right.

Is the Lands End Rusk Down Parka going to be as warm (or almost as warm) as the Peak XV or is it significantly less warmer?

I'm also leaning really hard into oxfords, and I'm looking for a pair of really statement ones.  I might have to start an Office of Angela Scott savings fund.    I think most casual or professional outfits can be worn without heels, you probably just need to get the item tailored to hit you at the right place.  Formal-wear is always the hardest for me.  You can do a low block heel, but this is where I find my outfit choices to be the most limited.	episode_done:True

text:Post-Baby Problems I Wish Someone Had Warned Me About	labels:Cheapie bras until your boobs settle down. Mine seem to have gone from DD, to bigger when I started breastfeeding to a pancake shaped C now 2yrs in. And for some reason they just slip right out of every single bra that isn't tightly fitted. Liquid boobs.	episode_done:True
text:What are some unexpected surprises you've found with certain clothing brands that are known for other things?	labels:I've heard Uniqlo is known for this and that, ultra light down jackets, denim, T-shirts, OCBDs, but imo their best products are their lambswool stuff,   they have a fantastic bang for the bucks ratio (I really like their OCBDs too, but I don't have anything to compare them to)  ultra light downs look really bad imo not my cup of tea, their T-shirts are okay and once in a blue moon they release some interesting prints, their denim stuff is pretty good I guess.

text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Having consistently good outfits that don't take a ton of time to plan every single day starts with a well organized closet (or just small one, hence the capsule wardrobe people,) so focus on identifying what makes an outfit look good to you, or what you tend to think of first when you're building an outfit, and make sure that your closet is well stocked with those items.    Personally, I almost always think of colour first when getting dressed, so my go to formula is something black+another colour/pattern I like.  Since I don't want black to be boring, most my tops and bottoms have fun textures or wildly different silhouettes, and when I hit a colour I love, I make sure that I at least get basics and a pattern with that colour in it.  Getting dressed at this point is only as difficult as I want to make it. I can go all black or monochrome if I'm feeling lazy, or go ham with colours/patterns if I'm feeling creative, but it always looks intentional, regardless of the amount of effort I put in.	episode_done:True
text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:I want a fitted v neck that is almost cropped (I have no torso, I'm basically a pair of shoulders on legs) that is somehow not tight enough to make it look like I have a giant back roll from my bra. If someone makes it and it works, I will buy one in every single color.   I've tried everything--wearing my "right size" bra makes the problem insane, as apparently the tissue over my ribs is just super squishy (?).	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: Beauty is Pain	labels:Everyone knows that true beauty is inner beauty, so over the past year, I've really focused on psychological pain and suffering. My top three habits include:  - Putting on a cute outfit every day and wearing a full face of makeup so that I'm not only slightly uncomfortable all day, but I'm also reminded of the fact that I haven't seen another person in over 10 months, so no one cares what I look like.  - Every Saturday I make myself a cocktail and put on one of my formal dresses to reminds myself of how much weight I've gained since I last attended a fancy party.  - I cut my own bangs  I'm pretty sure I'm at the brink of a nervous breakdown, but my *soul* looks radiant over zoom.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop for specific things without google clogging up with items from fast fashion? Or. How do you find the real designer of a fast fashion item?	labels:On Poshmark or eBay, I set a minimum price to filter out the worst of it. On eBay, you can also search specifically for pre-owned items, which might also help depending on what you're looking for. (Vestiaire and TRR have much less of it.)   I generally still get some, but it's much easier to scroll through and look for what I want.	episode_done:True

If you're built on the smaller side height or weight wise I would definitely recommend.

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:Not so much a uniform as a personal 'dress code' that came about because, if left to my own devices, I will randomly buy patterns and fabrics I think are beautiful and make dressing myself impossible.  I have a handful of cuts I like, have cut my colors down to specific shades, have gotten really, really specific about what makes an print acceptable, and if I really love something, I'll buy one variation and make it a pair.  (Just today, my boatneck, black & white floral t-shirt got a black and white floral, square neck tank sibling.)  End result means that while I'm not wearing the same thing every day, I can kind of choose a something I'm feeling (geometrics! black and white patterns! green!) and wear it for a stretch.	episode_done:True

text:Very good call, but on a similar note: Legion, the TV series with Navid Neghaban. He wore some crazy awesome suits. Other characters dressed differently. There was overall supposed to be a vaguely 70s vibe, but that was shifting constantly. Oliver had a 60s vibe for specific plot reasons. Amy has a 40s vibe for reasons that aren't at all clear. And, at the same time, everything is futuristic. David's tee shirts led to some interesting color/symbol theories. Track suits in an insane asylum. Hippy gear in a cult.	labels:A lot of Dr Martens in that show!	episode_done:True

text:Runways have been sending out 2000s vibes. Anyone onboard?	labels:I'm down with some of it, at least. I was in my late teens/early 20s for through the mid-2000s, and I definitely liked some of the trends. Like in the link you posted, I definitely dig the sunglasses. I was just saying to my husband the other day that I miss the kinds of sunnies that were popular during the early 2000s :) I liked the brighter colours and more interesting styles... like patchwork jeans, flared pants, plaid, studded things, corset tops, newsboy hats... and chokers! Choker-length necklaces are my favourite, so I'd love to have more access to them! I'd even go for a seatbelt-belt, and I'm in my mid-30s now (still a quirky dresser, lol).     I definitely DO NOT want low-rise to come back though; that was the worst! It's always so hard to find pants that fit comfortably and a low-rise comeback will just kill my dreams of comfy pants being easy to find. Tracksuits can stay in the 2000s, too :P	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 20, 2021	labels:Few questions regarding parkas  1. How long is too long? I'm a little below average at 5'8 in socks, a parka I'm looking at goes down to lower thigh, maybe a couple of inches above my knee.  2. How do you feel about fur trimmed hoods on parkas? Do you think it looks too bulky for someone who is not super tall? Also is creme colored fur feminine?  3. Should I even invest in a parka? I live in a pretty mild climate (Santa Cruz, CA) it'll get to low 50s and high 40s at night rn, someimes high 30s and very rarely below freezing every few years. I figured it would make sense to have a good winter jacket since sometimes my friends and I go to the Sierra Nevadas, but should I just layer up for warmth instead of investing in a parka?

I've talked about this in multiple replies to these posts before (not that I'm able to find them right now because argh Reddit search noooo), but the gist is I have a bunch of items I routinely wear and a bunch of items I don't.  Now the clincher for me is that stuff I don't regularly wear, I sell.  I'm hitting that point where I'm going to sell off a bunch of stuff because I haven't put it on in 9 months and I don't want to sit on unworn things.  As far as "nicer" vs "less nice" goes - I've never let that stop me.  If I'm buying something, I better damn well wear it, whether it's $10 or $100 or $1000.

I'm looking to back some of the Gustin heavyweight tees but I'm having difficulty with their sizing. I'm long in the torso with a pretty significant taper from shoulders down to waist. I've had good experience fitting the 3sixteen large tee in their long cut. I like the Gustins because Ive read they fall low at the waist. By their size guide I think I should be a medium, but this will be too tight if I get any shrinkage whatsoever. Shipping internationally so I'm hoping to get the size right.  Can anyone comment on how their sizes relate and if I can expect shrinkage in the Gustin shirts?

It is not the same thing, not the same merchandise. I walked into a saks off fifth once thinking I'd be able to find a good deal. They are not selling anything from saks off fifth in actual saks ever. The quality is not good. Low quality fake leather, bad sewing, cheap fabrics. I guess I'm just not the demographic they were looking for, but I do feel like it cheapens the integrity of the actual department store to put their name on those stores, but it must be working for them I guess, otherwise they wouldn't keep doing it.
text:I got a real THE Valentino small bag at an Off Fifth for about 50% off. It was the only one and in a case but there we plenty of the Mario Vs in the surrounding areas. Mine was the only true brand one, I figured it was a return and last season.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I go at least twice a week to 3 or four different local ones and that seems to be the key. I find amazing stuff but most days leave empty handed. Luckily they are all within ten minutes of my work so I can pop in on lunch break.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I'm short, and one of the fashion guidelines I tend to read say to create long lines - this means avoiding ankle straps on shoes. I LOVE ankle straps on everything - heels, flats, sandals, etc. I definitely ignore this rule! Another rule I saw was to avoid the midi length since it can sometimes be too long but not long enough to be maxi. I wear my midi length skirts high-waisted so they fall at the right point and I love them. IDC if they make me look short, they're gorgeous!
text:My feeling with this is - how can things "make you look short" if you happen to be five foot? You are short. This is fine!	labels:Exactly. Basically, these "dress for your body type" things are this:  Short? Look taller.  Tall? Look shorter.  Thin? Look curvy.  Curvy? Tone down your curves!  And so forth and so forth...
text:Plus:  Hour glass shaped? Do what you want.  Not hour glass shaped? Try to look hour glass shaped.	labels:Straight hair? Curl it up to look fancy!  Curly hair? That's not professional. Straighten it before going to work.   ?????	episode_done:True
text:Brands that are actually great that you discovered on Instagram?	labels:i kept seeing people touting mejuri as 'good quality jewelry!'

I shall be the most fabulous witch while watching not-so-scary movies, eating candy, and getting properly sloshed.

She owns almost no makeup (and has perfect skin... the genes did NOT pass down y'all), wears a straight cut jeans and t-shirt almost all the time, and has short hair that she doesn't have to do anything with. Oh and also, she has perfect eyebrows despite not doing basically anything for them. She taught me to never shave and always get waxed, which I did for a few years before getting sick of it and saying fuck it I'm gonna shave, and to use conditioner instead of shaving cream while shaving (which personally, after trying both, I disagree with). However, she has a lot of cool clothes from the 90s which are super trendy right now (almost all were bought on sale at various times during the decade lol), and we're the same size so I get to snag all of it, which is super fun.	episode_done:True

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I'm ~~32~~ 33, and I remember feeling the same way back then, that leopard print and other animal prints were "too sexy" and "looked trashy." I used to tease my mom for buying leopard print blouses and scarves and tell her they were tacky. It was pretty much the only thing I was ever a brat to her about, tbh.   Well I had to eat my words when I got a leopard print faux fur coat a few years ago, lol. For some reason one day I just had to have a leopard coat, couldn't get it out of my head, and spent months looking for the perfect one. I say I'm embracing the tacky.  I like the look of leopard print on others these days. Tiger print can be nice if it's subtle, with small stripes and lower contrast. On the other hand I only like zebra print if it's one of those ironic "actual picture of zebras" blouses, and I highly agree that snake print tends to mostly end up on poorly made garments, where the problem isn't really the print, it's the cut/design/quality... it can look nice on accessories though.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 19	labels:What's your go to for highish quality affordable casual collared shirts. Think j.crew 6+ years ago (the last time I updated my wardrobe).   Is Spier Mackay good for both dress/casual shirts (and chinos actually)? I like the styling as their casual stuff still looks pretty dressy/adult. Not sure about the quality, it's a new brand to me.   What about uniqlo, Banana, or other smaller brands? Uniqlo stuff doesn't fit me well and I'm not really into the style, but price and quality are a match. Not sure about banana republic.   Bonus if you can recommend a stretch denim tapered jeans for 100ish. Thanks!!!
text:For a stretch denim tapered jean I love Du/er.  Super comfortable, I have worn them a lot and they have stayed durable, I have big legs and the slim fits me well and has a decent taper on it, 13.5 inch opening on my size I believe.    SPier Mackay is a much smaller brand than the other two you listed and much more high quality.  No experience with their pants but I am a big fan of the casual shirts and more dressy shirts.  Great value proposition IMO.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:If you like ______, you might like ______.	labels:I like Torrid but I'm losing weight and won't be able to continue wearing their clothes for much longer. So, anyone have ideas straight-sized brands equivalent to Torrid styles?
text:Which side of Torrid do you like? The licensed character aspect or the trendy-with-a-dash-of-business-casual?  If you're looking for the fun, character side, I would suggest Hot Topic, Think Geek, and maybe Svaha.  If you're more for the trendy/business casual aspect, perhaps Banana Republic, J. Crew, ModCloth, ASOS, and Antonio Milani.	labels:I don't care about the licensed stuff. But, what I liked about them is that their pieces are usually unique and being a plus size store, the cuts are more flattering and are made to accommodate whatever extra fluff you might have. Even at a smaller size, I wished the straight size places made their clothes as flattering as a plus size store.  I still have lumps and bumps and a big butt at a size 6-8 and want clothes that smooth all of that out.   I have a more whimsical/"fun" style and I enjoy lots of colors, fun patterns and prints, quirky dresses and skirts, and colorful/printed pants in flattering cuts. I also want the clothes to be higher quality/well made.  I can often find things that match my style in other places but I struggle to find things that fit as well as Torrid's clothes do. I like high waisted things, no crop  tops, roomier sleeves to accommodate extra skin, etc.   I will have to branch out and check out some of these other places.

Two of the garbage accounts defending this dude coincidentally post in regressive racist subs.
text:To be frank.  Cancel Culture is fucking ridiculous and yes its a real thing.  That said.  This isn't an example of Cancel Culture.  When someone does something horrific or illegal and face consequences including loss of revenue, that just reality.  Cancel Culture in my opinion would be over blown reactions to minor faux paus that result in serious ramifications/death threats/life ruining consequences/ etc for something that really isnt  a huge deal.  Or is massively over blown due to social media.  To many idiots try to labal every instance of some dipshit getting his/her own as "cancel culture".	labels:> Cancel Culture in my opinion would be over blown reactions to minor faux paus that result in serious ramifications/death threats/life ruining consequences/ etc for something that really isnt a huge deal.  I also consider "cancel culture" to include non-minor transgressions that have yet to be substantiated resulting in substantial negative consequences (not necessarily "life ruining" but still real).  I've seen a lot of people use that definition as well.  I think where you see people in disagreement though is what "substantiated" means in that case. Some people would say that multiple accusations from different sources would point to a preponderance of evidence. Some people would say that only a conviction in the legal sense would.  Regardless, I'm not here to claim one or the other.  I'm just saying that I think "cancel culture" also includes negative ramifications that come prior to a judgement being entered.  So I feel like this could be an example depending on whether you feel that level of substantiation has been met or not with the accusations.
text:Yeah the fact that everybody is just glossing over the fact that these are still only allegations is definitely cancel culture.  The truth is mob justice isn't justice. Dude deserves his day in court, and if these allegations prove true, deserves to be heavily punished. Until then, innocent until proven guilty exists for a very important reason.   The problem here is nuance. Some people are fully engaged in cancel culture. Some people are fully engaged in apologizing for a predator. And everybody in the middle with any nuance whatsoever in their opinion gets steamrolled.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:If I was going to do this, I would work towards having a selection of bold pieces that work with more neutral items.  So, for example, a loud shirt that could be paired with a black skirt/trousers, or a really colourful skirt that can be paired with lots of different basic tops.  You could also use accessories (scarves, bags, belts, jewellery) as your statement pieces.  I've seen some comments suggesting that if you like bright/loud colours and statement pieces that a capsule wardrobe isn't for you but I don't think that's true.  It's just that it's easier to stick to a simple colour palette.    You can totally have bright colours and bold prints in a capsule - you just need to think more about your purchases so that they work with your other clothing.  A black top will go with everything pretty much but a patterned shirt might not.
text:That's a great way to put it! I have a black top that I like to wear but I got rid of my bright red pants a while back...or packed them away maybe? I'll have to dig them out and see if I can make some fun pairings with it! :)	labels:I used to wear a hot pink cardigan with like every other outfit lol. The only reason I do not now is because the one I loved has some holes, so it is regualted to desperate duties. When I find a new one, it'll be back to heavy duty rotation. Hot pink worked with my other colors, so that was a staple!	episode_done:True

text:My take cv on versatile skirt is one that can be dressed up for a nicer occasion and dressed down on other ones - and goes with a variety of tops.   The day dress is a dress that is work and weekend friendly- but not cocktail party friendly.   Sweatsuit alternative is something that feels as comfy as wearing sweats but looks more put together.

text:A Bespoke Shirtmaker On How A Shirt Should Fit	labels:Sleeves are my eternal issue with shirts, and why for so long I opted for short sleeve shirts. So often with RTW shirts the cuffs are so big they start sliding down my hand (looking at you, Charles Tyrwhitt). If they have a second button quite often it makes a dip in a bit rather than the complete circle and often still goes down my hand enough that the cuff bends when I move my hands. So many RTW shirts also have their sleeves a bit too short for me (kind of acceptable considering overly large cuffs). Some end up being too tight in the upper sleeve, painfully cutting into my arms if I reach forward (looking at you again, Charles Tyrwhitt) no matter the size. I don't remember shirts doing this in the past so perhaps an issue since I gained weight.	episode_done:True

Overspending on clothes can come from treating shopping as a hobby. I switched from browsing online stores to looking at high fashion photo shoots and shows. Still scratches the fashion itch. But you can't exactly impulse buy a $10,000 dress.   Can you also try focusing on other, non-fashion related hobbies?

She likes to garden and read and cook. Her only jewelry is her wedding ring, and she doesn't wear makeup or perfume. Her only skincare is sunscreen.   My mom is also a veteran and very practical and down to earth. She wears birkenstocks, plain shirts and jeans. But she always bought me whatever clothes I wanted for school. She also dyed my hair with manic panic and took me to get my first piercing. And recently she gave me her stash of vintage wool sweaters. She still won't give me her vintage coach bags though.	episode_done:True
text:What’s a piece you bought before the pandemic, but haven’t worn a single time since because the occasion has been cancelled/we have literally nowhere to go?	labels:A tommy holfiget coat snd a pair of boots plus a beautiful mauve raincoat	episode_done:True
text:How do you care for your expensive/fragile pieces?	labels:I wash with cold water on the delicates cycle. I use a free and clear detergent and I spot treat any specific stains with shout. I air dry all clothes except jeans (sometimes I will dry an item if I want it to shrink). Certain clothes I do not wash and will have dry cleaned at the end of the season (silk blouses, nice sweaters, puffers, coats) - I will hang them in the sun to deodorize them but you can also steam (I think).	episode_done:True

text:What are your favourite places to find loungewear ?	labels:Senita Athletics is a female owned workout clothing brand from Arizona. They are Lululemon level quality but so affordable! I own a pair of their  Weekend Joggers and they are seriously the comfiest article of clothing I own.
text:They also just launched their own lounge line, which has a really nice aesthetic. I am lusting over all of it right now.	labels:Oh wow, it looks like they launched that today! Good timing lol	episode_done:True
text:Brands that are actually great that you discovered on Instagram?	labels:Allan Shwartz!	episode_done:True
text:Looking for aesthetically pleasing pajamas	labels:I love Lunya.  They are very expensive.  They are excellent quality.  I wash mine in the washer and they are fine.   I like Summersalt sweatpants, but their lounge wear is somewhat over priced.    And this is coming from someone who thinks Lunya pj's are a sensible investment.	episode_done:True
text:Can we make a thread of everyone posting their all time favorite Halloween costume they wore? 🎃👻	labels:I dressed up as Clarissa Explains it All in college.

There was also the year my husband and I went as Leela and Fry from Futurama- lots of hair dye was involved.	episode_done:True
text:Do you name your favorite outfits?	labels:If I'm feeling a certain way about an outfit, I'll loudly announce "Category Is...!"

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 08	labels:What can you style cargo trousers with?
text:Depends on the fabric, the color and the fit of them. The more "rugged" they look, and the more the compatible outfit would be into workwear, outdoor or streetwear vide. But quite slim, sleek and minimal could work in smart casual looks, like the "bad boy" version of chinos.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is your favorite under-the-radar leather handbags / brand?	labels:I love Min and Mon.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 14, 2021	labels:I work in an office setting and I'm looking for a jacket that I can wear with a simple solid color cotton polo and slacks/khakis that is NOT a blazer and frankly I have no idea what websites I could look at or what kind of style/material I should even be looking for. Stores are pretty much out of the question because I don't have anything nice around where I live. I know this sounds silly, but it will mostly be for walking from the car to the building and occasionally out and about so if it worked with some dark denim jeans and boots that would be a plus. I appreciate everyone in advance!
text:A shawl cardigan would look great with all of those outfits and should be super comfortable, depending on your budget you could go for one in cotton (cheaper) or wool (more expensive but warmer). JCrew, Banana Republic, and Abercrombie are good budget options that I usually stick with but I've heard amazing things about Spier & Mackay and Kent Wang if you can afford them!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:All things K-Fashion!	labels:I wonder if the 2020 trends (logos, maximalist shapes, general flamboyancy) will actually play out in the US in the next year or so, when there's a tendency to minimize in times of economic recession. Or do you think it's the Gen Zeers who are mostly into K -fashion? If the trends persist, it'd probably be through the generation that isn't at risk of being laid off.  I like the simpler "classic feminine" styles and the fitted silhouettes. Not big into the ruffles.
text:> Or do you think it's the Gen Zeers who are mostly into K -fashion?   K-fashion has been popular among Millennial Kpop/Kdrama fans since like the 2010s. It's one of the reasons why sites like Yesstyle is so popular.	labels:Thanks, I didn't know. I'm a millennial but have more or less been ignorant to Kdrama and pop. Also, I shop on Yesstyle but for Kbeauty! Never thought of it as a fashion site.
text:their tagline on their URL tab says "shop Asian fashion, beauty, and lifestyle" though so I'm confused on how you never considered it as a fashion site.	labels:Was my comment unintentionally contentious? Maybe I'm just oblivious? I've shopped there 1-2 times, and likely didn't even get to the beauty tab from the home page. I don't know. I'm confused, too :)	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 20	labels:Trying to expand my wardrobe a bit for F/W in boston. College student so on a typical day I'd wear a sweater with black/regular denim or chinos, or throw in a black denim jacket with a hoodie and regular denim.   I know I can trying different sweater patterns/pants colors, but I'm trying to go for another kind of outfit outside of what I usually wear.

Not a moment's peace since they got here (we're dogsitting for family).  Ghostname: Meh	episode_done:True
text:My incomplete guide for buying less in 2021	labels:I wanted to completely upgrade my wardrobe and I spend a lot of money on clothes this month. Even though there are still a few things left I want to buy, I want to spend less money and be more mindfully since I came to the realisation that there are always new clothes, styles and trends and you can't have them all. I am selling my old stuff I don't wear anymore to start fresh. I will also delete most of my shopping Apps and unsubsribe to newsletters because it is too tempting and make a list of things I **actually** want and need.	episode_done:True
text:Fashion Favorites	labels:a nice pair of ankle boots (i love my everlane day boots and stuart weitzman yulianas)- i love them in black but feel extra cool when i wear my white boots. and honestly, just those paired with some light wash flared jeans, simple white slightly cropped tee, and cool pair of sunglasses or bag is my favorite outfit.   a mini bag (knockoff jacquemus)- when i wear my bright pink one with a dark green or white turtleneck sweater dress, i feel super fashion forward haha
text:White boots and mini bags absolutely ooze cool, very trendy!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you feel about vegan/faux leather?	labels:People here have pretty much nailed it: faux leather is really just plastic, and not particularly durable plastic at that, for the most part. It's clearly a trend this year, which I'm sort of glad about - if something like that is going to be ubiquitous for a while, it's great that we're getting it over with during a pandemic.    Between faux leather everything, weird chunky boots, baggy jeans and "shackets," the fashion industry seems to be in an odd and gloomy mood this year. I hope we get something more fun and glamorous this spring, even if we're all still stuck at home.	episode_done:True
text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:The concept of a personal uniform brings me back to my retail days where it was all but required.   Not a period of my life that I want to relive.   However, I do not own things in every color of the rainbow.  I know my coloring and what colors look good on me and which do not.    Since I'm now WFH (until at least next year), I just focus on the top.  I've worked in PJ pants lately.	episode_done:True

text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:Glasses are a permanent fixture for me. I try to go with something that fits my shape and then find a nice style. I've had the same tortishell pair for about 4+ years now (the longest I've owned the same style) and I love them! they're neutral so they go with pretty much everything. then again my wardrobe is pretty neutral, as well haha	episode_done:True
text:I dyed my leather boots and here is how it went.	labels:What a great job! Well done. Excellent result. You should be able to wear these for years now	episode_done:True
text:Do you think fashion or style has age restrictions?	labels:I have a sneaky suspicion most here will just say, "YOU GO GIRL, WEAR WHAT YOU WANT!"  But if you're starting to feel uncomfortable in those things, I think maybe it's a sign?  Basically, if you think you don't look your best in certain clothing, it's fine to start thinking about what different pieces make you look and feel better and represent who you are now. I'm 34 and would wear crop tops and high waisted jeans, but honestly that is partially to do with the fact that I have not really embraced my thirties or feel like I have moved on to the next stage of life. In a post-pandemic world (where I am is in lockdown), I might re-evaluate.	episode_done:True

My workwear palette is Navy, Black, Light Pink, Ivory and Grey  My spring/summer casual palette is Sage, Ginger, Tan, Cream, White and Black  My fall/winter casual palette is Navy, Red, Brown and Grey  I always have my workwear out (with some adjustment for weather) but my winter and summer casual clothes go in storage when not in season	episode_done:True

text:How do you feel the Pandemic is affecting your style? (Or, “I am a butterfly in a chrysalis”)	labels:I'm using this time to focus on losing weight, rather than buying any more clothes. Nobody except my husband and kid sees me now anyway, so who cares if stuff doesn't fit great right now as I size out of it. Hopefully when things open up again, I'll be able to start fresh building a new wardrobe in a new size. I imagine there will be new trend explosions once people are going out again, and I'm not going to want to wear items bought during the pandemic time when all the brands are playing it safe with neutral colors and 2019's styles.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:I ignore what magazines, blogs, influencers, etc. tell me are "classic and timeless" pieces, and focus on what's classic and timeless *for me*. There are certain items that I'll wear until it falls apart, and finding versions of those items that are well-made, durable, and perfect for style is what's more important to me.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 31	labels:How weird is it to have a wardrobe that's pretty much from one brand? Like, is there a reason to buy pieces from different brands?
text:Not that weird, although if it's logomania'd to any degree you may become know as that "that guy who loves Adidas".  What brand are we talking about?	labels:Everlane. Dislike branding anyways so it works out. Their clothes seem reasonably priced and well made.

text:Aww yayy I'm so glad you liked it!   Rodarte's collection was one of my absolute favourites too! Your comment has also made me realise that I somehow wrongly labelled Rodarte as the photography Daria Kobayashi Ritch but unfortunately I cannot edit the album because I didn't sign up to Imgur (so FYI in case anyone sees it).   Haha totally, I'm sure Shein are working on their duplicates as we speak!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Inspo Albums: Quirky Professor/Librarian, Edgy Bohemian, and Governess Chic	labels:OP you absolutely nailed these inspo albums, and their descriptions!  Good job! :D   If I were less victorian/witchy goth and were more 'ladylike' I would totally be all over Governess Chic! Make sense I guess, your album does have some vintage/victorian vibes too with all those high necks and ruffles!
text:Definitely Victorian-adjacent!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:"I just felt like it" is a perfectly fine response.   It's a bit rude to ask "why are you so dressed up?", but mostly when people ask that it's because they see you wearing something different than what you usually wear, and are worried that they somehow underdressed for the occasion and can't change.
text:It is 100% so rude... I hate that question. Half the time I want to ask back "why did you shower today?" or "why did you brush your teeth?". I'm dressed up because I knew I'd be leaving my dwelling and this is what I wanted to wear.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I have made a realization that, apart from school uniforms, I only ever wear polo shirts	labels:I think as long as you avoid the synthetic fabric blends and look for high quality pique or sweater knit styles, polo shirts make an excellent staple.   I would explore polo shirts that have minimal branding and instead explore visual interest with contrast ribbing, or through muted sweater patterns.
text:This is the reason I've recently come around on polo shirts, especially when paired with soft/casual tailoring. I used to think all polos were shitty synthetic blends with garish company logos and not much more, but then I discovered Italian knit polos and my opinion began to shift.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:For young women entering the workforce, my key piece of advice is to also invest the time and effort in doing laundry properly. Buy critically and care for appropriately. No more shoving everything into 1 washer and 1 dryer.   I have some pieces from fast fashion brands that have held up really well for several years that I love wearing and feel good wearing. Buy drying racks and mesh garment bags. Air dry as much as you can. The clothes are less likely to fade or misshapen - which is one of the quickest way for a piece of clothing to come off as cheap.  It's not feasible for everyone to have those Pinterest picture-perfect capsule wardrobes - sometimes, you want a varied wardrobe and can really only shop at mall brands. The important thing is you're not accumulating for accumulation sake and that you are purchasing mindfully and purposefully, even if it's not those "investment" pieces.	episode_done:True

text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:Everything eventually comes back in fashion.  Personally I would love for 2000s jeans to come back - not super low rise or the ones that were bedazzled or laced up but just normal rise bootcut and flare jeans. I have a few from that era that I still wear all the time and a couple more that I had to replace with similar ones from poshmark because I couldn't find them in shops.  I also miss 2000s makeup. Sure, there was too much body glitter and candy colors but there was also the fresh dewy look of blush and a light lip gloss - think Britney Spears in her Oops I Did It Again video, or Mandy Moore's makeup in her video for Candy. Not everything in the 2000s was horrible lol.
text:Lip gloss has been back in style for about a year now !	labels:I know- too bad it doesn't matter much cause I always have to wear a mask lol. If we ever get to a post-covid world, lipgloss is definitely one of the things I'll be looking forward to	episode_done:True

text:Decolonize Sustainable and Ethical Fashion	labels:This is great, but this sub constantly shares links for Amazon and fast fashion brands so there is a long way to go. It would also help to share resources on what to look for instead of what to avoid. If those buzzwords aren't real guarantees, how do you know? How do you check if what you're about to purchase is truly eco/human friendly at all?
text:>This is great, but this sub constantly shares links for Amazon and fast fashion brands so there is a long way to go.  Keep in mind that sustainable/ethical fashion is pretty pricey and people don't always have the option to buy ethically. Thrift shopping definitely helps, but depending on your situation it can be difficult to rely on thrift stores entirely. But maybe as things get more automated, sustainable/ethical fashion can become more affordable. Of course, a cultural shift regarding our wardrobes would help to, but that's not exactly easy to pull off. SOMETHING needs to be done, we can't keep consuming the way that we do...	labels:Thank you, there is no way for me to even save up for some stuff that gets promoted on here, especially Eileen Fisher. Miss me with spending a whole paycheck on one shirt.	episode_done:True
text:Is it disgusting to not wear socks with shoes?	labels:There are plenty of shoe sprays you can use to get rid of the odor. Go to Amazon for all natural ones.   Alternatively use leather shoes.

text:Which pieces make you feel like you’re really cool?	labels:Mixing girly, feminine pieces with badass jackets or shoes. I have a leather biker jacket and aviator jacket (from Zara and Loft, but got them off Poshmark) that I adore, and I feel that I can wear them with anything. For shoes, I like to wear Yeezys, Vejas, Vans, or Chucks with dresses, too.	episode_done:True
text:Do you have any pieces that "should not" work with your body that just seems to work?	labels:Seems to be that many so called rules are mainly to minimize our strongest and most unique features. But why are we being told to be apologetic about our most unique attributes? I'm one who tends to flaunt my strengths. I show off my muscular shoulders. I cinch my high waist at my actual waist instead of trying for the illusion of a proportionate waist. I wear pegged pants on my munchkin legs with FLATS *gasp* i like me. I like my style.	episode_done:True
text:Looking for a Shear Thing (Shearling Jackets)	labels:This time last year I was on the Arizona Trail. I was heading to town to resupply and I got a hitch from a Gila County cattleman in an old F-150. Handsom young guy, quiet but kind as can be. He was wearing old 501s and a shearling bomber over a tshirt that had once been white. His sandy hair matched the undyed wool and the leather matched his dusty boots. It was the most natural, most fitting, least pretentious use of a shearling jacket outside of being in the ball turret on a Flying Fortress. And *even he* just barely pulled it off. Because shearling is the peacock-feathers of Americana.

text:What ultimate-splurge fashion item would you buy to reward yourself for achieving a big milestone?	labels:love this question! I find it hard to decide when I deserve a reward though.

text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:Crocs and Uggs.   I have fleece lined Crocs i wear as slippers at home. I have Ugg boots and a puffer jacket for the chilly snowy Canadian winter days

What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:A lot of the polyester blouses I got from Loft were machine washable, hang dry.	episode_done:True
text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I was 18 and my best friend's family at the time were very much into having the nicest stuff. They were always getting the newest iphone and having the newest cars. I won some money at bingo and they convinced me to go buy my first michael kors purse and that led to an addiction. I am 5 purses in now at 23, and I haven't bought a new purse in a year and I tend to keep it that way. I also am a grad student so I make no money to buy more. I think I want to buy one when I graduate/get a job	episode_done:True
text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:This is probably opposite of most of the advice here, but I advocate for buying *exactly* what you want and not worrying about sales/price etc (assuming it fits your budget). I'd rather a few garments I love than many that are ok/fine.  Edit: NB that this is with the caveat that you have a good understanding of what you like and what works for you. If you're new to the idea of dressing well or with intention, it may be worth holding off on springing for things.
text:120+ upvotes...not that underrated a take after all.  Edit : But saying it's a popular sentiment gets downvoted. Y'all are weird.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:Fleece-lined tights! They're going to be your new best friend.   I used to work outdoors in all weathers, and I still refused to wear trousers. Doubling up tights is fine, but the fleece ones changed my life.
text:Second this times a million.  If you wear boots, you can even do fleece-lined leggings.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever found a designer, maker or collection that makes you seriously think, "Everything they make is so beautiful and I want to own/collect everything they make?" If so, what is it?	labels:i fucking love miumiu. it's my perfect fashion ideal of cute/punk/weird/cat lady/japanese-street-style. ever since they came out with those stupid teacup heels i've been obsessed with them.  all i have is their perfume (perfect) but someday i hope to own something special!
text:It's very cute. A lot of the new fall pieces remind me of Alexa Chung's vibe.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:As a PNW lady I usually wear comfy leggings or stockings and boots/booties with a cute top. I have way more outwear than I should. Ones for rain, snow, wind, layering; hats, scarves, coats, and so on. It's a good way to combine different textures and practicality. But the biggest thing is having a back up. Seattle weather can be unpredictable. It'll be extremely cold in the morning but too hot for a sweater by lunch. So even though I plan something cute I usually end up bumming it. I don't tend to stray from comfortable/practical clothing. There are outfits I'd love to rock if I was in warmer weather constantly, but I'm a nature girl at heart so most of my collection consists of stuff that can be used athletically or professionally.

text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:I've slowly switched over to leggings/kaftan combos.  I like lightly-fitting long sleeves because I don't like the feeling of things randomly touching my arms and the fabric deadens that sensation somewhat. Can't be too snug with the seams... I've got a solid upper-body (thanks Germanic peasant genes) so some shirts just don't work because swolegirlproblems.   Funnily enough I'm fine at home, but that's because everything is my stuff so I don't mind my stuff touching me... but other people stuff... (shrugs) It's a thing.   I sew and have a seam-ripper that's great for removing tags.   Hmmm what else... oh yeah, camisoles. I don't like the feeling of the fabric I'm wearing sliding around my skin, so camisoles deaden that sensation. No scritchy lace... no seams on the under-bust... no plastic clips on the straps. I cut those out and sew the straps to the length I want them to be. Boom no probs...   I have sacks of clothes that failed the sensory test. Super cute! Just... "AAGHH Noooo..." (takes it off and tosses in pile) "Damn it."	episode_done:True

text:WEEKLY DEALZ	labels:I am still reeling from the Nordstrom rack sales on Everlane items. They are so good. The sneakers are really good quality for 19 bucks, and I do see sizes come back, if you check daily. I bought a pair for myself and a pair for my friend.  I also bought a few clothing items that is taking forever to ship though. I might cancel some of them and wait out the rest. I mean, 30ish bucks for dresses/jumpsuits and 40s for cashmere is a pretty good deal, and it's not like Everlane's style is gonna change much. They sell the same shit year in and year out.
text:omg thank you for sharing. just snagged 4 pieces for under $80 for my eventual post-covid work wardrobe	labels:That's great! I think Everlane's quality is better than regular mall brands, and some of the styles are good.

text:I Spent $600 on T-Shirts to Find the Best One	labels:I feel like having one of the biggest contributing variables being "if it fits a pudgy gut and would still do so if the user became even tubbier" is frankly silly. Same with talking about streamlines and silhouettes. I get that fashion and fit are important no matter the body type of the wearer, but for people without a gut, a baggy midsection is a huge barrier and negative to actually having streamlined looks.	episode_done:True

They were just as easy to wear and comfortable as joggers, but mentally I felt more put together and in a work mindset at home, wore them almost every day this summer and fall. Picked up an extra one from each of their clearance sales for the spring, but would really like to find something similar in a winter weight fabric.  Worst: everything I bought in February for my new job, but haven't really been able to wear as I started working from home in early March and don't anticipate being back on site until June at the earliest. (Bought some new dress pants, a couple of ponte tunics and a new leather tote bag).	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: Zoom Fashion Etiquette	labels:Serious question here: how do yall with cleavage dress to minimize that? I have broad shoulders and large surface area below by neck, and I've now realized that my regular office attire looks really out of place during my wfh zoom meetings. Like... just because of the angle of my webcam, the fact that you can only see me from the chest up, and my weird body proportions (tiny head but broad shoulders), it just is a weird look.   Should point out that I'm in a new job, I'm young for the job, and I've never met my coworkers or manager irl because of the entire organization is working from home. So I feel a little uncomfortable with having extra skin show online when irl I would look totally normal.

text:This is accurate! Even if the intention of a system is different, it ends up being used like this anyway.	labels:Yeah! Like, obviously the concept of 'people with wide hips or a small chest or w/ev will be flattered by certain cuts' isn't weird. But the number of categories added and conflicting advice means you kinda have to just judge piece by piece anyways. Human bodies vary so much unless your silhouette is as exaggerated as Marilyn Monroe, body shapes don't feel useful	episode_done:True
text:Coveteur: An Ode to the Striped Shirt	labels:I fucking love stripes. Vertical striped shirts bring me joy, and I can never find enough of them. Although I think maybe that interest is shifting into grid/cross bar checks.

text:How many pairs of jeans and pairs of shoes should you own?	labels:In the case of jeans (and other pants), it is a matter of how often you do laundry.  I do laundry roughly every 10 days.  I have my clothes separated into lights, darks, sheets, towels.  I need enough clothes to not just fill a load (washing partial loads is a waste of money) but to last me enough time between loads.  I'm one person.  Someone who does laundry for a family of 5 likely does laundry much more often than me and likely wouldn't have the problems a single person would.	episode_done:True

text:What Do You Wear With Strong Sentimental Value?	labels:My grandpa has been a huge influence on me, his life story and the stories he tells about his grandparents are really inspiring. He was in the US Navy, and to remember him by, I bought a Schott peacoat.   However, I've seen my grandpa's dress blues, and inside there's really nice stitching and a patch of a dragon. I found that same patch on ebay, it was sold as an option with the dress blues at the time, and I sewed it into the peacoat.   I hardly get to wear the peacoat because where I am it doesn't get nearly cold enough, but it still means a lot, and I always look for an excuse to wear it.  That's one of my most meaningful clothing items, but everything I have I try to attach a meaning to. I have a  leather jacket I bought with my first paycheck, a watch I bought from my grandpa's home town, and many other things that I've given my own complicated stories to. I love bringing deeper meaning to everything in my life.	episode_done:True
text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:Does anyone know if this applies to an online store like 6pm? I like getting some Kate Spade stuff there (watches, bags). I assumed they just clearanced the Zappos merchandise.

Deerskin would work well with a lot of my outfits, is cheapest. Lamb nappa prob looks too smart although might be okay with harrington. Peccary would be v versatile, but touchscreen would be most practical for now. Hrm.	episode_done:True

I've tried on various jeans and cargos who are loose fit when standing but have very little crotch space when sitting. Trying to avoid the infamous dink print.	episode_done:True
text:What are some stores/brands that have surprised you?	labels:Kirkland and Costco in general. I lost weight right at the beginning of the pandemic when fitting rooms were being closed and the only place I go outside of my house is costco to get groceries so I've started getting clothes there too. Prices are good, quality is good, and the return policy is amazing. I've been surprised with the quality of Kirkland brand leggings and tops and I've been able to restock my wardrobe with coats, basics, and work from home outfits (mostly leggings!) for very cheap. Recently got a plush, warm, long robe for only $9! And there are good online deals pretty regularly as well. They also have lower prices on designer clothing/purses/perfumes/make-up.
text:Hell yes! All of my daily wear underwear is Kirkland signature, and the Nicole Miller Original multi-pack of leggings from Costco are the best quality leggings I've ever owned.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:How do you feel about wrap dresses? I find that they are quite flattering if you manage to find one that hits your waist or somewhere slightly above it. Heavier fabrics also tend to skim over any bulges you may feel conscious of; that said, light florals or ruffles also can do a marvelous job drawing the eye to parts of your body you feel comfortable with.   You mentioned your broad shoulders: may I suggest off shoulder tops with structured fabrics or for colder temperatures - an off shoulder knit sweater or sweater dress you can pair with jeans or nice leggings?	episode_done:True
text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:i miss putting on make-up every morning tbh.... i used to enjoy doing it so much even when i had to wake up an hour earlier but playing music in the background and having fun, excited to see the final look is a feeling i miss with my whole heart..	episode_done:True
text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:Full disclosure: I am not addressing any ethics concerns in my comment.   I've ordered a few times from Shein. I've gotten some really nice unique and flattering things that I get a lot of compliments on. I've only returned things that I didn't like on myself, not because they weren't as pictured. I find the exact measurements of every size and picture reviews very helpful. Don't order anything without reviews, at a minimum text reviews, and triple check the measurements and material on each item. I found the shipping to be decently quick and my refunds were processed quickly. No complaints.
text:Same I've had really good luck with some shein pieces but I also will only grab what has good reviews and photos.	labels:Same here. You can tell from customer photos which things have suitable cuts for the office (e.g. houndstooth/tweed stuff can be great but can be bodycon and the model photos don't always emphasise this), and which ones look to be good quality.	episode_done:True

text:The Bowery is going to be a little more formal, great for pairing with suit separates and sports coats. The 484 is much more casual so it's supposed to have a more relaxed fit which is why you notice that size difference. The BR is going to me more comparable to the Bowery since it's similarly structured.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have “irony pieces”?	labels:I have a shirt that has Ariel and Eric from The Little Mermaid that I got (thrifted) because I thought it was funny, but it's actually pretty comfortable so I wear it as a deterrent so randos don't try to approach me. I normally use it when I do laundry or other errands or (pre-covid) when I go out and eat alone.

text:Reigning Champ Hoodie: 2 months later	labels:I have 4 midweight hoodies in navy, forest green, charcoal and dusk. No elbow breakage here. Navy one of 3 years is still looking new.  Can you describe how the hoodie feels when you wore it? The only garment I associate with elbow holes is dress shirts - typical problem finance guys have when a shirt is pushed to its limit because you have your elbows on your desk all day. How often were you wearing the hoodie? 2-3 weeks between washes if you're wearing it everyday seems a little wrong to me even for a raw denim guy myself.	episode_done:True

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I require a relatively formal work wardrobe that includes suiting and tailored dresses.  After years of wasting time and money at the dry cleaners, I decided to rationalise my work wardrobe in a similar way to you some time ago.   Some brands, including Emporio Armani, Joseph, Me&Em and Norma Kamali, make very high quality machine washable polyester suiting and dresses that don't look remotely cheap or plastic-y. You can get suiting in machine washable wool from budget-friendly brands including Marks & Spencer and Next, but surprisingly designer brands don't seem to have taken up the opportunity. Wool or cashmere knitwear (any brand) can be machine washed if you invest in a modern machine with a wool setting and a specialist detergent. While deeper coloured cottons will eventually fade, it is otherwise resilient to machine washing and probably the best choice for shirts.  I would avoid silk. Even if it's washable, the colours will eventually fade, and it's hard to remove stains without damaging the fabric.	episode_done:True

text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:A huge chunk of my wardrobe is built out from Amazon. I add everything to a list, and wait until Amazon's algorithms decide they need to sell it for $6. They also offer Tall sizes on quite a lot of items, which is great for having sleeves that fit.  Uniqlo for jeans, Amazon's Peak Velocity brand for Tshirts, and Goodthreads for everything else is what I would do if I had to start from Scratch.  If there's a certain type of item your looking for, feel free to ask for recommendations and I can send you a link to what I'd look at.

text:I (M/39) just bought some bright yellow, women's, terry loungepants from August November. What wonderful "non-female" fashion items have you purchased recently? Do you ever dip into the men's section?	labels:I've done mens pants before but they have to be very specific styles, usually skinny or slim fit because the baggier styles are too overwhelming on my short frame. . Thrifting I can find some great men's button downs, and sweaters. Shoes too actually. I just got a pair of oxfords that fit great. Men's work boots are a lot cheaper than women's as well. I'll also grab t-shirts and flannels because they're usually thicker fabrics and aren't as low cut. I'll buy men's shorts too because they'll actually be knee length on me and the pockets are actually a good size.	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:Project Runway! I know this might sound silly but I never really realized just how much goes into designing and creating beautiful clothing until I got into that show. I grew up poor and thought fashion was something that only rich people cared about. Watching the designers on Project Runway create unbelievable outfits from only some relatively cheap fabric and a sewing machine made me realize just how much goes into being a fashion designer and I gained a huge respect for the industry. Now I am obsessed!

text:Does Anyone Ever Feel Like It’s Hard to Find Basic Clothing Items That Were Plentiful in the Past?	labels:I just consider "anywhere on the internet" accessible in 2020.   Local shopping for something specific has often been a wash for me, unless it's something like a bra or basic jeans.    Someone posted recently about being unable to find a basic suit --oh....it was the JCrew thread, and the suits all had unwanted details. I've found this annoying in the past when I wanted something that I thought should be easy to find at the mall, like a black pencil skirt, but honestly, I just plan ahead and look online if possible.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 24	labels:Opinions on best hoodie out there? Is reigning champ still.. well the reigning champ? If so, would you recommend the tiger fleece or the classic midweight terry? TIA!
text:Reigning Champ and American Giant are probably the two most commonly recommended on here.   The choice between tiger fleece and midweight terry is based on your preferences. Tiger fleece is a soft, very warm fleece fabric. Midweight terry is not as soft and not as warm but still quite cozy.   Tiger fleece might be *too* warm depending on where you live.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.
text:When I was going into the office I did this.

text:Does anyone else have “irony pieces”?	labels:I play an edgy, mall goth, tiefling, Graves Cleric named Desolation in a D&D game I'm in. When it was still safe to play in person I would occasionally dress up like the Mall Goth of my 16 y/o dreams. Then I ran out of pieces, and had to start buying more clothes to keep the costumes going.   Now I have an entire section of my wardrobe dedicated to this.
text:This makes me happy! Yay for costumes in real life. I also dress up for d&d but I'm also a new Orleans tour guide so I tend to incorporate costume stuff when I can or when I just want a lil extra joy even during COVID.	labels:Oh man which tour? I'm local-ish and have taken the vampire tour enough times that I'm ready to branch out
text:Awesome! I do a drunk and haunted and garden district/cemetery tours but I've been sitting out for a while. I'd love to do one with you one day. My company is Spectral City Tours btw!	labels:Cool when all this is over I'll check ya'll out. Mind if I ask for you/who do I ask for?

text:Mario Valentino is not Valentino Garavani	labels:At first I thought this was going to be a discussion about the difference between the secondary lines "Marc Jacobs" vs "Marc by Marc Jacobs", which is also sometimes difficult to wade through as well. But I didn't even know about this OTHER naming issue.  Jeez. I definitely feel bad for people thinking they got the deal of the century and just didn't know any better.  Edit: MJ was a bad example because I guess they discontinued MBMJ, maybe McQueen vs McQ would be a better current example

text:Ellen McArthur Circular Economy Report: by 2029 Resale is expected to be bigger than Fast Fashion	labels:As a fat person this is so funny to me. Even more considering how rich people fucked all secondhand stores and markets in my city so now your great great great grandma's robe she was ashamed of wearing is now called a vintage dress and it costs 50 dollars
text:Uhhhhhh...1) there were fat people back in the olden days, too, 2) it's not a weight, it's a lifestyle, and 3) I actually feel pretty bad for your city, but surely there's other cities that have decent secondhand stuff, too?	labels:Oh yes, sure they were but like... You do realize that 1. some clothes that fat people wore absolutely can not be reselled again, 2 whatever i spend going to some other city is like my whole budget so i would arrive to this city with better shops, smile, wave and go back to mine. Look, im not exactly trying to gatekeep second hand shops here... But like it absolutely shouldnt become a bigger option than fast fashion. It just isnt that accesible to a lot of people
text:I'm pretty sure that as secondhand becomes bigger than fast fashion, it will become more accessible than fast fashion, too. We're still in the early stages of secondhand overtaking fast fashion.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Club Monaco is better quality for almost everything.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:Diesel. By far the best jeans I've ever owned.   I have pairs that are everything between 5-10 years old. Still in great condition. The stretch jeans actually "stretch back" when you take them off and the real denim last  forever. I got a five year old pair from my friend and I wore them five years as well before they started to tear off.   Levi's is also fine if you're into boyfriend cut and such, but Diesel is my favorite with their colors, design, cuts and quality.	episode_done:True
text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:Back when I did online dating and went on lots of first dates, I tended to keep it super casual and then just have one really flashy thing. Like jeans, sneakers, solid T-shirt, and flashy chandelier earrings. Or skip earrings and wear sequin shorts instead of jeans. If they wanted to go somewhere fancy, I just always talked them down into my comfort zone (i.e. a bar where all the staff know me, at least by sight) and will try to keep me safe if I need it.

text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:I'm a high waisted pant convert; I only buy pants with a 10"+ rise. It's both a comfort and a visual preference.  No long sleeves that I can't push or roll up. No decorative/non-functional hardware (except maybe buttons.)  Also, cold shoulders can go fuck themselves.	episode_done:True

text:I have no personal experience with the brand, but Golden Fox seems to make decent boots for a low price.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:I had bright blue Coraline hair for around 4 years (with a few months of pink or lavender intervals in that time) and it did actually change how I dressed.   I mostly wear black, with some grey and camel, but until I had blue hair I hadn't realized how many of my office tops were blue or blue patterns. I didn't like mixing the blue tones, so I ended up passing over all my blue clothes until I had pink or lavender hair again.  In my anecdotal experience, I felt like light pink went with nearly everything, but blue wasn't hard to fit into my (pretty neutral) style.
text:Oh huh.  My hair is midnight blue, and I avoid blue tops,  and never made that connection.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 04, 2021	labels:Is it weird that the more comfortable I get with my personal style, the less I wanna post pics online? Haha.  It was fun documenting my style journey through 2020 on instagram/reddit. But lately it just feels like such a chore to get a pic together.  I think I was using the WAYWT threads as a way to motivate myself to be more intentional with how I dress. Now that I love how I dress, I am finding it harder and harder to want to post.  I still enjoy posting in the picture threads, I just dont really have the *itch* to dress up for a photo like I used to.

text:  >Edit: before you jerks make this into copypasta let it be known I did this in middle school  That makes it *so* much better	labels:I know right, haha. I like that the mocking comments are outpacing mine by almost a factor of two. It's like people are unsure if they want to upvote my admittance. I wanted to let you boys have some fun with the fact this happened, but I'll take what I said in it to the grave.

text:What’s your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:This list is basically 60 percent of my wardrobe and I'm not even sorry. mid 30s and grew up in the 90s but my mom never bought me trendy stuff so I'm living. I hope flares and courdoroy stay because it's all so flattering.	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel sexy at home in winter?	labels:Shorts and those giant knit socks and a tank top lol	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:I feel like dressing in the winter is so difficult (although the clothes are so much cuter/look better on me lol) because it'll be like 20F outside and 110F inside, and then a balmy 80F on the metro (crammed with smelly people pre-covid). so I usually wear a pretty thick coat (I got a really nice one on LL Bean last winter) and light layers underneath - J Crew tissue turtlenecks are my staples, Docs, and a scarf.  I try not to leave my apt during the summer haha...still trying to figure out cute clothes that won't make me feel/look miserable
text:I had this problem at my last job when I took public transit to work. I finally just got into the habit of taking off my puffy coat once I got into the subway station and holding it on the train. I'm sure it made me take up like 10% more room, and it was harder to keep my hands free, but it was worth it to not be a puddle of sweat by the time I got to work.	labels:I swear this is why more people pass out on the T in the winter (or so it seems to me). You're wrapped up like a burrito and get on the train and then the heat is blasting and you start sweating. What a mess.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:Girl I feel you! I shop secondhand when I can to avoid contributing to additional clothing waste. ThredUp and Poshmark are great for online shopping. I also shop the local Goodwill & 2nd Ave. For specialty gear, try REI. They have a whole section of their website geared towards used items.	episode_done:True

text:How famous do you think this guy is lmao	labels:Pretty sure about as famous as you can get. He's done colabs with Pewdiepie, so short of actually being number one, he's as famous as you get on YouTube.
text:Dude nobody knows who this guy is, you cant fault people for not getting that this isnt actual fashion advice.   Ask anybody above 40 who he or Pewdiepie is and 99% wont know, the Pope is famous, Ronaldo is famous, Charlie isnt that famous.	labels:I don't think fame is ties to penetrating every single demographic. Nobody under 70 knows who James Dean is, but that doesn't mean he isn't famous.
text:Lots of people know who James Dean is, he is a fashion icon and everybody knows the pictures.	labels:Lots of people know who penguinz0 is, he's collaborated with some of the biggest entertainers on the internet and his videos have a cumulative view count of more than 2 billion	episode_done:True
text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:No, no, no and no. I hate the aesthetic thing. Buying things bc 'they fit in with my aesthetic' and not bc you like them is weird to me. You can be all of those styles all at once. I love having a grungy girl moment, a colourful LOOKATMENOW moment, a classy neutral I'm a big girl moment and a floaty yes I am a fairy and I just tiptoe about in pretty midi dresses moment.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 16, 2021	labels:Do you guys find oversized clothing actually comfortable? Of course loose is more comfortable than tight, but I feel at a certain point the extra fabric and longer sleeves become more and more annoying. Also don't people worry at all about their sleeves when eating?   I've been going for looser stuff lately but I just can't seem to make it work practically and appearance wise. I feel like the only person who's oversized fits I like is Scott Disick wearing hoodies, and I've been trying to go for the same fit. I know a lot of his stuff is from John Elliott, but even the models don't look as good IMO.
text:I feel you dude, big ol sleeves can get in the way a bit (especially really wide ones that drape down from the wrist). Generally I find looser fits more comfortable and more relaxing to wear, but I can empathize with that frustration.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Need to try this out!!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What pieces would you love "backups" of?	labels:This is pretty uninspired, but I have a lot of basics that I wish I had bought in duplicates, but didn't buy in duplicates, because I figured they were basics and I could always just get more.   Alas. The styles changed just a bit, and now I can't find the plain white tanks and tees I want because the sleeves and the neckline and the length are all just a tiny bit off. Thank you for reading along, this not-a-real-problem is very frustrating at times.
text:I agree with this. Statement pieces beyond jewelry I can't wear immediately without being noticeable so I tend not to wear those pieces as frequently and therefore don't have to wash them as much meaning they get a much longer lifespan than a basic black turtleneck or lace trim cami that I wear with a lot of outfits.	labels:Also to increase the longevity of these pieces I almost always wear a cheaper "under layer" to catch sweat and deodorant and all the fun stuff that comes with owning a physical body. Therefore I for sure give my basics a lot of use	episode_done:True
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:When I was 16 I dressed somewhat dark academia -y. I wore alot of modcloth dresses and things that looked somewhat 40s in neutral colors, sometimes with a long cardigan and black boots. Super tailored long coats/jackets, gray clothes and dark makeup tended to make me look much older so I avoided those. Also, trust me, for a "cringey phase" dark academia is a good one to have! When I was around your age I wore fake uggs, leggings, and aeropostale graphic tees, with blue eyeliner. Lol.	episode_done:True

text:new year, old shoes — an upcycled shoe album	labels:These all kind of hurt my head in a good way, but the wedge & ripple soles are really the best IMO. Super interesting ideas and I bet we're not too far off from seeing new "upcycled-style" shoes at retailers	episode_done:True

text:When did skinny jeans go out of fashion?	labels:I'd say 2015 was when it started going out of fashion.  But fashion isn't the same as style so it's up to you if you want to stick to your style or keep chasing fashion trends. Trends is how companies get you to spend money on new things that go out of fashion in a few seasons.
text:Fashion isn't the style... hmmm can you explain that a little more?   Good points though, thanks for chiming in!	labels:Fashion is collective and style is individual preference.  Fashion is what is being offered because companies want to sell it to you. Fashion week showcases stuff 1+ year in advance so you know what to buy or start saving up for to stay fashionable.  Style is how you choose to present yourself. Wear whatever you like, find what works for your body.   A celebrity or influencer can wear their personal style (often kind of weird). When enough people starts doing the same, it becomes fashionable. For example Steve Jobs' style made sweaters and jeans acceptable and fashionable in tech companies.	episode_done:True
text:US bans all cotton from China's Xinjiang region over forced labor concerns	labels:Please let this persist through the next four years.  This is not something to be partisan about, the only way to stop China from exploiting these people is to take away the profit margin.  Edit: ITT .50 army drills.
text:Yes agreed! I hope this is applied in a non-hypocracy manner where we ban slave labor from other places too where our ideologies align like from Africa or Latin America. Heck lets fix the labour slavery in the US prison system before looking outside.	labels:>Heck lets fix the labour slavery in the US prison system before looking outside.

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:1. I really like ankle boots that skim my ankles and don't go taller. I think they go great with pants and tights/skirt/dress combo. 2. When I'm forced to wear black tights because of lack of color choice, I wear ones with a fishnet pattern- loose or tight pattern depending on how much I'm willing to let my legs be exposed to the cold that day.  3. If I'm doing a bare leg with ankle boots, I wear ankle socks with lace or scalloped edges that peek out over the boots.  4. No suggestions from me, sorry! I've never worn any 5. I wear 0-2 inch heels max with dresses ( I can't actually walk well in higher heels). It works for me, I'm comfortable most of the day and think i still look fairly put together all the time.	episode_done:True

text:Sith-Wave/Jedi-Core: A Star Wars Inspo Album	labels:Star Trek lost the popularity run with Star Wars because star wars was far more fashionable and aesthetic.   Don't try and change my mind.
text:What a vapid take	labels:No?   Aesthetics are important, and Star Wars has some of the most iconic space ships, characters, environments etc.  Everyone knows what the Death Star is and people see the flying triangles as Star Wars ships. Only the shape of the Enterprise is iconic.   That is my take.
text:I dunno. Although the Klingon Bird of Prey and Borg Cube don't have the same mainstream exposure as the Enterprise, they'll forever be iconic in my eyes.	labels:In the eyes of a fan of sci-fi, yes, but in the eyes your average not so into sci-fi person, they ain't got no clue what either are.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 02	labels:i feel like my interest in fashion has been cyclical throughout my life, where i'll care about clothes for months, if not years, and then have to drop it for a while  anyway life is pretty tough atm so i think i'm dropping fashion / reddit for a bit. see you guys on the other side!

text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process? What would you prioritize?	labels:I'd spend it all on really luxurious basics. A cashmere sweater, the softest plain black t-shirts known to mankind, a couple of jewel tone A-line coats like the ones Kate Middleton wears, and tailoring for some pieces already in my closet.   The money wouldn't go very far, but it would acquire me the items I want to buy but can't justify right now.   Edit: Totally misread the prompt. I thought I was adding to my current wardrobe. If I had to start over, I'd rebuy a lot of what I already have (cute dresses from Amazon, workwear from Banana Republic, $60 jeans). And then I'd buy one of those Kate Middleton coats in black so it'd go with everything.	episode_done:True
text:2020 in Hindsight: A Year in Fashion — Die, Workwear!	labels:I'll tell you this: moving forward, my comfort is first and foremost. Sure, suits will never go away but there had better be some seriously comfortable offerings from now own.
text:> suits will never go away but there had better be some seriously comfortable offerings from now own.  I feel like there always has been? A suit that fits you well can be very comfortable. Think of a gray flannel suit in Winter, or a cotton-linen suit in Summer. As far as styling goes, casualness has been on the rise for a bit (even when it comes to tailoring, see the excess of unstructured Italian-inspired options nowadays) and there's many writers who think that the pandemic is only accelerating that trend. Even industries like banking and finance no longer require full suits for work attire.  I'm actually struggling now to think of somewhere I would go in my life that would absolutely require a suit, and all I'm coming up with is most funerals and some weddings. In my personal observation athleisure is rapidly becoming the default for most people in my world.  You do you!	labels:> Think of a gray flannel suit in Winter  It should feel like wearing fucking pajamas. If it isn't comfortable you might just need to size up.	episode_done:True
text:What are you planning on getting rid of this year?	labels:most of the stuff i'm wearing nowadays is literally stuff i've kept for 20 years.  it's wild that the current trend is 1997-high-schooler, but here we are. (AKA YALL PROBABLY SHOULDNT BE GETTING RID OF STUFF)	episode_done:True

What comes to mind first are cardigans, solid-color sweaters, quarter-zips. Anything else that comes to mind?

My current (as in every winter since at least 2014) footwear rotation is seven pairs of workboots.  Four tan, the kind EVERYONE had back in the day.  One pale blue Cats.  One mauve Wrangler.  One cherry Docs, the soft leather kind.  As a Little Old Lady, I don't do "shoes" as in heels/ballet flats/loafers.  I live in the boots/Converse/sports sandals, as per season.  Have for years.  Guess I should add I don't do "outfits" either, just graphic tees/flannels/denim shirts/jeans/cargoes/cords/hoodies.  Shorts/inbetweens when warm enough in the summer.	episode_done:True

text:Yes to all this.  I stole some floor length 1980's cotton nighties from my (81 year old) mother the other day, and have been wearing them even on zoom calls with coworkers.

I'm currently watching the Real Housewives of Orange County and the style is basically extremely low rise flare jeans, layered camis, empire waist flowy blouses with giant cross necklaces, and halter tops. It's giving me traumatic flashbacks of middle school. I do have to say I kind of like the blonde hair on the outside black on the inside style.

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:Yes, for sewing. I have no idea about knitting. I'm not sure why people are saying not for knits - I use a serger and a coverstitch machine to get a professional finish.   As someone else said, wearing clothing custom made to your measurements feels amazing.   I also like that I know exactly the conditions in which my clothes were made, since I'm the person who made them.   One thing I struggle with is finding top quality fabric, especially knits. I think it's due to 1) price exceeds my budget 2) I'm ordering online and don't have access to a fabric district 3) maybe nice knits just aren't available to home sewists? I'm not sure, I'm still looking. I think I finally found a source for rayon/spandex tee shirt fabric.
text:I get lucky with knits at thrift stores sometimes. I never find what I want shopping at fabric stores like Joann. It's expensive and never exactly what I want. With thrift store fabric, I can experiment without the pressure of having spent a lot of money.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Barbour does alterations.  Either go to an orvis or a barbour store and they can help you send it in to them.  There's a lot they can do.  I went to Orvis (even though I didn't buy my jackets from them) and had minimal things done to one Barbour and then quite a bit of alterations done to another.

Comment here and let someone style it for you!	labels:I really like waistcoats, and have a few of them that I've either never worn or only worn a couple of times.   Besides formal situations, would it look odd to wear them more casually? Is regular shirt+chinos alright?  Would wearing one over a t-shirt be a step too far and a definite no? I don't mind a more quirky look, but wasn't sure if that combination would look bad.   One's a brown pinstripe fabric (and too small to do up so I couldn't really get away with wearing it anywhere formal anyway), the other is tweed.

I literally tried on everyone in my closet and threw away anything that didn't look fabulous.  So, you said you've got broad shoulders and a large bust...that makes me think you'd look gorgeous in anything that shows off those shoulders.   Something that accents your waist and defines it from your busy and hips is also an essential. Show off those curves!

I have several poplin ones for summer - they often have wider uncuffed sleeves (again, for comfort) so you can go for a sort of noragi look.  (finding a very light fabric chore jacket turned out to be a pain, or they were too expensive. So instead I wear a rotation of thrifted poplin pyjama tops. They look a bit different, but work fine.)  Recently I also got one in flannel, lovely to wear around the house this winter.  They're like oversized overshirts, but also have pockets. I want pockets.

text:Stockings vs Tights vs Leggings	labels:I HATE stockings.  I have this theory that they were invented by men as a torture device for women.  They're the most uncomfortable garmet I've ever worn.  Tights are not that far behind (my waist and thighs are two different sizes, so I haven't found any tights that fit in both areas).  So I swear cotton leggings (the $5 F21 ones) with boots under dresses.
text:How are stockings and tights different than leggings? Inquiring minds want to know...  I mean aren't they essentially the same shape garment with amorphous stretchy points?    I am totally different body shape, apple with no waist, a belly, boylike hips and thighs.. my disdain for all stockings, tights and leggings have more to do with what goes on above crotch point than below it. They all seem to have same issue to me? So please explain as I'm seriously curious.	labels:I think it has to do wtih the materials used and the sizing.  Most of the tights/stockings I've seen have either had sizing S/M or L/XL where leggings run S, M, L, XL.  Maybe if they had made more sizes of stockings instead of combining sizes and making them ill fitting.  The other thing is that the material in tights/stockings is typically a lot more fragile than a pair of cotton leggings.  I don't have to worry about a hangnail ruining a pair of leggings or taking extra care when washing leggings.    Lastly I (personally) don't like garmets with a lot of stretch in them (and this includes a lot of workout leggings on the market).  Tights and stockings are typically in that category.	episode_done:True

text:How Japan's Best Men’s Magazines Gained a Cult Following in the US	labels:Having traveled to Japan, I can second the exceptional quality of magazines there.  Or rather, magazines are no different in Japan than other things: some of them are just pure perfection due to the dedication and effort of their creators.  It is well known here in the sub that the same applies for Japanese denim and even for fast fashion like Uniqlo, among many other things. When they do something, the Japanese really do it right.	episode_done:True
text:Sewing your own clothes	labels:Having basic sewing skills to repair or slightly modify existing clothes is a fundamental skill most people should have and is absolutely worth the time. Novice tailoring is a great skill to have too and can save you some money. Beyond that, sewing clothes from scratch is more of a hobby than a necessity for most people, due to the widely available nature of inexpensive and functional clothing. So like most hobbies, whether or not it is "worth the time" (and cost! Sewing is expensive and it's frequently cheaper to just buy an item unless you're looking for a custom fit or something super unique) is more dependent on your enjoyment of the activity than it is on more "functional" motivators like cost-savings.
text:Yes, I think it is a hobby now. I love fashion I have been interested in cothes since I was a kid. For now, I don't have the skills, but it is like mindfulness. Maybe one day I get there :) Thanks a lot!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 09, 2021	labels:What do you guys consider fashionable workout shirts?     One of the mental tricks I'm trying play on myself is picking workout clothing that I actually feel *somewhat* attractive in.  I know that shirts with logos plastered over them are usually considered unfashionable, but lately I have been looking at Nike's Dri Fit shirts as possible performance workout wear. However, I hate the swoosh on the front. I can't tell if it's just my overly negative self-image thoughts, or if I'm overthinking it. What do you guys wear?
text:Old t-shirt with the sleeves cut off, and sweatpants. Can't go wrong with the classics!  You should wear whatever makes you feel good, both physically and aesthetically.

text:If you don't want to invest in a ring light, you can also position your laptop in front of your TV and open Youtube... search for "white screen 10 hours" and up your brightness.

text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:For me I got rid of some old work clothes recently as I work remote last as I realized even if I go back to work in person my style has changed. I have also greatly reduced my wardrobe to about 1/3-1/4 of what it was about a year or so ago.  I went about it by identifying clothes I hadn't worn in a while and stuck them in a drawer(s) I wasn't using/cleared out for this purpose. After a while I forget it's there unless there was something I want to wear at which time I grabbed what I wanted and kept it. Leave it in there as long as you deem necessary, for me it was about 3 months. Then I donated or threw away.  At first this was easy, and then it got a little harder, but at this point I had closet space and so I washed everything and put everything on a top rack. After I wore it it was hung back up on the bottom rack. After a while I removed what I hadn't worn up top and hid them in the drawer again.   I did this process several times over a year or so until I felt like I had successfully minimized my wardrobe, which I feel I have.	episode_done:True

That's how I view it.	episode_done:True

text:These would look super clean in a fashion-y/techwear fit in my opinion. It's curious to me that you couldn't find a single redeeming factor, considering the amount of craftsmanship that went into these shoes. Based on your other comments, it sounds like you just don't like chunky sneakers, which is fair, but doesn't mean they have 0 aesthetic value. I will agree with your other comment though, MMM Fusions are awful lol.	labels:I'm all about sleek lines and tapered shapes, footwear especially for me needs to be a continuation of the legwear. I am very anti-chunky shoe.  I find the craftsmanship wonderful but that's not an aesthetic observation.
text:Key phrase, "I'm all about." Your opinion isn't the end all to style. There is no rule in fashion that footwear "has" to be an extension of the pant silhouette. A lot of brands have made their name on messing with proportions and silhouettes, and have very loyal followers/customers. Fashion is an extremely subjective thing, and to pigeonhole something as general as shoes into such a rigid line of thinking is really limiting.  You don't have to like something, that's totally fine, but you're talking about this stuff like it's super black and white when it's not. Thinking outside the box on what I liked about clothes gave me a greater appreciation on other people's style, and made me a lot less judgmental. You're telling me that there isn't a single outfit that you have seen with chunkier sneakers that you've liked or at least said, it's not for me, but it's cool?	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Runways have been sending out 2000s vibes. Anyone onboard?	labels:I hate it. I feel like these looks are the epitome of, "Is that even a cool outfit, or is she just really skinny?"   The 2000s were such an era of idolizing the Paris Hilton body as the only acceptable physique. Remember how Nicole Richie was "the fat friend"? I'm so over it. I've been over it since I was 12 in 2004 and realized I would never, ever, look like that no matter how little I ate. I feel like we have moved forward as far as body positivity and inclusivity since then, and these stupid throwback trends are dragging us back.

text:Is it disgusting to not wear socks with shoes?	labels:Only if you don't wash your feet.  Some shoe styles look a bit strange with socks, because they're not conventionally worn with them. Yknow, like many styles of womens' shoes, so I find it strange a woman would say this tbh.

text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I forgot to add this to my original comment but I saw something on LinkedIn that is food for thought. I can't find the post but it's basically along the lines of "male dominated" implies that men have more control and influence over the industry (probably true), but switching to the phrase male clustered (meaning many of the same) changes the language and inherent thoughts associated with men being better to men being equal.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:Some of mine in no particular order; I don't think about it all the time but my dressing habits are based around this:   * No more than 3 colours (I don't wear much black and have a lot of different neutrals, so I have to be aware of this). * Try to have something more interesting than just a crew neck sweater + pants. I am so guilty of falling into this when I get lazy.  * Don't wear the same colour pants and coat. People can probably pull this off no problem but it is something I avoid for some reason.  * Like someone else said, for tops and bottoms no tight/tight or loose/loose. I just don't feel comfortable that way. I feel better when I emphasize either my waist or my hips.  * Only wear 1 uncomfortable item at a time. Ideally you would have no uncomfortable items but unfortunately I have a few pieces that I am not willing to get rid of. If I wear them all at once it's like I am crawling in my own skin, so I try to be aware of this when I dress to leave the house.	episode_done:True

text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:1. Don't think of compliments as criticism. There are a few bad bananas out there who will actually try to bring you down, but for the most part, people ask "Why are you dressed like that?" simply to make conversation (and it's really a compliment -- you look nice!).   2. Treat yourself like a friend. If a friend told you she wanted to change up her style but was nervous about getting comments, would you encourage her or tell her she's being weird? You'd encourage her! So stop discouraging yourself.	episode_done:True

text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:I agree with everyone, I think you shouldn't worry about looking older.  There is no way to mistake a teenager for an older woman in, say her mid-twenties. But if you still feel self-conscious, you can try toned down hairbands and barrettes, skater skirt in black or burgundy, oversized acrylic frame glasses, doc martens, and combat shoes. Also plaid skirts or shorts!	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:Thrifting can be hard cuz the selection can vary depending on where you live. Websites like Poshmark have thrifting easier, but there are still downsides like not being able to feel the clothes, no returning (unless the item was faulty), sellers sometimes not being responsive, etc.  I think you can still be somewhat sustainable even when you shop fast fashion. You can check materials to avoid polyester. When they wear out, you can wear them as pajamas or send them to recycling programs or to animal shelters (some h&m stores accept old clothes for recycling although covid may have affected that; Universal Standard and For Days allow you to ship them old clothes, etc). You can also cut them up and use them as rags to clean the house.   Other fashion related choices you can make are switching your laundry detergent (Dropps makes laundry pods that come in cardboard boxes), using products that capture microplastics, and air drying your clothes (less electricity used! Also better for preserving your clothes' quality)	episode_done:True
text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:I feel like in 2021 the trends move SO FAST you could wear anything and it would be in style. I like to read whowhatwear and in the same article stylists will contradict each other on what's in or out. Also there is probably a popular subniche where the item is trendy.  So if there's something I love but feel or looks a little off, I just save it in storage. In a year or so, my feelings on it could be renewed and it could be the next big thing.
text:Believe it or not it's actually less fast as it was a decade ago. Trends hang around FOREVER especially with Instagram, bloggers, etc. -- ripped jeans have literally been in style for over 12 years. 12!!! Same with moto jackets. It used to not be this way, where every year you were updating stuff to keep current. Now, it's like you can wear ripped jeans and a moto jacket and everyone thinks it's chic and cool. Because retailers want to sell, they don't experiment as much because the mainstream fashion consumer like most on IG, etc. are not as willing to move to trends as quickly as people were in the past. No complaints, but I find trends take forever to move now than compared to before.	labels:I was wondering this with jumpsuits and rompers, I feel like when I was just graduating college in 2006, rompers were just coming in but it wouldn't have been OK to wear them anytime in the last 10 to 15 years. Short rompers and long leg jumpsuits have kind of come in and out a few times since 2006, right now it's much more jumpsuits in my area, but they've kind of been in since 2006, moreso than less so?
text:I hope jumpsuits never go out of style, not because I care if they're in, but because jumpsuits being in makes it easier for me to keep buying more jumpsuits.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:A huge chunk of my wardrobe is built out from Amazon. I add everything to a list, and wait until Amazon's algorithms decide they need to sell it for $6. They also offer Tall sizes on quite a lot of items, which is great for having sleeves that fit.  Uniqlo for jeans, Amazon's Peak Velocity brand for Tshirts, and Goodthreads for everything else is what I would do if I had to start from Scratch.  If there's a certain type of item your looking for, feel free to ask for recommendations and I can send you a link to what I'd look at.
text:Thanks for sharing!   Items I'm looking for:  \- White sneakers - preferably leather   \- Jeans - Slim/skinny light blue, navy, black   \- Jackets - from bomber jackets to other non-bomber kinds  \- Sweaters or sweatshirts I can layer under my jacket  \- Long sleeve shirts/henleys  \- boots   If you've come across any of these on amazon that you think may be decent purchase I'd love to check it out	labels:Amazon has pretty decent t-shirts and sweatshirts (not knit sweaters!) that you can get for a good price. You can also buy some decent quality sneakers from Amazon too, just make sure it's from a reputable seller and from a recognized shoe brand (Adidas/New Balance/etc.).  &#x200B;  However, for stuff like jeans, jackets, boots, and knitwear, I'd look elsewhere. I've bought jeans from Amazon in the past that came with low-quality buttons and ripped after 2 months of wear, so I don't think the quality is quite there. My recommendation would be to search on places like Uniqlo/Carhartt/Champion or even thrift stores to get better quality jeans/jackets/knitwear that can last you a lot longer than whatever you'd find on Amazon for a comparable price.

text:No Cop January - End of the Month Check In	labels:I admit I failed, but I held out for longer than I thought I could and I only purchased used/secondhand/thrift. Overall it did make me really consider what I was buying, and did I really need it *right now.*  One of the things I noticed a lot more about myself and my purchasing habits: I would find something cool on Ebay and I'd be struck with this sense of urgency, like "If I don't buy it right this second then someone else will get it and it'll be too late." I fought that urgency tooth and nail this past month, and forced myself to slow down and reel it back. The vast vast majority of those items I was looking at are still there for sale, they didn't go anywhere but my perception of them shifted. And now I can really look at them and realize I don't really need this, I just got swept up in the hype of finding something new.
text:Sounds like it was still helpful though.  I remember having that same sense of urgency, and I feel like I had to overcome that mindset before I stopped accumulating stuff that I either didn't need or that I wasn't excited about wearing and just bought because it was a good deal.	labels:It was still helpful, yes. And you're exactly right. The question I should be asking myself is, "Do I want this because it's a good deal, or would I still buy this if it were full price?" Very illuminating.	episode_done:True
text:Inspo Album: Pulling the Past Forward, Asian-style	labels:I came here from the other Asian designers thread you just posted! I hadn't seen this post but THANK YOU for this.  I'm an East Asian immigrant who came to North America about a decade ago. One of the first few things I did was to promptly lose my native accent and do everything I could I assimilate asap. That meant everything from making caucasian friends to dressing on a certain way. I hid my culture and never really enjoyed telling people where I was "really" from.  Fast forward to now and I finally feel secure enough to wear whatever and speak however I like. I *LOVE* having Asian motifs on my clothes - my closet is full of crane and koi fish details. I'm also lucky enough to be working in a sector that fully embraces diversity on a deep level. Can't wait to try some of these brands out!

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:The name fast fashion doesn't stem from the amount of use the consumer gets out of the product, but the fact that all fast fashion brands take all clothes at the end of the season or "trend" and burn them. Fast fashion is the second biggest contributor to the declining environment. In supporting them you're essentially contributing to these horrible actions. Personally, as a student with 2 jobs, I think the best way to be eco-friendly is to shop second hand.	episode_done:True

text:Whats with all the "stretchy mens pants" startups I am seeing all of a sudden?	labels:Serious question for anyone who has these: are they different from something like golf pants?
text:Very similar, the strike about golf pants is in case you want something on the subtler side without a Nike swoosh, adidas stripes, or Under Armour logo, etc.   These new brands seem to lean into the nondescript muji, outlier, Uniqlo styling.   Conceptually the same .. the fits might also be more tailored and flattering, whereas golf pants are a little more generous in form fit.	labels:	episode_done:True

Mostly everything is black, gray, white, light blue, navy, with some camel and tomato red.  Only dresses really deviate here.

text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:I buy a lot of my jewelry from amazon, actually. I've also dabbled in etsy jewelry a little bit (under $30 range). I know everyone has a different idea of "quality," but I've been extremely impressed with the quality I've received from both amazon and etsy. It is definitely a step up from the jewelry you could get at Target or even Madewell.  I look for gold-plated or gold vermeill (also gold plated but it is plated over silver instead of other metals) since my budget is pretty tight. I started by buying a few different sized gold hoops, plain gold layering chains , and a few rings. I occasionally wear silver but I already had quite a bit accumulated over the years and find myself reaching for gold more often these days. I hope to be able to invest in fine jewelry someday, but what I can find on amazon or etsy in my current price range checks all the boxes for me.

text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I'm tall so as a teenager I avoided anything that would draw attention to me or make me look bigger or masculine... even the clothes I loved. I'm fit but there's nothing worse than hearing people comment on your height or body, and it happens all the time. One man once yelled out, "Giant woman!" on a night out. Does wonders for my self-esteem. I'm only 6'0.  Fuck em. Now, I wear heels (whenever appropriate), long or oversized coats that swallow my shape a bit, form-fitting dresses, baggy athleisure, and platform sneakers. People are going to look anyway, so I might as well look cute and accentuate my legs... even if I'm 2 inches taller or something.  I've seen Hailey Bieber and Kendall et al. rock some KILLER looks - including heels, oversized coats, menswear, tight hair, blazers etc. And they emanate strong femininity. Whenever I need a boost, I look up models street fashion and REMEMBER MY POWER.

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:Honestly, I don't.  The 2013 factory explosion taught me that it wasn't just the Forever 21s of the world, but higher-end brands were made in the same conditions.  And ethical fashion is generally not anything that I would wear.  The styles tend to be very boxy and earth tones, neither of which flatter me.  I'm not going to go out of my way to wear expensive ugly clothes.
text:There's a lot more selection than you think! Though it is hard to track down, but there is more to fair trade clothing than just the Reformation minimalist look. A good example is Lucy and Yak, very bright clothes, and a reasonable price (or at least, what used to be considered a reasonable price before fast fashion redefined that). Pact has a lot of basics for good prices, kinda meh on the fabrics but they're kind of like old navy quality. There's a lot of sites now, the issue is just finding em all cause I mean they're usually smaller businesses obv.  Spending more definitely does not mean ethical though, that's a point that so many people miss. Basically, unless a clothing brand explicitly advertises their labour practices... It's probably made for pennies. Because really, that's such a good advertisement, why wouldn't they broadcast that? (But even then it's still not necessarily ethical, but at least it's more likely to be.)	labels:And even broadcasting fair labor practices doesn't mean the dye was ethically sourced. Many colors only come in specific ways which are highly toxic. Hence the stereotype of ethical clothing being well, not appealing in colors.	episode_done:True

text:As a person who lives in a super hot climate, I say tent dresses can serve a function	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Which higher end brands do you find to be "worth it" and for what?	labels:I tend to prioritise natural materials (because a. I am sweaty and b. I work in geriatrics, which is warm). I tend towards lots of Paul Smith and Chloe for those reasons (though don't get me wrong there's lots of polyester there too but in general both are well made regardless of fabric). Some kooples is great and some is terrible. Most rag and bone is worth it. I'm English so all my shoes are Clarks, which are always worth it. DVF is good bang for buck though fairly boring workwear. Jaeger make great coats, not really high end but the materials punch way above their weight.

text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:A huge chunk of my wardrobe is built out from Amazon. I add everything to a list, and wait until Amazon's algorithms decide they need to sell it for $6. They also offer Tall sizes on quite a lot of items, which is great for having sleeves that fit.  Uniqlo for jeans, Amazon's Peak Velocity brand for Tshirts, and Goodthreads for everything else is what I would do if I had to start from Scratch.  If there's a certain type of item your looking for, feel free to ask for recommendations and I can send you a link to what I'd look at.
text:Thanks for sharing!   Items I'm looking for:  \- White sneakers - preferably leather   \- Jeans - Slim/skinny light blue, navy, black   \- Jackets - from bomber jackets to other non-bomber kinds  \- Sweaters or sweatshirts I can layer under my jacket  \- Long sleeve shirts/henleys  \- boots   If you've come across any of these on amazon that you think may be decent purchase I'd love to check it out	labels:Amazon has pretty decent t-shirts and sweatshirts (not knit sweaters!) that you can get for a good price. You can also buy some decent quality sneakers from Amazon too, just make sure it's from a reputable seller and from a recognized shoe brand (Adidas/New Balance/etc.).  &#x200B;  However, for stuff like jeans, jackets, boots, and knitwear, I'd look elsewhere. I've bought jeans from Amazon in the past that came with low-quality buttons and ripped after 2 months of wear, so I don't think the quality is quite there. My recommendation would be to search on places like Uniqlo/Carhartt/Champion or even thrift stores to get better quality jeans/jackets/knitwear that can last you a lot longer than whatever you'd find on Amazon for a comparable price.
text:Yeah - I wouldn't skimp on denim and footwear. A nice pair of boots that will last years and grow patina, same with denim fades. You can skimp a bit on the rest -    for example today I'm wearing: $300 Samurai Jeans, $x00 boots, $x00 vintage watch - but paired with an $8 Hanes cotton/poly sweatshirt from amazon and $5 generic khaki hat from walmart.	labels:Just seconding what others have said about denim, while I love good denim and definitely see the value of a $300 pair, it's definitely possible to skimp on denim and still have it last for years. Of course it won't look as nice as a more expensive pair, but if your goal is just to look presentable then cheaper denim can do the trick imo!	episode_done:True
text:advice on how to stop buying clothes I don't need?	labels:Try planning your wardrobe in advance.   Have a board, know what you're missing (e.g., a black top that would make five pairs of pants wearable).   Make a list, and then buy only what's on the list.   Trendy clothes are a total waste. (Would you be caught dead in a cold shoulder outfit now?  But those sweaters are probably only two years old---headed for the landfill but have hardly been worn.)

text:Do you have brand recommendations for the fitted sweaters? I also do not enjoy the boxy look that is popular these days.	labels:No I don't.  I am having a hard finding them myself.

text:I say don't worry about your scars. I have scars on my ankle from surgeries due to a broken ankle, and if I hid them I'd be wearing mid calf socks all year long. I know midriff scars are on a more noticeable part of your body, but I think you should work on being less self consious of them so you can wear the styles you want. If the scars bother someone, its on them not on you!	labels:I don't know if I'm self conscious or I just don't want anyone pointing at it and asking and having to tell the whole story! I wrestle with the idea of showing them or not
text:Say you fought a shark, just totally deadpan.  Other options are did surgery on Edward scissorhands, bear dentistry, crocodile ear piercings.. etc	labels:Lmao yes I dream of telling a different fisherman's tail every time!

text:For pants/jackets, I usually go with casual chinos/denim jacket or with dark jeans, both combos feel (to me) to be very classic Americana.

text:My favorite makeup piece is a bright lipstick. I have this deep, plum-purple that I love wearing in fall but masks just make it so much worse because then I get lipstick all over my mask and it feels gross to me. Someday... :)	labels:Lipstick is also my favorite. Bright reds, pinks, shades of purple, browns. I almost don't feel pretty without it, but I also think what's the point now?

text:Best and Worst Purchase of 2020	labels:Best: Sewing machine. I thought the price tag was crazy but it kept me company, I learned a ton, and it easily paid for itself with mask sales.  Also, earbuds. First I got the Airpods which came free with something. Otherwise I never would have bought them for myself. Then I switched to android and got the Galaxy Live. It's more than just having handy headphones, it's the fact that you just take them out of the case and they're instantly on, and you can answer calls with a tap. Of course, I lose them 5 times a week. They are currently missing in my house somewhere. I just ordered Tile finders :(  Worst: The hours I spent picking out a 2020 planner. Stuart Weitzman thigh high boots. Where the F did I wear these boots? The mall once in February.	episode_done:True
text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:I'm hoping those "Is it Wine o'clock?" shirts (or anything involving  women drinking wine to deal with life) you find at any mall store/Target directed towards adults.   Perhaps it's because I can no longer pass as a youth and will no doubt get thrown into the demographic these companies sell to, but it's always painful when you start to see a trend in clothes and you hate it, and it lasts YEARS.
text:I'd love for those to go out of style, but I think they might double down with quarantine+wine shirts.  On a related note, i hate the workout tanks with slogans like "Namastay in bed" or "Coffee Please!" or anything else in that genre.	labels:honestly any clothing with silly catchphrases or puns on them is horrific

(stretch or elastic waist or joggers with a drawstring)    Wear some fun eyeshadow and mascara and a cute mask. Your personal style isn't limited to the neck down.

My husband usually wears linen shorts but would need to get some new, longer pants for a potential new job.

Just trying to find a a good non-jean that is bootcut-ish.  A quick Google of "Dockers bootcut khaki" and "bootcut khaki" returned essentially 0 results, and the only thing I found was from Old Navy and it didn't look bootcut to me. Just wondering because I'd love to find a good bootcut khaki or chinonor whatever.
text:Personally I would try a straight leg from a brand that's known to have looser fits, like L.L. Bean. For true "boot cut" (flared) pants, though, your best bet might be companies that specialize in Western wear.	labels:Thank you!	episode_done:True

text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:Sometime in my 20s I tried and gave up at maintaining this crap.

text:What are your tips for being stylish when your weight fluctuates like crazy?	labels: I have this same exact problem (and also not sure how to deal with it, especially when it isn't winter)!  Styling does not come to me naturally, but I typically make swing dresses a wardrobe staple (they tend to fit through a range of sizes). I wear them with leggings and maybe a bomber jacket or something. I want to play with the baggy or lagenlook style, and see if that works.

text:Assuming that Bals look better open/unbuttoned ?	labels:Six to one, half a dozen the other. They work styled either way, but there's always something appealing about an open coat. I don't like version's that have belts though, they often cinch and reck the silhouette.	episode_done:True
text:Dress Sneakers Are Alarmingly Popular	labels:I also think it's on the rather unfortunate looking side... counterpoint: I know a surprising amount of people who have to wear dress shoes for professional reasons... but comfortable sneakers for health/pain reasons... this caters to them and after several have told me in how much pain they are I don't give a hoot anymore. Let Cole Haan/whoever do their thing.  Edit: this is not counting people I know who may have very different requirements throughout a workday/ work trip and may not want to pack/ bring several shoes and are in a constant haste.
text:I do think people forget that not every fashion choice is for the purpose of fashion	labels:Athleisure. I can't believe people think dressing in comfortable sportswear is something most people do for the *look* of it.
text:All along, I thought it was. Is it for comfort?	labels:Yes. Athleisure is basically the push to make wearing what hung over college students wear on their futon all day Sunday socially acceptable for adults to wear in public on a Monday afternoon.
text:To be fair, that's just a continuation of all fashion trends for the last century. Even the suits we think are so fancy today were the way to be more comfortable than dudes in morning dress.	labels:	episode_done:True

I've found some size twelve ladies who dress neat and tidy and ready for law practice, and I follow some size 12 ladies who wear streetwear, but nobody wears anything of actual interest in that size between either spectrum. Anybody I do see not in those two categories seem to be more in a "Macy's catalogue, 2013" aesthetic.  I need someone with stomach pudge and jiggly thighs to show me what cool structural and interesting pieces I can pull off without me spending 10 days and 10k dollars at the store to find it.

text:General Discussion - October 22	labels:So I live with my boyfriend and his two siblings. My boyfriend, his brother and I share a closet. I try to keep my part clean but they have so many excess clothes it just flows over into my stuff and I told him today that he should work on organizing it because he couldn't find the tank top he wanted for the gym. And he was like yeah I know, I've been meaning to do it, but he hasn't yet. And it's like I wanna help him but I also don't want to pressure him cause I know everyone has some attachment to their clothes. But anyway, that's just my little rant.
text:Do you have any extra space in the apt? I've made a clothes rack out of pipes for ~$100 that fits my living room's aesthetic, and ends up being a nice combination of decor and function.	labels:I mean kinda? His brother technically shares the room with us but sleeps in the living room. I think if we were to go through his clothes him keeping them in the living room might work but I think there's too many to move out there now. Also, it's like we don't want to force him to live in the living room if he wants to share the bedroom.
text:Mayyyybe you could convince both BF and the brother to move all outerwear / jackets to a living room clothing rack, which might open up space in the closet area? Wouldn't save much space for non-hanger items, though.  Decent compromise that frees up space, leaves the jackets in an accessible and common sense area, and might not be that hard to convince them of?  Just spitballing ideas, obviously there's a lot I'm prob not aware of :)	labels:That's actually not a bad idea.

text:Stop Dressing For Your Height [Tim Dessaint]	labels:I've never understood the fascination with absolute height as something that would qualify or disqualify someone from wearing a particular style or trying something. E.g. "Don't cuff your pants if you're short."  Like long coats aren't any different whether you're 5' or taller than Lebron James. What *is* different are your relative proportions and that *can* affect whether certain things look good on you or not.   Things like arm or leg length vs torso height but that's a ratio and has nothing to do with your absolute height.  Maybe I've spent too much time on the internet where everyone is the same height in pictures but I've *never* seen a good example where someone was too short or too tall for a styling.

text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:It depends on the outfit and the shoes I want to wear. I try to make sure my shoes match a color in my outfit. So if there's a black element, I wear black shoes. If that's not possible, I try to match my purse or accessories like a scarf. It's not always possible but I try.	episode_done:True

It did take a bit of trawling to find them, but it was very worth the price. Like new merino sweaters for 15 dollars which is unheard of. I like the hunt.	episode_done:True

While there are still plenty available on the internet, there aren't many available in my size or in any colors I want. I really like this cut as I prefer this to the 511 because they break nicely over a chunkier shoe and are more snug on the thigh than the 514. Has anyone found a substitute for the 513 out there by other companies. It seems a lot of the Slim Straights on the market are straight in the thigh and slim at the leg opening, which is the inverse of what I'm looking for. Any help is appreciated.

It was the stars above nightgown which is rayon/polyester/spandex... very smooth.   Can anyone recommend something that would be very comforting and not irritating to skin? A blanket or sweater, etc?

text:Help needed for buying jeans online! All advice is welcome!	labels:I finally bought a pair of 501s from the Levi's site.  After hours of scouring size charts and online fit testimonials, I *still* wasn't sure about size/inseam. So, on a day with a good sale, I actually bought SIX PAIRS and returned five of them. I regret nothing! If you have the disposable income to pay up front and wait for the refund to be processed, I highly suggest getting all your options so you aren't left wondering if you really have the right size or ordering another pair to try on.    Edit: as /u/fartymcfly22 pointed out, you might want to check that the company doesn't just throw away their returns before ordering duplicates like this!

I say 95% because the screen accurate whip and boots are unbelievably expensive, although I do at least have a whip that is the proper length and plait count.

text:Elk IV Parka from Wuxly Movement	labels:I gotta say tho, 600 for synthetic is really steep.   You could have gotten a really nice down for that, or a much cheaper equally good synthetic.
text:This is unhelpfully reductive and doesn't really address the issue in a way that makes sense. Down vs. synthetic is a tradeoff based on use cases, not a simple matter of one being better for everything.	labels:If one wants to make an ethical argument, thats up to them.  But down in a parka that has a waterproof shell is never going to lose against synthetic. Especially down which has been treated to not absorb humidity.   In sleeping bags, or for technical layers, there are more tradeoffs. But the OP already put themselves into the bucket of style/weight where Down is going to win across the board.   Synthetic can win on price (and get close to matching other considerations). But not $600 synthetic.	episode_done:True

text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:I was in this same position a few years ago! I highly recommend creating a budget and setting aside a certain amount of money each month for fashion/clothing/shopping etc. This prevents you from feeling guilty or restricted from shopping.   Also, I would recommend creating a wishlist of pieces you want to buy and planning out when you want to buy them. For example, in the beginning of the year, I knew I wanted a good pair of boots this year. So I wrote down in my wishlist on my phone that I would buy them in September/October. I think this helps to be more mindful when shopping as items will be on your list for a while so you have to think about and research them and how they will fit into your wardrobe before you actually buy them!	episode_done:True
text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:I think looking "dated" is when you are wearing something that you wore 10 years ago trying to be trendy.  However, I definitely think there are ways to wear items or general styles that are not the most currently in thing, without looking dated.  The first example that comes to mind is Rachel Zoe, she's been wearing flare pants all through the skinny jeans trend.  I'm not even sure she has ankles.  But she does in a modern does 70s, not a costume or 1990s version of the flare trend.     I'm about to be 32, and I'm accepting letting go of skinny jeans but one thing I'm not budging on currently is rise.  I have a larger waist/hip ratio and a long torso so low-rise and even mid-rise is a no for me.  I'll try all the bottom or pant silhouettes, but I want my pants in my waist where its most flattering on me.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 07, 2020	labels:Are penny loafers suitable for someone who is in their late 20s/early 30s? It is suitable for my dress code at work, smart casual, but I am not sure whether it suits me.  My impression of penny loafers is that it is for the more mature and refined group, perhaps early 40s and above.
text:Penny loafers are a classic Ivy shoe; they were worn by a ton of students at colleges in the mid-20th century. they were considered  a youthful shoe then, and by now fewer younger people wear them. They're very cool if you want to explore the look though, or if you wear mainly basic stuff and want to maybe expand your aesthetic. I wouldn't worry about connotations of "maturity", as they're not a formal shoe- if you're interested in them, go for it!

No shipping codes available, no threshold I can cross to get free shipping. $20 period, no exceptions.  It's a $300 pair of sneakers discounted to $180, I guess should be able to rationalize that at $200 (including shipping), I'm still getting a better deal than what's available anywhere else online (only a few select retailers got this colorway, and all but one are sold out in my size), but still, $20 shipping feels *wrong*. My brain has been trained from years of online shopping that there should always be some way to get around paying for shipping, or otherwise, shipping should be cheap.

I just got a Taylor stitch shirt in XS as that's what they're size guide recommended me. However, as is the case with most shirts I try, it's a bit tight in the back (I have a 38in chest). This only applies if I'm crossing my arms, giving a hug, or tying my shoes or something (basically moving both arms forward). The shirt fits everywhere else and is otherwise fine. I know that it I size up though, the shirt length will be a little too long and the sleeve length will be too long, despite fitting more relaxed in the chest/back area.  Do I size up or retain my current size? Again, the only real problem area is that the shirt hugs my chest a little bit and I feel the fabric strain across my back if I try to cross my arms (not enough so that it feels like it will rip, but it still strains).	episode_done:True

text:Do you name your favorite outfits?	labels:I do one that is very much adjacent to the "Errands Mom" that I see from other posters. I call it the Interior Designer AKA the basic Rich White Woman outfit formula:  Perfectly tailored skinny jeans in any wash but with absolutely no distressing, an oversized sweater in the winter or stupid expensive T-shirt in the summer, and slide sandals no matter what season. Multiple gold rings, a big gold watch, and maybe some small earrings or a dainty necklace. Nails kept short and round with either maroon, black, or army green polish. If you are wearing glasses, they are the darkest black sunglasses you can find in a large frame style.   Pairs well with flawless skin and balayage highlights, a martini for lunch, and a massive Instagram following for no apparent reason because all you post is the same selfie over and over again.	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: Advice on Learning How to Hate Fashion	labels:Basically, I really started to hate fashion when I realized that I would spend hours each morning creating a unified and satisfying look, and then I'd go out onto the street, see a girl in a torn concert tee, mom jeans, and worn combat boots, and immediately wish I had dressed like her. This would happen day after day after day. Invariably I'd spend far too much time trying to satisfy my inner compulsion look perfect, and then immediately envy the first girl who looked like she had rolled out of bed and slipped into whatever happened to be sitting in a pile on the floor of her room. It was at that point that I could no longer hide from the fact that none of this made any sense, or maybe it made a sort of sense that I personally would never understand. And yet there was no escape.

text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:I've been bingeing Star Trek. Give me a jumpsuit worthy of space travel. Barring that, I'll continue wearing a boatneck 3/4 sleeve top with dark wash jeans. My hair will be in a ponytail or French twist a la Seven of Nine because hair is annoying.   I used to try to be fashionable. It hurt my wallet and my ego as I tried keeping up. So many trends just don't work on me. I found a uniform that looks put together for my needs and requires little thought.
text:I had a Trek inspired 60s retro futurist obsession once. It's actually pretty easy to do. Long sleeve skater dress, best with mock neck, black tights, plain black boots, with some random abstract minimalist metal brooch on the chest. Suddenly you're a retro Starfleet cadet. Except then I realized I hate tight fitted dresses and never wear tights. So there goes that costume fantasy.	labels:I love this idea! I just looked it up and daaaaang were their skirts short though. How am I supposed to get any work done around the ship without showing everyone my space underwear >:(

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:Unpopular opinion:  its like much of modern art.  It's not really good,  but people want to be viewed as sophisticated by appreciating it, so they coo over it like it takes some special sense of taste to truly get it.
text:Have you been to some modern arts museums? Because I thought a bit like you until I actually went there, took time to explore it and use the guides and resources they provided.  For example the MUSAC in Leon (Spain). There is some really weird stuff (like a circle made of red panties) in their exposition for female artists. But in the same exposition is also a series of fotographs of a young soldier throughout his service (still ongoing) that was mesmerizing.   Its the same for me with old, traditional art. Most are well painted pictures. But i dont find them interesting, while someone who really is into that stuff can talk about the brush technique used by a certain artist. But for me pictures by Monet and other impressionists are something i want to see.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 12, 2020	labels:I bought a Topo Designs jacket since they were having a crazy sale and I really like it, but one of the snap buttons is broken. It definitely seems fixable, but when I submitted a warranty claim, they said they're not restocking until next fall so I could either get a different color which I don't want or a refund. I'm going to ask if they can at least tell me how to source the parts to fix it myself, but would it be better to just take it to a tailor to see if they can fix it? The broken part's on the inside so it won't really be visible anyway if it doesn't look exactly the same.	episode_done:True

text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:Seems like high waisted skinnies are out, but still the most flattering thing on me..so not gonna stop with them.
text:I feel like blue skinny jeans are out but black skinny jeans are more classic so I'm sticking with those.     That said, I think our perception of what's flattering is partially shaped by what we're used to seeing. We've been looking at ourselves and other non-models in skinny jeans for the past decade. Straight and wide leg jeans are still new, so we've mostly seen them on models. There's still some objective elements though. Like I definitely think a higher rise makes the torso look shorter and the legs look longer so if you're long torsoed they'll probably always look better on you. I remember all the fashion magazines saying straight or flared cuts were more flattering back in the early 2000s.	labels:Yes on the high rise/long torso thing! I have a short torso and violin hips. High rise is awful on me. I'm not going back to low rise though. Mid rise forever!!
text:Yeah, it's useful to define high rise in absolute terms but it depends on your body. On me, a 12 inch rise sits right at my navel. A mid rise might hit the same point on someone else.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:It depends.  Black, usually. I personally think the more business formal the better, to show respect for the deceased.

text:Feminist clothing	labels:I have to laugh at a request for feminist clothing being downvoted on a women's fashion sub.    The ladies who fought tooth and nail so yall could vote, own property, have careers, and take for granted the notion that you can be your own person would be *so proud*.
text:I was not expecting this to apparently be controversial.	labels:Because it's honestly a bit weird? Like why wouldn't you simply donate money/goods to a charity/shelter? Or volunteer? It doesn't take much effort on your part, and it helps your local community. Or as someone else said, support local seamstresses and use their services.  Idk, to me clothing with feminist statements will always scream "i need to let people know how woke I am without actually doing anything"

text:What are your tips for being stylish when your weight fluctuates like crazy?	labels:When my weight was fluctuating I started thrifting because I can't afford to buy new things everytime I change a size. I don't know how the stores are in your area but my Goodwill has really nice clothes (great brands like Madewell, Liz Claiborne, Gap, etc).   I am now trying to sell the stuff that doesn't fit anymore so I can make just a little extra. Most of the clothes I thrift I get for $6 or less. It's fun too!
text:This right here! I am the first person to have a meltdown when something doesnt fit me, but when I only spent 1$ on 80% of the things I own it makes it hard to lose my cool. If something doesnt fit me, I rehome it and just buy that size again if I need it.

text:Budget?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:I feel the same way, I'm bewildered at so many people finding ALL pants uncomfortable.   The only thing I can think of is that they're either wearing the wrong style (I vastly prefer super high rise. midrise and lowrise cut me across the stomach in an uncomfortable way, unless they're a size too big), the wrong size (too small jeans WILL be terrible, especially 100% cotton), or they have sensory or digestive issues/stomach sensitivity.	labels:I've hated jeans ever since I was a little kid: if my mom tried to make me wear anything more restrictive than leggings/stretchy pants, I would throw a fit. I've since realized that I'm super prone to bloating, and that must've been the case even when I was young. Like I'll put on a pair of jeans in the morning and they'll feel great, but slowly throughout the day I'll start to puff up and by the end of the day I feel like I'm wearing a corset.

All my heels and skirts that I was excited to wear are gonna have to wait lol  I'm almost embarrassed to admit it, but I'm actually really glad one of my classes requires cameras to be on.

I really have a good feeling about this collaboration and time will tell how it turns out.   The collection looks good; I like the silhouettes, the patterns, colours, next to the trousers and jackets (even the rolled-up sleeves; love it!). I do agree with BuscapefromCCD about the onesies/long johns; don't care for them as well.

For leather bags/backpacks, I stick to Roots, a trusted Canadian brand. For casual shoes, I wear Frye & Sutro.	episode_done:True
text:Big Coats	labels:This high-water crap is over.
text:Haha you mean a lot of ankles showing? I know it makes little sense in winter but it gives it a slightly more tailored look which seems pretty popular now	labels:I think that depends on body type though (and honestly, quite a few other variables). I feel like if you're tall, rolling your trousers up past the ankles just makes you look like you couldn't find trousers long enough for your legs.  I can see it working on a shorter man, better than having that bunched up fabric at the ankles, but even then I wouldn't take it to extremes.  This is another example of why say don't *religiously* follow trends, wear what compliments *you* the most. Personally I would never wear hugely oversized clothing because I'm 5'5 and I don't want to look 3'5 (speaking generally, because tbh many of these jackets posted here aren't so comically huge, most of them look normal to me and I'd absolutely wear some of them).	episode_done:True
text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom taught me that you should dress for YOU.

text:advice on how to stop buying clothes I don't need?	labels:I've been watching YouTube videos of fashionistas showing their latest purchases, trying the new thing on with other things, sewing their own clothes, purging their closets, etc. It's like vicarious fashion. Right now I don't have the money or anyplace to wear new clothes (or old ones), so it's nice to watch others shop and spend that money and get the thrill of something new. Then I watch them trying to make the decision to let go of things that don't work for them, but often, even when it's obvious, they have a hard time letting go and that clutter just goes back in their closet. Which reminds me I have a lot of clutter in my closet that needs to go.	episode_done:True
text:Handbag conundrum: lesser know (and lesser seen all over the place) or standard luxury designer bags (think the usual Gucci, YSL, LV, etc.)	labels:I think some bags are worth it when there is an iconic look and shape that you adore. I also love the feel of quality and the details like superior stitching and hardware. That being said, there definitely seems to be diminishing returns in luxury handbags -- ie. a $500 bag can be 90% as good as a $3000 bag and it's up to you to decide if an extra $2500 is worth the (possibly) extra 10% in perceived quality.   I also think about the social constructs behind luxury bags and other items sometimes. There have been so many luxury items that I've purchased that really didn't bring me much joy or even an afterthought after purchase. While I can afford a purse that costs thousands of dollars, it's not until after I get it and use it for awhile that I realize the brand of the bag doesn't matter to me or anyone else really. So in essence, get whatever bag you like if the cost doesn't matter.	episode_done:True

So, for me, even if I am out people are at their own tables or in their own dining igloos, and I really can't see everyone's full outfits.  I was also injured right before covid so I haven't gone to work in person in a full year.    That being said these are trends I have actually seen - tie dye, more doc martens than ever before, more wide pants than ever before, shackets, matching sweat sets, flared leggings and lots of ribbed pants and ribbed tops in general.  leather and faux leather pants.  thigh slit mini skirts.   I have not seen anyone wearing bucket hats or sweater vests, they still only live on tik tok in my world.
text:I'm in Sydney right now and tonnes of girls at the beach on the weekends are wearing bucket hats with their bikinis.	labels:Sun protection that doesn't wreck your hairstyle. I like it.

text:Sculptural Fashion Inspiration Album	labels:I love the unexpectedness and drama of making a normally shapeless medium like fabric stiff and structured enough to hold any shape you give it. It also adds a dramatic volume that you don't usually get from clothes.  This is mainly inspiration. Not much of what's in this album is what most people would consider "wearable". These are almost all runway pieces and the majority of them weren't produced for sale. That said, if they were and I could afford them, I'd wear about 60% of what's in the album.  I included a bit of womenswear. There's more to draw from in womenswear, and the pieces here are wonderful.
text:I find it extremely hard to believe you'd wear 60% of that album. None of it is functional. They're all art pieces.	labels:All clothing has to do to be "functional" is cover your body
text:Timeless pieces are timeless for a reason. Art is art and should be appreciated as such. Go look at the shoe making competitions. The shoes are created with extremely small widths that are not actually wearable. They're art and a great starting place, but no one looks those shoes and says, "I'd wear that." Because they know it's not possible. Would they wear something similar that was produced in a proper width? Sure. It wouldn't be that exact shoe anymore though. Almost all aspects of the shoe would have to change to properly fit someone. Likewise with the clothes in this album. These pieces were meant to show skill and design. Hence, they were never put into production.	labels:> no one looks those shoes and says, "I'd wear that."  You're assuming a lot here based on your own experience. I do that.	episode_done:True
text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:Depends on what you mean by "nice". If you want to wear fabrics like silk, structured pieces, pieces with a lot of embellishment - you're going to have to dry clean them, no way around it. I've been successful in caring for delicate clothing at home, but tbh it's often just easier to pay for the dry clean. If you just want something that looks professional, polyester is both very durable and can look just like the real thing at a lower price.	episode_done:True
text:Stop Dressing For Your Height [Tim Dessaint]	labels:I've never understood the fascination with absolute height as something that would qualify or disqualify someone from wearing a particular style or trying something. E.g. "Don't cuff your pants if you're short."  Like long coats aren't any different whether you're 5' or taller than Lebron James. What *is* different are your relative proportions and that *can* affect whether certain things look good on you or not.   Things like arm or leg length vs torso height but that's a ratio and has nothing to do with your absolute height.  Maybe I've spent too much time on the internet where everyone is the same height in pictures but I've *never* seen a good example where someone was too short or too tall for a styling.
text:I think the Youtuber's point is that short people are cautioned AGAINST playing with proportions in certain ways because the effect is multiplied if you're short. Like, if you wear oversized clothes as a short person, that makes you look even shorter/smaller. As a guy, if you're tall and broad in the 'right' ways, society gives you a pass to play with style more.	labels:People are cautioned against this by others that don't know what they're talking about who are either repeating prescriptive urban legend grocery store checkout magazine bullshit or projecting their insecurities onto others with false authority, thereby giving vulnerable people just starting to learn about fashion false and damaging body image ideas.  We can stop repeating shit like this now.  TLDR: delete this, nephew

text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:I've been to 4 funerals in the past year, the last one this past week. Thankfully none as a result of the pandemic, just old age and sadly, cancer.  For 3 of the 4, most people wore "office casual" with a mix of black and color. One of them, it was HOT and middle of the summer(I'm in Louisiana). Most wore a sundress or nice jeans and blouse/button up. Mostly it's "Sunday Best."	episode_done:True

I think they look great on her (classic 'winter'- dark dark hair, pale skin with a pink undertone), but I just can't stand them on me (Auburn hair, beige skin). It doesn't help that my mother loves to buy me bright red turtlenecks.	episode_done:True
text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:I was always allowed to wear what I wanted (the rule was she couldn't see up it, down it or through it!) and when I had my big Emo phase, she loved it. My Mum sewed me a My Chemical Romance inspired Black Parade jacket. She was always really supportive of all hair colours and makeup too. .

Are there any colour's of sport coats I should stick to?
text:it's slightly gimmicky depending on the exact shade. Definitely wouldn't recommend it as one of your first few, one of the reasons why navy and brown are so recommended as sport jacket colours is because they're not as noticeable when you wear them again.

You want a wardrobe that suits your lifestyle and what you like to do. The outfits you have may compliment the events you go to, but they definitely shouldn't drive the need to go out, unless you're specifically looking for motivators to break outside of your comfort zone.

text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:Everything eventually comes back in fashion.  Personally I would love for 2000s jeans to come back - not super low rise or the ones that were bedazzled or laced up but just normal rise bootcut and flare jeans. I have a few from that era that I still wear all the time and a couple more that I had to replace with similar ones from poshmark because I couldn't find them in shops.  I also miss 2000s makeup. Sure, there was too much body glitter and candy colors but there was also the fresh dewy look of blush and a light lip gloss - think Britney Spears in her Oops I Did It Again video, or Mandy Moore's makeup in her video for Candy. Not everything in the 2000s was horrible lol.
text:I watched the vampire diaries when I was about 13 (I was born in 2000, so I was too young for it when it first came out) and I remember being so jealous that Elena and her friends would wear those bootcut, mid-low rise jeans.

Let it soak for 30 minutes and then rinse with gentle agitation. Make sure not to squeeze or wring the garment. Lay flat/reshape on a towel and let it dry overnight.

Recently during COVID I started selling clothes I don't wear on Depop, which I totally recommend if you want to purge your wardrobe but not just throw things out. You get to make a little money but as you go through your wardrobe to sell things you can also just get rid of junk clothes that you were never going to touch anyway!

That's also a good idea for people who don't live near a mall or have a variety of stores to visit in person.

text:A friend of mine was doing the Nordstrom one for awhile. She made it sound like she had a personal stylist selecting items based on her preferences and over time her boxes gradually changed to be more to her taste, but maybe I misunderstood.	labels:That's been my experience with Stitch Fix. You take the initial quiz and they send you some items, then you give feedback on each box and what they send changes slightly based on that and what you keep.

Moving company cost us ~650USD total. The price was based on time so having no elevator made it cost basically double. Labour is more expensive here too.  I'd say moving an entire house or an apartment with more junk will cost you about ~1000usd, yeah. That sounds pretty reasonable for a day of labour + flat moving costs such as the truck, packing etc.  BUT there was no way we were going to move a solid oak table, a corner sofa or huge wooden dresser up 5 flights by ourselves.

The survey does provide measuring instructions, but self reporting does have its limitations and there are always going to be inconsistencies. But I am very open to suggestions for improvement!

text:Do you think that designer brands will no longer be as sought after in the future?	labels:I don't get the logic.  Why would people be buying secondhand designer clothing if they didn't want designer clothing?  The pop in secondhand designer does not just *happen* to coincide with multiple major economic recessions and historically low relative wages for working class people.  At the same time we're in the shadow of a fast fashion industry that deliberately produces 'affordable' clothing of an extremely poor quality.  So, for a lot of us, the only way we can obtain good quality clothing is to buy it second-hand.  As for online platforms, I believe those only contribute to the popularity of designer clothing.  Since people can no longer handle clothing in person before we purchase it, we are even more reliant on brand reputation for a clue as to what the garment's quality might be.	episode_done:True

Perhaps it's because I can no longer pass as a youth and will no doubt get thrown into the demographic these companies sell to, but it's always painful when you start to see a trend in clothes and you hate it, and it lasts YEARS.
text:Oh, yeah, those are so stereotypical, lol.  Or just any of the "I put words on a shirt" styles.  Especially the super gendered, stereotypical ones for little boys and for little girls.

I throw that on and not feel a peep of wind chill or cold even with only one layer underneath, which is how I always wear it. The chest pockets are in the perfect spot and better than wearing gloves.

text:Military Adjacent	labels:Can someone explain to me how any of this is "military"? I've been in the US Army for nearly 13 years and none of this looks remotely military.
text:"adjacent" is the key word.  Many of the items pictured are old (out of current service) items of uniform: og107 fatigues, bdu jackets, deck jackets, a1 bomber jackets, m65 jackets, USN peacoats etc. Or they heavily lean on these designs.	labels:I mean I get the idea. I guess I'm just not seeing it. Maybe I'm uncultured haha. Like a peacoat in the first picture I guess can he considered military. The second picture is a highschool letter jacket with a tie and some od green pants. Again I guess if we're really stretching, the od green pants are military.
text:The point isn't that it's dressing to look military though, it's about using military inspired / adjacent items in a civilian wardrobe. Something menswear had done for at least a century, if not more.   Like in that second photo I'm pretty sure the trousers are vintage m65 pants - which were literally an item of uniform at one point.   It's "military adjacent" not "military" or "militaria".	labels:Ah okay. Explaining it that way helped. I was sitting here thinking that they were trying to look military. I get it now. Thank you for being patient with me.

text:What’s your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:As a baby of the 80s/90s, I'm here for it! This is my first cycle of fashion "coming back," and it's pretty fun to see a new generation reinterpret the style I saved my allowance to buy from Limited Too. That being said, as a 30-something, I'm not diving in too deep, as this aesthetic feels a bit young and maximalist for my style.  The trend seems to be permeating home decor too... I'm mentoring a high schooler through a women in STEM program, and we had a Zoom date the other night. Her bedroom looked like the set of Clarissa Explains It All and it was strangely comforting.

text:What’s something you wish you could tell clothing manufacturers to do differently?	labels:I want sleep pants *without* pockets. I don't need pockets when I'm in bed! What am I supposed to be carrying to dreamland? All pockets do is create lumps underneath my thighs that dig into my skin and make it hard to go to sleep.    I also want manufacturers to take more care with the inner seam of fabric pants like sweats and joggers - I hate when one leg starts to twist around.
text:I like the pockets because I walk around in my pants around the house, and sometimes even outside and tend to put my phone in it	labels:I don't wear my pajamas anywhere but to bed, but if I did wear them around the house I would want pockets. I definitely want pockets in my joggers and sweats, but I don't want my pajama bottoms to have pockets. They do this weird thing where they ball up and dig into my hip bones.	episode_done:True

text:I'm sorry, that was too specific. what do you mean?	labels:The Seven Sisters were/are a cohort of historically elite women's colleges in the Northeastern US which were, I think, meant to serve as the women's equivalent of the then-all-male Ivies.

text:To avoid shrink of any apparel, I would properly follow the washing instructions on the tag.

It may just not be your style?	labels:I have several second hand coats and jackets, and I know in the article Derek says about certain things looking better worn but those marks of wear on the clothing aren't from *my* wear. They're all fairly classic things so style isn't an issue. I enjoy wearing them, it is just a weird quirk that only I seem to have.   To be honest I sometimes get it with brand new things but it goes away after about 3 years. It did somewhat go away with my navy Chesterfield after I had the sleeves lengthened.	episode_done:True

text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:I have found people overwhelmingly wear clothes a size too small (like speaking to friends and whatnot). My sister, for example, buys the same size leggings as I do despite her hips and waist being 5-6 inches larger than mine, and then complains about them being see through. I have strong suspicions that this is the reason people find thongs horrifically uncomfortable as well.	labels:And i buy a size larger leggings than i should because, guess what, if you buy larger leggings they are never see through, panty lines don't show, you don't ooze out the top, and they don't try to creep off of your body. And when they aren't skin tight i feel better about wearing them like pants. For reference, i'm a US 6-8 in denim and i wear size large leggings (except for workout gear i go medium for compression)

text:Just singing the praises of wool	labels:Also wool, and similar fabrics. I'm often cold and work in a cold place, so I usually layer wool items in order to be warmer. One of my best purchases was a will scarf made in Ireland, it's really good. I went as far as buying sheep slippers so my feet are never cold anymore when I'm at home.  Linen is a life saver when the weather gets too warm, we are starting to experience repeated heat waves here and I can't stand wearing synthetic clothes that will stick to my body, absorb my sweat and smell. Linen does none of this. I'm planning on ordering a linen shirt on Etsy for next summer.	episode_done:True
text:Handbag conundrum: lesser know (and lesser seen all over the place) or standard luxury designer bags (think the usual Gucci, YSL, LV, etc.)	labels:This might be an unpopular opinion, but I now find leather goods (and by extension, most designer bags) repulsive. I used to love them and I was obsessed with acquiring certain brands. But since turning vegan I can no longer see the material as anything but skin forcefully taken from sentient, feeling individuals who died painfully and unnecessarily for the sake of vanity. I've given away all my designer bags except a few gifted to me by loved ones.   Now I'm happy with lesser known but cruelty-free handbags. I don't think objects should determine your worth as a person. I used to think status symbols were necessary to get ahead in an image-driven society, now I think that people who see my value according to how much I have are not people whose respect I want anyway.	episode_done:True

text:Guidance organizing a suit for my fiancé for his father's funeral during lockdown	labels:Navy slacks without a pattern and white shirt (tie is not my area). Mismatch of fabric is critical in this case because you are not building suit, but rather classical sport coat and slack combi.
text:The suit looks dark grey to my eye, though monitor may be misleading.  If it is indeed dark grey/charcoal, I would not recommend navy pants, I'd suggest a lighter grey with no pattern that is very noticeably lighter than the jacket. Agree with the above poster that the goal here isn't to match, but to contrast in a... Controlled... way, especially since you're planning for a funeral.  White shirt, simple/plain tie in any dark color (black or grey would be traditional for a funeral, but dark blue, burgundy, or dark green would be fine as well).	labels:I think navy is the right bet. There's nothing really wrong with it, and if a gray is too light it might grab attention in the wrong way. The range of grays that contrast enough but don't stand out might be very narrow.	episode_done:True

Weight gain is nothing to be ashamed of, but I commend you for trying to be healthier - that shit isn't easy!!  As for the "wanting to look professional but wanting to look / feel like myself", I think a LOT of people struggle with this. I feel like for the emo look, wearing all black can still be seen as very professional, I think the issue more would be the cuts of the clothes. It also depends on your profession / workplace - obviously some places are much more lenient and you can get away with a lot more skin. Maybe wearing jewelry that is more alternative can also be a good way to look professional but feel like yourself.	episode_done:True

text:We had some protests in my city a few months ago. Something along the lines of anti-5g, 5g causes covid, anti-vax, covid is a hoax, Bill Gates invented covid, and anti-lockdown.

text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:LOL DC is in the south and rarely gets super cold, although some winters can be worse than others. And the metro tends to be warm even in the winter, and it can get stuffy. If anything depending on where in the south your from, you might find the summers to be awful since they are so humid. Anyway, I digress.  Since your already have Blundstones which can be worn in snow/rain -  get a nice quality wool coat with room for sweaters underneath (J.Crew/Aritzia is popular among the yo pros), a regular puffer (Uniqlo), hat/gloves/scarf and some sweaters (Uniqlo, H&M) and you'll be fine. Also a rain jacket/umbrella (Target) for the rando torrential downpour. Don't need any of these actual hardcore winter items.	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Fashion Grave Robbing	labels:I'm coming for your LV neverfull  "But it lasts forrrreverrrrr and it's an invessssstmenttttt!"  1. Not really, I have LL Bean bags that are in better shape than some of my friends' LV bags.   2. Unless you have a family of 4 paying $300/month to live inside it, it's not an investment.
text:lol for real though those LL Bean canvas totes will make it through anything. we have a big one that got frozen under a dock all winter (I LIVE IN NEW ENGLAND OKAY) and came out good as new. you could perhaps perform a nuclear test on New England and then pry our LL Bean canvas totes out of our cold, dead hands, and then keep them for yourself.	labels:I've had my LL Bean tote for 10+ years and I'm pretty sure that thing could stop a bullet.

Which colour of the iron rangers is the most versatile? I usually wear darker outfits (selvedge denim and darker chinos), so im thinking about getting the dark brown ones (amber harness).
text:It's just personal preference. If you wear denim, any color works. Copper Rough and Tough and Amber Harness are probably the two most popular IRs. Oxblood are being discontinued so if you like them, grab a pair.  Next year Ebony Harness is coming back and Slate Muleskinner is  going to be introduced.	labels:Thanks for the reply!	episode_done:True

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:I would say I dress conservatively, even though I don't have conservative views (quite the opposite to be honest).   When I was younger, people would always assume that I am this polite, quiet, Christian girl. They would also treat me that way. I could be heavy drinker, meet with random guys, swear, party, do really stupid stuff and still be this perfect girl, an example for my peers. My parents had never questioned my actions and I had almost complete freedom.   Right now, my style is still rather conservative, but I no longer this rebellious girl. I am still not Christian though.
text:Ah I can relate to this! I've tried to dress slightly "louder" to offset this, but my comfort zone for style still leans classic, which comes across as conservative (especially in Silicon Valley where everyone dresses extremely casually) even though I'm not.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Pros: I look approachable and friendly!  Cons: I look *too* approachable and friendly.   I've had students tell me that I look like Ms.Frizzle and I can see it. I even have the curly reddish hair. But usually my air or vibe of comfortability seems to entice people to get all up in my space. Most people don't mean anything by it, especially the kids.  But I've had to teach my kids about respecting others bodies' autonomy. They like to grab my clothes to feel the textures. And while there is nothing mean-spirited by it, I always have to tell them, they can't just grab or touch others.   So in a way, my clothes have become a teaching tool and I've tried to instill life lessons. So just like life, the good/bad is kinda intertwined and makes it all gray.

text:Does anyone else hate literally everything they put on?	labels:Have you considered whether you have a long, short or proportionate torso? I am in my 40s and just learned that I have a short torso maybe two months ago. It has seriously been a revelation for me. I found a youtuber who has made some short torso dressing videos and they've been helpful to me. It makes sense after all these years why certain dresses look good and others don't. I always thought it was just because I'm short. Might be something to look into!   But to answer your question, yes, I have a growing pile of crap I'm trying to get rid of on poshmark because I have a lot of clothes and shoes I bought but now hate. ;) some with tags!
text:I did that tiktok thing where you place your hands on your torso to check and apparently mine is slightly short, but I have really huge hands LMAO so I'm guessing I'm about average.

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:I remember: -Tight fitting babydoll shirts with rhinestones on them.  -Ed Hardy and graffiti ish print stuff.  -Really long camisoles that had lace on the top and on the bottom in the v-neckline style. And normally you would wear two different colors on top of one another in different sizes. -Ultra cropped jackets that would basically only cover your arms -The Victoria's secret fold over waist band yoga pants in cotton and the Ugg boots -Super tight light wash Jeans with a flared boot cut and rhinestones on the pockets and swirly designs and low rise lol -thick studded belts  -low rise tartan skirts with wide pleats  -leg warmers over converse

text:Looking for a Shear Thing (Shearling Jackets)	labels:This time last year I was on the Arizona Trail. I was heading to town to resupply and I got a hitch from a Gila County cattleman in an old F-150. Handsom young guy, quiet but kind as can be. He was wearing old 501s and a shearling bomber over a tshirt that had once been white. His sandy hair matched the undyed wool and the leather matched his dusty boots. It was the most natural, most fitting, least pretentious use of a shearling jacket outside of being in the ball turret on a Flying Fortress. And *even he* just barely pulled it off. Because shearling is the peacock-feathers of Americana.
text:Thought this was an excerpt of a novel at first.	labels:Same. I was expecting it to be credited to one somehow. Nicely written indeed!	episode_done:True
text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:T-shirts and jeans can be your style! Don't knock what you currently have. Along with everyone else, I recommend getting on Pinterest and pinning things you like. Not items where they look good on that person, but outfits you would like to try.  Look up different ways to style pieces. You probably have some great core items already. Some styling techniques and a few accessories (or even just ways of wearing your hair) can add an extra oomph to an outfit while staying true to who you are and your comfort levels.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 24, 2020	labels:I alternate between loving and hating my hair. It's super thick and it feels nice, but I can't do ANYTHING with it style-wise without drenching it in product. I basically have to glue it in place or it'll just flop back into its natural state, which is basically a bowl cut.
text:do u by any chance have asian hair	labels:Nah, just unruly white boy hair
text:You mentioned your hair is thick. Are your (individual) strands thick as well or are they rather fine? You might have assessed your hair wrong..	labels:Gotta be honest, I'm not sure. I just trust my barber when he says my hair's thicker than a bowl of oatmeal

Frye pointed leather loafer in black-dry weather.  Black booties (either flat or heeled) in black. Typically with a slight pointed toe.	episode_done:True
text:Derek Guy: The Crown’s ‘Balmoral Test’ Barbours Are Not Just Jackets	labels:It's the one reason I can't stomach Barbour, the upper crust British association rankles. It's reflexive. I love other British producers, have Trickers (official shoemaker for the Prince of Wales no less), Cheaneys and a good chunk of my wardrobe is SEH Kelly but that landed gentry aesthetic from Barbour just doesn't sit. I'd say it's an Irish thing but there's no shortage of people walking around Dublin in Barbour and I even remember a period in the late 80's / 90s when wax jackets were all the rage in rural Mayo.
text:Any thoughts on Private White VC?	labels:I mean they sell clothes that would fall into the Barbour aesthetic, I wouldn't wear any of their wax pieces, but they also sell other beautiful classic pieces. I'd be all over their wool overcoats. Their vibe is more towards the permanent style crowd but with as much as I spend on clothes I can't really claim the working class hero angle. The Barbour thing is probably more rooted in not wanting to look like I'm emulating the British elite.	episode_done:True
text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:My problem with Modcloth is that every time I liked an item I look and it'd be made of polyester (looking at you, Pam Breezely top!).  Polyester makes me sweat like crazy, and I've been trying to switch my clothes all to more natural fibers where possible.  Looking at their catalogue today I'm seeing a lot of Rayon and Viscose, which is better, but there's not a lot that catches my fancy.  I also miss the indie designers! I hate how if you're not into whatever is considered mainstream fashion for that season that it's really difficult to find items that are both accessible and stylistically different than anything else on the rack. For me, Modcloth used to fit that gap, especially since most (all?) of their styles extended into plus sizes.
text:I HATE polyester. HATE. IT. I actively avoid polyester because it feels AWFUL.  The indie designers, I feel, were what made Modcloth great. Now? Meh.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:Definitely a distinct style, which my friends teasingly refer to as "grown up goth". All-black monochrome, hardware accents, drapey silhouettes, varied textures, lots of knits. Anything outside of this style is because there's a dress code.	episode_done:True
text:What are your favourite places to find loungewear ?	labels:My Roots sweatpants are the most comfortable I've ever owned. They're long, cozy, with a drawstring and pockets.

text:General Discussion - January 06, 2021	labels:Changed a zipper on a jacket (lined, light easily tearable fabric, has a storm flap, snap buttons snapped through the old zipper so basically a bitch to work with). Ripped the old zip out, pinned, basted, sewed the storm flap to the new zip, sewed the storm flap to the jacket... and then noticed I HAD THE ZIPPER BACKWARDS. THE PULL WAS ON THE INSIDE. HOLY SHIT WHY MUST I SUFFER. Just THINKING about it makes me angry.        It's all good now though, seam ripping took ages cause I use a too-dense stitch but I've got it basted the right way around now. The lesson here is check your zipper orientation twice (or at least once for fuck's sake) and sew once.
text:Oof. Yesterday, I thought sizing down a watch bracelet and putting the clasp back on backwards was frustrating. That's nothing compared to having to seam rip out a zipper.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Burberry is donating unused fabric to fashion students in need	labels:Huh? Yall trashing fashion students, in a fashion subreddit? Make it make sense. Do y'all think Fashion Students are given fabric for their homework and projects or? I had to pay almost $200 for a swatch kit when I was in school. Literal 1 inch scraps of fabric. Donations from a literal fashion giant sounds pret-ty cool to me. Those donated fabrics could lead to an internship, and a job, investment, and a line that you will buy into, because of that donation, from Burberry.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 06, 2021	labels:If the size chart says Medium and actual fit is Large which one should I go for online shopping?
text:Ask for a size chart and measur a clothing item in the same category that fits you well in the particular category you're looking into. Rule of thumb is always get the size with the measurements that are closest to your actual measurements unless it's outerwear that you plan on layering then size up.   Sizing conventions vary per brand and can even vary per item. Ask for a size chart and measure say a slim fit t-shirt that fits you well if you're going to buy a slim fit t-shirt (slim fit means that the T shirt gets tighter as it gets closer to the belly button area aka natural waist). For regular fit tops, you're good with the chest, shoulders, sleeves, body length. For slim fit tops, you need to ask for waist measurement if you want to be super sure.	labels:I mean the size I bought from there last time

text:Now I need to find a super femme tailored tweed blazer with elbow patches. Except I don't because I'm moving to a tropical climate and have too many blazers. Academic femme is totally my new England jam. Bah	labels:I live in Mexico so I know what you mean with not being able to wear the clothes you want...it's just something you'll have to accept. It sucks when it's 90 degrees outside and you're scrolling through Instagram and all these influencers are wearing cute thick sweaters...so many trendy things just don't work in tropical weather. In the end, climate always wins haha.
text:Climate definitely always wins. I don't think I've truly wrapped my head around the change in weather, going from a place with 4 seasons and 1-2m of snow a year to tropical monsoon climate where it gets below 10C/50F like once a decade. I went through my clothes and gave my friend a whole trash bag of just winter work clothes. At least we're moving down during the dry/cooler season. Showing up in the beginning of the summer would be awful. Gonna melt for the first first year until we get used to it.	labels:It's definitely a huge adjustment! I completely understand. And it makes you realize just how much the fashion world is biased towards places with traditional 4 season weather. I feel like I've had to create an entirely new persona since moving to Mexico 3 years ago because so much of my wardrobe didn't work here.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:My wardrobe is fairly neutral, I tend to wear mostly white blacks and greys so I love a good statement shoe for some more personality.   I have a pair of bright turquoise patterened mules which I wear with a neutral outfit. I also have a bright red/orange pair of heels which tie in perfectly with a pair of formal paperbag trousers which have the same colour running through. Personally I like to bring in colour from one accessory - whether that's a scarf, bag, shoe, or jewellery.  I like to play with juxtaposition and so if I wear a very feminine outfit I like to pair it with some tougher shoes like Doc martens.	episode_done:True
text:Better With Age: 10 Things Better Bought Used – Put This On	labels:This is my jam.   I love thrifting (does virtually count?)  so much I'm sad I already have all the things he listed.   Wool sweaters are fairly easy to find second hand and for the quality some mainstream brands sold (LL bean, Land's End, Woolrich, Pendelton) you'd pay $400-600 to get the weight and craftsmanship today.  Recently been into the old Levi's as well though I've focused on the Japanese versions so far.   Great/Overcoats are great second hand as well though the lapels are often dated so there's a lot of sifting.   u/chashew tipped me to a couple places in Toronto when we could travel a while back and literally spent 4-5 hours going through a few places.   I often wonder the story of where an item has been, what it's seen, who had it.   I find it all beautiful to think about.   Not even mentioning the sustainability portion.

text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:Yes, especially now.

I'm kind of stumped since whatever she really wants she just buys (she just bought a bunch of plates from lenox on Black Friday). She's super into cooking and baking (and has a bunch of pots/pans already) and she dresses pretty classy (last place she bought from was Tahari.) Any suggestions?

Worst: - bought a few items from Forever 21 during one of their sales. The items are not ugly, but it shows how the quality is reflective of the price (the quality is not very good). In the future, I am going to aim to avoid fast fashion and buy decent quality items that I think I will wear.	episode_done:True
text:Best and Worst Purchase of 2020	labels:Best: a vintage orange trench coat from the 80s. I get tons of compliments and was definitely a bold and impulsive purchase. I wear it at work and casually on the weekends to the store!  Worst: old navy jeans. I always grab a few pairs and don't really read the label past the size and cut. So I have 2 pairs of mid rise jeans I hate, and overwear the 2 pairs high rise jeans. I do this almost every time, and I don't learn so that's definitely on me.	episode_done:True

I thought I saw them reply that they'd be ok in response to a comment on their IG post announcing the suit liquidation, but I can't find that anymore.
text:Just my personal observations but I think they're trying to pivot a little bit, and moving some deadstock to consolidate their inventory. They just released a field jacket, two winter parkas, and the most knitwear I've seen from them this season.

text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:I've always been an over dresser, and here's why. Way back in high school when I was 15, my boyfriend (just two years older than me) scored us tickets to a NYE event for over 21's. I had no idea you were supposed to dress up for such events, neither did he. Nobody carded us or anything and we hung out at that event wearing jeans while everyone else was dressed to the nines. This may sound weird, but that somehow permanently scarred me for life fashion wise. LOL! So I'd much rather be over-dressed than under-dressed and that's stuck now for .... over three decades. It never bothers me when I'm more dressy than others... but if I am a lot more casual (like wearing athletic gear and sneakers and everyone else is in suits and dresses and heels), I have flashbacks to that NYE party.	episode_done:True

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:When I got my first "real" job I bought myself a beautiful red Balenciaga city bag.  I loved it and was so proud of it.....but it sat unused in my closet 90% of the time.  It was flashy, too delicate for work, and uncomfortable to wear (I've since realized my narrow shoulders do best with crossbody bags).  I ended up selling it a few years after.    I think I got caught up in having an "it" bag that I dreamed about without realizing what actually worked for my life.  I ended up buying another designer bag, an Alexander Wang crossbody, that I use all the time now because (to me) it's beautiful and practical.  I suggest trying on lots of different styles and find something that you aren't afraid to baby-beautiful bags are meant to be used!	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 01, 2020	labels:About  to start my career in physiotherapy, I am wanting to find new clothes. I  will be working at a private clinic where the dress code is business  casual. Typically male physios wear polo shirts with trousers/golf  pants.  The challenge for me is  that though I am 5'11", I am very leggy so I require a 33/34" inseam,  and my waist is narrow - 29/30". I would be needing to squat/lunge/lift  etc. in these pants. 30x34 pants are pretty hard to find...  My  waist/chest are narrow, so most polo shirts fit me poorly. I wear my  shirts both tucked and un-tucked. I would also love to buy from an  ethical/sustainable company if possible. I live in Canada.  TLDR:  \- 30x34 pants I can squat in  \- Polo shirts for a thin guy  \- Ethical/sustainable brand preferred
text:If you need to squat in them your only real choice is more technical fabrics with stretch. Try Outlier or Patagonia. Sustainable brands come at a big premium.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:I don't know if this counts, but actual summer weight clothing.  I don't particularly like slathering sunscreen over myself and hate tan lines.  Finding breathable linen or cotton cardis/pants/etc that are both light weight enough to wear in Maryland summer heat/humidity and covering is so hard :(  I have a small set I've collected, but nothing nearly as stylish as I'd like.  Oh and a real wool deep purple winter coat that's super fitted double breasted affair with a fur rimmed hood and doesn't cause me immense back pain from the arms not fitting quite right.  My girlfriend has a red one that's just perfect, but I can't find anything like in my color.
text:I feel like linen clothing, especially wide leg pants, are so much more popular now, hopefully you can find some good stuff!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Casual Blazer Inspo	labels:Just what I needed. Bought a UW London Jacket in navy and have been struggling to dress it down	episode_done:True
text:What’s your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:Scarves! I love the variety in fabrics, patterns, and textures. I have a giant collection and I get so excited when it gets in the 40s. Here in SA, there's not much of a winter. But I love how scarves can look good with t-shirts, sweaters, bodysuits, etc. Its extremely versatile in my life.	episode_done:True
text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:My first "designer" bag was at the mall in 2006(?) during college. I got a Dooney & Bourne bag to celebrate getting a job. Back then, Hayden Panettiere was on Heroes and was in the advertisement for D & B. I was a huge fan. I ended up gifting it away to a sweet girl just because. Then I kind of got stuck on Coach and mid tier bags like Longchamp and Madewell. I'm pretty frugal and don't really like to spend much on purses. My most recent and last purchase was a Coach Cassie bag which I love. It was also probably the most expensive bag I'm willing to pay for. I love the LV Metis Pochette but am not willing to shell out over a grand for a bag. The Coach is a "dupe" but made of leather for a fraction of the cost. I'm the type who would toss my bag around and rough house with them. I'm pretty happy with the purse collection i have now so I probably won't buy another bag for a long long time.	episode_done:True

text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:Thank you for saying this! I thought I was SO disgusting, but I don't wash my clothes after each wear (or even 2...5...or 6...or ever, depending on the item). Underwear, yes, but most everything else besides workout clothes gets at least two wears.   Felt like it was my dirty secret, but glad to see I'm not alone.	episode_done:True
text:Coveteur: An Ode to the Striped Shirt	labels:I loooove stripes. I buy them for my daughter, too, and we both own so many we often unintentionally "twin" pretty frequently. I recently retired an Old Navy black and white striped tee that I had for at least 10 years, and only because the shoulder seam had several holes. I just think it makes getting dressed easy. Put on pants or skirt in a simple, single color. Put on striped shirt. Add cardigan or sweater as needed.	episode_done:True

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:I personally think buying second hand is almost always the most ethical decision. At that point the brand isn't benefiting from the profits, so there's no fear of supporting them. Buying second hand also helps to reduce the amount of used clothing that ends up in landfills.  Just be aware that someone might ask you what brand you're wearing (happened to me recently) and you may want to know in advance what you'll say. You may not benefit the company with money by buying second hand but you might accidentally act as a billboard for them	episode_done:True

text:What are you looking forward to buying for "pandemic life" this summer?	labels:Tbh, it depends on whether or not I'm back in the office.  If I'm back in the office, I'll buy some work-appropriate sandals or flats. I was planning to buy those in 2020, but then the pandemic happened and I had no need.  If I'm not back in the office, I may pick up another crop top, since crop tops had no place in my pre-pandemic life. I already got one to wear under a cardigan with lounge pants this winter, and it's oddly liberating.	episode_done:True

Shit if we're gonna give Thom Browne credit for the short suit that's a massive formality clash.  Not saying that there aren't reasons to critiques sneaker/dress shoe hybrids but if you're gonna say that individual shoes are somehow objectively bad and *especially* if you're gonna say that an entire category (subgenre?) of shoes is irredeemable then I expect a better reason than "formality clashes are bad"  Also separate but related hot take:  Caring about the rules of formality is at worst barely-coated elitism and at best it's nerd shit and should be ignored

The neck is always too wide, or the top is too sheer of a material, too heavy of a material. Don't want it to be skintight, but I don't want it boxy either. Such a pain in the ass.

text:Can we talk sleepwear?	labels:I got a really great pj set from Nordsteom Rack (originally from the Nordstrom Lingerie line) that completely changed my stance on "nice pajamas." I was always a flannel pants/tank person, but this set is a super soft stretch jersey long sleeve collared button up and matching shorts, and I was really impressed that I could be super comfy AND feel like I looked cute. The quality is incredible, especially compared to similar sets I've bought at Target (which is still love) more recently that are all pilled and getting holes. I felt like the Nordy set were kind of my gateway pjs into the nicer stuff. I still can't do silky because I always wake up with at least one boob out and everything all twisty. Maybe if you had silky pjs and silky sheets it would work?	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:I really like ponte pants because they come in a variety of colors but are pretty similar to the style of a skinny jean or jegging. I have black, charcoal gray, wine red, and green.

text:Winston & Co. Shawl Collar Cardigan Review (But mostly preamble)	labels:This is good stuff. I think the important takeaway is that there are really not likely going to be shortcuts here - you are likely going to find scratchiness at lower price points, and moving up the pricing ladder, you may find that the ply numbers align with price = wool sweaters whose weight is in pounds not ounces are going to cost $XXX not $XX.  Also, if you do value horn versus leather buttons, you are further slicing your options - there is a strong correlation with Scottish knits with "tradition", and that means the default tends to be leather buttons. In fact, years ago I was at NMWA when a S&C order came in... with leather buttons. I think that meant they had to ship back a few cubic yards worth of cardigans
text:You're right, there aren't short cuts to this level of quality.  I think this knit represents the best entry level option for this sort of sweater. It's not as heavy, but it's FAR from insubstantial.  I don't mind the leather buttons, but they definitely add a level of "Old fogey" vibes if you're not careful.  Even horn buttons can miss the mark, I saw the new Spier & Mackay chunky cardigan and a common comment is that the buttons are just a bit too large.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:If leather, odds are they're Allen Edmonds or MiUSA. Nordstrom Rack's in house Men's Shop belts are really nice for the money and made in USA.	labels:Yea they had a tag in english that said "calf leather" and Made in the US but no further info if they were top grain, full grain, etc nor the tannery it was sourced from  A bit more than the regular US retail price but cant complain honestly	episode_done:True
text:Actually Sustainable: How Brands Are Going Vintage	labels:Or buy fewer clothes of much better quality which suit your physique, in a colour which suits your complexion and of a style which is classic.

As a 5'1" girl a boot with a rubber sole that's between one and two inches and hits just above the ankle goes with everything.  Maxi, midi and mini skirts and dresses and both wide leg and straight and skinny pants.  I teach 5 year olds so for most of my life heels just aren't worth it but I never feel under or over dressed in boots.  When it's hot I wear flat mules.

text:There's always been a sub-culture in Japan that follows milsurp stuff (and I used to sell a few).  Generally speaking, American and post-war German stuff are really popular.  When those M-65 style jackets and liners started becoming mainstream, it seems that vintage places began popular among people beyond that group.  But I think many have moved on since old military stuff indeed have really strange fits.  I personally collected a few but ended up selling all of them because they're honestly not that comfortable to wear. more modern stuff has better stretch, are lighter, just as warm, and are better fitting.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else always hesitate to buy what they truly love because they don't have a social life?	labels:I do still buy it, I have a closet full of dresses for weddings or like really fancy occasions. It's been mostly used by friends because I need to make sure my mom sees they are being used if I don't want her throwing them out... some of them were actually knew when given to friends and even if I do not use them I still want to buy more. I have a problem. That's why with some girlfriends a few months ago after corona we decided that we had to do as we wanted and if we were not invited to any cocktail parties to use those fancy dresses then we would go to a fancy ass restaurant once a month and get all dresses up. It's been pretty amazing, we have done it twice and it gives you all the bad bitch energy needed for the rest of the month.

The idea of doing but that with shipped clothes is too wasteful for me.	episode_done:True

text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:I think it can be huge to just have a consistent color scheme, even if you wear different styles, if you do it all in similar colors then it will always look cohesive.

text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I don't think everyone *should* own specific jewelry. It's so dependent on preferences, location, culture etc. What do you like, what do you think will be timeless for your lifestyle? That's what matters	episode_done:True
text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:Good question! Items I always feel a bit of a sense of satisfaction when clothes wear out tbh because it means they've been well loved. It rarely happens to me because I thrift and have way more than I actually need. A few:  \- A pleather jacket I wore for 5+ years was peeling pretty badly around the back collar. I ended up replacing it with a second hand real leather one that's wearing in much more nicely.  \- The soles of my Birkenstock sandals wore in so much my heels were nearly touching the ground. I ended up losing them before I could wear them in all the way sadly. Heels and soles also wear down in my favourite boots but I get them resoled!  \- My favourite skinny jeans usually last me a year or two before they get super faded and the elastic wears out around the butt. Have not found a good solution for this.	episode_done:True

Consequently, I have a small hoard of vintage leather Coach flap bags in various browns, although Indy's little man purse is actually a canvas army surplus bag, I think.	episode_done:True

text:Stockings vs Tights vs Leggings	labels:Lived in Toronto for a couple of years and cold areas of the US for longer. My go to is a multi layer system. Lowest layer is a pair of thermal leggings. Second layer is a petticoat. I make my own and my preferred material is satin lined with flannel. Over that goes my maxi dress or skirt. The petticoat helps trap heat in and fluff out my full overskirt so it swirls more dramatically. The leggings are my last line of defense against drafts. Overall this set up is good with keeping me toasty up to -30 with a decent long coat on the outside. If I'm still feeling cold then extra petticoats trap even more heat and keep my legs warm. Note that this set up really works best with the absurdly full skirts and not anything narrow. You can't exactly hide the petticoats beneath close fitting skirts.

Which goes on to suggest comparatively expensive wood slat bath mats, which can also grow mold and bacteria.  Another article in the same series derides slippers, and suggests wearing $400 Gucci loafers around the house instead....     The site's OG premise was about recommending "quality goods" and all that jazz, but I guess they bought into their own bullshit and now conflate $$$$$$ w/ "Quality"  (Additionally, an anti-cold brew article in the same series as the others .references James Hoffman, a effete British snob who I would gladly kick down the never-ending stairs from Super Mario 64.)
text:> effete  Is it necessary to use this as an insult?  I feel this happens to most sites.

I'll mix those pieces with the non-colors or each other, depending on my mood. To keep my neutral outfits interesting, I play with textures a lot.

text:General Discussion - November 17, 2020	labels:Hot take time:  "It's a clash in formality" is a baseless and invalid criticism, and if we're going to ask lurkers/new people to do better than "it's just bad" then we should ask the same of our community  I saw very few criticisms of sneaker/dress shoe hybrids in the other thread that amounted to much more than just "they're different formalities so they're bad" but I've seen ties in casual outfits, jeans worn with tailoring, and suits worn with tank tops come off fantastic. Shit if we're gonna give Thom Browne credit for the short suit that's a massive formality clash.  Not saying that there aren't reasons to critiques sneaker/dress shoe hybrids but if you're gonna say that individual shoes are somehow objectively bad and *especially* if you're gonna say that an entire category (subgenre?) of shoes is irredeemable then I expect a better reason than "formality clashes are bad"  Also separate but related hot take:  Caring about the rules of formality is at worst barely-coated elitism and at best it's nerd shit and should be ignored
text:End of the day most fashion takes are based on in- and out-group mentality. Most boils down to associational prejudice.   Or colour-theory and cultural subjectivity (compare colour of choice for wedding & funerals in the West versus India for example).  Other hot take: there's no categorical imperative or supreme being making Immutable Universal Laws of Fashion. The language of invalid and objective fashion is dumb. Things are just subjective based on temporal factors (time, place, culture, etc).   Hottest take: it's just clothes mang.	labels:> Other hot take: there's no categorical imperative or supreme being making Immutable Universal Laws of Fashion.

Fashion is paradoxical in that there's no Laws of Fashion but at the same time it's about reading the room and being socially aware of your subjective time and place which feeds into so-called rules or prescriptives.

Some Armani clothing is better, but it's all drastically overpriced. Lauren Ralph Lauren and some Polo Ralph Lauren are the same; some Polo Ralph Lauren is pretty good, but you won't find it in a Macy's or equivalent. The really good Ralph Lauren clothing is mostly only sold in Ralph Lauren stores.  Lacose is fine. Nothing too special, but not trash.  Ermenegildo Zegna is quite good. Better than Z Zegna, not as good as zegna couture, pretty nice in general.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 27, 2020	labels:I need to find shirts that fit. My shoulder width is xl but my stomach is m/l. Im 6' and 165 lbs I've tried uniqlo slim fits but they have the same problem.   Do you have any new recommendations? Maybe a tailoring service that can be recommend?
text:Find your measurements and shop online. I'd suggest starting out at a department store like nordstroms, where you can shop a bunch of different brands that range from $-$$$. So many different brands and designers use different patterns, there is bound to be something out there that might work or come close.   The other option is what you are thinking, finding a local tailor. Altering shirts isn't too costly and it allows you to shop anywhere and end up with a great fitting shirt.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 08	labels:Looking for some suggestions/ inspirations for 2 outfits for Christmas parties/events here in Australia where it will be summer. I live in the country side, so people are more casual.  outfit 1: something to wear to work Christmas parties. Shorts are acceptable, although I will probably go with jeans.      outfit 2: needs to be just a little more formal, I was thinking jeans and a dress shirt, I am clueless when it comes to shoes.  my style/vibe: causal, minimalistic, mafia,  gta gangster, former footballer. I have a muscular physique, and long legs.     please help.
text:Chelsea boots would work for either function.   Dark wash denim and a white button up. Maybe a belt that matches the color of your boots.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:Yeah, I shop a lot because I'm usually sad and it feels like new items will fix that somehow, or make people miraculously like me more. I'm aware that it doesn't work like that, but I love dressing up as a "new me" every day and I easily get bored... but that's just mental issues :/  With autism and me identifying as queer and all, I'm not exactly popular and there isn't one version of me I'd consider the real me, which makes it even more difficult. "The real me" fluctuates day by day, and so do my outfit preferences. I often buy things impulsively that I WILL love for quite some time, but never on two subsequent days, for example. I've been mocked for this, but I've still found I'm happiest like this, with my crazy big wardrobe and tons of different styles.
text:Wow I've never seen someone else put into words how it feels to need such a flexible wardrobe because your "self" is always fluctuating. I feel a little less alone! As another autistic ladyish person. YES.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:Try maternity tights.  I find they are waaaaay more comfortable.  I have black tights, dark grey tights, and light grey tights for different shades -- all H&M maternity.    For OTK socks... try compression socks.  I don't need compression socks for any health reason, but a friend suggested it -- they are warm and stay up, although all my pairs are just below the knee.
text:I have to second this, I always size up in tights by at least one size, maybe more. It has to be rated for someone 100 lbs heavier than me or I just cannot take it.	labels:Going on SnagTights and getting tights that aren't too small was life changing.

text:What are you hate wearing?	labels:High waisted bottoms. I bought SO many high waisted sweatpants, jeans, and pants because they make my short legs look long. I've spent so much money on them and have bought cropped jackets, shirts, tube tops, etc, to match.  However I don't like wearing them anymore because they squeeze my fucking organs. I literally get stomach pain/cramps and am miserable.  But I continue wearing them when I have to go somewhere that I know I'll be at for a short amount of time (i.e. grocery store). I wear them out of guilt and don't want to think I threw my money away.

text:General Discussion - December 03, 2020	labels:I just heard a new phrase today: "thought leadership" (in an art/literature context). I don't know whether that's just dean for "influencer", but it's the creepiest newspeak I've seen in a while.
text:Yep. Influencer BS/techspeak. And the cultural sector is desperate to monetize whatever it can, due to perennial underfunding, so here we are.	labels:\*sigh\*  I'll just put it next to "teacher-scholar" on the garbage pile.	episode_done:True
text:How do you wear square scarves?	labels:My Mum used to wear them over a collared shirt to work (business environment/when a man would wear a tie) using a scarf clip or ring (similar to a small napkin ring)
text:Ok I LOVE this idea. Gotta get me a scarf ring ASAP! Thank you!	labels:For larger size scarves I tie them similarly to neckties for relaxed looks as well, it works great!	episode_done:True
text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:To be honest, most even slighty heavy-weight fabrics (and by that I mean cotton and heavier) would be fine. You just don't want them to get blown up and get wind trapped into them. I personally prefer short skirts with wool, possibly patterned tights underneath as I think long skirts just look a little too heavy and dark with dark tights underneath, although that is definitely a preference. Anyway, as long as your tights are thick enough, the skirt material shouldn't really have any impact on staying warm! For a really winter-y look, you could maybe look into wool skirts, but I don't think those are a necessity.
text:Any recommendations on shoes to pair with tights and a skirt?	labels:As u/noirextreme said, ankle booties! Or I just wear my all-black suede-ish looking sneakers, those blend in really well as well, and they're actually a little warmer to me (but not as pretty).	episode_done:True

It barely has a shape, pilling is everywhere, looks like a raggidty blanket on closer inspection, but I fucking LOVE IT.   The coworker in question dresses like a finance bro, so what does he know?
text:Doesn't look beat up in the pics.  I thrifted a Shaggy Dog and my wife was like "But, why?"  I get it.	labels:My wife *hates* my brushed Shetlands, while I want even more of them.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 21	labels:Been eyeing some formal, leather Kooples shoes for a while, does anyone know their quality or durability? I'm always dubious of brands that aren't solely in the shoemaking business.
text:The safer bet is going to go with a reputable shoe maker especially if you're looking for a formal pair.	labels:Fair enough, they just had a very particular design that I couldn't find elsewhere. I'll probs just keep looking though. Thanks!	episode_done:True
text:Dress Sneakers Are Alarmingly Popular	labels:Dress sneakers are great and I'm not sure i understand the hate. Sure don't wear the with a full suit, but, pairing them with the right thing makes a casual-formal look feel purposeful. Wearing dress shoes for a semi casual look almost takes always takes away the casual aspect. For mens fashion advice this seems to be more of a hit on an item of clothing, instead of how to make that item work.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 19, 2020	labels:What is the point of slippers? I found some cool LL Bean Wicked Good Slippers in my size at Goodwill but can't figure out their use. Does it prevent your socks from wearing out on hard wood floors? Doesn't seem like you should wear these out to the store. Why not wear socks when you are home?
text:Slippers are usually warmer than socks and also provide more cushion.   Also, slippers are great if you're getting out of bed in the morning and your hardwood/tile floors are cold.  Also, I can easily take my slippers on/off. Like when I'm sitting on my couch I can leave my slippers on the ground and put my feet up on the couch, as opposed to socks which would go from the ground to the couch.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What niche do you feel is missing from the fashion blogging/YouTube world?	labels:Adult goth/ punk/ alt fashion is something I'd like to see. I'm talking more tasteful and stylized than the full blown, head to toe Killstar or Dolls Kill aesthetic that's been cultivated recently. I'm 35 and always learning how to "age up" my look over the years, without looking too silly.
text:OMG YES, just posted this and going to edit but I agree!!!!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Which color palette do you hate wearing?	labels:Most warm tones or earth tones/muted colors. My worst color is mustard.  I'm a "clear winter" and look best in cripser colors-- jewel tones, icy pastels, etc.  If I wear a white, it has to be pure white, not ivory/beige/oatmeal.
text:Where do you buy your clothes? I'm a clear winter as well.	labels:At this point, my closet (I'm on a no buy 2021).  It's been that way for the last few years as colors are very Kanye like earth tones and the silhouettes have been boxy and oversized.	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Fashion Grave Robbing	labels:I would like to submit chelsea boots, the ones with the elastic. And replace them all with riding boots, just because I like to see the world burn.
text:You just made me gasp aloud. Cold dead hands, indeed! I live in California, my feet will sweat to death in riding boots.	labels:No! Riding boots = real leather. Chelsea fashion boots = synthetic. I love my paddock boots. Good luck trying to pry them from my very living hands!
text:Did we live through the same early 2010s?? With the synthetic leather riding boots and leggings?	labels:We did! I ended up w a hand me down pair of real leather ariats that lasted until I grew out of them! Lived in a few pairs of the synthetics until early adulthood when I splurged. Now I know better than to go synthetic anything, but of course, to each their own!

text:Hiking Aesthetic - Functionality vs. Fashion	labels:Arc'teryx is a brand that I swear by for hiking/climbing/trailrunning clothing but also wear in non-recreational environments. Their women's clothing is also great for curvier women, they understand that women have hips, boobs, and butts unlike a lot of brands (*cough cough* Patagonia). You can find different gear that works well in a variety of color ways, if you stick to a palette it may help with your desire to be ~fashionable~. I've done this to an extend by focusing on deep reds and navy for most of my workout wardrobe, however it's better to have bright obnoxious neon colors for safety which I why all of my mountaineering gear is bright red. You're also going to find that the more technical the clothing, the more at the mercy of the manufacturer you are with regards to colors and sizing.	episode_done:True
text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:Are jeggings out? I love the skinny jean look but hate the feel of the waistband. I have 6 pairs of the Uniqlo leggings pants.

text:Me neither... considering I have almost identical hair in length, colour and texture and it almost never looks that perfect, I feel like a right fool!	labels:Same except for the colour.

text:General Discussion - December 27, 2020	labels:Any good shows to binge that give insight into male fashion?
text:Hannibal. Just binge it, it won't give you nightmares.  More seriously... Seinfeld. Granted, that's not totally serious -- obviously -- but they do talk about clothing a lot, and I really gained an appreciation for the way they dress, looking back.	labels:You mean the Jay Peterman episodes?
text:Start episode one. Very first conversation. Tell me what it's about.	labels:I know this one.  Button placement.  It's also how the series ends.
text:Yup. There's also a whole episode about thrifting Frank and Morty's old crap -- Kramer buys a little bit of both and keeps wearing it.  There's a plotline where Kramer wants to steal back an old jacket from somebody.  There's an episode where Jerry has to buy a crested blazer he hates from the Andover shop. That comes after the episode where he loses another blazer he had to borrow to sit in a restaurant...   Jerry is a big sneaker head. Kramer takes them all to get cleaned at a mom and pop shop at some point.  There's an episode all about dry cleaning, too...  And who could forget the Bro / Mansseire?  That's all off the top of my head before 7:30 am. Granted, I just re-binged the series.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What does your shoe wardrobe look like? What are your shoe essentials?	labels:I always think I have way too many shoes, but I also worry I will end up needing them for some specific situation. I have:  - black heeled boots (formal wear) - silver heeled sandals (formal wear)  - wolverine 1k boots (Everyday)  - blue vans (Everyday) - rubber rain boots (Rain) - black birkenstock Mayari (Everyday)  - maroon birkenstock Granada (everyday)   - birkenstock EVA slides (beach/shower shoes)  - 2 pairs tennis shoes (working out) So 10 pairs total.	episode_done:True
text:Dress Sneakers Are Alarmingly Popular	labels:Sneakers are defined by the rubber outsole.  The constrasting white with the 'dress' upper is what is gaudy or....ridiculous.  There's no reason with today's technology we can't have sneaker comfort with dress-shoe style.  It's just lazy dressing or trying to be trendy.	episode_done:True

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:If I picture my mom's typical winter outfit it was a sweater with snakes wearing sombreros and margaritas embroidered on it, a burgundy "sweater jacket" with fringe, and a pink/orange/green bucket purse.*  So I guess she taught me "fuck it, wear what you want", but it did take me a while to adopt that attitude.   *tbf, this was a look for moms in the 90s
text:That sweater sounds amazing.  source: am mom.	labels:I really didn't appreciate her taste enough. One thing I did steal from her were a pair of earrings that are just dangling wooden parrots. I did like her Christmas party uniform, which was a long navy dress, a cream colored military style jacket, and block heeled sling backs.  The 90s really were a trip.
text:I gave my mom a pair of those earrings as a mother's day gift when I was like four. My dad let me pick them myself. My mom is really into "tasteful" things, so I don't think she's ever worn them.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:I will always swear by Cole Haan loafers. If their Nantucket is on sale, I'll buy whatever color they're trying to get rid of. They require no break-in, are SO comfortable, and even my black ones that I wear for tradeshows/conferences and put 150,000 steps a week into on those weeks still look brand new.	episode_done:True

text:Sculptural Fashion Inspiration Album	labels:Not a regular poster here but I wanted to stop and thank you for this album and the conversations it's inspired. I've never really taken the time to consider the purpose behind this kind of wild stuff. It's always seemed like kind of a joke, or a deliberate waste of resources.  Zoolander-y, if you will.   Having read through the comments I'm really warming to the idea of, to borrow a phrase I just learned here, "fashion as pure art" without a purpose other than to experiment with fabrication and create something nobody's seen before.   Even as a jeans+t-shirt wearer I think after a second look I can see at least one desirable trait in every single image, even if I wasn't down with the whole ensemble outright (though I was more into more of them than I expected, too).  Definitely more interesting than another post about dress shoes or sweaters.	episode_done:True
text:One Can Never Have Enough Socks - Happy Holidays MFA	labels:Often when I find these types of socks they tend to be cotton while I really prefer wool socks. Are there any recommendations for these more vibrant patterns and textures, but in wool?
text:CHUP always have a few styles in wool every year, I prefer them to cotton also	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:I think there are some job interview situations where being really over dressed leaves a bad impression. For example, at an interview with a small non-profit that deals with homelessness, showing up in Louboutins and an obviously very pricy bag may give the impression that you don't know how to read the room, or are unfamiliar with the typical organizational culture of non-profits.
text:Thanks for bringing this up! People like to push that super outdated advice that "you can never be overdressed for an interview!!!!" and that a suit is ALWAYS appropriate and that's honestly just a huge mistake. FFA is really guilty of pushing this as well.   There are more and more casual industries where showing up in a suit will reflect just as poorly on you as if you showed up in jeans to interview for a law firm. It makes you look outdated, out of place, inflexible, and clueless. You're likely to be discounted as "not a culture fit".   I've personally been in situations, back when I was young and stupid and believed the "dress formal/can't be overdressed" advice, where I was overdressed in my dumb blazer and shirt while the person interviewing me was in like, track shorts with a sweater with holes in it, even for corporate jobs. On some of those occasions, the interviewers were visibly amused.   Always research or ask about the culture/dress code.	labels:Oh my god this reminded me on my worst interview experience - I have asked the recruiter, they said business casual. I wore a black pencil skirt and a burgundy shirt, pantyhose and closed toe shoes. Well in general the office was business casual, but I happened to go interviewing on a casual friday they had. The guy leading the interview wore a footbal jersey and flip flops. I was in a pantyhose in august. And even though on a regular day my outfit would have been perfectly reasonable, the undersressedness of the interviewer somehow reflected on me in a bad way. I still think he was underdressed even for a casual friday and this somehow made the situation worse.
text:This is tough to gauge though, I've worked places that were casual attire, but absolutely expected interview candidates in suits. When in doubt, ask HR (or if the company is too small, the administrative assistants scheduling interviews).	labels:In this case a recruiting company did the organisation and they didn't know/care about the "third friday each month is casual" thing there. The part I found interesting is how I wasn't WAY overdressed, maybe just the pantyhose was too much, and I still have been made feel so bad about this thing I had no way of knowing lol. Silver lining is that I'm so happy I didn't get that job.	episode_done:True
text:Quilted Pants	labels:Greatest album yet. Thanks for assembling (and draining my checking account)	episode_done:True
text:What would you wear to elope during a pandemic?	labels:I would still wear a wedding dress. I sort of eloped and the airlines lost my wedding dress for 5 days and I got married in a sundress. It's been 11 years and I'm still sad about it. We always said we'd go back and have a do-over, but things happened and life continues to happen and I'll never get to run around Vegas in my wedding dress. I have worn it any chance I get though! Holiday parties or other random events. People are always weird about it "um. Is that a wedding dress?" Me: hell yeah ! I love my wedding dress. I'm gonna wear it as long as I can! I feel like a mother fucking princess in it!" Also, I'm happy I work hard to stay fit enough to still fit into it. Haha. I bought it on Craigslist for $400. I love it. I will continue to wear it as much as possible without any cares because I feel good in it.   That being said. Wear what you feel best in! If it's a wedding dress or sweat pants. YOLO it with all your confidence.	episode_done:True

text:The best plain t-shirt video guide — 11 t-shirts bought and tested	labels:Any recommendations for a tshirt that dont wrinkle so easily?	episode_done:True
text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:I think buying it secondhand is totally fine - you aren't supporting the brand directly.  I put it in the same category as wearing clothes from a brand I no longer support, but purchased a long time ago - I already made the purchase and can't change it, and the most sustainable thing I can do is to wear what I already own til it dies.  I will never again shop at Everlane, but I do have a few super old nondescript silk blouses from them that I still regularly wear.	episode_done:True
text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:The key is actually just learning how to create FABULOUS casual outfits rather than tryin to dull down a dressy outfit. Instead of starting from a place of Dressiness, start with Casual then work on making it the NICEST version of casual possible.    I like to wear jeans and loafers and then some gold earrings, a small scarf, a blazer and maybe a necklace. Where I live even that can be too fancy. So if I see its over the top, I just whip off the scarf and blazer, wipe the lipstick off a little and then I'm looking really cute casual in a t-shirt and jeans.     Overly styled hair and makeup is one thing I notice older women do that "ruins" a casual outfit. The hair is often too stiff and done and the makeup too "nice". So I think having a really pretty, casual go-to hair and makeup routine is important.	episode_done:True

text:What’s your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:I think there was a very diverse range of what was cool across the 90s. There was not 1 kind of cool, which was pretty revolutionary.

text:Brands Want In on the Vintage Fashion Boom	labels:At least to me, the thing I love so much about shopping around at  vintage and thrift stores is that it feels so much less "corporate" than just going to a mall or ordering something off the internet. The more companies dip their hands into this area of fashion for profit's sake, the more life will be sucked out of it
text:I don't know, I know a lot of people who enjoy the process of going to vintage stores and never knowing what you're going to find. The clothing is also frequently significantly cheaper than it would be for you to purchase something of comparable quality new, and there's also the warm moral assurance that you are not contributing to the growing problem of fashion's unsustainable ecologic impact.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:No one thing in particular. Growing up, the local thrift store had 99 cent sales where all clothes were 99 cents. Wedding dresses. Prom dresses. It was great! Probably around the time I got to high-school they modified it so only certain clothes go on sale. Wildly disappointing.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 20, 2021	labels:Hol up. Biden took the oath 10 minutes early, but then the commentator said that he'd be president at noon. I thought the oath itself is what makes Presidents. Was he President at \~11:50 or 12:00:00? Anybody know their Toobin well enough to answer?
text:Section 1 of the 22nd Amendment says this:  >	The terms of the President and the Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January, of the years in which such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified; and the terms of their successors shall then begin.

text:Pantone Color(s) of the year for 2021: Illuminating and Ultimate Gray	labels:It's making me feel a little better about furnishing the house my husband and I are buying. The kitchen and living room are pale yellow and the way the house is laid out, the hallways and upstairs loft are all the same pale yellow color. Then there's also a blend of white and oak trim: white cabinets with oak doors, oak hand rail with white supports. Maybe I could paint the white gray or re-stain the cabinets to update it all a little bit.  But my signature color is pink, so I'm going to keep only buying pink and neutral clothes in 2021 (but I count metallic and leopard print as neutrals alongside my blacks, grays, and olives)	episode_done:True

And depending where I'm going, say casual like to the grocery store or simple errands but I still want to look polished, I'll slip on a pair of classic loafers or slides (something easy to walk in), put on a pair of classic gold hoop earrings, dab on some red lipstick to just stain my lips, and refresh my mascara.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 24	labels:Any recommendations for good OCBDs with a decent taper in the <$50 MSRP range? I'm a 37" chest and a 29" waist with a pretty long torso (I'm 6', but my torso is longer proportionally) and a sleeve length of like 34-34.5", so I usually buy medium, but a lot of stuff off the rack is either kind of loose around the middle or too short somewhere.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 06, 2021	labels:Are there specific long coats for shorter guys that I should look into? I'm about 5'7" average build.  I'm  aware that I should look for mid thigh and above lengths, but it's hard to judge online and a physical store is pretty limiting, I plan on visiting a few these weekend anyways. I was mostly looking at ASOS, but they don't  have measurements beyond model height and the size of the piece unless I looked in the wrong places.  If it's necessary, camel/tan and single breasted, with a budget of about $140. I can budget higher if it's  recommended, but please don't do this to me lol.
text:There really aren't any specific long coats for short guys also I wouldn't worry about the length of the coat too much your not going to look shorter with a coat that reaches past your knees.	labels:Well,not specifically for short guys, I probably worded it wrong. I mean long coats that are on the shorter side. I prefer them shorter anyways, going past the knees is kinda uncomfortable for me  E: am I doing something wrong? I'm just looking for reccomendations on shorter pieces...
text:I think asos will have something you like long coats are only just recently stated coming back h&m had mostly shorter jackets too when I tried some on a couple months ago	labels:Thanks man. H&M was one of the places I was going to check out so that's  good.  Asos had one that I wanted but it's sold one, and the only one that looked like it might be the fit I wanted.  Thanks again.	episode_done:True
text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:Don't ever store animal fibres dirty (wool, silk) - moths are attracted to the oils on them. It's a tough call between not wanting to wash them too often, versus hanging a silk blouse up (thinking it's good for another wearing after its aired) and then pulling it out to find it's been dinner to a moth family.
text:Define store- are plastic totes safe? I put all of my silk and wool stuff in heavy duty plastic totes at the start of Covid. Some in the shed, some in the storage closets. Was planning to buy a ton of cedar essential oils and put it on popsickle sticks around/in all of the bins.	labels:I've had problems with plastic totes in the past, where I've opened the lid and pulled out a holey mess. I've taken to storing them in vacuum sealed food saver bags, which I put in the freezer for a month or so as soon as the clothes are sealed in, just to make sure that they're safe.  I am however burned after many ski seasons where I've un-stored my thermals in autumn and found they've been mothed.
text:I really thought this was an old timey thing that didn't happen anymore because I've never seen this in my life and never known someone in real life that has either.	labels:I've had a lot of things damaged by moths, one year I  had all of my wool jumpers plus numerous other clothes inc synthetics wrecked by carpet beetles. The larvae just ate straight through my non-animal fibre other to get to my jumpers in my storage bags (and didn't care about the cedar I had in to ward off moths) I started using spices (currently little mesh bags full of mulled wine spice) to deter them and it seems to work - no further beetle incursions, although a lot of my clothes smell like spiced beverage now.	episode_done:True

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:I was in middle and high school in South Carolina.

If you were a student you had a jansport book bag and if you were a girl you had a purse, either a Dooney and Bourke(sp?) Coach, Vera Bradley, or a "Louis Vuitton" speedy bought for $20 at a flea market

I also have unbound merino socks and wool and prince merino socks. I carry a couple of nike cotton socks for harsher conditions that warrant more wear such as running. I've also heard very good reviews on darn tough socks which is a combo merino blend if you want to take a look at them. They will be my next purchase. Hope this helps.

There's a bunch of really good no show socks on the market though, or ankle ones that you can get, if you like the sockless look though, so plenty of options.

text:More Men Reach for Sewing Machines	labels:Learning to sew darts, hem trousers, bring in trouser legs, and wastebands, have been some of the biggest savers of my favourite items and keeping up with the fluctuations of weight and style that come with life.        Not to mention jeans repair, crotch on my nudies is more darning than original fabric now. Worn in look on a reliable pair of jeans that fit nicely is hard to imitate.      It's wierd how the simple home repair craft has been labeled un-manly, despite most of those paragons of manliness people put on pedestals singing the virtues of repairing objects used every day.
text:Congrats on being able to darn yourself. That's something I need to practice.  I too find it strange that sewing crafts have been deemed "unmanly." I learned how to sew (as well as cross-stitch, latch hook, needlepoint, and a bunch of other thread crafts; not to mention ironing too) when I was really little. I think its more "manly" to be able to take care of your own wardrobe (amongst other "feminine" household tasks) than it is to have to get someone else to do it for you.  Plus, some of my favorite clothing label and/or designers are men.	labels:It's a shame that more men aren't into it! I made so many toys for myself as a kid by hand and eventually machine sewing, I still have them kicking around. Nothing adds more sentimental value than making/fixing something yourself.	episode_done:True

text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:In addition to what others have said about body type which I think are true and important, I also find the quality of product important. If I am following an influencer, their clothes are probably more expensive than mine usually are, and if I find a cheaper product that is similar, it doesn't have the same fine touches that make the difference. The whole outfit can end up looking cheap.  I've realized that when I shop for something in particular, including to replicate something I saw, I end up settling for something that kind of looks like what I'm looking for but doesn't "wow" me. I've learned to keep an eye out for pieces that really let me feel something instead of just deciding if it kind of looks like something else I liked.
text:This is very good advice. Certain things, like blazers or cashmere sweaters don't translate well to more affordable options. I think the same thing goes for sundresses.

text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:Fold over military style boots - the Doc Marten triumph boots are the closest, but I want just solid black boots.

text:Black Denim Jacket Inspo Album	labels:Fun question ... are we supposed to be able to close a denim jacket ?  A lot of the fit look like it would be impossible to do that.
text:Yes, you should be able to close them. A lot of the fits in this album are just too small.  I disagree with the whole "denim jackets should fit snug" rhetoric- denim is a stiff material prone to shrinkage and it's way harder to stretch out a jacket than the waist on a pair of jeans.  Ideal denim jacket fit for me is *just* loose enough to button up over a hoodie while still being comfortable. Really hard to get that kind of fit without stretch though. I think denim jackets will always just be kind of uncomfortable.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.
text:I disagree with only the last point. Your body prioritizes warming its core. If you don't have a warm enough core, your extremities will get cold.	labels:Fair point but for me I always have something that I can add, or have added, for my core but am missing for my extremities.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone take their “power color” really seriously? Basing a whole wardrobe around one color - not just choosing an accent color for a neutral capsule?	labels:Colours date so quickly.

text:\> Come on Scott Pelley, you have an AARP card and do a hard news show beloved by baby boomers. How "trendy" do we need you to be here, really?

Personally I'm a fan of the suit/sneaker look, and I think this outfit is largely reasonable (I wouldn't have gone with a white insole, but I respect his preference).  If we're talking about respecting the occasion, then I still think it's reasonable.

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:Personally I think about fast fashion isn't necessarily whether or not the clothes themselves will last a long time but moreso that fast fashion retailers are CONSTANTLY sending out new clothes aka it's a production model. If you look at the definition of fast fashion it has nothing to do with quality:  **fast fashion**  1. inexpensive clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends.  I think slow fashion is more, providing new options at each season but not really adding that much inventory while in the season whereas fast fashion there's a new drop every week using resources to make those clothes and encouraging constant consumption. The clothes may last but ultimately you are inclined to still buy more than you would before because you're constantly seeing new items and they're inexpensive.	episode_done:True

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:One of the big things I learned is that there's a lot less room for error or experimentation with investments. I feel pretty fortunate that I had a pretty good idea of what I liked and didn't like, but I think if you're still wanting to experiment then it may be best to stick with very specific investments. For example, I started just with shoes (I have strong preferences) and outerwear (I wanted to upgrade shapes/colors I already loved). That'll help build confidence in moving to other areas.
text:Agree wholeheartedly about experimentation. I began transitioning from fast fashion a few years ago when I landed my first job. I focused on buying less and thinking more about my purchases. It wasn't until two years ago that I started to realize that the style I had settled on wasn't my style at all, it was just what I thought I had to wear to the office.   Now I have a much better idea of what's work appropriate and fits my aesthetic! Since OP is still in that transition period, I'd suggest she try thrifting first from Poshmark or ThredUp to see if she feel comfortable with those items before making a big investment purchase.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:My style is academic/smart/business casual - slacks and sweaters, jeans and blouses, pumps or loafers. Throw in a pencil skirt, blazer, or scarf if I'm feeling fancy. Neutrals year round.  Pros: compliments from my bosses about professionalism, less gendered harassment from male colleagues, way less catcalling and creepiness in public. My clothes are sturdy and need little care.  Cons: bosses say behind my back that I "class the place up" (ew), I see my female colleagues and friends getting harassed and I feel helpless. People expect me to behave as though I'm part of a higher socioeconomic class, though I dont know the culture and I don't have the main privileges (i.e. I'm secretly poor and trashy). I feel like an imposter.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 26, 2020	labels:Been thinking about using some Christmas money on sewing patterns and books to fuck around to try to make my own unstructured sack jackets, high rise trousers, and outerwear. The catalyst has been wanting the Beams+ corduroy patchwork balmacaan, but not willing to pay for it, and just getting frustrated that I can't find any sack jackets (vintage or new) or pants in the fabrics I want for a price I'm willing to pay.  Am I crazy to think that's a reasonable endeavor? I'm concerned I've got some hubris about it since my mom was a family and consumer ed teacher and I've made quilts and shit with her in the past.

text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:I think there are some job interview situations where being really over dressed leaves a bad impression. For example, at an interview with a small non-profit that deals with homelessness, showing up in Louboutins and an obviously very pricy bag may give the impression that you don't know how to read the room, or are unfamiliar with the typical organizational culture of non-profits.
text:I used to work in startups and it was not great when candidates showed up in full suits. Candidates were told that it was a laid back environment and to wear business casual at most for interviews. I felt awkward interviewing people who were much more dressed up than me, not to mention that their clothes suggested that they wouldn't be a good culture fit.  I also showed up to an interview once wearing heels that were totally appropriate for walking around an office, not realizing that my interview was going to involve about 2 miles of walking across a huge corporate campus. In this case recruiting told me to "wear whatever I felt comfortable in" so I went with a skirt, cardigan, and knee-high boots, thinking that it would be a cute, put-together look without looking too formal. At one point my interviewer looked at my feet and said, "those aren't really great shoes for this interview and you're way overdressed. Didn't recruiting tell you that we're a casual workplace?" Needless to say, I didn't get the job.	labels:That sucks! I would probably have reached into my tote bag and pulled out a pair of sneakers and said I was ready for the 2-mile tour!  But seriously some of these "casual" workplaces-- in tech at least -- they all very much have a uniform. Dark wash jeans. Company logo tee. Maybe a blazer over it if the job requires public speaking. Really nice leather loafers OR trendy sneakers, and an expensive belt. When you think about it, it's all very uniform and just a different version of a suit which everyone wears. It's also pretty boring.	episode_done:True

Even larger brands like The Great Frog do this.  You can also cut down a ring that's a bit too big (say a 5).  I'm pretty certain my pinky is about the same size as yours and I haven't run into any problems yet.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Excercises for personal style	labels:I recently watched a tedx "Dressing for Confidence and Joy", where the presenter Stasia Savasuk asked people to think about how they wanted to be perceived in the world by thinking about key words, and then to think about articles of clothing or accessories that fit in that keyword category. For example, if  Person A wanted to be perceived as confident, they would ask themselves if the article of clothing or whatever fit inside the "confident" bubble.  I found that idea to be useful. So the first step is choosing your keywords, and then considering them when you shop or dress yourself.

Did not make any sense, but I'll give it a go because I loved Nicola Coughlan in Derry Girls, but I don't know anyone in the Winx remake and see nothing to gain from watching it.  I wasn't that big on Winx as a kid, but I did watch it when it broadcasted with the morning cartoons, and my fave was Musa.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 06	labels:Does anyone wear chelsea boots for work/formal occasions? Are they worth getting (comfort/practical) or should I get formal lace up boots instead?
text:There isn't a huge tradition of wearing boots with suits in many places, at least for a number of decades. So, I can imagine in some places where suits are required, any boot would be deemed unusual, and you'd have to decide if standing out would be a good thing.   If you do go with boots, I don't think there is a real difference in formality of chelseas versus balmoral boots. Balmoral boots are a bit like wearing a hat in 2020 - notionally conveys a degree of formality, but it also stands out.	labels:Ive got a good pair of brown and black shoes, along with an assortment of others, but would like to get boots for variety. Noticed that Chelseas look good with suita or jeans so was curious.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 08	labels: Assuming budget is not a factor and temp/climate is appropriate (ie spring/fall/winter), is there any reason to choose cotton over wool for everyday wear? I guess what I'm getting at is, after finding out about merino, I'm wondering why I would buy cotton going forward. Merino is anti-stink, temp regulating, handles moisture and precipitation well, and doesn't need to be washed much. Cotton needs to be washed every other wear, doesn't regulate body temp well, absorbs moisture, but at least is easy to wash and is cheaper.  I guess what I'm getting at is, if I want to build a simpler, more sustainable and higher quality wardrobe, why wouldn't I choose wool (from brands like Outlier, Wool & Prince, etc)? The main reasons I can think of are that if it's hot in the summer, merino might be a little warm. Also since I have a kid, vom and other accidents occur - with a cotton shirt, that just washes right out.  Anything else I'm not thinking of, or reasons you wouldn't totally convert to merino or other wool fabrics?

At least most of the time I end up changing my pants because I don't know what shoes to wear. And it's holding me back. I've never been a huge fan of derbies, especially black derbies because I associate them with school uniform shoes, and I'm forbidden to wear sandals. So now I don't know what to do.

text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:> "house dresses," i.e. clothes that you wouldn't want to be seen in public wearing  I actually get the opposite read from that NPR link. Not house dresses as embarrassing clothing to be worn only behind closed doors, but rather as a step up from sweats/activewear, helping people feel better/more put together/more normal in our current situation. I'm reading it more as saying, house dresses originally existed as a concession to comfort, allowing women to wear looser clothing while still remaining "ladylike" (because they are dresses), but they are trending now as a way for women to feel "dressed" while at home.   I've been living in a Cupshe button-front loose floral dress that I got in a clothing swap right before the pandemic, and I wear it just as much to the grocery store as I do at home :)
text:How do you find the quality of the cupshe dress? I am looking for optimal house dresses and their stuff is nice but the price makes me question the quality.	labels:I got it in a clothing swap so I didn't pay for it and am not sure of the cost. I'm not even sure how much the previous owner wore it before it got to me. The material is definitely thin and the buttons are a little loose, but I've washed and worn it many times and it looks great. I'm guessing from other dresses on the website that it was about $25-30 USD, and I'd say it's about worth that.	episode_done:True

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:Instead of tights, I usually wear leggings. I have a black pair and a navy blue pair, and imo they look like opaque tights (especially sice i always pair them with boots that cover the bottom of the leggings at the ankle, so you can't tell the leggings don't have feet). I find leggings way more comfortable and warmer than tights, plus more durable.
