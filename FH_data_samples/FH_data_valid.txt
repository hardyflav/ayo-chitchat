text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels: Top Apres ski pic is Aspen, isn't it? Unless every resort town has those sidewalks.  Honestly, if really unsure here, I'd look at hashtags and gallery pics from local bars to see what people are wearing.  Denim is COLD in these climates and unpleasant if you're going to be outside a lot.   I feel as if Gorsuch and Alp-n-Rock do these looks well, but yeah, expensively. I would probably look for similar on Asos and maybe Tommy Hilfiger for "sporty but make it sweaters."	episode_done:True
text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:I sell the ones I dont wear much to places like plato's closet or consignment stores (the RealReal for branded stuff), and it honestly helps a bit because I'm getting some money back for the clothes instead of just giving them away and losing stuff. Not sure if that makes sense but it kinda works	episode_done:True
text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:I used to buy a lot of high end stuff, mostly bags and shoes, with occasional clothing pieces in there. It was definitely easier to spend more knowing I could recoup something.   The problem was that I was never really honest with myself about what I could realistically sell things for, because it started to become justification if that makes sense at all. I never bought things with the intention of reselling them later, but it made it easier. It was always like “$1000 is a lot for this bag, but I can sell for 800, so it’s not that expensive.” In reality, it would sell for more like 500, and it would take a long time to sell. And then occasionally, I’d end up with something that I like, but that no one else really did, and it’s hard to sell something for pennies when you handed over hundreds. It’s a lot of psychological warfare with yourself, or at least it was for me. It also doesn’t help that selling high end designer pieces is much harder than selling mall stuff — a lot of fraud, a lot of entitled buyers *and* sellers, and just a lot of headache overall.   These days, I don’t buy nearly as much luxury stuff, and I try to buy mostly secondhand. I still resell some stuff, but I try to buy more classic things that I’ll keep for awhile. Resale factor does come into play, but if I’m honest, I have a list of things I need to sell, but haven’t taken the time to do.	episode_done:True

text:How to combine colors	labels:This looks great, man, and a tad overwhelming. :D   I´m colorblind and these days trying to find out which colors I like and which suits me. In my situation  even just learning about color and combinations becomes difficult because I lack the foundation to even see the colors and the nuances described. So far I´m leaning towards a gray/white/black combo style which isnt too hard and look good. But I also really like earth tones/autumn viby colours and comfy clothing so I´m checking that out at the moment. I recently saw Ordinary People (the movie from 1980) and the sweater, shirts and colors were perfect. Anyway, checking this out. Thanks  Edit: for colorblind bros: apparently there are apps (f.ex color grab and kuler) that can tell what color things are. Super helpful if you wanna learn which skin tone you have.
text:Goals and Resolutions Check in: February	labels:My goals are going well! A couple of ours are essentially the same. Good luck, we got this!  1) Wardrobe Overhaul  At the beginning of the year, all I owned was athleisure. I was a very cozy, but very bored, person. So I’m working on filling my wardrobe with clothes that really make me happy, and it’s working! I’m in a fortunate position right now, so I’ve been spending the last stimulus check on ThredUp and Poshmark. I gotta say I am loving online thrifting.  2) Dress for my emotions rather than comfort.  Part of moving away from athleisure. My clothes really influence how I feel, so dressing up to look like a badass bitch makes me feel like a badass bitch. Even on days I work at home, I wear outfits to emotionally prep myself to enjoy being productive. I change into pjs when my work is done for the day, so I actually get to look forward to my comfy clothes rather than feel like it’s just another lazy day in leggings.  3) Focus on fit and proportions.  This one is harder but is making me feel the most ~fashionable~. I’m trying to identify how/why certain pieces work on me while others look slightly off. I take videos of myself where I make a bunch of tiny adjustments to my outfits to identify the little details I do or don’t like. This is definitely the biggest of my goals, and will take a long time to really figure out. I can often tell when something isn’t right about an outfit, but identifying that element is tricky.

I doubt every fifth post in the Funko Pop subreddit is about curbing consumption and how they should be rethinking their involvement in a plastics based interest.   Personally, I think they're wasteful as shit, but I'm not about to roll up into their space and shame them for it.  I'm so over the handwringing, guilt, and joylessness about fashion in this sub sometimes.
text:How to wear nice casual clothes with a cotton allergy?	labels:Have you tried looking for clothing made out of hemp or linen? You can find casual tshirts and whatnot that are 100% hemp fabric. You can also find causal shoes that are hemp (i have an older pair of Adidas that are 100% hemp fabric uppers). Plenty made out of leather as well.  Do you have a budget for clothes? A lot of companies that use these alternative materials are considered "premium" brands and carry their price tags accordingly.
text:I also have added a lot more prints/textures/silhouettes/colors to my wardrobe since COVID.

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.

text:Lately she is my pandemic designer. I love all of her patterns and pattern upon pattern and her comfortable to the max looks. And the shoes! No reason to suffer heels now. Even though restricted to the house and yard and sometimes a quick trip to the market I still get dressed as creatively and colorfully as I can. It lifts my spirits as well as the spirits of my family. We are a three generation household. My 13 year old granddaughter gave me the highest of compliments last week when I came downstairs.  "Wow, I wish I was an old lady so I could dress like that"! I told her that one of the benefits of being my age is that I can wear whatever I want. I'm retired and 76 but I still love looking good and I love fashion but I no longer worry about or want the latest trends. I know what they are and can work around them to get the look that I want, not what Madison Ave. tells me is IT.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Office Clothes	labels:I am in a male-dominated field but in a sector of creatives in a professional office.  I usually wear:  -	Solid or patterned (houndstooth or understated plaid) pants. -	tops with interest like puff sleeves, boat necks, crochet detail, etc.  I don’t really like patterned tops. -	Tea length feminine dresses.  Not sheath style.  Usually a-line.  Most of my dress are in a mellow print.  -	cardigans or blazers depending on my mood  My personal palette is navy, forest green/dusty green, dark red spectrum, ivory, mustard, and sometimes black.  I can’t do pastels except pink because it washes me out, but they looks lovely on others.  I’d say 75% of my clothes come from Boden and the rest from Gap, Banana Republic, J. Crew, and some from Old Navy. Boden is my fav and their clothes feel and look nice in me and have lasted a while.   I get my pants mainly from any of those places that aren’t Boden.  Everything else, dresses and tops are from there for the most part.	episode_done:True

text:What are the Luxury IT Bags right now? And which ones are actually worth the $?	labels:The #1 It bag right now is the Prada Re-Edition. Because of that, you will be seeing a lot of nylon and half-moon shaped shoulder bags over the next few months. Bag trends go in and out pretty quickly, so it is much more important to pick one that you really love (especially when you are dropping that kind of money!). The Dior Saddle Bag is an older bag style that they brought back in and saw a huge resurgence in popularity. It's not as trendy as it was when they reintroduced it, but it looks pretty likely to stick around as a staple style for the brand. Dior has been getting more expensive recently. The price doesn't really reflect the quality (the quality is just as nice as many luxury brands with lower price points), so you are really paying for the brand.
text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:I think that this really depends on what type of washing machine you have access to. If you have a modern, front loading machine, with multiple wash settings, you can relatively easily machine wash many “hand wash only” items. I’ve had varying results with top loaders or old front loading washers-I find them more rough on clothes. Most items do ok on a delicates cycle with cold water for both stages. I often wash sweaters on the wool setting (cold water, low spin) or soak my sweaters with euclean and spin dry-er in the machine before laying flat to dry. Most of the damage to clothes happens in the dryer IMO. Also, brands often put dry clean only or hand wash only because they haven’t tested the fabric for machine wash and want plausible deniability-thus many things can survive with machine wash cold and air dry. But your results may naturally vary based on the piece of clothing. I personally only buy stuff that I feel is very special that is not machine wash air dry safe. Otherwise I feel like laundry ends up taking too much of my life, and it isn’t worth it to me.
text:How has your style grown/changed since before quarantine?	labels:I have been able to really hone in on my style! It’s not that it has changed, it’s just that I’ve been able to buy things that are more in-line with it. Actually, the trends this year of ruffles, bows and puffy peeves are my actual style, so, I’m advantage of having all of my favorite things being readily accessible.	episode_done:True

I got some more fabric to make masks too, made sure to pick out a jungle print. I found one that has tigers in it, so that's a plus. Also got a fall leaves print.	episode_done:True
text:How many distinctly different outfits do you have?	labels:I also have a uniform!   My tops are usually either a black and white top or sweater. I have mostly skinny black pants and black skirts as bottoms. Even though they’re all Different to me I can imagine that they look the same to others.   I don’t particularly mind this because it feels like a signature look to me, and I think I look good in my outfits. To me, it just signifies that I know what I like and wear it on repeat! If you are happy with what you are wearing, I wouldn’t worry about trying to mix it up for the sake of mixing it up. I always think: do I, someone who likes clothing, remember what my officemate was wearing when I saw her two days ago? Nope! It’s probably safe to assume she doesn’t remember what I wore either. Heck, I don’t even remember what I was wearing myself.	episode_done:True

I'd like my professional attire to say some things, and I'm exploring sleep/relaxation as a theme in casualwear, but I still kind of just buy...

text:General Discussion - January 11, 2021	labels:2020 was probably the worst year of my life (most of the year was ok but nov/december was so awful it dragged it all the way down), but a serious silver lining was that i lost close to 35 lbs. i've been overweight pretty much all my life but not what most people would consider obese. still, it has always affected my self-esteem and confidence, and i was at my peak weight at the start of 2020, 235 lbs.  I cannot overstate how taxing it was to not see the scale budge downward for so long and always seemingly ticking up. a suit I had bought a year prior to fit comfortably after I gained weight was starting to not fit, real "ah shit here we go again" moment. at the start of the pandemic though, i lost 14 lbs in like two months and was ecstatic. i ticked another 10 or so lbs downward before I plateaued and you know, I was happy about it because I never felt hungry and I had a consistent lifestyle and it was good that I could live like that and not gain or lose weight at all. Then, I came down with food poisoning in december and barely ate for like a week and lost another 10 lbs (hardly healthy but in 2020 i'll take the good with the bad). Even after getting better and feeling good again I have kept that weight off and now weigh under 200 lbs for the first time in years. I'm ecstatic for more progress in 2021 and hopefully finally being confident enough to buy the dope clothes I want and not worrying that I look bad in them.  It's so interesting what relativity does to you. I'm 198 lbs rn, but I was last that weight when I was a senior heading off to college and felt awful about it. Now, I feel fucking great and way more confident than I was before. Funny things. The mission is 170 lbs but I'll be happy to be between that and 180. Sorry for the paragraphs but I know this forum more than almost anywhere will understand struggles like this, especially for guys.

text:People who work in the fashion industry - what do you wear?	labels:I work in the fashion industry, but within the tech org of a fashion retailer, which tends to be more casual than the rest of the company.   That being said, for being on the west coast (PNW), our tech org dresses much better when compared to the large tech companies in our area. Worth noting that with COVID and working from home, most people I work with are wearing solely athleisure now.   My role has to interact with our buyers and merchants quite a bit, so before COVID I tended to dress in smart-casual attire (think loafers, slacks, and a sweater — or nice jeans, a blazer to dress it up, and some booties).  Our merch org dresses all over the spectrum of “always fashionable” — where the lower employees tend to lean more casual and trendy, high-street fashion with maybe a few designer splashes, while upper management tends to wear a more business-formal designer wardrobe (think St. John style).

text:Learning to dress better	labels:Some great advice already.   There’s plenty of YouTube videos and Instagram accounts to draw advice from. For example:  Gents Lounge, Real Men Real Style, etc etc  You just have to search and find some you enjoy watching and enjoy the people presenting. Only problem I find is that everyone is trying to sell something or they all encourage buying expensive items. Not always practical.   What I will advise as a student or someone with a lesser budget, or indeed anyone, is you can easy make some outfits work by substituting high street/cheaper brands.   Keep an eye on local charity shops and ebay, If you find something you like and it’s good quality, you can get it for a fraction of the price. Then if you need to take it to your local tailors and have it tailored. The cost of cheaper secondhand and the cost of a tailor can still be far below the original market price of the item.  If you do this, ensure the item is sized larger as it’s easier to take in clothing. Damn near impossible to let out.   I like to keep outfits simple, clean and a good fit. I’m not one for peacocking or over the top fashion style.  Find what works for you and have the confidence to own it. You don’t have to be a cardboard cutout, be yourself.  As for hair, women don’t mind long hair, just as long as it’s clean, maintained and kept. Just because you are growing it long doesn’t mean you have to just neglect it.   Growing it long could be a chance for you to cut it later and find a style you like.	episode_done:True

text:definitely worth the cost. I found out about contour bodysuits maybe a month ago and I already own 5. I would say it’s pretty true to size but I would size up for the crewneck styles only because the armpit isn’t stretchy which makes it harder to get out of. If you want a skin tight fit, I would go with regular size and just take into account you’ll have to be patient at the end of the day getting it off or have someone help you.

text:Exactly this truthfully. You start to look at everything your wearing for its physical properties. Something that will keep me 1 degree warmer while not increasing my weight is way more important than any fashion considerations. I'm not even nearly as serious as most people.   Otherwise on casual day hikes I just wear a mix of "normal" clothes and what is most important to me such as shoes and socks.   Not to say you can't go the "other" way with your clothing. I wear my merino wool base layers under regular clothing all the time same with my hiking socks. I also have multiple copies of my hiking pants that I wear both hiking and as casual wear.

text:Totally.  To me, Gen Z is a lot of clothing that isn’t work appropriate but super fun. A lot of crop tops, bra tops, spaghetti straps, usually some tummy showing, and then some baggy pants. Lots of thrifting and also cheap fast fashion. Doc Martens and other platform shoes. Very 90s/early 2000s. Long acrylic nails, false lashes. Really fun and can be a really “hot but trashy” style   Millennial fashion is more professional/better quality/structured. Linens, trousers, heels, sandals, etc. Frankly I think it has to do with millennials having more money. Low key hair, nails and makeup. Neutral colours and patterns. It’s a more mature style   I’m 25 so I get to do both 😎 woohoo	labels:Yeah I’m right in the cusp too and I just mix the two together  I wear platform docs constantly (in part because new motorcycle and I’m vibin with it), but make it work with more professional looking pieces, high waisted jeans without rips, blazers, belts. I try to keep colors and unique prints in my outfits whenever possible though, without sacrificing professionalism too much  If I’m going out clubbing and it’s warm and not a pandemic though? I’m all out with the crop tops, mini skirts, spaghetti straps, or whatever else though.	episode_done:True
text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:It’s less about the value of the item and more about the stars aligning perfectly.  I wear a size 12-13W shoe, plus other things that make my feet really hard to fit, so I am used to buying formalwear to match the one maybe two pairs of formal shoes I own at any given time.  So when I was 17 and going to prom in 2006, my mom tried really hard to help me find shoes, any shoes, that were suitable. But we could only find casual flats or runners, and I realllly wanted to dress up nicely for the first real time in my life. So she said “you know what, let’s buy a dress and then we will just have to find a way.”  So I picked out a black and pale pink dress that just made me swoon, and I figured black heels would be easiest to find. Lol I was so young and stupid.  Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn’t find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I’d just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.

text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:I think it's pretty outdated, but I don't see anything wrong with her saying she dresses for men, if that's in fact what she was doing. There are bits in here that aren't that different than what I hear people say/read on a regular basis:  > I don’t think I could dress like the illustrations in the high – fashion magazines. For that you require what is thought as a Vogueish figure , and is, I believe, a boyish type figure and I don’t have a boyish figure.   Pretty similar to the idea that women with straighter figures can wear clothing or particular shapes that aren't traditionally feminine, but curvier women need to wear clothing that shows their curves or end up looking fat.  > You have to be friends with your clothes if you’re going to dress for men – no too tight zippers or unnecessary doodads to make you uncomfortable! Sometimes their acceptance is just in their response, but the response tells me I am right.   I've heard this often enough: (straight) men don't appreciate complicated clothing, they don't like clothing that isn't "flattering" but might be aesthetically interesting.   I think a lot of the article's pretty silly from a modern perspective and has some eye-roll inducing lines about women not liking her clothing. However, it's not like (some) women don't dress for men at all any more. I don't think her opinions are that unusual, she's just putting them in a way that doesn't sound right for modern readers, especially because hardly anyone actually *says* they dress for men, even when they do. I don't care to dress the way MM did, and I don't share her opinions, but I also think she's conscious of playing a role here.

Then you avoid the weird men’s fitting and bulge.

text:Future of fibers?	labels:I think the future of fashion will be that natural fibers will get increasingly rare in the mainstream, but I hope that etsy sellers/minimalism fashion/indie brands that are the source of a lot of my 100% natural products evolve in the future to be more stylish and less “handmade.” I was a teen in the 90s with a mom who was obsessed with 100% cotton and I remember going shopping with her and maybe 30% of the items were that. Last year I went into a Club Monaco looking for either an 100% cotton or linen top and was told that they didn’t have any of that in the store. And Club Monaco isn’t cheap.  >Are there are any brand's or companies that have been successful in using natural fibers and also have quality products?  My list for cotton and linen (because I turned out to be my mom):  - Eileen Fisher  - Jungmaven (hemp)  - Lilla P   - Sunspel  - Demylee  - Tela 9  - The Great  - Amomento  - Filosophia  - Frank and Eileen  - Le Bon Shoppe (my opaque white shirt haven)  - Muji  - Nicholas  - Norse Projects  - SEA NY  That minimalist look:  - Esby Apparel   - Hackwith Design House  - Wol Hide  - Not Perfect Linen (etsy)  - Epic Linen (etsy)  - Linen Sea (etsy)  Affordable:  - Hanes, especially the ultraweight cotton tees  - Uniqlo  - Lands End  You can also find some 100% natural stuff starting at accessible luxury and midlevel designer brands like Tory Burch, Vince, Theory, Ulla Johnson, Comme des Garcons, Frame, APC, L’Agence, ATM etc. as well as mens/outdoors stores like LL Bean. but I listed only the brands that carry mostly 100% or for affordable brands, at least offer a decent selection consistently. All carry cotton and linen of the quality that I remember in my youth as opposed to the paper thin stuff except maybe Uniqlo which is similar in quality to... say Madewell but cheaper/different style

text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I buy/sell on eBay, Poshmark, depop, and Mercari. There are pros and cons to all of them. For me I’m not trying to make money or save money necessarily—I just want to recycle clothes that didn’t work for me and from everything I’ve read most donated clothes end up in landfills. I also prefer to buy secondhand for similar reasons.   Poshmark definitely has the best customer service. I’ve dealt with a lot of bad sellers (listing the wrong size, clothes not as described etc) and whenever I’ve reached out to Poshmark they basically refund all my money and let me keep the item. On the flip side, as a seller people have unnecessarily complained (item didn’t fit) and Poshmark didn’t allow them to send the item back for a refund—maybe Poshmark gave them a refund and let them keep the item but I wasn’t effected. This is something that REALLY irritates me about eBay—they always take the side of the buyer and u end up having wasted time, money etc shipping something even when u aren’t at fault. I really wish eBay would absorb the costs like Poshmark does, but this is probably why Poshmark has the highest fees.  Ultimately I think the downfall of Poshmark will be the wholesalers and people who are doing it as a side hustle. It’s becoming harder and harder for sellers with 20-30 listings from their actual personal closet to sell things because there’s so much garbage for buyers to sift through. It’s also hard for me as a buyer to find bundles anymore. In the early days sellers closets were made up of actual clothes from their closets so they were all the same size and the style of the person selling. Now if I find something I like it’s impossible to find another item in someone’s closet because there are 500 random listings to sift through.

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I do not like black opaque tights very often. I love a patterned sheer-ish tight - with polka dots or some other thing. A loose enough pattern that hints at your skin below.. I have also had grey sheer pattern tights and other shades, but I a dark skinned black woman, so I have some different color constraints. I generally prefer darker tights over paler ones since I am darker.   As for ankle boot height? I prefer right around the ankle, or even something that has more of a profile of a shoe. I am not a big sock wearer, but if I do want ones to be visible, the need to be an interesting pair,   I'd pick colors that mimic your skin tone or pickup a shade in the dress/skirt you are wearing. I also do not love big contrast between the sock and the tight. But it depends, if the tight matches the dress/skirt - then contrast in the shoe is fine. But otherwise I like the shoe and tight to be closer together.	episode_done:True

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.

It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.

Otherwise, what I did:  \- Left everything that was in the dresser/drawers in there and moved them as one piece (even stuffed extra stuff in each drawer)  \- Space bags for all of my button downs (lots of ironing when I arrived)  \-  Anything that could tolerate it (like suits, wool coats, down jackets), I rolled, folded, etc and packed them into either space bags or just into boxes  \- Packed shoes into boxes as tight as possible (I don't keep the shoe boxes normally)  \- Anything of any high monetary or sentimental value (RMC leathers, a few of my favorite Vibergs/Aldens, etc) traveled with me in the car.

Well, today the USPS emailed me that they just approved my insurance request and I should be receiving a refund soon. That's a fucking 7 month delay.

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:My opinion is that money cannot buy style and taste. Growing up, my family wasn't well off but my mom always dressed nicely even though she didn't buy expensive clothing. She also made sure my siblings and I had decently nice clothes, albeit "unbranded" things for the most part.   As I got older and started working when I was 19, burying clothes on a limited budget while paying my own way through university was such a thrill. Been very lucky to be financially comfortable and then some in the past 8 years but I still don't like to splurge on clothing - anything past $50 is something that will make me pause and think for a few days. The amount of money I have, or the lack of willingness to spend it, has never stopped me from having a rather good sense of style and friends and colleagues always express disbelief that my clothes are not high end nor expensive.   Conversely, I know of many people who are rich or splurge only on high end or designer clothing and accessories as I come from a very affluent Asian country. But this does not guarantee good taste or a fashion sense when they put outfits together. Having a good eye and a keen sense of personal style is seperate from having money in that sense.  I do not shop at thrift stores as there's nothing good in my area and I also have very limited time and patience for it, however, Poshmark has been absolutely fantastic! With the advent of the Internet, access is not much of a limitation for me.	episode_done:True
text:The joy of cordovan—and how to wear and maintain it	labels:Cordovan is an Instagram dream - it’s lustrous and has a ton of color depth. Unfortunately I find  actually wearing it is a different story. It’s extremely stiff and inflexible, especially during the first 20-30 wears. It’s the coldest leather I’ve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I’ve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I’m glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there’s no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.

text:Does anyone else always hesitate to buy what they truly love because they don't have a social life?	labels:I try to reach a compromise: one of the questions I ask myself before buying something is “will I wear it?” I’ve learnt that I don’t really need more dresses, but what does make me feel good is really good quality staples that make day to day clothes stand out more, like a special coat, shoes or earrings. For you, you might want to explore making your jeans, tees and athleisure really good quality so they make you feel good about them when you put them on.  Another way of looking at it is you probably save more money than the average person on going out. You could set aside some money every month for special items of clothing, then try buying and wearing that fancy dress or expensive jeans you mentioned - it’s much easier to treat yourself on clothes when it’s designated in your budget. The more you wear them, the more you’ll probably see there are opportunities in your life to show them off.	episode_done:True

text:Advice needed - Nordstroms Out of Stock items	labels:Have you called a store near you? With Nordstrom specifically, your best bet is to get ahold of a sales rep and pray that they'll want to help you. They can do a stock search and see if there are any units left in the company (aka did someone return it?) that can be shipped from the store to you. You'd probably have to call periodically to check.  If it's something super hype, like the latest Supreme shirt, you're SOL and would have better luck buying it after-market at a higher price than retail.  Calling and having someone ship something to you from a store doesn't work for every company - Sephora won't do it and I don't think most fast fashion places will either. Your chances of getting a sold out item go up if you have an established relationship with a sales associate.

The result is that you will be recommended to people you know way less / not at all, and if you _are_ your profile shouldn't be immediately recognisable as you so people will skip over it.

text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I feel the opposite, right feel like almost every “outfit” I see influencers in nowadays is just jeans and t-shirt. If they weren’t hot and young, the same outfit would get dragged. Like mom jeans and a giant tucked t-shirt that looks like it came from Walmart and we’re raving about Bella Hadid’s style. I find it very hard to find fashion influences for adult women that aren’t super basic, skewed super young, or just generic preppy “put a blazer over it!” J-crew style. The only place I see any creativity at all is in super high end fashion, but that’s not within the reach of most of us. The whole fashion industry in general is skewed so young, it’s like after 30 they think I should just wear a sack. The only reason the super high end brands cater to an older demographic at all is that older wealthy women are the only ones that buy their clothes. Any price point below that is plain plain basic city

I wouldn’t purchase an article of clothing with a fake logo, for instance, but that’s me personally.)   I also find that fiercely anti-knockoff attitudes can become classist very easily. And the topic of ethics in this regard really gets to me, too. I don’t think it’s fair to criticize the ethics of consumers in a rigged economy.

Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.

That’s what I can remember.
text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:Several reasons:  It depends on who "you" is. Some people do wear runway-esque looks on the day to day (usually the same kinds of people who are really in to looking at runway shows). E: actually I don't think I made this point strongly enough: even for the weirdest, most abstract, least practical runway look you can think of there are people who are looking at it and thinking "that's dope, I want to look like that". People who are fans of that sort of thing aren't looking at them like paintings in a gallery, in many cases they really would dress like the runway looks if cost and practicality allowed.   Couture starts at like five figures, so it's a good guess that "you" can't afford it.  Runway shows are in part about image making, i.e. producing photos that will look cool on social media, or in trade magazines or coffee table books down the line. Sometimes this takes priority over displaying clothes you can actually buy, which is how you get things like Craig Green's sculptures, or Gucci's severed heads, or Thom Browne in general.   All of the looks on a runway will consist only of the clothes from the brand, for obvious reasons, which is not necessary how people wear the individual pieces IRL.	episode_done:True

text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:Poshmark and ebay tend to be my first stops when I'm looking for a specific item.  (People go through things so quickly these days that pre-covid I'd often try on something at a store and find it barely worn on poshmark in my size while I was still in the fitting room.)  I find them much easier to narrow things down to exactly what I want than other sites.    If I have a general idea of what I'm looking for but I'm not looking for a specific item, I also like thredup.  I haven't used curtsey enough to have a real opinion on it, as I prefer desktop but I don't like their website.

text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:I will pay more for 100% cotton, linen, wool, cashmere and silk.  I will not pay more for anything else in 100% material including denim (uncomfortable), modal, tencel etc. I pay less for mixes, especially if it’s natural mixed with artificial, that seems to lead to pilling.  As for quality, the best way to tell is to literally feel it. It’s hard to describe but if you go to the most expensive (especially men’s clothes and minimalism/ethical focused) boutiques you can find and feel their fabrics, you will develop a touch for it. The material is almost always denser, heavier, and thicker than you are used to. That’s not to say $$$$ equals quality - but IMO it’s the best way to “learn by feel” is to find a large concentration of it. Quality is sometimes super affordable but relatively rare - for example, Hanes “ultra weight” t-shirts are some of the best quality 100% cotton tees you can buy and is very cheap (but also no design/super basic).  When I go into a new store - I don’t even pull out items on “sight”, I pull them out by feel, remember the brands that feel good and then see what else they have.  For online shopping, I stick to the same brands over and over. My favorite t-shirts, tanks and other simple tops for example are from Hanes, Wol Hide, Le Bon Shoppe, The Great, Tela9, Lilla P, and Sunspel. How do I know? I’ve felt them in person, bought them, worn and washed them, and when I need a new item, I go there first.	episode_done:True

text:Orlando. I flew to NYC for Alan David and willing to do so again, but that turns a $1500 suit into a much more expensive one, obviously.	labels:Yeah... I don't know many shops in Orlando. Supply and Advise is a great store in Miami, next time you're there, but I'm not sure if they do anything MTM.  For NYC... You could always just go and get measurements on file at a few places. Kent Wang, black Lapel, the Armoury, Mr. Ned, Martin Greenfield, Imparali, et cetera. And visit No Man Walks Alone and Turnbull and Asser and Meermin and Carmina and... We've got a pretty large number of menswear stores worth visiting.  Buuut I wouldn't fly up for just one jacket. Get a tailor to measure the shit out of you, tip him $10-20, and keep those measurements on file, they're yours, you won't lose them like SS did. Then try to get a shirt mtm online (Spier and Mackay, Proper Cloth, Luxire, Black Lapel, Alton Lane...) And see how that goes for you. Online MTM suiting is trickier, but you know... Give it a try.
text:No clue about winter wear. Please Help!	labels:Without knowing your personal style, I'd say at most for winter you only really want to invest in a nice jacket/coat and a scarf. You probably have everything else you could want for layering under it. - a nice shirt, undershirt and maybe a jumper.   Sizing wise stick with your usual size, as winter jackets are typically designed to be worn over something. You wont need to invest in something too extreme as you'll be walking the streets of Paris, not an expedition on the Artic.   Do spend a little more on the scarf though, as it can be a nice statement piece and you want it to last as well as feel nice.	episode_done:True

I was tempted and ordered a sweatshirt on sale a few months ago and it was made out of the worst and cheapest feeling fabric I've ever encountered. In their defense, they refunded me for all three of the items. I just don't think they're worth another shot.	episode_done:True
text:DAE feel they made incredibly ODD fashion purchases, this year in 2020?	labels:I bought a lot of stuff this year, I won't be adding it up because that's always scary.

For when I'm at a new job that involves being in an office all day, travelling through snow and sleet and rain and sunshine 😄 Right now I'm working from home and my outfits are pajamas and slippers.  Also, there was a lot of comfort shopping too, this year has been brutal and painful. If some new boots can make me smile for a week, it's worth it.

text:Brands Want In on the Vintage Fashion Boom	labels:At least to me, the thing I love so much about shopping around at  vintage and thrift stores is that it feels so much less "corporate" than just going to a mall or ordering something off the internet. The more companies dip their hands into this area of fashion for profit's sake, the more life will be sucked out of it
text:yeah that creeping need to want to 'upgrade' or have the 'best' is a big contributor to the unsustainability of fashion i feel like. Even though you could sell/donate the item, it may just end up being thrown away or shipped out.

text:Covid Dilemna - Finding my style	labels:Yep, I frequently play "dress up" in my own clothes and take pictures to analyze. If it's an option, you could try borrowing clothes from a friend or family member to try on and do the same. Remember to try different styling tricks, too, like rolling sleeves, belting, cuffing pant legs, etc or even pinning at different lengths or fullness to get an idea of what those silhouettes look like. It's not the cheapest, but you could also rent clothes or just buy and return. I'd only do that if there's something you want to try that you don't otherwise have access to, though.	episode_done:True

I don’t have a problem with most leggings, but I’ve seen wool leggings by icebreaker and smartwool.

text:This is the right advice. I've been a ski racer for many years. Most of the best jackets like Arc'teryx, HH, etc will prioritize their shells with all the nice features like Recco, pit zips, pass pockets, goggle cleaners etc. Shells are excellent for cutting through wind and then you can have more or less layers depending on the temperature for insulation.   My current setup is an under armour (Costco has great ones from a brand called 32 degrees or something like that), a Hot Chilis quarter zip, a vest that I got as a gift from Marker, and a patagonia poly fill that I swap out for down if it's cold all under my shell. If I'm in a GS suit it's mostly just the under armour and then two coats because it's a bitch to carry layers around as you have to shed them to race.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:This subreddit has a serious hate boner for synthetics and I will never understand why. It seriously depends on the fabric and the purpose of the garment. Not all rayon or viscose or polyester or nylon is the same. It's like you said, the Uniqlo heattech or their amazing wrinkle-free perfectly drapey rayon blouses are so good. Is all rayon wrinkle free or behave like that? lol no... Which is why you need to look at reviews or touch the material yourself. When you touch it, you can just tell it's good...  Not all "natural" materials are elegant or good either. Sometimes stuff like linen is so trash-bag wrinkly. Sometimes cotton/linen/silk really holds in the sweat and makes you stink, or forms sweat stains on your pits, whereas there's loads of moisture wicking poly athletic clothing or super expensive technical gear for hiking or professional sports which is designed for a specific purpose from synthetic material that keeps you ultra dry, ultra cool, whatever it may be. Poly is also good UPF protection from the sun. Some of my most expensive hiking gear is made from polyester. There is some clothing I own, which I can toss in the washing machine, and after the spin cycle, it's completely dry, without the dry rack.   Acrylics can be super itchy and pilly, or be super tightly woven, soft, and incredibly durable. It really depends. You can't just look at the label and put it away because "omg ew polyester 100%" you need to touch it, stretch it, scrape your nail against it to see how the fabric performs.   tl;dr There's loads of great high quality fabrics in all materials whether it's natural fiber or man-made and I don't really have any negative opinion of anything until I see it in person, and touch it and wear it and I don't think it should matter at all, so long as you personally like it

And I'm not in love with the black-forward color scheme here. Plasma's look is also more tame than usual, no crazy colors, but the first background was... cheating, really. The long cardigan worked. And is that all color 8? And the scarf being worn asymmetrically like that is a plus for me. Tame, overall, but... really solid.  \--> /u/ngoknows <-- v. /u/chunsak \-- I'd say NGO ahs the most interesting fit here, for me, with the big, fun, scarf. I like the asymmetry in the first photo... Really solid fit. Oh, and I love the detail shot! Chunsak... Also solid, but doesn't stir anyting up in me, personally. I can see how cord, flannel and donegal in this combination might excite some of you, but for me... eh.  Overall... I expect something crazier next round. Don't pull any punches for the finals.

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:The clothes on the runway are designed to represent, as closely as possible, the idea and sentiment that the designer is using to inspire the new line.  It's analogous to the Platonic ideal. Because the ideas can be so abstract, so too must the clothes. In fact, you can think of it as a series of progressive dilutions, from the designer's mind, to the runway, and then to the clothes that you wear in your day-to-day.

text:I really question why I frequent that sub sometimes. Too many absolute pieces of shit people on there. I suppose that's why the negative connotations with the style exist. We need more dress trad; be rad enthusiasts.	labels:In my native culture this kind of style is *very* frowned upon (which of course doesn't stop a very obnoxious minority to dress like this anyway), so I'm biased to begin with. I realise this isn't internationally true, so present company very much excluded.  "Prep" brings together a couple of things about fashion I don't really like. The whole "dressing with the (only) goal of elevating one's social status" thing and *then* going for "looking like old money" to achieve that. Just horrible to me. Who decides that they *want* to look like their father bought them a spot at Harvard? Doesn't reflect well on one's character imho.  I really like nautical references and turn of the century styles, so it's a shame.

text:Sometimes I wonder how of this is bias towards the present.   There definitely have been large scale trends lately: notably luxury streetwear, which is starting to ebb (Virgil Abloh, Kim Jones, and Jerry Lorenzo have all been trying to pivot to tailoring lately).  Sure, not everybody has been on the streetwear train, but not everybody in the past marched in trendy lockstep either. We think of the eighties as pretty homogenous, but football shoulder *Wall Street* tailoring, prep, punk, and new wave were all happening at the same time, Issey Miyake was in the middle of his career and Comme and Yohji were getting their starts. If you were living in the middle of that and you cared about fashion, you probably wouldn't think there was just one trendy thing at a time either.   Maybe in 2060 we'll all be looking back on the 10s as The Streetwear Era and think that trends are just at that moment starting to die.	labels:As someone in their 40s, this era feels a lot more wide open than the 80s, 90s, 00s, or 10s (to about 2017 or so when the opening started). It's not so much that things aren't in, but that a lot less is out.	episode_done:True

text:I had a similar no jeans allowed dilemma! I have a medical problem that makes tight pants/denim not an option (except the occasional legging day). At first that meant I had wear the few pairs of androgynous-looking joggers which is a fun style but started to make me feel really frumpy and sad having to wear them every day. Now I’ve built up some trousers that look more put together and have a loose fit and conveniently usually an adjustable waistband, which has worked great for my recent weight gain.

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting our 'Finding A Style and Building A Wardrobe' guide	labels:one thing i noticed in my fashion journey is the effect that location has on style, and to be aware of it. is it something you like, or dislike?  i went to college in the north east in the late 2000s and it was all prep all the time. i was in academia at the time, and fully embraced prep into my life, even though it felt like a facade.  then i moved to NYC and  i stuck out like a sore thumb lol. slowly, and without realizing it over the course of a couple years, my style went from typical new england prep with lots of fake pearls and plaid and corduroy and navy and JKP lusting, to all black all the time city girl.  i LOVE my style now, it just feels very "me" and can't ever imagine wearing a navy blazer again in my life. but if i was to move to the north east again, or down south or somewhere else with a different local aesthetic i would pay a lot more attention to my buying choices to make sure i   maintain my style in a way that i like, and if i ever decide to change it up to make it a conscious decision. it would have saved me a lot of money during that transition period when i had no cohesive items to wear together.  a navy wool blazer from jack wills doesn't really go with leather shorts!  &#x200B;  \[edit\] i'm not sure how it would be worked into the guide, though. maybe when talking about climate which heavily affects people's fashion choices and is also very regional, regional (even hyperlocal, different neighborhoods in NYC dress very differently) style trends could also be mentioned?   it would have been helpful for me when moving to a new city to have had that seed planted in my head. if you're freshly moved or have been living in a place for a while and want a new style, look at the people around you! they'll probably be wearing clothes that can be found locally, and if you like how people dress it's a great way to get inspiration on what's current in that area.   it's also great because if you DON"T like how people are dressing you can consciously make the decision to avoid those choices.
text:Stylish ways to carry emergency medication?	labels:You might want to see if you could have something like a cigar tube made for you. Many cigar tubes come with space for 2 or 3 cigars, and are designed to slide into the inner pocket of a suit jacket or blazer. It likely wouldn't need to be overly thick either because the medication isn't as fragile as tobacco.   Alternatively, some companies make cases for fountain pens which are similar to cigar tubes, but often have a more open interior allowing for more versatility.	episode_done:True

text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Nothing that needs to be dry cleaned except winter coats. Hate the smell, hate the bother, hate the expense.  No glitter, no metallic thread. I like it on other people, but on me it makes me feel like I’m wearing a costume. Sequins and paillettes only on formal evening wear (for me).  No dolman sleeves (for me). I don’t like how they look on my busty inverted triangle shape.
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I feel this. In my case I think the problem stems from me getting pieces that I like aesthetically but that have something wrong with them that I ignored/didn’t realize until later. For instance I got these shorts that looked really cute but got really wrinkly around the crotch after I’d sat down, and then they just looked like a monstrosity. Like my entire outfit was completely overshadowed by my goddamn crotch haha. I ended up donating them because I realized that even though they were a style I liked and a great color, the fabric was not right for me. Getting a good pair of khakis that flatter your curves will go a long way. Get them tailored if there is something wrong with the fit on an otherwise good pair of pants. Just look for that holy grail pair that fits you nicely, and don’t buy stuff that is *almost* good enough but has a problem (unless it’s a problem tailoring can fix).	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:Going for good materials is definitely the way forward if it's something I'd want to wear for years to come. I prefer solid gold or silver to plated pieces which will barely last a few months before coming off. However, if it's a fun fashion style I'm not adverse to cheaper options like gold filled or vermeil.  Same goes for stones - e.g. diamonds or pearls over CZ or plastic pearls.  There is a wide spectrum of 'real stuff' depending on your budget and brand preference. E.g. a Tiffany diamond is more expensive than a non branded one from Costco. A lesser quality diamond (based on the 4 C's) or lab diamond is cheaper. 14k gold is cheaper than 18k gold and sterling silver is cheaper than 14k gold...  Not sure if I'm still considered young anymore but I've certainly always enjoyed jewelry! Sterling silver is cheap to buy typically if you don't go for branded (Tiffany, David Yurman) - Etsy is a favourite. Plus second hand saves a lot. Gold is a lot cheaper in Asia if you buy non branded as the labour markup is a lot lower. Given the weight method of sales, solid gold earrings and rings are quite affordable as a result.   And cultured freshwater pearls are a lot cheaper than say Akoya pearls of AAA quality. When I was on holiday in Asia, it'd be common to pay £5 or something and pick some oysters that they'd open up and you get to keep all the little seed pearls they had inside  Typically there were quite a few! Goes to show how easy it is to farm them.  Overall, I think if you're savvy about how to shop and willing to compromise on quality, these items are all affordable.  I'd say have a browse for what you enjoy wearing and like the look of and go from there. Some people might enjoy a single classic item and save up and others have a wide range. I'd say pawnbrokers, eBay and Etsy are some of my favourite go-to places depending on what I'm looking for.
text:When is a garment worth it to you?	labels:For most reasonably priced items, my rule is (unless there an urgent sale) to wait ~3-4 weeks. If I still want the item just as bad, I get it (or wait for a sale to get it). If I’m excited about something else, then so be lol  For expensive items, I do the same but also find an excuse (holiday, birthday, publish a paper, etc.)
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:I also stick with one loose item and a more tighter item to balance it out. I like wearing a blouse with loose sleeves, tucked in a high waist skirt or pant. I do the inverse too, wide leg/loose bottoms, with a tight shirt/blouse. I think I would get overwhelmed if everything was too tight or too loose.	episode_done:True
text:Kaptain Sunshine Fall/Winter 2020	labels:I haven't been able to lock into the Kaptain Sunshine wavelength. To me it the smooth lines and heavy use of solids or very subtle patterns looks like flowy minimalism, which maybe is conceptually cool but to my eye is kind of bland. What am I missing?

text:Men's Health invited me for an interview after my post here	labels:You look awesome in these clothes, I like your mindset, keep up the good work.  Tunics/dresses/skirts/robes especially in looser fits are comfortable in warm weather because of the extra airflow, even more so if underwear isn't worn, and allow for big range of motion, it's nice and easy to do a full squat in them.  It's such a taboo for some people, but it's just fabric around your legs without stitching it together, historically they were worn far longer than pants. A lot of men wear bathrobes and overcoats and those are basically the same.	episode_done:True

text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:I buy 90% of my clothes from Poshmark and ThredUp.    Poshmark: has a much larger inventory than ThredUp.  You can communicate with sellers and can often bundle items for discounts and ask for more pictures/measurements.  ThredUp: easier to search for a type of item (e.g. white cotton t-shirt) and save that search, which I find really helpful.  Much easier to find a specific fabric.  For example I love linen and there's no way to find linen clothes on Poshmark besides just searching "linen" and hoping the seller looked at the fabric.  Each item is shown on a mannequin, which is nice but sometimes it's difficult to see the details (hem, pattern, etc.).	episode_done:True

text:How do you tell when discounted items were never full price?	labels:It doesn't matter if they were sold at a higher price, plenty of crap is marked up regardless of quality. What matters is if they are a price you're willing to pay.  Also try checking other websites good the same item to see price variances.

text:Is anyone into MBTI? Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels:At one point on the INTP subreddit everyone was talking about how they wish they could wear a cape without it being seen as weird. I would interpret the INTP relationship to fashion as a little bit more nuanced than "drab and careless". I think the common theme is that INTPs don't generally care what others think - and so that can manifest on a spectrum from "wears whatever because does not care about their appearance at all" to "wears completely outlandish things because they care about their appearance but do not care at all what others think of it".      As an INTP myself I fall somewhere between the two. Like... I *want* fashion to be a higher priority for me, but when it comes down to it my attitude is more often just "whatever" because social pressure to look good  doesn't register to me nearly as much as it could.

text:I'm Not a Watch Guy I Swear - Street x Sprezza	labels:I am a watch guy, but very much a relatively broke one.  Had I known how much trouble it would be to break into watches, I might have said never mind and wisely walked away. I didn’t, though.   Some pointers for those interested:  1.	The cost of the watch is only the upfront cost. Like a car, a mechanical watch needs regular maintenance. Generally speaking, this will be anywhere from $300 to $1,000+...every 5-7 years.  2.	Because of point #1, entry level (~ $500) mechanical watches are not pieces you will pass down to your kids. In fact, it is usually cheaper to trash them entirely and buy new than to bother having them serviced.  3.	People will tell you there are deals to be had in the vintage market. That’s true, but it can also be difficult to find parts or people willing to work on them. 4.	There is relatively little offered between entry level and about $3,000.  5.	There is nothing wrong with wearing a quartz or digital watch.   All that being said, I still love my small collection. Just wish I had known those things from the start.

Now when I look at lines, I put them in my cart and buy what I like *(on sale cause retail is for suckerssss).* I can't be bothered with business casual looks & fast fashion like H&M, Gap, Asos, J.

Buy less clothing and go to the gym instead." He was right.
text:This is a Good Comment.  Especially the part about reacting to the model's body and styling as well as the items of clothing. And man, it can be real tough to come to terms with that sometimes. Having a cohesive style certainly helps with the styling aspect in these situations, but the part about the body is rife with stress and emotion for a lot of people. There's no one right way to deal with that. Everyone just needs to find the line between what they like and what they actually want.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Yeah, speaking of novelty, I'd say 75% of compliments are basically "I noticed this". People aren't going to lie (Compliments, especially unprompted are going to be genuine), but saliency is the key feature.	labels:> I'd say 75% of compliments are basically "I noticed this".   Exactly! It’s for this reason that (in most instances) I usually prefer people not notice my clothing enough to compliment any specific item.   As an example, I can wear a bright coral sweater and receive many compliments on it — but that’s because coral washes me out so badly that the sweater is all anyone notices. Or I can wear statement earrings. They’d utterly overwhelm my face, but I’d surely get comments and compliments.   A neutral grey sweater is a much less exciting item and is less likely to attract attention or compliments on its own — but I know that grey  makes my skin and eyes/hair pop in a way that make *me* look good as opposed to the clothing.

text:I think this is a bit of a disingenuous reading. Leandra voluntarily stepped back because her statements about Black Lives Matter in June were so off the mark, and the accusations of racism and her role in perpetuating an unsafe and unfair environment for POC employees spiraled from there. I don't know about the gossip, but to pull the plug without giving her employees the time to actually demonstrate their new vision, or even make preparations for being on the job market during a pandemic--maybe it's the behavior of a typical investor/owner, but it's not the "humble, always learning/growing" persona she has been putting out since the summer. I am a little tired of people getting away with cruel capitalist bullshit just because they are women. That's the whole "girlboss" conundrum and I'm glad it's dying out. I was excited to see what the staff did to turn the site around, but they weren't even given the chance. And this isn't corroborated, but if you tell your employees on Sunday the site is closing and less than a week later they get their severance and that's it, it seems to me like that is at least a potential indication of reactive, irrational and last minute decision making, if not a "tantrum."	labels:Yeah ngl, I am so completely disinterested in any form of feminism that's more aggrieved about one very wealthy woman being criticized with vaguely gendered language than it is about a whole bunch of financially precarious women on her staff having their livelihoods upended without warning in the middle of a pandemic winter. Who-owns-what-and-has-the-legal-right-to-lay-off-whom doesn't really factor into my moral reasoning either. If that makes me a crackpot, well, so are the people who actually wear these outfits in real life.

I now wear a ring which will look good with my fits, but feels really weird being just ... there on my hand, all the time now.  They vetoed me posting pictures (we have public facing jobs, these pictures are all over social media, too easy to reverse image search etc.), but they wore a Rick Owens dress (that I picked out) while I went full minimalism with a collarless shirt with onyx studs, a sleek blazer and cropped trousers. I put this together from my existing wardrobe, since we didn't want to spend a lot. Covid measures made things a bit weird, but the court officer made a real effort into making it nice, which was great. (edit: just so nobody thinks we are totally irresponsible: it was literally just us at city hall, no guests, no party. We'll catch up with that after vaccination.)  It was fun seeing all y'all Americans count down to my wedding day.

I don't talk about faith much for self conscious reasons, but i thought telling internet people ould be nice. Prayer beads amd ropes found in so many cultures and religions is really interesting- learning about malas, i found out the first beads found are 42,000 year old seashells that were shaped and strung up.   In other news, i'm making a website you can go to for printed fabrics, patches, customised clothing or a form to contact me and commission repairs- i love fixing clothing with stitches, it feels really invigorating to see how more people are trying repair as a practical thing and an art form.
text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I have a teal suit that is similar in brightness to your pink one. Some tops that would work/that I think work with my suit are: - white/cream button down - white/cream turtleneck - turtleneck or mock neck in a shade lighter or darker than the suit for a monochrome look - silver (for mine) / rose gold (for yours) colour camisole or shoes  - lacy bodysuit + heels - graphic tee + sneaker for a casual streetwear look (I don’t really like wearing sneakers with suits but lots of people like the look)  You can also simply wear the pieces separately!! I tend to wear my blazer a lot more than my pants.	episode_done:True

What gives with your "friend"?  Now, if you find yourself unable to do that -- you're STILL okay. And if you need help, obviously that's why Daily Questions etc exist. Because we weren't any of us born knowing how to style.
text:For many people on this sub fashion is a hobby, and so they don't mind spending a bit more on quality items. Some materials (e.g. wool/ leather) are just more expensive.  There's also the question of quality. A 500€ leather jacket may be usable for 20 years, while a 100€ one will deteriorate after 2.   The reality is though, people on this sub rarely pay full price for their items. Many buy during store discounts or second hand. Buying second hand is a great way to get quality clothing for little money! Find some brands that you like and then go look for them used.  Many people (me definitely included) are working with a small budget, it's definitely possible!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:I’m the first to admit I have a pretty boring colour palette in my closet (I love it!) But I did try for a while as an exercise to make colourful capsule wardrobes where I could assemble 20 (digital) items and make 20 outfits. I had a lot of fun and really tried to go for colour. One thing I found was that you could have the wildest colours you want, so long as everything went together as a whole.   My suggestion for eg. Red pants would be the items in following categories: 1. Coordinating neutrals (like your white top) 2. Coordinating solids (eg a blush pink top, or a  mustardy colour if it’s more burgundy) 3. Coordinating prints (eg anything that has a bit of red in it to tie it all together) 4. Monochrome! Red on red!   Which category you choose in what quantity will depend on how bold your style is, but I think that with a little planning you could incorporate a colourful pant happily into your wardrobe!   Oh, edit to say: I have a teal pant that I really love. I wear it the following ways: 1. Coordinating neutrals: my wardrobe is black/white/silver so basically any black or white tops 2. Coordinating colours: again, don’t really have any but I do find it goes well with my silver camisole and shoes! 3. Coordinating prints: I used to have a white shirt with teal leaves all over it, match made in heaven! 4. Monochrome: with the matching teal blazer, or with a coordinating teal turtleneck under a different jacket!

I ordered a dress and a top, both are 100% cotton, well constructed, and fit me like they were made for me (because they were).   The one drawback is it took about 6 weeks from order to arrival, but I actually think that’s pretty quick for something that was made to order and then shipped from India to the US.

text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:Planed obsolescence comes in to play. If the trend is over for the next season why make it last a year?  and adding to that is the cost of investment to change trends is higher for women with more possibilities with sizes and lot's of  inventory for each size. So the "Value"is in the changing for companys because it increases consumption but men don't have that.  For them if it falls apart or feels cheap they don't buy it and a shirt can last every season XD. So if it falls apart after a couple of months they are more likely to change brand for something of higher quality.  >>  >The lack of consumption and brand loyalty can lead to increase in quality with lack of differences and change cutting cost.	episode_done:True

text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:I once got the tip to put everything in your closet with the open part of your hanger hook facing out. Then, when you wear something, turn that hanger the right side out (i.e. round side of the hook facing out). Set a time period that you want to revisit cleaning your closet (i.e. a season/year etc) and after that time period donate or throw out everything that still has the hook turned in. Similarly, pack all the things you aren't sure if you want to keep into a box and set a time frame. If you find yourself wanting to wear something in that box, take it out. At the end of the time-frame, donate what's still there (especially if you forgot that item existed).  Recently due to COVID, I moved across back the country so I had to fit my closet into suitcases. That involved donating a lot of things that are perfectly nice and wearable but what I had to admit to myself that 1)I actually never wore in the 3 years I lived there and 2) didn't miss in the few months that I was living without them (I was living out of a carry on when I got unexpectedly stuck back home).  In terms of the never throw anything out, perhaps donate it to  a charity that's helps dress the less fortunate for work? They're definitely pieces that others will love.

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:Filters are your friend. I like to start with brand - otherwise the search is way too broad and overwhelming. If you fill in your sizing the app will automatically filter out things that will not fit you (which culls the list quite a bit). If you find an item you like try looking through the seller’s other listings as well- often I’ll find other items that appeal to my taste or discover new brands this way. I think you can suss out a lot about the seller based on the way they describe the items & pics they take too - someone who just Marie kondo’d their closet will have different kinds of items than someone who sells as a side hustle  The big appeal to me is the thrill of the hunt!!

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:By the time I had reached an age to care about clothes, my family went from middle to upper middle class. So I always taught to spend my money wisely and shopped sales.  I noticed that I tended to care more about my appearance and enjoyed shopping for clothes. However, my friends who struggle with money could care less. It wasn't until they were older and had a better income that they focused on buying clothes and being well dressed.  I work at a college and I do notice that students who have more money are more "fashionable" than those who don't. This is 100% because they have extra disposable income.  Fashion is 100% a privilege. I think most people want to look nice and feel good in their clothes. The difference is that some people have the extra cash to buy nicer clothes and others can barely pay their bills. So they are going to only buy clothes when it's a necessitie, and it's going to be something cheap and something that can be used in many situations (aka a plain tee shirt).   Even though fast fashion is detrimental to the environment, it does give people who struggle with money an opportunity to feel cute and good about themselves. There is big difference from buying from a thrift store because you want to score a good deal verses HAVING to because you have no options you can afford.   For my personal style, I really enjoy the minimalistic or dark academia look. I work in a college so I just really enjoy that vibe haha. If I didn't have such a soft baby face, I would probably enjoy a more grudge-y look. If I had less money, I'd probably stick to jeans and a t-shirt lol	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:There's that saying that "you don't know what you don't know", right? I couldn't conjure up a completely original and personal style out of thin air without pulling up inspiration and learning about all kinds of different styles and clothes and fabrics and aesthetics et cetera et cetera. My style is just a big mix of all kinds of trends from the last five years, but it's personal to me because I curated it.  I like to think of personal style as an iterative process similar to design, you build on top of what's already there, see what works, what doesn't, remove unnecessary things until there's nothing left to take away. What remains is just right. The one thing to realise is that it's not something that happens overnight, most people who have a really strong sense of personal style have been doing it for years or decades.	episode_done:True

text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Nothing that needs to be dry cleaned except winter coats. Hate the smell, hate the bother, hate the expense.

No dolman sleeves (for me). I don’t like how they look on my busty inverted triangle shape.
text:General Discussion - December 03, 2020	labels:So, it turns out “””Escape Room””” is not a genre but more akin to a quirk of spotify’s algorithm that just so happened to coincide with a handful of artists I don’t remember listening to this year. Basically they analyze not just the genre of the artists you listen to, but what also what artists you listen to together, and I guess break it down into the smallest bubble of artists that other people also listen to together and ig just give it a random name for categorial purposes...which is not how you fucking define a genre and leads to weird shit like Xiu Xiu, Aphex Twin, and ASAP Ferg being in the same “”””genre””””, but, whatever, mildly interesting peak under the hood of the machine, and my friend got “city building pop” so I guess it could be more bs  In other news, anyone else feel like beginning of the year was weighed a lot more heavily than the end?

text:Is anyone into MBTI? Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels:INFP here! I buy everything second hand, so my wardrobe is a collection of every style and era. I love wearing things that have had a past life before me, and I'm supporting the second hand industry by doing so too.  In less abstract terms, my wardrobe tends to be quite eclectic. Most of my clothes are from the 80s/90s, but I do like to switch it up. Because it's all second hand, my trendy pieces will usually be the older version of a trend! Eg. having mom jeans and floral midi skirts from the 80s, or bootcut jeans from the 00s.  I find it important that my fashion choices reflect my personality, or current mood. For inspiration, I often spend hours looking at old photographs/movies/etc and imagining what these characters would have worn from my wardrobe. Sometimes I'm feeling Britney Spears circa 1999, but other times I want to be a slightly-bohemian period drama character, so I can dress accordingly. I like to have a wardrobe where items can do double duty.  I often feel like I don't know how to express myself, so I love how clothes are a way of easily doing it! That's possibly the most INFP sentence I've ever said, lol.

I’m sick of seeing all these clothes in my closet.  I’ll dress more comfortable too. I can’t picture myself in dresses and tights anymore for my kind of job.

Fast fashion definitely makes it way in there but you can raise your price bar to around $10+ or $15+ to weed all those out.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:I'm in a ambivalent state of mind right now. For a like over a year now I have been into streetwear. Baggy, oversized clothes with lots of prints and branding. This was my first period of taking clothing serious and feeling "fashionable". But one can only see so many of the "same" outfits.  I grew really tired of streetwear in the last couple of weeks but I'm scared to leave my comfort zone. I'm 20 years old but feel like dressing like a teenager. I really really like graphic tees if the prints are well done and If I would imagine dressing like lets say Tim Dessaint for example, who is not into graphics/"crazyness" at all, It would feel too "mature" for my age if that makes sense.  But at the very same time, I feel like im dressing too childish when wearing cargo pants + graphic tee.  Am I overthinking this?

I've got maybe three or four real gems that I still wear from vintage hunting, but everything else has been donated or sold. I'm much happier with my wardrobe now, especially since I started to invest in nicer stuff. I'm wishing you all the best through that transition!	labels:I have gotten a ton of cool shit from thrifting but it really is so easy to grab something for grabbing something’s sake.

In my amateur  assessment, I'd say language effects our fashion choices more in the realm of what we're dressing to communicate (personal wealth, individual perspective and creativity, respect for the natural environment, etc), and in the realm of how we consume fashion (desiring to have more or better than others in our community, desiring newness, desiring to leave a smaller environmental footprint, etc).	episode_done:True

The CDBs are still wearable, they still "last," but you just don't get the same enjoyment out of them at that point.  Or maybe you get a rolex, and sell it four years later at the same price you bought it for... which is terrible, from an investment perspective, so you can do some math to see what you really lost, and compare that to the price of just getting a cheap tissot every few years, and compare the pleasure you get from those options.

I’ve been in the market for a camel coat and black leather jacket for a couple years, but haven’t found the perfect one to pull the trigger on either yet.

text:I think it’s so weird that people are saying she’s so outdated and misogynistic for saying she dresses for men when, by the way she describes it, most women still do. So many of the commenters here do the same as her, they just say, “I dress for myself in the context of modern fashion and culture which still is influenced by the male gaze”. I don’t see anything wrong with it besides the self delusion that these people are wearing makeup and heels just for themselves instead of the reactions they get from others. It’s the same thing! She just said it differently/ more straightforwardly. I do it too when I feel like and have zero shame. It’s fun to dress for men you like if you’re a straight woman.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I agree with the general sentiment that there's no jewelry you "need" to own or that fits all lifestyles. I've had the same 6 rings on for years, I don't take them off ever, no matter how casual or fancy an event. I have two holes in each ear but can't remember the last time I wore earrings, I can wear a necklace for a bit but after a few hours it bugs me to have something constantly touching my neck. That said, I do have pieces from my grandmother I like to break out occasionally; a (fake) ivory elephant pendant and a turquoise penguin necklace. I wear her opal ring every day. My engagement ring will have her sapphires in it.   That said, if you're looking for some basics I think your list sounds great. I'd look more at your own wardrobe than trends to decide whether you lean toward cool silver or warm gold, your occupation to decide whether hoops or studs are more practical, your social activities to decide whether you'd like to invest in true gemstones or costume jewelry. Maybe a few pendant you love and chains of varying widths/lengths so it's as versatile as possible?	episode_done:True
text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:1.  yes, I wear some items from 5+ years ago, but I style them differently.  2. I'm 21. At 13 I wore lots of neons, but I basiclly did it to annoy my teacher who said bright colours are slutty (yes, I find it confusing too)  At 14 I switched schools and dressed like a  1960s stoner. I realized quickly I wasn't into it and that I was just copying people around me.  15-18 was grunge. Docs, faded denim jackets, jeans with 42 holes in then, plaid skater skirts . I dressed like it was 2012 when it was actually 2015-2018, but for a change I was dressing for myself, without intentions to annoy/ conform to people.   18-21 got a job where I had to wear black every day , as a result I was sick of grunge.  I started weating more colours, and becsme intrested in both 1940s snd 1970s fashion.   3 . It took me a long time to switch to grunge because that was my first real style that I built up, but switching to my current style was easier and quicker.  4 . I don't really dress trendy. If I notice a trend I really Iike I buy it, but I'm ok with wearing absulotly untrendy things.
text:What’s on everyone’s Black Friday wishlists?	labels:Since I am not sure when we will open back up again, need to go back into the office, and ultimately what size I am going to be at the end of all this, most of my tabs been purses and shoes 😅  I have a bunch of shoes I am on the fence on.  It's been so nice just buying shoes and breaking them in while WFH. I did get spotted on a Zoom rocking sweatpants and heels when I had to get up and grab something which was a surprise for everyone since I don't wear usually heels to the office. Oops. lol.

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:My vibes are so #1 and varied it is a little ridiculous. I'm definitely a closet maximalist and I love having very varied pieces. Always have been like this too, in college people liked to joke that they've never seen me repeat an outfit.   I will say some of my stuff fits similarly. Like MOST of my pants are high waisted skinnies, but in a bunch of colors/patterns. I have like...10-12 beanies that are all different colors...  I'd say my handbags is the part of my wardrobe I change out the least. I have a black pleather mini backpack and a beige woven cross body that are my go-tos, with like 3 other bags for special occasions.	episode_done:True

text:Indoor layers	labels:I think what your serious outerwear is going to be depends on where you live. I live somewhere where the cute wool coats you may see in winter NYC or winter London are not practical. People where I live wear huge down feather coats in the winter, and we are definitely not wearing these coats inside. By extension, autumn is pretty brutal and people may break out their heavy jackets that are double-lined, but again, we’re not wearing these indoors. Since my area is super frigid, we’re not looking at outerwear trends to be cute. People who move here realize that they need multiple coats and jackets, and it’s to be practical and cover the variety of weather changes more than anything.  If I moved somewhere warmer, and didn’t need outerwear for the practicality reason, I would say that I actually love blazers and think they’re fine indoors (because you see blazers in corporate suiting, which is worn indoors). Your mileage may vary though, cause if somebody is wearing trenchcoats and leather jackets indoors, I would question if that individual is looking to leave the building.	episode_done:True

text:Do you think fashion or style has age restrictions?	labels:I'm mid-30s and I still wear that stuff on weekends! There is definitely stuff I avoid, but honestly, reflecting on it right now, that might be more my personal style at play than my age. I avoid anything too tight or clubby, and I  tend to go for block heels or pumps over stilettos or platforms. There was a whole going-out-top-nice-jeans trend in the 2000s that makes me avoid anything satin- or lace-based. But I think that Vans/Converse or crop tops/high-waisted jeans are definitely still in play if you're 30. And if that changes soon, I'd guess it's because the trends change rather than what is appropriate age-wise!

text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:This subreddit has a serious hate boner for synthetics and I will never understand why. It seriously depends on the fabric and the purpose of the garment. Not all rayon or viscose or polyester or nylon is the same. It's like you said, the Uniqlo heattech or their amazing wrinkle-free perfectly drapey rayon blouses are so good. Is all rayon wrinkle free or behave like that? lol no... Which is why you need to look at reviews or touch the material yourself. When you touch it, you can just tell it's good...  Not all "natural" materials are elegant or good either. Sometimes stuff like linen is so trash-bag wrinkly. Sometimes cotton/linen/silk really holds in the sweat and makes you stink, or forms sweat stains on your pits, whereas there's loads of moisture wicking poly athletic clothing or super expensive technical gear for hiking or professional sports which is designed for a specific purpose from synthetic material that keeps you ultra dry, ultra cool, whatever it may be. Poly is also good UPF protection from the sun. Some of my most expensive hiking gear is made from polyester. There is some clothing I own, which I can toss in the washing machine, and after the spin cycle, it's completely dry, without the dry rack.   Acrylics can be super itchy and pilly, or be super tightly woven, soft, and incredibly durable. It really depends. You can't just look at the label and put it away because "omg ew polyester 100%" you need to touch it, stretch it, scrape your nail against it to see how the fabric performs.   tl;dr There's loads of great high quality fabrics in all materials whether it's natural fiber or man-made and I don't really have any negative opinion of anything until I see it in person, and touch it and wear it and I don't think it should matter at all, so long as you personally like it
text:Guidance organizing a suit for my fiancé for his father's funeral during lockdown	labels:In this case, you're not going to be able to find an exact match for the jacket fabric to turn it into a suit, so we're looking at a somber odd jacket w/trousers look.  To keep things somber, a dark, muted, monochrome palette would be my choice. I'd recommend a white shirt, dark matte grey tie with minimal pattern (could be a grey Glen check if you can find that).   For trousers, I'd avoid navy since it doesn't work that well as an odd trouser colour. Go with a pair of grey trousers a shade or two distinctly darker or lighter. Try a pair of charcoal or mid-grey wool flannel trousers, and pair that with black shoes. He'll get a ton of use out of those trousers in the future since they'll go with almost any kind of jacket as a blank slate. The jacket should be ok — any shininess will contrast with the flannel trousers, but that's actually what you're looking for with an odd jacket/trouser combo.   I applaud you for thinking and planning in advance for him; you seem like a great fiancée.

I used to hesitate to donate "perfectly good" clothes (ones that weren't ill-fitted, out of fashion, or ill-suited for my lifestyle) because I was so afraid I'd regret it - like one day I'd find the "perfect outfit combination" for that item.   I've learned that 99% of the time, you won't even remember what you donated after a few weeks. But also... yeah, there are a few items I regret giving away. It happens, and it's okay: you'll have a day or two of "ah damn, I should have kept that", and then you move on.

text:Cyberpunks Not Dead - Inspo Album	labels:Digging this! I just finished a month-long cyberpunk roleplay/cosplay/lifestyle and the elements that I was looking for in my fashion choices were sharp edges, black or neon, things that light up, face coverings or face paint to confuse facial recognition software, straps, heavy black eye makeup, bright hair, metallics (although that's just because I have metallics-- I think iridescence is more on-brand). We modified it to tie in some vaporwave/outrun aesthetic as well, so pastel pinks were on the table as well as anything that looks glitchy. I'm loving seeing the overlap and non-overlap between the looks we went with and this album!   Favorite cyber-looks are the wide-brim hat with the blue veil, the Calvin Lou look with the spiked hair, the Emporio Armani look with the black translucent fabric and the tiny 90s shades, the Each Other "free hugs" photo, and the Rocostru silver straps.  I love the veil because I think facial masking is a part of what I imagine a cyberpunk future to be about and I think the color scheme is right on-point. The Calvin Lou and Emporio Armani looks both just nail a Matrix-era vibe to me. I love the way both looks play with showing skin and I love the hair styling for both... both read very cyberpunk to me. The Each other look is great partly because I love turning the storm trooper "free hugs" guy into a nostalgic cyber-icon but mostly because the 3D glasses are super on-brand-- both colorful and technological-- and the outfit is also super functional. And, loving the silver straps in general.  I wish I'd had the idea and courage to go more nipple-forward in my costuming for last month... digging that part of this album and loving the implication that our future is more down with women's nipples.

This was years ago, when the brand stood for something. I got to work along some hardcore industry vets who took me under their wing.   Then over the years I have gotten to work at just about every "type" of menswear shop. Big box retailers, flashy online-only outfits, bottom of the barrel makers, the extreme top of the top family owned shops.   I've been able to do everything within the business, too. I've sold, designed collections, marketed, ran operations, did the buying, taken out the trash, taped up and shipped orders. The whole thing.	episode_done:True

text:I've owned bags in various price ranges. I've found that more expensive ones, up to a point, tend to be more durable. Vachetta leather bags are very forgiving, and mine looks great after years of wearing it daily.

I might start to wear bracelets again and go from there.

text:Handbag conundrum: lesser know (and lesser seen all over the place) or standard luxury designer bags (think the usual Gucci, YSL, LV, etc.)	labels:Definitely buy what makes you happy. The fact that you have looked at the high end, well known brands and came away disappointed indicates that (this season at least), they aren't for you.   To answer your question directly: for me, personally, showing my own style is 1000% more important than showing the status of a luxury brand. Do the two sometimes overlap? Yes, and that's fine. But I don't personally get buying something *just* because it is a certain brand. Who are you trying to impress? What are you conveying with that logo (wow, you're well off? What kind of message is that, on its own?) I just feel like people who are super into labels, not the design or the style or anything else, just come across as kind of immature? The truth is, anyone worth spending much time with isn't overly concerned with what logo your bag has. (Now! I will concede there is a difference between showing off luxury brands and having higher end items, in some circles. Like, there could be some tension if you're hanging out with super millionaire socialites and everything you wear is from TJ Maxx...but in that case, I'd still say its important to focus on personal style first. And knowing about smaller higher end designers, rather than designers you can buy at a mall, is a whole different thing too...)
text:Inspo Album: Vintage Wool Sweaters Need Good, Loving Homes	labels:As a born and raised Norwegian, now living in the UK, my love for wool jumpers is endless and my sadness is twofold. 1) I might be Norwegian, but I've also got extremely sensitive skin. Thus my heart may be set on wool, but my skin is absolutely not, unless it's very fine cashmere or particular blends. 2) When autumn comes my immediate reaction is "WEAR ALL THE WOOL JUMPERS", and then I remember I live in the south of England and it doesn't actually get that cold here, plus it always rains.   Neither of those points are going to keep me from now spending several hours looking at vintage wool jumpers online though.

For example I would like a Canada goose jacket but I’m not sure if they will be outdated.	episode_done:True
text:What are your most loved ride-or-die winter clothing items?	labels:A parka I got from Target last year. It wasn't even $50, and it's the *warmest* jacket I've ever had in my life. I live in the northeast, where the snow and wind can be brutal, and I was used to spending upwards of $150 on coats that didn't even do anything.  I'm in the process of losing weight, so I figured spending $50 on a winter coat I would wear for maybe two seasons wasn't bad at all. Cue my surprise when I spent a weekend in the Adirondacks last November, where everybody else around me was freezing, and I'm snug as a bug in my cheap Target winter jacket!  I'm hoping come next winter, it'll still fit well enough to be warm, because it's honestly my favorite winter clothing purchase I've ever made.

You knew how things were going to fit or what the quality was. I know things came from all over designer wise so it’s hard to really control for size that way but it was still frustrating as the consumer.

text:What are your fiction and or nonfiction plans and outfits? What are the things you want to wear just to wear?	labels:My husband and I are planning "fancy" dinner on Christmas Eve. I have a couple party dresses that I would love to wear, as well as a cute Christmas fascinator that I have been wearing for Zoom calls, and he has the easy option of a tuxedo.   It is our first Christmas in a new home, and our first Christmas not traveling in something like 20 years, so while we will miss seeing friends and family, we are looking forward to just being together and doing the stuff we like to do.   Also I bought three pairs of fleece-lined holiday leggings for $2.99 each at the hardware store a few weeks ago. They probably won't last past New Year's, but they are cozy and festive, and they go with my wardrobe of flannels, sweatshirts, and wool socks, so I am enjoying them.	episode_done:True

text:Fwiw I know at least two men who own a ton of shoes and hats. As in 50+ pairs and a store rack worth of hats. One of them collects sneakers as a hobby while the other just likes his shoes and hats to match every outfit. I would guess it's similar for women who own a lot of purses.   I personally don't like purses at all so I only have one for when I absolutely have to (dress codes at fancy events, weddings etc). With "nice" shoes it's hard to find any that are remotely comfortable, so I see a lot of women buying various pairs of torture devices in hope of finding the perfect ones, only to end up with a ton of impractical footwear that never gets worn. I myself own 3 pairs of ballet flats that give me blisters and I haven't got rid of yet. But then if I'm invited somewhere I won't have any nice shoes and idk if I should keep the toe blisters ones or the heel blisters ones or the ones that fall off my foot every other step.	labels:	episode_done:True

I also use Google photos to create a collage	episode_done:True
text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers. Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:I received a Patagonia coat in 2019 and it’s been a godsend. I live in the Midwest, so winters are long and can be brutal, but my long parka from Patagonia keeps me toasty through long walks on campus. Plus I just love the company’s ethics, so it felt like a good investment and a good company to support.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - October 29	labels:I'm watching *Next in Fashion*. I kinda like how it is *not* like Project Runway in that the challenges are not like "design a gown out of garbage", but these are great designers, they get everything they need and are supposed to make the best possible design they can, no constraints except time.  But sometimes the show feels so inconsistent. There is not a *lot* of manufactured drama, but when there is, they turn it up to 11 (and I roll my eyes so hard they might pop out). I also don't need the "human interest" tear-jerker backgrounds. Focus on the designs, ffs. They almost always do women's *and* menswear (which is great), but then for the women models they promote some kind of body shape diversity, whereas the male models are all *very* conventionally attractive. Feels half-assed. Tan France isn't half as funny as he thinks he is (more eye rolling).  Overall I enjoyed it, but I can see how it got cancelled. Netflix also did a shit job promoting it.

Personally I cannot afford their full price products so I usually wait to find a good deal online or in-store. Having said that I think that limits  what you can own from BC. Their water repellent cashmere blazers, their cashmere jumpers and cardigans as well as some of their leather/suede jackets are always sold out before reaching the end of season for a decent markdown!

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:I have moved to different climates many times. My recommendation would to not purge or change anything until your move is complete. The reason is, you definitely get climatized, where what would consider "warm" in the winter to you now will feel chilly enough to wear heavyweight items you hadn't expected would work once you are climatized. A lot of items that you think will/won't work end up being the opposite, etc. You mentioned having less storage, so it sounds like you will need to offload/purge at some point, but I'd wait to do it once you get there and put it off for as long as you can to truly see what items work. I'll never move to a cold climate again but even moving to different warmer climates, I will wait to do any paring down/purging until I can get a little climatized and adapt.
text:I would agree. I already commented but there's a huge market gap for plus sized women that Shein fills. It's beyond obvious most people posting and commenting on this sub aren't plus sized or are on the smaller end of it like me, size 14/16. Shein accommodates women up to size 24/26 or so and those women are more likely to need inexpensive clothes (obesity/poverty correlation, it sucks but its true). Most people on this sub can afford or have the option of a huge variety of ethical and sustainable clothes that are not Shein either due to being straight sized or having enough disposable income. If you're committed to ethical and sustainable fashion and you're avoiding all new clothes, fast fashion, and mall brands, sure, I'll listen to your critique of Shein, but please realize most American women don't really have that privilege. If you're out here buying Zara and Express, you can kindly shut the fuck up with your hypocrisy.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:I typically just start by wearing them to places like the grocery store first. By my logic, there have been several times where I have worn a cocktail dress and heels there just to pick something up and have not given myself a second thought about doing so, so why should a bright shoe, or another item of clothing I am self conscious about be any different? Likewise, I have also seen many people at the grocery store in some cool items, and will not be thinking about it for more than 5 seconds.   After that if I still wasn’t completely confident I would probably try to wear it to a small gathering with family or close friends.   I also just try to keep in mind that nobody cares about what I am wearing as much as I do. Honestly, most people are too obsessed with thinking about themselves and if others are noticing their insecurities to spend more than a few seconds, if that, on a stranger. As long as you like your item, be confident in it and others will notice your confidence much more than the item.	episode_done:True

To put them to use, some of them are able to be used for layering so I try to make it a little more classy if I decide to wear it out. Usually, if I see something I like that'd be perfect for going out, I'd consider how versatile the piece might be and whether or not I could dress it up or down.  Once quarantine is over, I'm breaking out all my fancy/going out clothes and dressing myself to the 10s!	episode_done:True

text:That’s a really good point, but could you elaborate on what makes a dress appropriate for certain seasons, other than temperature considerations? I wear jeans and t-shirts all year long, so I’m very ignorant in this whole area.	labels:To me, a winter dress either has long sleeves or is worn with a blazer/jacket to cover up short sleeves. Winter dresses are either long (past the knee) or if it is short, is worn with dark colored stockings/nylons/leggings. Winter dresses are typically darker colors- blacks, browns, dark green, navy, burgundy, etc.  A summer dress is usually lighter in fabric and lighter in color- whites, yellows, periwinkle, taupe, etc. A summer dress can be long- but if it’s long than the top should be short sleeved or tank top/halter etc so you don’t overheat.	episode_done:True

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:kind of all of them? It seems like you have to pay pretty steep prices now to get the quality of clothes that mid-price mall brands had in the 1990s and early 2000s. It seems that most stores have switched to a model of selling poor quality pieces at huge markups with the expectation that they will sell most of the stock at clearance prices. The GAP used to have quality staples, and J Crew was "fancy." Now GAP is really the same quality as Old Navy, and don't know what J Crew is anymore. The quality has certainly dropped, but I also don't get what is up with the designs since you can't even get a reasonable women's suit there these days. Madewell is not made well. Anthropologie used to sell unique pieces with really good construction, now it's roughly the same as other fast fashion, though I do appreciate that they added petite and plus sizing and carry some high end brands too. Levi's main line is terrible now, and to get the heritage quality, you need to get the Made and Crafted line, which is really expensive!  I mostly shop secondhand because I can't afford the stuff I like. When buying new, I try to wait for sales and avoid buying anything "final sale" or with complicated returns unless I know it will work. Clothes that I used to get at Anthropologie, I now get from Sezane, Ulla Johnson, Doen, and Samantha Pleet. I started buying vintage jeans over Madewell/Levi's or expensive craft brands—my 1980s Chic and Gitano jeans were probably sold at K-Mart/Target but are better quality than anything I have gotten from Madewell. I don't wear jeans/denim enough to justify craft denim prices. Patagonia is still very high quality technical wear; I just scope out the Tyler sport outlet and secondhand for deals. Shoes are hard because I don't like to get them secondhand. I switched from Adidas to Veja and Diemme for sneakers (you can find Diemme shoes for huge markdowns on Yoox during the winter and summer sales—I don't think they are worth retail price).

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Addressing the body change: I too gained a decent amount of weight in my mid twenties due to getting an office job. One of the biggest breakthroughs I had in terms of my style was accepting my new body/silhouette and figuring out what cuts work for my new body. With that extra weight, I ended up loving the way I looked in long, dark pencil skirts paired with a tucked in top. Additionally, I stopped caring about the number or the size of the garment. Sometimes I needed a size M, sometimes I needed a size XL. Once I got over that mental hurdle, shopping was so much easier.   &#x200B;  Addressing the lifestyle change: Not sure if this is the advice you wanted to hear, but this is what worked for me. My younger self's style was not office appropriate at all. I was into short sundresses and plunging necklines. My big "ah-hah" moment was realizing that I can have two styles. At work, I'm a walking advertisement for J.Crew and I feel so confident. Outside of work, I'm in a short dress and high heels. The trick for me was realizing that my body can pull off different silhouettes depending on the style. I enjoy form fitting outfits in my office wardrobe. Conversely, I enjoy flowy outfits in my non-office wardrobe.

text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:Whoa... I am an adult woman with ADHD and I never thought about this somehow. I have MAJOR issues with restrictive clothing. Winter coats feel like a straitjacket, turtlenecks \*literally\* made me vomit when I was younger, and anything that's even slightly itchy or makes a weird noise (like a swishy windbreaker) drives me insane. I can't wear bracelets or watches because the sound of them clicking on my desk grates against my soul.  I usually live in American Eagle jeggings (soft joggers as soon as I get home), comfortable shirts, soft and loose sweaters/cardigans, comfortable ankle boots/Converse, and sometimes a well-fitting skirt with tights.  Interestingly, I have no issue with wearing tights, which I know a lot of women find uncomfortable. I don't mind wearing a bra, either.

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:In my experience, lower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose) and spending more tends to lead to a more noticeable improvement in quality up to a certain point. That's painting with a broad brush though... leather dress shoes and boots scale much better than sneakers or sandals, where mid-range options are going to be good enough for most people.  T-shirts, dress shirts, denim, and accessories in low-to-mid-range are generally good enough from a quality perspective IMO and I've only really paid more in those categories for a design I like rather than because I think I'm getting something higher quality. There's nothing wrong IMO with buying something because you like the way it looks even if a similar quality alternative exists at a lower price, but that's harder to do if you're shopping on a budget.  I'll also add that for all of the above, your dollar goes a lot farther if you're willing to shop used. Sites like Ebay, Grailed, reddit/styleforum B/S/T threads, etc. have made it a lot easier to buy preowned clothes without having to set foot into a thrift store.  TL;DR When shopping on a budget I'd focus first on having a high quality pair of shoes and jacket. Consider buying used clothes to stretch your budget further.
text:Which color palette do you hate wearing?	labels:All the fucking beige and oatmeal shades that have plagued fashion in the last decade. So ready for something with a little more life to it.
text:Engineered Garments.  I really like their stuff, but I'm just too deep in the rabbit hole of my own Ivy/basic bastard style amalgam to try to incorporate an EG vibe too.

I suppose I could dip my toe in with Universal Works, but it's hard to care right now when the only time I leave the house is to get groceries once a week.	labels:Man ivy is ripe for EG integration, just swap out a blazer for a before and you're there	episode_done:True

text:It’s 2021. A vaccine for the virus has been made widely available and businesses may operate at full capacity, including bars, clubs, salons, etc. How will this influence fashion?	labels:People will go ALL OUT. This sub usually salivates at the thought of athleisure taking over and killing fashion (and fast fashion) but that 100% wouldn't happen. Almost every woman I know is bloody sick and tired of not getting to dress up, not being able to wear lipstick, not having places to wear heels and vacation outfits. People would literally go crazy and it truly would be the roaring twenties. Dresses of all types, miniskirts, sparkle and glitter, heels for days, fun fabrics, bolder colors, leather pants, blouses with impractical sleeves, statement earrings – women would really be dressing to the nines *and* wearing bold lipstick colors to compliment.

Incidentally, the leggings were  Along Fit High Waist with Pockets from Amazon and they are awesome. Good fit.  Stay up.  Comfy with just enough compression.

text:How many pairs of jeans and pairs of shoes should you own?	labels:Women can have things they enjoy having without being concern trolled about how much they really need it.   I don't see men getting hassled for the amount of electronic waste their hobbies produce.   I doubt every fifth post in the Funko Pop subreddit is about curbing consumption and how they should be rethinking their involvement in a plastics based interest.   Personally, I think they're wasteful as shit, but I'm not about to roll up into their space and shame them for it.  I'm so over the handwringing, guilt, and joylessness about fashion in this sub sometimes.
text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I wear a lot of stuff from Rickis, RW&Co, and INC International Concepts. It's all fairly inexpensive, holds up well, and is machine washable.  "Dry clean only" is almost always a lie though. Clothing manufacturers are required to put care instructions on garments, dry clean only is an easy way for them to avoid responsibility if the garment gets fucked up while being cleaned.   Almost everything with a dry clean only label can be put in the washing machine in a mesh bag. If something seems really delicate (sequins, glitter, delicate mesh) then you can almost certainly hand wash it. Just avoid heat and you should be fine. At this point the only things I would dry clean would be items with sculptural/3d elements that would break down if they got wet.  I thrift most of my clothing, so I'm really daring about putting things in the wash, because if it gets wrecked I'm probably not losing more than $10. I've put dozens of dry clean only items in the washing machine and I don't remember the last time I wrecked something by doing so.	episode_done:True

text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I used to wear small diamond earrings every day, and would put them in my wallet when I went to the gym after work. I got to work the next day and realized I forgot to put them back in after the gym, so I opened up my wallet and they were gone. I had made my usual morning stop for breakfast on the way to work, so I rushed to the food cart and looked all over the sidewalk but I couldn’t find them.  At least 1-2 weeks later I went to the same food cart for breakfast, looked down, and saw one diamond earring in the crack in the sidewalk. I looked more closely and there was the other one! The metal was chewed up (they were bezel set) so I had to get them repaired, but it was a lot cheaper than a new pair!   Definitely my #1 fashion (jewelry?) miracle.

For example, if I am going to be indoors for a duration of time (longer than average grocery trip) I will sometimes take a winter hat off because it'll get too warm to keep it on, or if it is out of place indoors for a long duration. Wear the cloche out! Hats are a great and super easy accessory to up level a look and make items into an outfit.	episode_done:True

text:Dressing for “housework” vs “working from my house”	labels:Embrace the apron!  I know it sounds twee and cottage core but a good apron allows me to do housework and cooking while protecting the clothes I wear. I prefer a pinafore style for freedom of movement and ease of putting on and off.
text:Good quality men's jeans?	labels:Just wanted to reply that I'm a raw denim guy, but a lot of people are going to throw out raw denim recommendations to you.  One thing to be wary of.  Raw denim is unforgiving, so in the slimmer cuts I have found them **MORE** likely to have crotch blowouts than other jeans.    I've never had issues with crotch blowouts in your standard levis/gap/j. crew brands.  My first 2 pairs of raw denim had crotch blowouts, because I wore slim fits, and the point of tension is in the crotch.  My 21.5 oz and 16 oz raws had holes forming within 6 months.  I've since bought a pair of Samurai's in a straight cut and they seem as if they will last forever, but they are NOT slim.

text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:Athleta’s Salutation legging in 7/8 length! I don’t like any more compressive feeling leggings, but lululemon Aligns are also a bit too soft and non-supportive feeling; the Powervita fabric on these is soft but also hugs so better for the ass lol. Also, I don’t like leggings that cover my ankles, and the 7/8 length is just right, though they also have full length. Also good if you want mid and high rise and pocket/no pocket options.   Someone else commented about Athleta’s Elation legging, and I’m not sure what the difference is between these two styles, but they’re both made out of Powervita fabric.	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: Ghost Outfit	labels:Humiliation in life. Humiliation in death.  I've died wearing the too-large, white-but-actually-gray-at-this-point, ratty bathrobe given to me by my ex over a decade ago. I haven't had a haircut in almost 2 years and I'm not even wearing socks.   The worst part is that I spilled coffee on myself, so now I have a coffee stain on my chest for all of eternity.  I think it's safe to assume that I died from falling down the stairs or some shit after spilling coffee all over myself. I'm going to haunt the path outside my house because when the wind blows really hard, it actually howls down the path and it's spooky AF. I think I need all the help I can get, give the whole bathrobe situation. Though my coffee stain MIGHT pass for blood, so that's cool.  People aren't creative at all, so I'm probably going to get called something stupid like Bathrobe Witch. Or like, The Ghost of... Well I'm not actually going to put the name of the path because I don't want someone to find out where I live and make me actually dead.

text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I think they can work as long as you consider how they fit with your outfit and the colour palette.  A coworker wore a lovely green scarf tied loosely around her ponytail once and the rest of her outfit was grey/black and simple. It looked great. Had she worn a bright blue dress and bright red lipstick with it, maybe not, at least in a professional environment.  Some women get away with dressing a bit eccentric, but I’d say they’re almost always in a senior role, near retiring or very young. I say ‘get away with’ because we technically have no dress code, aside from something really inappropriate.  Intend to stick to neutrals and darker colours. I have a few plain tops in bright colours, but I always pair them with very simple and plain items. It’s not that dislike them, but they require more thought!	episode_done:True

text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:Try on lots of stuff.  Pull all the clothes out of your closet and just start pairing things up and modeling the looks in the mirror.  As a teenager, I used to read magazines like Vogue and Glamour, even the trashy tabloid magazines like Us and People, and try to replicate outfits I thought were cool with the clothes I had.  I did the same thing with Pinterest when that came along and now I do it with Instagram.

text:Is Chanel going to be better off without Karl?	labels:Not as exclusive? They rose their prices by 20% this year lol.
text:> I think the pandemic and bankruptcies you mentioned may push that trend further, but it was already on its way.  I actually wonder if the opposite will happen. After a year of sitting at home wearing sweatpants every day of the week people might be in the mood to dress up again and suiting could see a revival... maybe with more casual details to ease the transition? Unlined jackets, drawstring pants, patch pockets, stretch blend fabrics.	labels:That’s a possibility for sure, but I think only for a small group who really enjoys tailored clothing; I feel like the vast majority of guys really just see that sort of clothing as a burden. That said, I myself have been fleshing out my formalwear closet a lot since the pandemic started, so I hope to put it to use once I can :)	episode_done:True

Otherwise, I would highly suggest getting the size as close to you as possible and consider getting it tailored--especially if you intend to get a nice coat that lasts a long time.

You might catch yourself setting certain outfits aside, and those are key moments to train yourself to look out for. When you find yourself doing it, make a choice. Some days you may simply wish to be comfortable, no shame. But it may also be important to recognize it makes you feel uncomfortable for now, and then do it anyway.

text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:I dunno, I have no problem looking ‘overdressed’.

text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:I know that social media can subconsciously influence the way we perceive ourselves and the world around us. Perhaps try taking a little break/limit time from exposure to social media? It might change the way you dress. Also, I find that educating myself about the world of fashion has really opened my eyes to all the possible things that one can wear, so maybe try reading up on some fashion history/watching educational videos to hopefully gain a deeper appreciation for garments? But honestly, the "real you" should be the you that you feel most comfortable and happiest in. Good luck!	episode_done:True

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items are my Native American Turquoise jewelry and my cowboy boots. Just purchased a huge $900 squash blossom necklace and have worn it constantly. My boots range from $30 for a secondhand pair to $750 for custom made and none are worn more or less than the others.  When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was “saving for good”. Ironically, “good” apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I’m just out running errands.
text:Agreed! I like to buy from a few local resale shops in my area that are women-owned. Therefore supporting women, my local community, and much more eco friendly than buying new. Try finding ways to support women of color’s businesses, especially!   Instagram resale is big now, too. This can support individual women rather than companies, and again is more environmentally conscious.	labels:depop could be a good bet if you like the social resales.	episode_done:True

text:does anyone else struggle with this pattern? if so, how do you FIX?!	labels:Idk if this applies but don't build your outfits/wardrobe around current trends (i.e. everything galaxy not so long ago). They go out of style quickly and leave you with regrets.  Usually a basic/timeless base with a one or two trendy pieces shouldn't leave you embarrassed two years from now	episode_done:True
text:Effortless style - let's exchange tips and tricks	labels:I think it's very reliant on finding the right colors and cuts and even fabrics for your body and vibe you give off (style aside), so it's very individual. I believe for every person there's a style that can make them look effortlessly stylish, but some people will simply never look effortless in exact outfits they see as looking effortless on someone else, if that makes sense?	episode_done:True

text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:Honestly I think you have to give way more detail on your old pair and what you’re looking for.  In my mind the biggest hurdle to perfect jeans is the fit, and since every body is different this is highly individual. Some people might prefer stretchier denim for a more forgiving fit, while others look for stiffer fabric, and have less leeway.   Personally I still struggle to find a high rise, non cropped, fits my thighs and waist, plain dark wash, straight/skinny, 90% or more cotton, pair of jeans. But hopefully I’ll find it eventually!

text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I too am bored to death of the French classic look, the Tik Tok youth trends, the Everlane normcore.   Someone recently recommended Amy Smilovic of TIbi here and I’ve gone in deep, haven’t felt this inspired in a long time.   On her + Tibi’s Instagram she espouses what she calls the “Creative pragmatic” look and articulates nicely many things, like what makes clothing “stuff or style”, does a lot of bolder silhouettes that somehow still work for everyday and uses styling to bring out personality.   Frankly, I haven’t seen anyone be so clear on why sometimes you buy an item you love that feels stylish but as soon as you use it in your daily life it just feels off or not as impactful.   It’s also been helpful for me to see for once how pieces are worn on actual people and not just models. For the first time it’s like I can see where these higher end looks could translate into real life.	episode_done:True

I add everything to a list, and wait until Amazon's algorithms decide they need to sell it for $6. They also offer Tall sizes on quite a lot of items, which is great for having sleeves that fit.  Uniqlo for jeans, Amazon's Peak Velocity brand for Tshirts, and Goodthreads for everything else is what I would do if I had to start from Scratch.  If there's a certain type of item your looking for, feel free to ask for recommendations and I can send you a link to what I'd look at.

text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:It seems the current census is that no brand can be trusted to keep a high quality, and 30+ year old vintage is the only way.  Brands might be lauded for their quality/price for a few years until the constant push for higher profit every year makes them produce the same disappointing clothes as all other dying mid-range brands.  I never really see quality as a selling point for clothes anymore. It might be hidden in some company statement with promises of green washing. But all brands want you to come back the next season, not encourage you to buy and use something for *years*.	episode_done:True

text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I am a teacher that went back to working in the building at the beginning of September, so to be fair I was only wfh for several months in the spring, but it still drastically changed my style, or my perspective on my style.   Pre-Covid my work style (and general style) had morphed over the years to become very, very minimal and neutral. Lots of Everlane and Eileen Fisher. This was both because I wanted to be taken seriously at my job (I read very young) and because it also seemed like what was in style to me.   Returning to work in the fall, I realized I really f*cking hated all of my sensible, plain, go with everything black and grey clothes.   I still really prefer earth tones and blacks and greys, and I still wear some pretty simple outfits somedays, but I went on a small spree on The RealReal after I had my realization. I bought myself some louder statement pieces that feel more me, including an embroidered Happy Sheep sweater, a knit Missoni sheath dress, a multi-colored leather and fur purse, platform oxfords, and a couple of geometric patterned silk shirts and dresses.   For me life is too short to try so hard to be timeless and professional. I’m not knocking the look, it just isn’t ~me~ I want to love the clothes I wear and the clothes I love are fun knits and patterns.

I went through a phase at like 28 where I felt like I had to have this "timeless capsule adult lady wardrobe" and changed my whole style to fit into a societal expectation of what a 30 year olds style should be. I was BORED, uninspired, and honestly spent money on stuff I hated. Now I just wear whatever I think looks fun and inspires me and yes that includes gen Z jeans lol. Fashion isn't supposed to make you feel sad and life is short. Wear the damn crop top.

text:General Discussion - December 28, 2020	labels:Really thick into quarantine and realized I don't really have anyone to talk about fashion with anymore. It's kind of a bummer being excited about clothes and not being able to talk about it. Makes me actually want to start posting pics on WAYWT.   Been slowly replacing my closet with a lot of Todd Snyder and don't know how to feel about it lol, always wanted a "cool designer" closet but from a cost and functionality stand point it's not very doable. Good staples just get more wear in my closet, got to pick up more stand out pieces so I don't feel boring!
text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:I don't think I've ever tried anything extra expensive on just for the hell of it, but just feeling the fabric on a piece of clothing is so revealing. There's cashmere and then there's the *softest* cashmere imaginable. There are coats, but then there are well-constructed, high quality coats. Of course there are occasional duds, but for the most part there's a clear difference in every detail - not just the label.  As for durability, I think there you might run into some differences depending on what's currently trending.	episode_done:True

text:Are jean shorts on men really that bad?	labels:Broken-in above-the-knee cutoffs are the way to go. I would ever wear them myself, but it can be a badass punk or retro 80s casual look.   I’m really not a fan of clean-cut denim shorts. Thigh-hugger denim shorts seem to be getting increasingly popular though I’ve never thought they look cool—we get it, you go to the gym. Don’t wear below-the-knee baggy denim shorts unless you’re pairing them with timbs in a 90s rap video.	episode_done:True
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Nothing that needs to be dry cleaned except winter coats. Hate the smell, hate the bother, hate the expense.  No glitter, no metallic thread. I like it on other people, but on me it makes me feel like I’m wearing a costume. Sequins and paillettes only on formal evening wear (for me).  No dolman sleeves (for me). I don’t like how they look on my busty inverted triangle shape.

text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:Taking a picture or asking for a second opinion from someone who’s fashion sense you trust can help too! I’ll put on something that’s risky or different from my usual fits and think it looks awful. All I see is how it is too tight in the bust or emphasizes my waist, then I take it off and move back to safer ground.   My husband’s favorite dress on me... I was going to return it, when he saw me trying it on and told me to pick a restaurant. I still don’t love the dress on, but he swears it looks amazing on me. (And he does not shy away from expressing negative opinions).   I’m just saying, sometimes we see what we expect to see. And getting a second opinion is worth it, because that look might really “look right” on you. It just might not be what you are used to seeing.	episode_done:True
text:Brooks Brothers's Future Looks a Lot Like Menswear’s Past	labels:* Less SKUs. The amount of stuff BB sells is overwhelming.  * Do away with there weirdly named fit system. Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.
text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:I haven't worn jeans in over a decade, but i still do wear trousers.  When i buy them, i have to cut about 4" off the leg and hem them, so they aren't ludicrously long.  I save that fabric, and when the inner thighs get worn down i patch them from the inside.  The trousers i buy are already 2 layers on the seat and inner thigh, so once i'm down making the patch i carefully cut away the outer fabric layer that is fraying, exposing the 2nd layer with the patch all the way on the inside.    It's not perfect, but it gives me a couple years extra out of my work trousers.  The pair i have on now needs the patch installed, and i recall buying these 5 years ago.	episode_done:True

text:BOF Op-Ed: How Luxury Became Fast Fashion	labels:I agree with the article in the most of what added to the ‘exclusivity’ (besides the price point) if luxury brands has disappeared. I think it’s all still in the process of imploding though. These large fashion houses are all leveraging their names, which were built in times of higher exclusivity, to see diffusion lines, collaborations and perfume.   Between that and more and more designers trying to use the same trendy ideas, I’m not sure if the name recognition they have will last for much longer. I think we all know that luxury designers are shifting away from selling only luxury clothing/bags. But like if I’m going to get fast fashion quality, I’m gonna pay fast fashion prices.
text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I work in an office where "casual Fridays" are very casual. I'm currently wearing a yellow buffalo check Levi's shirt with jeans and sneakers. Sometimes I'm super casual (jeans and a plain t-shirt) or semi-dressy (last week I wore red kitten heels with a white pussycat bow shirt tucked into ankle length high waisted boyfriend jeans). I've also worn said boyfriend jeans with a lavender terry cloth cropped Nike sweatshirt over a white button down and brown ankle booties. Basically I wear anything I own that I can't wear to work Mon-Thurs. It's my favourite day to style because I can take some fashion risks and I love to style super casual with dressier pieces!	episode_done:True

text:For those who define their style as "classic-traditional" (tailored, fitted, matching, sleek), what are your typical outfits for work, on the weekends, date-night, running errands or lounging around?	labels:For work at this point I’ll throw a white button down over some yoga pants, it looks good enough for zoom and isn’t bad overall. White button-downs are basically a personal staple at this point. For running errands or running around I’ll do a fitted white oxford button down with high waisted linen pants or something A-line, with a leather handbag or backpack, or a tan tote. Maybe a long coat/trench coat if it’s cold or raining. For lounging around I’ll probably wear a cardigan, sweater layered on a button down, or something else cozy. I’ve gotten a lot of inspiration from Pinterest and the “dark academia” aesthetic :)	episode_done:True

text:Help needed for buying jeans online! All advice is welcome!	labels:I finally bought a pair of 501s from the Levi's site.  After hours of scouring size charts and online fit testimonials, I *still* wasn't sure about size/inseam. So, on a day with a good sale, I actually bought SIX PAIRS and returned five of them. I regret nothing! If you have the disposable income to pay up front and wait for the refund to be processed, I highly suggest getting all your options so you aren't left wondering if you really have the right size or ordering another pair to try on.    Edit: as /u/fartymcfly22 pointed out, you might want to check that the company doesn't just throw away their returns before ordering duplicates like this!

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:My new year's resolution is to only buy (at most) one new piece of clothing per month. I have a pretty well-stocked closet, but I also don't love most of my clothes. I did too much stress shopping because of Covid, and spent more money than I needed to on mostly cheaper clothes, and I made this resolution to help change my mindset about shopping.  With my resolution, I'm not even looking at outlets of other cheaper stores. Yes, it is still hard to stomach spending more money on clothes, but after I've had an item in my cart for a couple days and feel certain that it's the one new thing I want to get for the month, it has been easier for me. It  has also forced me to be much more thoughtful about what I need. We'll see how the rest of the year goes!  I think that thrifting can (obviously) be great, but it can be a lot easier to buy things that you don't love because they are great pieces that just don't work for you.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:Am I the only one that doesn't see how the Teddy jacket would give off peaked in high school lettermen jacket vibes like all the lurkers that were clearly bullied by jocks are claiming?  Obviously it's inspired by letterman jackets, but removing the contrasting leather sleeves and not having a TGI Friday's wall's worth of shit stitched onto it completely changes the vibe. I don't know, maybe I just associate it more with rockstar because it's an SLP piece and Alex Turner was the first celebrity I saw a photo of wearing it.
text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:If I picture my mom's typical winter outfit it was a sweater with snakes wearing sombreros and margaritas embroidered on it, a burgundy "sweater jacket" with fringe, and a pink/orange/green bucket purse.*  So I guess she taught me "fuck it, wear what you want", but it did take me a while to adopt that attitude.   *tbf, this was a look for moms in the 90s

text:No (New) Jawnz January: 2021 Edition	labels:When I'm really hyped up over a new garment I just found online, I ask myself this armor-piercing question: *Do I already own this?*  It forces me to shift gears out of hype mode and take a mental stock of my wardrobe. While I may not own an exact copy of the garment I'm considering buying, I probably own a piece that fulfills the same purpose already (with regards to utility or aesthetics), and if the comparison is too close with the new item then I know I should wait a week and see if I still feel the same attraction to it. In most cases this allows the glamour of novelty to fade, and I've saved myself money and a potential redundancy in my closet. It's helped me a lot over the years.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:<rant>  If I said "Wear cropped jackets so you look taller" I'd be laughed out of the room but somehow "Short people shouldn't wear long coats" is a valid thing?   Also what's defined as short? If someone is 5'7" do they get to wear long coats? What if they're 5'7.5"??  It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering". If you care so much about these gender norms, masculinity and being ~ flattering ~ then sack up and wear the clothes you like.   That whole thread is just people saying that someone else told them they couldn't *wear a coat* so what should they do? Oh idk. How about tell them to fuck off and wear the damn coat.  </rant>

I also just bought Jen7 by Seven --a straight ankle length & I really like them.  I buy most of my jeans at Nordstrom Rack or Bloomingdales on Sale.

Another comment mentioned that she apparently uses "five fashion personalities".  If you watched her YouTube channel, would you say her course goes a lot deeper than it, or can you basically get the idea from watching her YouTube?	labels:Hi, sorry for super late reply!  I didn't really felt like the fashion personnalities were too rigid, but she uses seasons to describe different kind of people and what color scheme looks good on them.  While it's not super rigid and she does mention it's just an advice, I ended up not wanting to wear some clothes I loved just because of it. I'm also not sure I agree with the classification. For exemple, I think I'm supposed to be a Winter type (cold, bright colors), but I find that a dark orange looks ok on me. Maybe I got my type wrong though !  I think it gets more in-depth than her YouTube videos, but the fashion advice she gives can all be found somewhere else online. It's just handier and she is very clear in her explanations, which is nice. There is also a very helpful community.  I hope this helps :)	episode_done:True

text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:I used to work in an environment that was super casual. Because we had no dealings with the public, we could wear hoodies and sweatpants to work if we wanted to. I just wore whatever I wanted to. Some days that was jeans and a comfy shirt, other days it was heeled booties with a dressy blouse and vest. The only thing I kept in mind was what job I'd be doing that day. I floated around different departments, so I'd dress nicer on days I'd be mostly sitting, and I dressed more casual on days I'd be doing hard work in the shipping area. Other than that, I dressed however I wanted. I didn't mind standing out because I was dressed better than everyone else. I was also the youngest person there (I was 19, looking more like 14) so I figured people were already judging me for that, so might as well add judging me for dressing way better than they did in there. I did a good job and my work spoke for itself, so I didn't notice any real negative effects from my fashion choices. A few grumpy people probably thought I was some bougie millennial, but they were so miserable I'm sure they hate everything anyway.  &#x200B;  Edit: I also want to add that I agree with everyone else that crop tops are never appropriate for the office, no matter how casual the environment is.	episode_done:True

text:For 1. What pants do you recommend for people who are thin but carry a bit more weight in the core (stomach and butt) instead of their legs and thighs.	labels:It’s hard to say. Even for people who put on weight in the core does it go “out” or “sideways”? Everybody’s body is so different. It’s hard to tell what looks good without trying on different things but usually people are a pretty good judge of what “works” once they find it! Just keep an open mind and be willing to take stuff into a dressing room. A big butt or rounded stomach/hips can be sexy! If you are looking to “hide” something however a good trick is to split it up -ie. layering or accessorizing with a belt, jacket, longer necklace etc.	episode_done:True
text:I think we'll have to agree to disagree. My memory is hazy on this, but I think she did try to start a company of her own or something, because she was so spiteful of how the studio controlled her. She tried to get better deals, because she was at times the actress who made the studio the most money, but was paid very little in relation to that. And she was incredibly passive-aggressive in meeting the studio's demands. You may be right that she handled it in a very naive and not very business-savvy way - but I definitely remember that she did fight for her rights a lot, but was met with resistance time and time again, from people who were more powerful than her. So maybe you're right that she was dumb, but she wasn't passive or unaware.   I think most women who do "cool girl" in real life are definitely very often misgoynist in some way. However, actresses today have to play the same game, and I think they do know. Like how almost every single actress who is interviewed on the matter of body image and dieting, claims to eat fries and pizza and stuff and is just so Naturally Skinny, and therefore not like those Other Girls.   Famous women have to meet strict standards, but they have to pretend that they do so completely by accident. Otherwise, they are punished for being attention seeking or self absorbed. Women should be admired as beautiful objects, but they can't ever try to achieve that on their own - that would be too active, direct, greedy. They have to be completely passive. Approval is something to be granted by others, though no effort of their own.	labels:	episode_done:True

I'm petit enough to fit into Zara's kids stuff and this trench was like half the price of a very similar looking women's trench (also Zara). It's very versatile, my cost per wear is \~$1.50  I have some pieces that I bought off Taobao (black pleated mini skirt, my only pair of denim shorts, a white short sleeve blouse, and a lavender knit top) that's also around the $1.00 per wear.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:I'm Indian and gold jewelry is huge for us, so I have a lot of it that I've gotten over the years from family. When I got married everyone gifted a few pieces too.   I can't speak my native tongue fluently and I don't feel comfortable shopping in India, so online Indian jewelers have been a godsend. The styles aren't as trendy as the stuff you find in American stores but there are a lot of simple, everyday styles if you are willing to sort through the inventory. They ship directly from India (so longer shipping time) and are cheaper because Indians do gold pricing by weight and not design.  I used to not buy gold for myself because it always felt so frivolous...but a while ago I saw a comment on this sub by a woman who said she bought nice jewelry to celebrate life events/achievements and idk why, but it really stuck with me so I've started doing the same.

text:Inspo Album: Vintage Wool Sweaters Need Good, Loving Homes	labels:Awesome that they are still around. A testament to the durability and quality of real wool. I’m 75, so this kind of sweater was all we had to stay warm in the winter when we were young. I knitted quite a few as well. When Polar Fleece became available the woolies were less used. However I still appreciate the warmth of a real 100% cashmere or the feel of an Icelandic cardigan knitted in the natural colors . As a knitter I love to see the hard work in a wool garment and the lovely colors that you can find in the older handmade sweaters. They need some care(laundering by hand and blocking to keep their shape, air drying) store away from bugs in the off season ( mothballs!) and kept folded on a shelf or in a drawer not on hangers when in active use. You’ll also find wonderful interesting buttons on the vintage (yikes that’s my childhood years!) items. Lovely sweaters that deserve to be enjoyed by a new generation ❤️ Buying vintage? Look for stains, moth holes, odd shape from improper laundering, missing buttons. These are major faults.

text:General Discussion - November 27, 2020	labels:Hot take: speaking from experience, fetishistically optimizing the most basic of basics (e.g. "the best plain white t-shirt") for maximum imagined value is not a meaningful nor worthwhile exercise. Your wardrobe is not more interesting because your white tee is better than another white tee, and by the time you've found the 'perfect' piece either the prevailing trend or your own preferences will probably have changed.  'Perfect tee' threads are usually highly-upvoted, but the answers have drawn from the same pool for the last goddamn decade:  - *Vintage/workwear (generally heavier, boxier, shorter):* 3sixteen, Buzz Rickson's, Lady White Co. - *Streetwear (generally lighter, slimmer, longer):* Reigning Champ, wings + horns, John Elliott - *"Normal" (somewhere in the middle)*: Naked & Famous, Arket, American Apparel when they still existed - *Edgy goth shit:* Rick Owens mainline for lighter and DRKSHDW for heavier, Kazuyuki Kumagai Attachment, Voidthebrand when they still existed - *Budget*: Muji, Uniqlo, Everlane, Bella+Canvas, etc., but no one really cares  It's functionally a solved question. You can pick one from the applicable list for your style, and it'll be *fine.*

Most of the "Buy ____ instead" suggestions I read involve waiting for sales on factory seconds or things like the redwings that straight-up cost more money.  The version I got is basically a combat boot for a smart casual office dress code, and they are great for that. Quality-wise they're worlds better than the $100 boots that they replaced.  In your case (Colorado, snowy sidewalks, etc) I might lean towards one of the "rugged and resilient" leather options.  If you want a lug sole, they have 2 color options on the captain for that, and the Diplomat has a wedge sole and a moc toe instead of a cap toe.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:The company already made money off of the original purchase of the shirt, so you buying second hand doesn’t really benefit them in any way. If you really want the item, buying it second hand is probably the most ethical choice you can make. If someone asks where the piece is from, just say you don’t know so they won’t be tempted to buy from the brand lol
text:It’s fascinating that there was and still is a binary of “dressing for men” and “dressing for yourself [and other women]”. Which is a heteronormative and exclusionary way to put it, but I’m having trouble articulating everything. Both sides feel like they’re rebelling against the other, when for the most part people tend to participate in both. Both being, dressing for oneself and an audience that appreciates style without finding it sexually appealing and then the other side of dressing in part to be found sexually appealing by the group that you wish to attract. I agree that a lot of similar feelings towards what is considered “flattering” come up a lot here and it’s uncomfortable to try to get to the root of why that is.  I think a lot of her language doesn’t sit right with us because it’s assumed that every woman wishes to attract a man	labels:	episode_done:True

Thus my heart may be set on wool, but my skin is absolutely not, unless it's very fine cashmere or particular blends. 2) When autumn comes my immediate reaction is "WEAR ALL THE WOOL JUMPERS", and then I remember I live in the south of England and it doesn't actually get that cold here, plus it always rains.   Neither of those points are going to keep me from now spending several hours looking at vintage wool jumpers online though.

text:Yup - not just that. They have these "cosy" sweaters and they are amazing. It's the cheapest item of clothing I own (sub $10; got them on sale) but they look and feel (and so far have lasted) like things many times the price.

text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:I sniff test everything (except underwear, which is one wear/wash) and I just purchased a wool sweater for the first time and I was *so suspicious* of the care instructions telling me not to wash it lol. I scoured the whole internet looking for something to tell me that this information was fake and that my suspicions were correct. After an overwhelming amount of evidence telling me I would have wasted $100 if I don't listen to people smarter than me, I begrudgingly made a deal with myself to give airing out only a try and I would wash it if it so much as had a hint of a stink.  Four months later and the sweater is going strong! That'll show me. In hindsight it makes sense that wool is water and scent wicking, because sheep have it "on" all the time, it was just a big adjustment for me since I had never really had natural fiber clothes before.	episode_done:True

text:BOF Op-Ed: How Luxury Became Fast Fashion	labels:Luxury used to be expensive materials and construction.   But it's much more lucrative to sell "looks", "styles", and "trends". When they can't even sew on the buttons without threads sticking out of every hole, some too tight that I have to re-do myself.  I do believe that you can have luxury synthetics, but also that few brands use them. Even brands that go "ethical" and "timeless" in marketing avoid "quality" now. Because it's easy to prove quality. Using unprotected fluff-words and reputations made decades ago is much safer and can be used to inflate prices.  H&M collabs used to be amazing. I regret I didn't buy a wool jacket 5 years ago. It was a bit too expensive and heavy for me then. But the quality for price was GREAT. It did make me realize how shitty midrange clothing is.   Picking the right stuff from H&M will be better then brands that costs 5-10 times as much. It's really only the label that is different. And if H&M can't pay their worker much for that price, more expensive brands just doesn't. Why would they?  Does Amazon pay their workers more, or take out a larger profit? No one with the means of starting up international brands actually wants to offer a great product, made fairly, they want max profit. Greenwashing is great for profit, no need to prove anything, and keep selling shit that needs to be replaced after a few uses for premium prices.	episode_done:True

text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:Can I just ask why “as few pieces as possible” is the goal and not, say, “every piece in my wardrobe has a clear function or two, and sometimes that function is ‘because I feel like it’ or ‘because sequins make me happy?’”  A wardrobe you like is one that lets you be properly equipped for everything in your life and gives you a nice little aesthetic pick-me-up while you do it.   Before even shopping, I’d say: Look at your life. What do you do at work? What do you do in the community for volunteer work? How’s your social life? Are you outdoorsy? Do you have messy hobbies? Do your hobbies include going out to clubs and live shows and festivals? How often are you running meetings, speaking with elected officials, serving on committees? How often are you attending religious services, religious rites of passage, or big-deal family events like weddings?  Start with taking an inventory of your time and what you need your closet to do to help you be as prepared as possible for how you spend that time. Identify the holes in your working wardrobe, like “I need a good outfit for going to funerals” or “I need a warm weather first-day-at-the-new-job look.” Then you can settle questions of personal style, budget and what items fit more than one situation in your life.

text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:I think /u/Ghoticptox pretty much summed it up perfectly, nothing to really add. I personally have no interest in bespoke because I value design more than minuscule fit details, I think this sub has a tendency to overemphasize how important fit actually is, especially considering how nebulous of a concept “good fit” even is.  Like, the fit “issues” you highlighted,   >shoulder tiny bit broad in one coat, a little extra material in the waist of another.  Are complete non issues to me, that’s just variance in fit and design, I wouldn’t blink at that on a piece I otherwise really love.  The more important thing to me, and I can’t believe no one else has mentioned this yet, your friend got into clothing a couple months ago, he doesn’t even know what he likes, it sounds like, and I mean this judgement free, he’s just going around looking for the most expensive thing he can find, I don’t think we’d recommend anyone go and buy a $4000 coat right as they’re getting into fashion. Like, is he rich enough that he can afford to make that work or rich enough that it literally doesn’t matter? Because I think unless $4000 is something you can spend in a day and not blink itms probably not a good idea to go and drop $4000 and a true bespoke coat when he could end up getting into streetwear in 3 months and never wear it again. At least in that case something like YSL will retain value better and can be sold for more, as opposed to a lot of traditional tailoring brands, which go for pennies on the dollar on the used market	episode_done:True
text:For the parents of girls	labels:My daughter is two and while she loves helping dress me (I'll ask her what colour I should wear today and she'll have VERY firm opinions about that), she's still utterly indifferent to dressing herself and prefers to run around naked XD         I absolutely HATED how I was dressed as a kid (lots of home made clothes in my grandma's very questionable fabric choices... the clothes were cute, the fabric would be like orange and purple plaid or garish green and gold stripes (why grandma, WHY????), so I have a lot of name brand clothes for my daughter that I got second hand (gap, tommy Hilfiger, tea collection, persnickety, etc.) for like $2-5 a piece (FB marketplace is really good in my area - pre-covid, people would just invite you into their front hallways, drop bins of nearly new toddler and baby clothes in front of you, and then let you rifle through them and then charge you a flat price for each item you picked.  Found so much good stuff that way.)      I'm very much going to let her develop her own style and experiment from as early as she wants.  As long as she is weather appropriate, I plan on taking a supportive, hands off approach once she actually shows interest.    She has definite fit preferences now though (when I do dress her, leggings are a must - no jeans or wide legged pants).  She also hates long sleeves.	episode_done:True

text:I think it might matter a lot. Especially when buying online. The people setting the price knew what the item was worth approximately. If the item is crap you can only inflate the price so much. Even when you get into the whole brand markup.  There is a massive difference in quality for example in Nordstrom rack items that were made for the rack with a fake mark down vs the flagship store sale items. You can feel the difference in person but online how can you tell except a real mark-down?  I’m super interested in this topic OP. This is a good one.	labels:I think this is spot on, that there will be a difference in quality depending if it was made for outlets or boutiques. For stuff like leather goods (shoes and bags) and coats, there's a stark difference even if they're the same designer (ex: coach outlet vs coach, kate spade). I've been facing this same problem when trying to buy a purse myself and it's tough.	episode_done:True

What I’ve tried to do to try and get out of these habits are. 1. Try and post a “fit pic” once a week on Instagram where I’m wearing something different, might be the same vibe but it’s different. 2. Think of clothes as toys from toy story and I want them to be happy they’re being used. 3. If I like how one out fit looks, I’ll try to recreate that outfit with the other clothes I have. Ex. A white shirt and blue pants could mean a button up, long sleeve, short sleeve, or hoodie then different washes of jeans, slacks, different pant cuts.	episode_done:True

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:For the longest time (like 15 years), I hated all animal prints. I found them tacky, loud, cheap...the same connotations you had, basically. They had their moments in fashion now and then, but even when they were in fashion, I never came around to them. I think it may also partly be because someone I know growing up had a LOT of animal print in their wardrobe and house, and I became sick of it at a young age. Hatred of animal print was the one aesthetic feeling that stayed consistently with me for *years.* I was very accepting of most trends, but this is the one I could never bring myself to like – so I eventually shrugged and accepted the fact that I would always despise it.   AND THEN?????????? randomly a year ago, I suddenly found myself really liking leopard print, snakeskin, and croc skin (in small doses; I don't think I'll ever enjoy it on large pieces). They had come back into fashion, but unlike the previous times they'd cycled into fashion, this time I was suddenly feeling them? I really can't pinpoint why. It just happened. Maybe I saw some really cute outfits and ways to style it that I'd never really considered before. But either way, I bought pointy-toed leopard print pumps (with a really stunning dark golden velvet base!), leopard print slip-ons, croc skin slides, snakeskin sandals, and a snakeskin bucket bag. I thought these specific animal prints suddenly looked really cute as accessories!   So now I'm basically a-ok with leopard print, snakeskin, and croc skin. But I still really dislike zebra print for some strange reason. Not sure why this one still irritates me, and who knows, maybe one day I'll come to like this one too! But for now, zebra is a nope. And tiger print is horrendous and cheap to me.	episode_done:True

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:Hm, I wonder if the same thing is happening there as has happened to so many other business sectors since the start of the MBA boom.   * Company has a fine, high quality product  * Consumers buy it on reputation * MBA comes in, cuts costs and quality * Consumers continue to buy assuming quality is the same * Profit margins up massively, MBA takes the opportunity to leave on a high note * Consumers finally realize it's garbage and stop buying * MBA already gutting the next brand  It's been happening everywhere the last few decades.

text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:Right now, a lot of people's best intentions are devolving into "old lounge wear" because we haven't anywhere to go. Or when we have, it's running errands. Australia just got out of lockdown, I know Germany is going back in partially, the UK's going back in... and America is still a chaotic mess, but a lot of people are still working from home. So part of the answer may be "wait unti the world is different for you".
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 17, 2021	labels:Heya, I am updating my wardrobe to be a little more “clean” and  “modern” as I get a little older. Previously I have almost entirely shopped vintage/thrifted my wardrobe but it’s just gotten bloated and unfocused. That being said I don’t know a lot about clothing brands. Here’s what I’m looking for:  -Ideally US made, or at the very least ethically produced. I want to avoid exploitive fast-fashion. This was a big reason I previously only thrifted.   -Decent quality, I don’t have the money to buy super high-end but I am fine with paying a little more for something that will last.   -specifically looking for some solid color cardigans and button-ups, a sweater or hoodie or two, black chinos and black jeans, and some decent priced white tees. I found that I almost always wear black pants + white shirt + black/navy/olive/beige top. I’m pretty happy with that formula right now, just looking on ways to riff on it endlessly.   -Previously I have liked Everlane and Los Angeles Apparel, if that’s any kind of frame of reference.  Thanks for any help!
text:I actually hate my Ruggable. I love the design, but it is horrible for a house with dogs that shed a lot. The only way I’ve found to get hair out of the rug is to get down and scrape it with my hands. Since using the vacuum with the brush (which would normally loosen hair) separates it from the Velcro and causes it to wrinkle, it’s impossible. Also, the edges are always rolling up.   Ok, end rant!	labels:Try a designated floor hair brush	episode_done:True

text:I vividly remember wearing my too-long-baggy jeans on a rainy day, during a late night out with friends. They ripped all the way up to almost my knee. The next day I used a line of safety pins to hold that pant leg together and thought it was  socool because there were similar pants at Hot Topic.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:The only way to make it work is to sell items directly, preferably ones you’ve bought at bargain basement prices. eBay, Grailed, Vestiaire etc will absolutely destroy your margin with their cut. This means building an Instagram following, finding your way into niche communities, and spending hours photographing, pricing, and listing items. If having thirsty dudes slide into your DMs is worth an extra $100 to you, it can go a long way towards making you profitable.   Even then, if you’re not buying things with an eye towards flipping, it’s going to be slow and potentially not worth the time investment. I’m a big Rick collector, and what I buy for myself has little overlap with what has significant resale value. I make most of my extra money on arbitrage between markets and reselling unisex pieces to the significantly larger male audience. If I wanted to make a significant dent in my clothing budget with resale, it’d turn into a 15-20hr/wk endeavour. Spending that same effort on my actual job would generate a much larger return, and compound over time to boot🤷‍♀️	labels:The point about ROI on time spent doing this vs working is well made. I have a hunch that I would enjoy the process, but if not, it is certainly not worth it.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: Clay Jewelry?	labels:I really like clay jewelry, it’s fun. It’s an easy way to add a “spark” to an otherwise plain outfit. But I’m really rough and tend to break things so I don’t have any clay jewelry 😅	episode_done:True
