text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:I'm in a ambivalent state of mind right now. For a like over a year now I have been into streetwear. Baggy, oversized clothes with lots of prints and branding. This was my first period of taking clothing serious and feeling "fashionable". But one can only see so many of the "same" outfits.  I grew really tired of streetwear in the last couple of weeks but I'm scared to leave my comfort zone. I'm 20 years old but feel like dressing like a teenager. I really really like graphic tees if the prints are well done and If I would imagine dressing like lets say Tim Dessaint for example, who is not into graphics/"crazyness" at all, It would feel too "mature" for my age if that makes sense.  But at the very same time, I feel like im dressing too childish when wearing cargo pants + graphic tee.  Am I overthinking this?

text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:I feel like Abercrombie and Fitch has turned around! I love all the dresses I've bought from them - almost all have been lined and a lot of them have pockets! I'm so pleased.
text:Your AC bill has gotta be crazy.  I saw a SF post about climate change and how we might want to avoid heavy sweaters in the future.  Bah.	labels:Oh I don’t have AC.  I put them on at my house, wishing I was in the mountains so I could look cool wearing this particular fit, and then I take it off and put them back in my closet.
text:I've tried that but feel like the outfits are too much for a casual stop at the grocery store. Any tips on that?	labels:I look for ways they can be made more casual by focusing on the silhouettes or components. My Pinterest is full of wool trousers, delicate gauzy blouses, full skirts, and chunky sweaters. I probably wouldn't wear an outfit with all of those components to the grocery store, but I might wear mom jeans with a pretty blouse and Keds, or a more casual skirt with a chunky sweater and some flat ankle boots, for example.
text:Haha yeah - I will admit that there were a few periods where I was unable to wear them frequently. I have actually lost weight after purchasing them 5 years ago, and the relaxed fit probably reduced any chance for common crotch blowouts. Other than that, I just wear them like jeans. Wash them without much care, in the machine. The recent pairs from last year were to fill up some wardrobe holes.. a black pair, a super neppy pair, an interesting dye pattern, and one that was appropriate for sport coats & blazers.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Do you feel like your current clothing no longer represents how you want to be seen, or do you just feel a bit uninspired right now? The former is what pushes people to change styles; my current wardrobe has almost no traces of my previous interest in streetwear. The latter might mean you're feeling a bit stuck but still want to keep doing streetwear, in which case I would recommend looking at brands such as OAMC, Noah NY, Cav Empt, Fear of God, Awake NY, or Brain Dead, all of which are "streetwear" but are doing really cool things to present a distinct vision.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Streetwear From Above — Die, Workwear!	labels:> wide-boys   History really does repeat itself huh?   Edit: Interesting article. It’s definitely weird being conscious enough to watch stuff from artsy/DIY/underground scenes “trickle up” into being trends. Not trying to be too “I saw it before it was cool” or anything but it’s wild watching “skate fashion” get super popular and now thrift type stuff. That’s just how we dressed out of necessity, now everybody’s rocking the vans/adidas/converse with dickies and Carhartt stuff my homies and I would wear cause it didn’t tear so easily when skating/causing trouble. Anyways it’s late and I’m rambling and this article was thought provoking. Thanks.

text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:Congrats mate  I used to be obese as fuck like 35 BMI but now im at 20 BMI.  If you plan on keep losing weight, the key is to buy used clothes that fit slightly tight so that they start fitting better as you go on. You can minimize the cost doing that	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:I would get:  - a knee length/mid-calf black, brown, grey, or navy dress (good for anything and you can pair with colourful accessories for a wedding if you want)  - a flowy maxi dress (good for outdoor weddings in hot weather)  - a fun one that is still appropriate.   Avoid:  - excessive cleavage  - tacky rhinestones  - white dresses and anything close to white.  - completely red dresses   - black dresses can be a bit somber but I think can work if accessorized properly. Try to make sure it isn't too funeral-looking.   Things to keep in mind:  - at least one dress that covers your shoulders might be a good idea for any more traditional/conservative weddings.  - keep the length classy  - look for timeless styles, dresses you can wear in almost any decade and look good. Your fun one you can have fun with and have it be a trend that might not work 5 years from now.  - don't buy a dress you don't have the undergarments for/don't plan on buying undergarments for. Eg. Do you have massive boobs, and can't wear strapless bras? Don't get a strapless dress.

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:Give shoes a day break between wearings.  A shoe repair guy said that even with socks, shoes absorb a lot of moisture from our feet. He suggested going  at least day on day off with shoes to give them time to dry and regain their shape. Otherwise he said they stay in that moist, malleable state and get out of shape more quickly.  Anecdotally I’ve seen a major difference in the lifespan of my shoes.

text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:Play dress up and have fun! Honestly it may seem simple, but just trying it on, and especially taking pictures of outfits and saving them for later. I’ve got a whole album of outfit photos (thanks biweekly outfit threads lol) and it helped me narrow down things I liked and didn’t like, and where I wanted to go with my style.  Also, lots of looking at outfits in Pinterest and Instagram.   Another thing you could try are 30x30 or 10x10 challenges, and find new ways to wear the clothes that you have.	episode_done:True

text:Are there any actual fashion trends in 2020?	labels:we must be living on different planets.   lingerie as camisoles, fur trim everything, distressed tops, denim skirts, sweater vests, low rise pants, straight leg replacing skinny jeans, patchwork jeans, patterned tights, flared leggings, corset tops, fur lined boots, super tall platform shoes, juicy tracksuits, animal prints, tie dye, hand and leg warmers, fluffy bags, all were super popular trends last year. this has been the most trend heavy year in my memory, I could barely keep up.

text:What are your favorite straight leg jeans?	labels:Frame!	episode_done:True
text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:I regret buying boots too small. Make sure that when you try on boots wear the kind of thick warm socks you’re going to want to wear on cold days. I often even double up socks if I’m going to be walking around a lot and my current boots are a full size larger than my normal shoe size.   Also, other people have mentioned it, but a thermal base layer is a must, especially for your lower body. I don’t use my thermal tops that much, the upper body gets your sweaters and your coat, but if the only thing standing between the elements and your legs is jeans you’re gonna be COLD.	episode_done:True
text:Thank you so much for your insight I really appreciate it	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Thank all of you	labels:I'm so glad you were able to experience well-fitting shoes!  Allen Edmonds used to be the default recommendation back on MFA and GoodyearWelt, but they've fallen by the wayside in favour of places like Meermin which offer more absolute value.   One thing that I think people really don't take into account though is how vital AE's customer service is for someone just getting into good dress shoes – they're not going to have a good understanding of how a dress shoe should fit, and the staff at AE are really great at getting that across as well as finding the right size.  Once someone has gotten some experience, then they're more equipped to try better value brands with an online-only or foreign presence. But that initial guidance is critical and in my opinion, worth the "premium" that AE charges over Meermin
text:Over the summer I got beaten for trying to block cops from trampling someone they smashed on the side of the head. He was dazed and had an EMT trying to stop the bleeding and blood was pouring down the side of his head. For saying “he’s hurt” and putting my arms up I get my leg beaten by a baton and get thrown to the ground. When I can’t walk away fast enough cause of the bum leg I get hit just below my ribs. These assholes get to go into the capitol building with no repercussions whatsoever. Disgusting.   I mean uh, furniture yeah	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:Personally I try to avoid faux if possible. Real leather lasts longer, faux leather is just plastic and I find it cracks and/or scuffs usually within a couple years. Granted, I haven't bought any luxury faux leather so maybe that would last longer. Also on the sustainability side I feel like real leather is better (although I'm sure it depends on processing and where it comes from)
text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:Yeah, I shop a lot because I'm usually sad and it feels like new items will fix that somehow, or make people miraculously like me more. I'm aware that it doesn't work like that, but I love dressing up as a "new me" every day and I easily get bored... but that's just mental issues :/  With autism and me identifying as queer and all, I'm not exactly popular and there isn't one version of me I'd consider the real me, which makes it even more difficult. "The real me" fluctuates day by day, and so do my outfit preferences. I often buy things impulsively that I WILL love for quite some time, but never on two subsequent days, for example. I've been mocked for this, but I've still found I'm happiest like this, with my crazy big wardrobe and tons of different styles.
text:banesas	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:For me it came with age. In my teens and early 20s I wore the same sorts of things my friends did. By my mid 20s, a lot of my style was influenced by bloggers (just before the social media influencer era, when fashion blogs were at their peak).   But I eventually got used to spotting what looked good on me, what didn’t, what I actually liked the most and what suited my lifestyle.   I’m 30 in a few weeks and I don’t follow current trends. I wear the things that work for me.	episode_done:True

My morning routine includes changing, and on "weekends" (days my SO is off work) I wear house dresses or leggings, but the rest of the time I put real outside clothes on. I still spend time trying out new outfits, to keep it fresh since I'm not buying much right now. I'd encourage you to try it out, even if you don't have plans to leave the house! I joined a facebook group called "I'm high and this is what I'm wearing" and post there on days I feel the need to share my outfits but won't see anyone.	episode_done:True

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:I also feel like this holds true. I also don’t see a lot of effort from luxury brands as well to counter the fast fashion feel and perception. Less craftsmanship and no real effort concerning environmental effects or lowering their carbon footprint.   It’s a shame and I think the whole industry needs big change.

text:Your 2021 trend predictions?	labels:I think this years over the top escapism in the form of poofy sleeves, bows and other dramatic elements will continue into next year as we enter year 2 of the pandemic. Florals, feathers, sheer clothing, and colorful bold clothing will be more prevalent.

text:Dressing Drakes on a Budget	labels:Good write up on a good topic. I've specifically said that Drake's is visibly expensive before, a lot of these looks are hard to replicate for cheap... But you really have done a great job, at least with the simpler looks. Yes, styling and fit are huge factors.  And of course, materials are a big factor, particularly for their silk and shirting...   But the real magic in the brand is in specific details, color combos... The closer you can get to the exact color palette you're trying to imitate, the better. If you're looking at cord, don't just look at the cut and color -- think about the difference in wales per inch (IE the width of the cords), look at the buttoning method, and every detail you say you're not worried about, just know what you're sacrificing, because they have a real eye for detail.  (Or, do somewhat less work, and you'll still look pretty good, but details matter, that's all I'm really saying).	episode_done:True
text:The Style Blogger Index: finding people who are the same size as you	labels:It's really interesting how someone with my height, size and even shape can be so different from me. I am right now quite into the Kibbe body type system, so it's helpful to understand that someone with my size and even same waist/bust can have a completely body structure (for example I am frame dominant and am visually wider and my bones are blunt, while someone else may be flesh dominant and have a very rounded frame, or might have quite sharp long bones, or a juxtaposition of both). This can make the same item of clothing look so different on two people.	episode_done:True

I live in a country with soggy, slushy winters, and I finally broke down and bought a pair of Bean boots. What a game changer.   Also, having a variety of underwear is very nice. I went back and forth from boxer trunks and boxer briefs my entire life. It didn’t occur to me until a few years ago: why not have both? I have different fits for my trousers, why not have a choice of underwear to match?	episode_done:True
text:How do you feel about vegan/faux leather?	labels:I am a vegetarian and use cruelty free makeup and household products, but avoid plastic “leather.” It’s rare that it looks anything but very fake and it’s terrible for the environment. I have leather bags that will last me 10 years and may get that out of a good tough canvas bag but pleather will look like shit quickly. I’d rather buy 1 than a dozen.	episode_done:True
text:Honestly, I don't know. I went to the mall a couple weeks ago and was let down by most of the sweaters I saw. It's the same thing you observed... Everything felt flimsy. For reference, I stopped in Target, Macy's, Banana Republic, Nordstrom's and Bloomingdales. Bloomingdales/Nordstrom's had some stuff I would consider, but the prices were commensurate with high-end brands, so ~$150-200 for jumpers and turtlenecks.  Edit: Correcting myself here... $150-200 is more like mid-tier all things considered.	labels:I know what you mean. A lot of the sweaters I’ve been trying these days feel more like “dress” sweaters than everyday wear. And yeah I certainly wouldn’t pay full price for any of those upper-mid tier brands. On sale they are good value but otherwise I’m not so sure.	episode_done:True

Today I ruined my last good pair of chinos. Anyone know a brand that could work for me without the need for fitting? I like chinos and a slim, fitted look. Many ”athletic fit” pants look like shit since there is to much fabric around the calfs and foot.	episode_done:True
text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:As someone who dresses like an absolute nut job I have learned that generally speaking as long as your outfit is overall appropriate for the situation, you can get away with murder. Like I wouldn't wear a sequined micro mini or ballgown to my office job, but I would absolutely wear a velvet suit and a bunch of brooches. I have also noticed that when I wear pieces that I love, my confidence increases throughout the day. Sometimes I have moments in the day where I look down and think "dang, this outfit is cool and I feel cool!" Those moments just give me a boost of confidence all on their own. The last thing is that people are generally too busy with their own lives to notice what you're wearing. They're doing them, so do you and have fun with it!   edit-words

text:General Discussion - January 19, 2021	labels:I never thought I'd become this person, but man, shipping costs really can fuck up my desire to buy something. I was just about to commit to buying another pair of sneakers and it's probably the best deal I'm going to find on them, added to cart, shipping info entered, billing info entered... $20 for the cheapest shipping option. No shipping codes available, no threshold I can cross to get free shipping. $20 period, no exceptions.  It's a $300 pair of sneakers discounted to $180, I guess should be able to rationalize that at $200 (including shipping), I'm still getting a better deal than what's available anywhere else online (only a few select retailers got this colorway, and all but one are sold out in my size), but still, $20 shipping feels *wrong*. My brain has been trained from years of online shopping that there should always be some way to get around paying for shipping, or otherwise, shipping should be cheap.

text:Indian factory workers supplying major brands allege routine exploitation	labels:The crux of the article (and exploitation in general):  > #'Brands are to blame' >  > These kinds of brands do not own or operate factories in India, which creates distance between them and working conditions there, but one owner of a clothing supplier - who did not want to be named - told the BBC that if brands push for cheaper clothes it can leave suppliers with no choice but to cut corners to meet orders. >  > "It's the brand who wants to maximize the profit. So, they push you to a level wherein you have to do the exploitation in order to survive," he said. >  > The owner, who used to supply a major UK brand not mentioned in this story, described some factory audit processes as a "sham". >  > "The factory is aware when the auditors are coming, so they keep everything in perfect condition before," he said.

text:How are the Veja trainies? I keep eyeing those up	labels:I have the V-lock sneakers. I bought my first pair \~2 years ago and replaced them with a newer pair this summer. The only ones were in wearable condition, they just were very worn and dirty looking because the shoes are white and stuff gets into the velcro. I wear those as a backup now. Vejas are not the most comfortable sneakers ever—they take a while to break in and aren't made for running/sports. But once you replace the insole and break them in, the leather softens up and they really do last. The seams of the sneakers got dirty, but the white leather itself did not scuff or stain despite heavy use. The soles are very thick and only seem to have minor wear after a year of very frequent wear—usually I will destroy sneaker soles within a few months. Veja leather sneakers are great for walking around cities and just throwing on as casual shoes. They also seem pretty weather resistant and are comfortable in most weather. I definitely recommend them as long as you are prepared for them to be uncomfortable at first! And definitely replace the insole.

Its always been my fave season for dressing.

text:Learning to dress better	labels:If you are looking for more mature stuff to just throw on and not have to think about I would consider starting with a "casual capsule wardrobe" of interchangeable basics.    There are a couple guides if you search them, but if it were me starting over here is what I would do.  **Bottoms:**  Light wash jeans, Navy Chinos, Sand Chinos, Khaki chino shorts **OPTIONAL:** Dark or black wash jeans  **Tops:**   **T-Shirts**(no logo no graphics)**:** 2x white, 1x Navy, 1x Light Grey **Optional:** Offwhite, Charcoal, various pastels, short/longsleeved henleys in any neutral colors.   **Button Downs:** light blue oxford, light pink oxford, **Optional**: gingham button down (light blue or navy), flannel shirt (black and watch or buffalo plaid), White oxford, university stripe oxford.  **Outerwear:** Light Grey crewneck sweatshirt olive anorak (for rain), tan/brown/navy quilted jacket for winter   **Shoes:** White leather gym shoes, brown leather boots or chukkas (pants only) **Optional:**Tan/light brown loafers, brown camp mocs, snow/rain boots (bean boots or hunter mocs)  &#x200B;  Obviously feel free to make it your own, but I would start trying to build solid basics like that that are 100% interchangeable.

text:I love this comment. It’s so freeing to appreciate fashion (and fashion photography) as an art and not only from a consumer perspective or through the lens of your own wardrobe needs. I have tons of Pinterest boards for aesthetics that are totally impractical for me, but I just enjoy looking at them and imagining the lifestyle of those characters. I only have a couple of boards that are for items I would practically wear. Those boards have purpose too, but I have a definite mental distinction between looking at outfits for fun and trying to fill holes in my wardrobe.	labels:	episode_done:True

I’m usually so confident in my outfits but there’s just something about turning 30 plus comments here and there from my older family members that make me second guess myself and make me wonder if I need to find a new style even though I love my clothes and style.	labels:You do you! I went through a phase at like 28 where I felt like I had to have this "timeless capsule adult lady wardrobe" and changed my whole style to fit into a societal expectation of what a 30 year olds style should be. I was BORED, uninspired, and honestly spent money on stuff I hated. Now I just wear whatever I think looks fun and inspires me and yes that includes gen Z jeans lol. Fashion isn't supposed to make you feel sad and life is short. Wear the damn crop top.

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:I have moved to different climates many times. My recommendation would to not purge or change anything until your move is complete. The reason is, you definitely get climatized, where what would consider "warm" in the winter to you now will feel chilly enough to wear heavyweight items you hadn't expected would work once you are climatized. A lot of items that you think will/won't work end up being the opposite, etc. You mentioned having less storage, so it sounds like you will need to offload/purge at some point, but I'd wait to do it once you get there and put it off for as long as you can to truly see what items work. I'll never move to a cold climate again but even moving to different warmer climates, I will wait to do any paring down/purging until I can get a little climatized and adapt.

text:I'm Not a Watch Guy I Swear - Street x Sprezza	labels:I am a watch guy, but very much a relatively broke one.  Had I known how much trouble it would be to break into watches, I might have said never mind and wisely walked away. I didn’t, though.   Some pointers for those interested:  1.	The cost of the watch is only the upfront cost. Like a car, a mechanical watch needs regular maintenance. Generally speaking, this will be anywhere from $300 to $1,000+...every 5-7 years.  2.	Because of point #1, entry level (~ $500) mechanical watches are not pieces you will pass down to your kids. In fact, it is usually cheaper to trash them entirely and buy new than to bother having them serviced.  3.	People will tell you there are deals to be had in the vintage market. That’s true, but it can also be difficult to find parts or people willing to work on them. 4.	There is relatively little offered between entry level and about $3,000.  5.	There is nothing wrong with wearing a quartz or digital watch.   All that being said, I still love my small collection. Just wish I had known those things from the start.

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:Any time you're paying more than a few thousand dollars for a basic article of clothing, you're paying for the brand; because you could have that same blazer or pair of trousers custom made by a tailor/dressmaker in the same or better quality, for a lower price.  This was the case in the 50s and 60s as well, but at the time, high quality clothing was more common, sewing skills were more common, clothes were expected to last longer, and the general public had a better understanding of what good-quality clothing looks like; people bought Chanel expecting quality construction, of course, but the main appeal of buying from a prominent Parisian fashion house was knowing that anything Chanel made would be in fashion for the upcoming years.  Now that we are immersed in fast fashion, nobody has the knowledge to hold luxury brands accountable, and fashions change so quickly that a well-made 'up-to-date' jacket from a reliably fashionable brand would be a pointless investment.  It just doesn't make sense anymore for luxury brands to invest too much on quality if there is no longer any demand for quality.  This is not *only* a recent thing: I've seen gowns from the court of Marie Antoinette made of materials costing 30+ years of a working man's wages, yet were hastily thrown together with big, sloppy stitches and tacks.  That's just what happens when your client wants their garment *right now* and will only wear it once or twice.  If you want something that's really well-made and is going to last a long time, there is certainly a market niche for that, but it's become more of a middle-class niche for people who *specifically* care about quality and durability.
text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:1. Being “overdressed” is an absolute myth people have created to hate on other people who are doing what makes them feel great.  2. I’m currently going through this transition myself. What’s helped me is really just trying things on that I like but may not necessarily be in my comfort zone and pairing it with someone familiar. So maybe I wear a fancy, feminine top and pair it with some boyfriend jeans (something I wear every day) to help balance it out!	episode_done:True

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:I think for me if I could avoid it, I would but I still like some cami tops from F21 so I’ve purchased some from there recently. I also think that how long an item lasts is more important so you’re not replacing every month or so. I’ve had clothes from H&M that I’ve had for years and I’m still using since it’s still in good condition.	episode_done:True
text:Yes I agree with that - workplaces are getting more casual but any midriff skin is really a big no-no still. You really can’t have ANY midriff skin showing. If you love the overall shape you could wear a cami underneath so instead of a strip of skin you have a strip of cami.  I agree with the general advice to just wear boring things for a few weeks/months while you’re new and getting a feel for the overall vibe. There will almost certainly be a way to dress more interestingly and have fun with it, but there will be “ok” and “not ok” ways of doing that and you’ll need a bit of time to figure out what they are. A few months of dressing boringly isn’t a big deal in the scheme of things.	labels:Agree with this.

text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:Yes and no.   I have been wearing way more loungewear - and all day loungewear. I have been going to my workout class and it feels silly to change clothes midday to get ready for an afternoon class. I would bring a change of clothes before of course.   One of my fashion goals for this year was getting better at separates. I am practicing this! In the before times I wore more dresses. I haven’t been doing it as much because my desk area is a little chilly. I have a few looks I am happy with and should translate nicely.   I did wear some of my dresses during the summer. But more solid ones vs patterned ones. I have been also experimenting with solids this year.   I have been wearing way more pants so that will likely translate in the future. Surprisingly. I have avoided pants a lot in the past.   I can’t wait to get back to my fave shoes and the dresses I have missed - that feel a little wrong for sitting at home. My wardrobe has gone through a massive shift over the past 5 years when I started biking for errands.  This means I mostly buy items that are bike friendly. And that works well for sitting at home as well. I have snuck in a skirt or two that may not work on my bike - and jeans which I hate biking in - but one the whole that rule serves me well.	episode_done:True
text:I agree with you 100%. The sleeve thing, gaiters, and video game style collar things are a recipe for disaster. Maybe the aesthetic is possible to pull off, but it would require very high quality pieces and someone who is really good at this kind of thing. It's one of those, if you need to ask for advice, there is no way you could pull it off scenarios. As terrible as it is, I'd probably chuckle if I saw someone wearing any of those accessories at a bar or something. I'm just picturing someone alone at a dive drinking some shitty (or very oddly expensive for the bar) single malt whisky alone approaching random people and trying to talk about outdated philosophers. Even just the high rise pants look seems very intimidating to me. I'm always very impressed by the people on MFA who pull it off. It seems like one of those things where if you pull it off you look incredibly fashionable, but if you fuck it up just a little you end up looking  wholly ridiculous.	labels:And I won't know until I try it :) Have faith that I know what I'm doing

No white shoes after Labor Day hasn't been a rule in many decades. It's just trotted out as article fodder (to proclaim "These Rules Are Dead!") every so often.

In my situation  even just learning about color and combinations becomes difficult because I lack the foundation to even see the colors and the nuances described. So far I´m leaning towards a gray/white/black combo style which isnt too hard and look good. But I also really like earth tones/autumn viby colours and comfy clothing so I´m checking that out at the moment. I recently saw Ordinary People (the movie from 1980) and the sweater, shirts and colors were perfect. Anyway, checking this out. Thanks  Edit: for colorblind bros: apparently there are apps (f.ex color grab and kuler) that can tell what color things are. Super helpful if you wanna learn which skin tone you have.
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:This may not be everyone's cup of tea but I love wearing oversized long sweaters or sweater dresses with sheer tights and then thigh highs over that. I'll usually wear this with combat boots or some type of heeled boot as ankle booties don't look great on me. You can also wear this with a skirt/shorts and a sweater and then a coat on top. Add a hat, scarf, gloves as needed.  This combo worked great for me in the fall when I lived in Canada.	episode_done:True

text:Yeah I like conversations like this too. I can suddenly see how it would just like weird and uninteresting if you had pretty clear gender categories. I feel more in the mix like he seems to, so it definitely does resonate with me. I think the thread below is interesting too, that it’s because he was seen as a hot male celebrity in One Direction and has gradually wound up wearing a dress on the cover of Vogue. I am not actually a super radical gender person, but there is something about Harry Styles that resonates extremely strongly with me. I frankly can’t say why.  The ppl in the other thread are emphasizing how there’s nothing inherently new about what he is doing but I disagree. I think he represents a very widely-consumable version of a gender queering position. He is at once legible as a British rock star and something very contemporary. It comes back to the sense of insouciance. I know everything he is doing is deliberate, but his attitude is that none of it should matter. I think other instances of celebrity gender bending were framed as being subversive, whereas he is trying to treat us as precisely not subversive but nothing. It’s a complicated move, for his radical thing to be to pretend that what he is doing isn’t radical. But for me it works and is quite smart and meaningful (even if it is, as the ppl in the other thread are saying, a series of calculated decisions, I don’t think it’s only that. I think he is following something genuine and internal, even if he is a professional concerned with having a successful career. He does strike me as being actually genuine in a sort of rare way. Idk. This was a long response, which shows how intensely his dress thing is impacting me.	labels:I’m glad you feel safe to express yourself here. I like what you had to say. I work to live without gender categories and I definitely projected just some of my aesthetic choices. I go for polished looks that are “complete” from head to toe so my first reaction was “needs some makeup”. But you’ve pointed out it’s more of a dejection of all that instead of just putting together a feminine look.   I wanna pose a question to you. Do you like Harry as the subject for something like this over someone like Billy Porter? Why or why not?	episode_done:True

text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ?

I bought some really fun colours, mustard yellow, light pink, floral patterns, pastel blue, etc.   I used to style them primarily with black, dark, grey, white, chambray tops/blouses.  I grew bored of this phase and went back to blue jeans, but it was a fun experiment for the summer time!

Some of my online has been surprising (like ordering two sandals 9.5 and finding them to be too big) and others were amazing (a Banana Republic Factory fit and flare dress fitting me perfectly?? How) But I basically decided that I think I need to spend more time studying and gathering wardrobe inspiration, and taking care of basics. I also went to my local Fleet Feet and got fitted for proper walking shoes and a sports bra, so I can start exercising for my health. All in all, it's been a mix.	episode_done:True

Takes maybe 15 mins total and you don't destroy your clothing. You can even spin it again once the water is out to speed up drying if you let it air dry.

Just like buy a navy worsted wool suit from J Crew on steep discount or any of the other many budget brands for suiting out there now.

I’ve seen a few pairs online, but I’m hesitant to pull the trigger because I’m not sure how much I’m going to like them and wear them.  I haven’t seen them for much less than around 80.00, which is a price I’m ok with for a shoe I know would get wear, but I’m not sure about spending that on something I kind of just out of the blue want.  I’m imagining pairing them with jeans and a chunky sweater or for a quirky look, my midi length floral / flowy dresses.

They cost anywhere from 50% to 100% more if it is in a more urban part, or you can move to a more suburban place further out.

Just be prepared and make sure you have warm gear with you in the car in case. I wear heels to work, so I make sure I have a pair of boots in the car. For comfort and safety. Or I wear the boots and bring the heels and change at work. You aren’t banned from wearing anything. I have an ankle length coat so I comfortably wear dresses/skirts with tights most days. I also do have a blanket, hat and extra gloves in my car just in case, but I don’t let the cold stop me from wearing anything. You just have to make the proper modifications. I grew up in one of the snowiest, coldest places my whole life  but I love fashion and just make sure I am prepared.

text:Fashion "fantasies" coming true years later?	labels:A little bit different, but I remember as a kid being like "man, wish I had the confidence to wear belly shirts, they look so cool" or whatever we called them back in the 00s, and now that they're being styled with high waisted pants and skirts it's like, the best of both worlds, in that I don't have to have my full stomach out and it's way cuter this way anyways. AND the nigh waisted/crop solved the issue I had with clothes and my wide hips: low-rise pants would slide down and shirts would always ride up unless they were loose enough, so I would have to CONSTANTLY adjust.  And on the reverse note, any shirt I have that isn't cropped gets tucked in, which is funny considering how ridiculous it always seemed to me to tuck in shirts back then too.	episode_done:True

text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:A fair amount of what makes a garment last/wear well is how you take care of it.   Extremely cheap fast fashion like YesStyle is going to wash/wear poorly, so you need to be very gentle with washing those kinds of garments. Hand washing, coldwater washing on low speeds, and air-drying will make those kinds of garments last longer. I have 10-year-old Forever 21 dresses because of how I wash them.  For American-made brands, I like LA Apparel and Bug Bud Press. However, keep in mind that these brands are expensive for a reason, and they have fewer styles and sizes for a reason. To try and understand clothing price and quality, try and think about how can this YesStyle dress possibly cost $11? How long does it take to make a dress, what would I like to be paid for making a dress, how much does fabric cost per yard, how can this brand afford to make this many styles, colors, and sizes? You'll realize that the only way for a garment to cost that little is because corners are being cut SOMEWHERE.	episode_done:True
text:MFA crosspost: How to Ask for a Recommendation	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Formula for a put together outfit that works for most aesthetics	labels:I think this strongly depends on your natural features. E.g. I have an hourglass figure with noticeable boobs, so if I'm wearing something fitting it's already like 4 points, lol, even if it's a simple black dress. If I'd put 7 more "points" worth of accessorizes and stuff that would turn me into overly feminine very much in your face type of appearance. So I usually have my outfit - fairly simple but fitting, some makeup on the face, and everything else is a bit toned down, e.g. simple jewellery, maybe a pendant or earrings, simple hairdo, etc. If I had less prominent features, the "blank slate" model look I feel I could push further with adding scarves, bags, more jewellery, etc. But being curvy even red lips become kind of a provocation.	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: Beauty is Pain	labels:Everyone knows that true beauty is inner beauty, so over the past year, I've really focused on psychological pain and suffering. My top three habits include:  - Putting on a cute outfit every day and wearing a full face of makeup so that I'm not only slightly uncomfortable all day, but I'm also reminded of the fact that I haven't seen another person in over 10 months, so no one cares what I look like.  - Every Saturday I make myself a cocktail and put on one of my formal dresses to reminds myself of how much weight I've gained since I last attended a fancy party.  - I cut my own bangs  I'm pretty sure I'm at the brink of a nervous breakdown, but my *soul* looks radiant over zoom.	episode_done:True
text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I guess I don't really follow them because as a pear shape the advice is usually to emphasize the other body parts to draw attention away from the hips. But I like my butt, so I don't feel like I need to specifically hide it.  Also I think bootcut or flare jeans that are usually recommended just make my legs look like columns, and slimmer pants actually show that  I have slim legs and ankles (which to me looks nicer). I think a lot of this advice was based on the idea that the goal is to look as skinny as possible, so if anything is sticking out it needs to be obscured. My mom said she never wore jeans in the 80s/90s because she thought her butt was too big for them, and it's not even a particularly huge butt. So at the time the hourglass ideal was just overshadowed by the need to not look "fat" it any way (especially in the 90s).
text:General Discussion - November 10, 2020	labels:It’s really fun to look at clothes objectively without pretext of it not being suitable for a man to wear.

text:I've done my laundry for 20 years, using laundry bags, special detergent, gentle cycling. Silk, cashmere, underwire bras (REALLY use the bag here), sneakers it's all fine! Just dry on a flat surface.  I usually have no problem until cotton tshirts the last couple of years. A cotton tshirt should be fine at 40^o C. It's the recommendation on the label. But a few has instantly lost inches in high and transfererad it to width. And it's a ridiculous difference. All my husbands tshirts are fine though, it's only mine getting ruined.	labels:> But a few has instantly lost inches in high and transfererad it to width.   I think that's an issue with construction. Cotton fabric has a grain to it and if the pieces of the garment are not lined up properly according to the grain, washing it even carefully will cause the garment to warp.	episode_done:True
text:My thoughts of the Cote&Ciel Isar L after a year	labels:Holy shit I can get something similar at IKEA for just 50 Euros. This is ridiclously expensive.
text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Had something similar happen, and let me just say - the first step is to find two or three good pants that you feel good in. For me, it was to leave behind shops like forever21 or New Look, and I started shopping at shops like Torrid. I know some people hate torrid, and some of their clothes are cheesey. But let me just say - they do the BEST jeans. I have bought them in size 10, 12, 14, and 16, and they fit and grow with me as my body changed and fluctuated, and then when I lost some weight, the smaller pairs still fit.      Just remember, you have to ignore the size on the rack, and instead go based on what feels good. Good, buttery jeans that make your butt look rocking are a huge confidence booster for me. Tops that hid the ladies which grew sort of uncontrollable after changing the pill also helped. Structured blazers with t-shirts and dark jeans = perfect office look for any size. Statement necklace or simple earrings always a bonus. However you are, as you said, you deserve clothes that fit, so get em, girl!	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts then and now?	labels:Love that old post. Thanks for linking!   To me, it’s not as much about dressing up or down as it is about design. I have seen a lot of articles about the heightened attitudes towards “design,” which is a pretty general term, but to me it starts with the era where Apple was being criticized for hiring more designers than engineers. In my opinion, a LOT of products could use more/better designers, including fashion.   Maybe it’s the “hard times” mentality of my generation (millennial), buy the fundamental question of design (full disclosure, I do not work in design) is “What is the problem I’m solving?” In my opinion, a lot of clothing fails to meet the basic expectations of utility. See, for example, my impossible quest to find summer dresses appropriate for Texas heat!   I hope that the dressing up/down discussions we are having will lead us towards clothes that are better designed for the realities of our lives.
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:My usual office wear is midi circle skirt and blouse, sheer black tights, pointy flat shoes, cardigan or blazer.  Or a midi or knee length dress, cardigan or blazer.  In some offices I've worked in, solid coloured jeans with no rips count as business casual.  I would wear them with solid coloured tshirts or knitwear and boots or shoes but not sports shoes.	episode_done:True
text:what are your fashion flaws?	labels:Maybe it’s not a flaw, but, whenever I find an outfit I like, I will wear it on repeat and then it becomes boring to me.
text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:Sort of yeah, I mean I try to look at what brands that specialise in an item sell something for - lots of entry-level goodyear-welted shoes around £200-250, lots of good neckties around £100, wool trousers seem to be £200-£400, many wool overcoats £800-£1000. I'm not rigid on the prices but I do like to search around to get an idea of an average consistent price.	episode_done:True

text:An Essay on the Navy Blazer with Brass Buttons	labels:When worn well, a navy blazer with brass buttons is absolutely killer. In general I think we harken back to the really boxy fitted blazers with the brass buttons which of course turns must of us off of the idea. Alan Flusser's shop instagram has posted some great looks with brass buttoned navy blazers (the head MTM guy, Jonathan \[I think\], is the one in the photos most of the time) and made it look ever so effortless. Us menswear geeks should rightly reconsider its place in our wardrobes, just with some updated proportions!	episode_done:True

text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:So, look, I don't want to tell you _not_ to do this, but if I've understood correctly you're looking at creating a bloodborne-inspired victorian/traditional wardrobe. There are elements of that style that have mainstream appeal today, high-waisted wool trousers being one example. However, when you take them in context with the more "interesting" elements you picked out it gives off serious cosplay vibes. Perhaps you should take the fact that the only places offering this sort of clothing are Etsy/cosplay stores as a hint that you should reconsider this idea.  You might be thinking, _what about the cyber goth vampire Rick Owens fits I see on this sub?_ It's a valid question. The key difference is that the style you're going for here has _such_ a strong association with cosplay and videogames and so little mainstream appeal that the number one association people are going to make is that you are cosplaying. Doubly-so if you're wearing cosplay-quality clothes from cosplay vendors. While the Rick Owens aesthetic may not have mainstream appeal it _is_ very accepted within fashion circles and _doesn't_ have that strong cosplay association.  So with that said my advice is to take what you've got and tone it down. Treat it like a high-fashion runway show and take inspiration from it instead of trying to recreate it 1:1. High-waisted trousers, great. Gaiters? Maybe just get some actual boots. Bloodborne-style woolen collars/scarves/hooded shawls? Wear a regular scarf that has an interesting shape or texture, or a shirt with a more exaggerated collar. Maybe the fact that you can't find retailers selling this kind of stuff is the limitation you need to make it work in the real world.  Or maybe I'm just talking complete shite and someone smarter than me can help you more. I hope that I've at least broken the ice and said what needed to be said so that people can try to constructively help you.
text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I don't have a capsule wardrobe per se, but I do have a color palette that isn't exclusively neutrals that (imo) goes together. I have some neutrals (warm gray tones, black, off-white, camel) and some colors (forest green, red orange). I have suit jackets in each of the colors I've listed above and camis in each color as well; I tend to stick to neutral bottoms (white or black jeans) so my tops are more colorful. I don't think a capsule has to be exclusively neutral, but do try to pick a family of colors that work together (e.g. all of my color choices are warm-toned vs. cool toned greens, reds, greys, etc.).
text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:I don't feel constrained at all. I've never really worn heels and I finally threw the few I had out last year. I get compliments on my shoes and outfits often.
text:Where do you find inspiration for your Outfits?	labels:Instagram and Pinterest primarily. I also like to people watch and if I see someone in a really cool outfit and I have similar pieces in my closet, I’ll try to replicate their look. I live in a « fashion capital » so there’s a wide variety of styles and tons of inspiration!	episode_done:True
text:Reigning Champ Hoodie: 2 months later	labels:Often times, cheaper, more utilitarian fabrics are more durable. While I can't speak to RC's quality as I have never owned any of their stuff, terry-cloth is generally a softer material and can be more likely to abrade. So if you are like me and place a lot of weight on your elbows while seated at a chair with armrests (esp if you have pointy elbows), then you might find that you develop holes there and so you either change up how you sit or you realize that you need something that will work with your use-case (denser weave material or maybe reinforced elbows/elbow patches). Not dissimilar to how some people put holes in socks more easily than others. Shape of your body and how you do normal, everyday things can impact how things wear on you.    More expensive does not mean more durable. These are not the same thing and it's something that people really need to stop using as a reason to spend more on something. Durability \*can\* be a high-quality product's claim to fame, but is certainly not generalized to everything.    Durability is also not a measure of quality. It can be part of why you consider something to be "quality", but that's up to you what you want from your garments. Unfortunately, you don't know what you don't know, and going by what people recommend means that you're basing your purchasing decisions on other people's preferences. Fashion can be an expensive hobby and there is a lot of trial and error as you learn about yourself and about the various things that go into making a garment.	episode_done:True
text:That would probably be a bad match. Oxford and flannel are good heavier textures. If the pants are dressy, you can't go wrong with broadcloth or twill. Herringbone can make for a nice, soft, in-between shirt. Denim is less summery than chambray.	labels:	episode_done:True

The application to consumer is pretty nice for "virtual try-ons", but also there's a business case for better promo/model pictures for online stores too.
text:Let me ask you a few questions here...do you even like these clothes or are you more comfortable in something else? Are you dressing for you or for men? If for men, if a man is disappointed by what you're "hiding" then he's not worth it. There are plenty of great men out there who like you and your body just the way you are and they don't really care what you're wearing.   I would say we are all hiding some flaw...for me, I'm hiding my mom pooch belly. I can hide it well in clothes, but naked...nope! It is right out there. If someone doesn't like that then that's on them and speaks to how shallow they are, which is an instant turn off for me.  Love yourself first.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:I've taken a couple of laps before writing this comment, but up-front I think aesthetics section should be split, because I think the most basic question, which is answered aesthetically but not functionally, is what do you want your clothes to **do**? Giving off a vibe is mentioned, but there's an even more functional level of "are these clothes sensible for how I live my life?" Are you buying lots of hawaiian shirts even though live at the north pole, or buying down parkas when you live in Hawaii? Do you regularly find yourself cold and wet because you don't own any raincoats, or find that your fishnet sleeves keep getting caught on the mill in the machine shop, or that your raw denim really doesn't give you the flexibility you need to dance?   I think what the clothes do should meet you where you do what you do, and at the most basic level that's physically enabling you to do things, and you can build a vibe from that.

They look a bit like short leather wellies on me, which is fine with me. I sort of wish I had bought them in Burgundy...  I would like some new knee high black boots,aaannned something interesting? Not sure what. Options seem a bit limited,  everything that makes me want to buy it has a big heel and so will never be worn. Maybe I'll buy a something in plain leather and paint it?	episode_done:True
text:Not to mention the quality of the fabric used. I sew and consider myself an average sewist. If I take the time and have a good pattern and quality fabric I feel my clothes are pretty decent. Probably not equal to very high end, but because I can adjust fit very early in the process they can look better than fast fashion with fit issues.  That being said not everything I make turns out like I hoped it would. But I have several items of clothing that I have been wearing for years and I will wear until they wear out because they fit, are completely my style, and I love them.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Share what are your quick tips to always look polished !	labels:I have 2 pups and have accepted that I will always have dog hair on me.   Back when I wore more business clothes, I would have separate at home and work clothes. Changed out of my work clothes as soon as I got home and into sturdier/less expensive outfits.   Also recommend keeping a lint roller in the car.   To generally look polished: add an accessory like a scarf, earrings or a necklace.   I’m also a fan of tucking shirts/sweaters.
text:I can’t speak from experience with this, but according to a few people I know the book *I Will Teach You to Be Rich* by Ramit Sethi is really great if you have “enough” money but still have massive anxiety about how to spend it. I used to read this guy’s blog a million years ago and it was pretty different than most finance stuff—he was more about figuring out how to responsibly use money  in ways that made you happy, rather than, like, strict budgets and the evils of cc debt.   Also, congrats about the nurse thing! That’s amazing!	labels:	episode_done:True

I think it’s time I let the thrifting and g r a p h i c t e e life go for a bit. I own way too many band shirts and shit that I just don’t wear anymore. I need to suck it up and start investing in my wardrobe to get it to a place I want it to be instead of buying a ton of shitty bandaids for 8 bucks a pop at thrift stores. Time to be a big boy and learn to go for a few expensive pieces instead of a ton of cheap ones.   Wish me luck lads.

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I also live in Louisiana. You definitely want to have a pair of rain boots or waterproof shoes because of how much it rains in the spring and summer evenings. I have a pair of cute Chelsea boot style rain boots that are a lot easier to style. Also, get a pair of good quality sandals that are comfortable, I prefer Birkenstock’s.   I strictly wear shorts or mini skirts in the spring, summer, and most of fall, then jeans or leggings/joggers in the winter. I have denim shorts, chino shorts, and some cute dressy shorts, depending on the occasion.   I don’t really like dresses because it’s hard to find summer dresses that aren’t sleeveless, and I just prefer to have some kind of sleeve.   I personally would get too hot wearing a sweater in the spring/summer, and I am very cold natured, but I keep a lightweight jacket in my car in case I go somewhere and the AC is really cold. I am not really big on tank tops, so I just wear a lot of short sleeve tops. I don’t even rotate my tops because I will usually just wear the short sleeved ones under a jacket in the winter, and I only have like 3 sweaters anyway.   Also not big on hats, personally, and the only time I see other people wearing them are for photo shoots or going to the beach. However, I do recommend some nice sunglasses.

text:How to wear nice casual clothes with a cotton allergy?	labels:Have you tried looking for clothing made out of hemp or linen? You can find casual tshirts and whatnot that are 100% hemp fabric. You can also find causal shoes that are hemp (i have an older pair of Adidas that are 100% hemp fabric uppers). Plenty made out of leather as well.  Do you have a budget for clothes? A lot of companies that use these alternative materials are considered "premium" brands and carry their price tags accordingly.

text:early 2000s looks are already hugely popular again, especially with younger people.  If you go to the hip neighborhoods in brooklyn you'll see tons of cool kids wearing big baggy jeans and oversized tees/racing jackets, which makes sense as fashion is trending toward looser fitting clothing in general.  The main difference is cuffed/cropping in the pants, but even then there's a lot of people, especially girls, wearing baggy low-rise cargo pants that go full break at their big chunky sneakers.	labels:i see where it comes from, cause for the past few years cuffing pants and having a more looser fit became alot more popular, this just seems like a normal transition from that to a more oversized/cuffed look from the tapered look thats kinda falling out tbh.   like its something i see alot of people who cuff their pants above the shoe moving to. like me honestly and i see it being a thing in the future i just cant see myself doing it.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - October 27	labels:I think early MFA and the attendant blogosphere it spawned / belonged to / helped popularise is partially to blame for the whole "timeless" nonsense.  We've come a long way from "well dressed men wear suits" to "actually shirts and blazers can be dressed down" to "actually you can wear what you want and look good", and maybe the whole "timeless", "dapper", "classic", "gentleman" thing was a necessary part of the journey, but... would it just fucking die please.
text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I feel the opposite, right feel like almost every “outfit” I see influencers in nowadays is just jeans and t-shirt. If they weren’t hot and young, the same outfit would get dragged. Like mom jeans and a giant tucked t-shirt that looks like it came from Walmart and we’re raving about Bella Hadid’s style. I find it very hard to find fashion influences for adult women that aren’t super basic, skewed super young, or just generic preppy “put a blazer over it!” J-crew style. The only place I see any creativity at all is in super high end fashion, but that’s not within the reach of most of us. The whole fashion industry in general is skewed so young, it’s like after 30 they think I should just wear a sack. The only reason the super high end brands cater to an older demographic at all is that older wealthy women are the only ones that buy their clothes. Any price point below that is plain plain basic city

text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:For me (almost 34), I think it's the progression of time seems to have sped up. It's like, I buy a pair of designer jeans (an investment!) and get a good season out of them. I love them. Then I get pregnant and have to do maternity clothes for almost a year (barf). Then post partum changes your body and I just miss my old clothes. I can't fit in them so miss another season. By the time you lose the weight and can fit in your favorite jeans, it's summer. Okay, I'll wait for fall. Fall comes and apparently the waist height is dated? That's bullshit, you JUST bought them.. 3 years ago. That doesn't feel like that long ago.  It was the same with some over the knee boots I bought 5yrs ago. Beautiful leather. I wore them one season, then pregnancy changed my shoe size. Then the post partum phase I was always bending over and on the floor, things over the knee boots did not do well. I needed slip ons. Okay. The next 3 years and two more kids, can't wait till I'm back in the life phase where I can wear my boots! Except now they're 'dated'. Again, total bullshit. Shoes should be fashionable for that period of time. Ugh, I'm wearing them anyway.   Just my theory. I'm currently super frustrated by t shirt lengths. I can't keep my jeans and buy new t-shirts. I now need to update all my jeans or show an awkward amount of stomach. I'll do it, but I'm going to be old and grumpy while I do it.	episode_done:True

text:Dressing for “housework” vs “working from my house”	labels:I've been a SAHM for 12 years now, and I learned early on that it was easiest for me to get up each morning like I was going to work, shower, and get ready for the day (do my hair and makeup). That means I'm prepared in case of an emergency or something unplanned. My uniform is jeans and a "cute" top. Right now, my kids are doing virtual learning, so I'm running around helping them, plus fixing their lunches and snacks, in addition to my normal chores and errands.   My favorite shoes are Gabor loafers, which I have in several colors. And I just purchased a pair of Dansko Nora loafers. They are super comfortable, lightweight, and have great support. I typically go barefoot at home (which is why my Bombas wear out), but I walk my dog every day and these are great for that.  I really love having a uniform, and I have several pairs of the same style jeans, and multiple tees in different colors and styles. If I have to leave, I can throw on jewelry, grab my bag, and I'm ready to go. I was a teacher previously, and having a system works for me at home. Huge hugs to all the moms doing double duty right now!	episode_done:True

text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:This might not be helpful at all, but here’s how it worked out for me:  My first realization was that (for me) basics are overrated. I only like certain types of pants and never wear basic, plain tees. So I got enough skinnie jeans to last me throughout the week (which is 3 in my case) - two in black, one in a timeless jeans shade. Then I got just enough lounge/sleepwear to last me between washes. I had a small handful of old sweaters and tees that I didn’t love and phased out (still keeping them around for yard work) when I got items I loved.  From here on I decied to take it slow and *only* get pieces that   a) worke with what I have, and b) genuinely excite me.  In my case that meant (second hand) designer pieces that I meticulously picked out.  They needed to be timeless, of high enough quality to last years, fit me and suit me, and reasonable to care for. (Learning how to properly care for your clothes goes hand in hand with that)  If I saw something I loved (for example an 80s Fendi monogram jeans skirt, a lovely navy blue N. Pearl men’s turtleneck that looks just the right kind of oversized on me) I’d jump at it, otherwise I made due with what I had.  I slowly built my wardrobe like that. I only purchased 2-3 pieces a month and was really really picky. I either bought outstanding “wow”-pieces, or items I *really* needed at the time (a winter coat for example).   While I don’t have a large variety of clothes to pick from, I’m genuinely excited to get dressed every day.	episode_done:True

text:How has lockdown affected new purchases?	labels:At the start of the year I set a goal to focus this year on overhauling my business casual wardrobe for work. Bought a nice blazer in February and got to wear it once to the office before it closed. Luckily that was the only thing I bought for work. Lately I've just been focused on my casual wardrobe since that's all I wear now, and acquiring more interesting or unique pieces to supplement the basics I've focused on in prior years: sneakers,   As far as timing goes I didn't buy anything in March/April. That was a rough time... my work was discussing layoffs, I wasn't sure if my wife would do the same, and my 401k was tanking. It felt safer to sit on any cash that came in. Fortunately we've managed to maintain our jobs and our health.  In May I bought a few secondhand grails but still shied away from impulse buys. Late June I'd say my spending on clothes picked up again. That's when restrictions started to be lifted here in New York and it actually felt safe to leave the apartment (with a mask) and walk around or sit outside for outdoor dining. I'm not out as often as I was pre-Covid but when I do go out I take the opportunity to wear some of my favorite pieces and as I reach for certain things most often I start to get a better idea of my personal style.	episode_done:True

Fashion-as-art-onto-itself stuff like 10, 17, 22 also looks good (and I guess it earns him his avantgarde cred), but doesn't filter down to the stores.  So there is this gap between fairly ordinary stuff and out-there artworks that he can't seem to fill. But in that gap lives the stuff I'd like to wear.

text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)?

My off-duty wardrobe is, like everyone else's in our position, larger than it needs to be.  But since I live in a colder climate, I've gotten really into outerwear like coats & scarfs since that's the one thing I can control every single day on my way to and from work!  When I first started in my lab, I didnt want to put on a whole new outfit when I got home because I'm lazy and hate doing laundry.  But after a while, I got to the point where I just wanted to feel cute and like myself! These days I basically change outfits entirely in the evening when I get home just to have a little style in my day.  I also started wearing my "special occasion" clothes more regularly too since when else are we gonna wear them?!  Last night I wanted to look cute but didnt want to put any effort into it, so I put on a chiffon tank top and cozy sweater with nice leggings.  And you know what - I felt fancy as fuck sitting on my couch eating burritos with my husband.  I've decided that it's just about finding that balance between needing to feel put together at some point during your day/life, and how much effort you want to put in.	episode_done:True

text:There was a reddit shower thought awhile back about how Dads are like time capsules because they wear whatever was popular / in style when they had kids... as if they just stopped buying clothes and keeping up with trends once they had the first kid.  It seems like mid-20s/early-30s white guys in tech are the same. Based on what they're wearing, you can tell when they first started paying attention to how they dress. And they're all convinced that whatever they wear is timeless or classic, without recognizing that they just bought in to whatever was trending at that time (menswear, minimalism, streetwear, etc.) and that they already are starting to look dated.	labels:I agree. I just think that this partially resulted from how we used to "teach" fashion by some sort of quasi-scientific approach, with all the infographics etc. on how "clothes should look like". Everyone got a dose of post-hoc rationalisations on why the fashion of the day is "right" and it is difficult to move past that. Cf. the whole thing about slim fit being the right fit.

text:I really question why I frequent that sub sometimes. Too many absolute pieces of shit people on there. I suppose that's why the negative connotations with the style exist. We need more dress trad; be rad enthusiasts.	labels:In my native culture this kind of style is *very* frowned upon (which of course doesn't stop a very obnoxious minority to dress like this anyway), so I'm biased to begin with. I realise this isn't internationally true, so present company very much excluded.  "Prep" brings together a couple of things about fashion I don't really like. The whole "dressing with the (only) goal of elevating one's social status" thing and *then* going for "looking like old money" to achieve that. Just horrible to me. Who decides that they *want* to look like their father bought them a spot at Harvard? Doesn't reflect well on one's character imho.  I really like nautical references and turn of the century styles, so it's a shame.
text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:Was just pondering this the other day, I have always had hand me downs and thrift store finds and other bonus items as my wardrobe. I still have people comment on my style and saying I'm stylish, but fashion and brand choices aren't an option. I make what I can get my hands on work. I hardly ever get rid of anything just in case it will work well with something I get in the future. I wear a lot of more outlandish stuff simply because people would notice how shitty my clothes are if I was trying to dress like everyone else. I'll often get an item of clothing or a pair of shoes as a big birthday present, but anything over £100 is out of my league. Even if I could save it up, there's no way I can justify spending that much of my budget on shiny clothes, especially since there's hardly ever anywhere to wear them!	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 02, 2020	labels:I've never really been able to figure out how pants should fit at the waist. I'm a relatively slim guy looking guy but I carry a lot of my weight right in my waist. Thus makes it hard for me to find pants that "fit", I feel like most things that I feel okay about around my skinny ass legs give me a bit of a muffin top, although I can usually for a finger between the waistband and my visceral fat without too much effort. I guess the question is: how should pants fit at the waist? Is *any* fat squishing a bad fit?	episode_done:True
text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:My taste in jewellery has evolved over the years, and most boyfriend jewellery was small silver things, so I’ve either donated them to op shops, or passed them on to other people.   I had one little diamond ring that he paid about $200 for, and I sold that to a pawn broker for about $80. Then I probably spent the money on clothes and wine.	episode_done:True

text:My body type is essentially a skinny pear haha. Also have a super short torso for my height! I find Madewell’s Rhyme top and Park Popover are really great tucked, French tucked, or untucked. Madewell definitely has a muted color palette overall, so depending on your personal wardrobe that may or may not work. I’ve also had good luck with tops from Splendid. If you’re super short torso’d, you might actually want to try Petite sized tops if you haven’t already, even if you’re not technically “petite” in overall height.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:I like fleece lined tights.

text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:There's a lot of good advice about finding inspiration here but what really helped me is in some ways the opposite: allowing myself to be really picky. Maybe I'm just a negative person haha but it's easier for me to realize I sort of balk at wearing a particular item and then figuring out the reason it's off-putting as well as taking note of clothing I feel my best in	episode_done:True
text:Is anyone into MBTI? Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels:At one point on the INTP subreddit everyone was talking about how they wish they could wear a cape without it being seen as weird. I would interpret the INTP relationship to fashion as a little bit more nuanced than "drab and careless". I think the common theme is that INTPs don't generally care what others think - and so that can manifest on a spectrum from "wears whatever because does not care about their appearance at all" to "wears completely outlandish things because they care about their appearance but do not care at all what others think of it".      As an INTP myself I fall somewhere between the two. Like... I *want* fashion to be a higher priority for me, but when it comes down to it my attitude is more often just "whatever" because social pressure to look good  doesn't register to me nearly as much as it could.

text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:I'm from Japan and a male in those age categories, would likely dress quite differently.  Japan is a land of 'Uniforms'. many spend much of their grade school to high school in a uniform.  when they go out and get a job.. they gotta wear a 'uniform'.. either a suit and tie, or some company uniform.  College is usually the time for experimentation, but because people have such a strong hard-on for fads and trends, they end up being in a uniform again.  maybe in 2017-18 ish. the trend for college age men was a wool chester coat and a hoodie underneath (a mix of very casual and slightly formal).  fast forward 2-3 years later, it nearly completely fell out in favor of oversized fleece jackets, or North Face Nuptse and other similar puffers.. usually in black and yellow.  guys 30s to 40s stop dressing like that  guys 40s and up tend to focus more on brands to flex their income and status, but often wear ill fitting stuff.. as well as strange color stuff (likely went to a Ralph Lauren outlet and could only afford that bright yellow shirt that was on sale because no one would buy it)  People often judge you by what you wear as they think it reflects your occupation or status. For example some one wearing shiny black with a lot of accessories is perceived to be involved in the night industries and probably of lower education or culture.

text:Le Château is closing all stores (most likely)	labels:Also Canadian living abroad here, and any time I visit, a trip to a Le Chateau outlet is... was... always on my to-do list. I appreciated that their menswear (sweaters in particular) came in small sizes that I could wear. One of my favourite sweaters is a thin wool men's from Le Chateau, purchased 2009, still looks and feels like new. My most complimented blazer is from their 'Made in Canada' line. Aw.  They've been on the chopping block for years, though. Not at all surprising they've collapsed now.  The number of different pieces they produced always seemed crazy to me. The outlet stores were enormous and I could go back year after year and see a lot of the same clothes from my last visit. Why bother purchasing anything full-price from their main stores when the outlets were bursting with the same stuff but half the price?	episode_done:True
text:I just feel like I have too many clothes, and it has lead to a pretty bad laundry habit because I know I have more to wear.

I know it's not wrong to have a big closet, I just want to have less. I enjoy donating clothes that I no longer have purpose for but I somehow still have a hard time getting rid of things.

I've been more and more interested in formal wear that reads visibly queer, and I really loved how they've styled their's as neutrals/dark tones, but with the details/silhouettes that are so undeniable.   Really liked the check pants on #3 and #14, I've been trying to hunt down a pair like those for a while!
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:I go to a lot of networking events in the STEM field, where the dress code is business casual, and I know that business casual in STEM is a whole different beast to business casual Law, and as Australians in a hot city, I'm guessing it's a lot different to a colder climate city. Probably way more casual.  After work networking events: whatever I wear to work. Generally long sleeved button up, mini skirt or skinny jeans, ankle boots, loafers, oxfords or sneakers. No effort into hair or makeup.   Networking event where I know there'll be bigwigs: I'll swap out the mini skirt for a pencil skirt, or a sheath dress. Definitely avoiding sneakers.   For an event with kids (like industry engagement): I'll make an effort to present more femme and do nicer hair, makeup, work heels, pencil skirt, polo. Sometimes blazer. I am almost definitely overdressed, but I think it's important to subvert the stereotype of female engineers as "pink steel cap boots" because that's not really indicative of me.	episode_done:True

text:Hiking and the Outdoors Inspo Album	labels:andWander is killing it.	episode_done:True
text:Yeah now that I’ve taken some time to think about it, I see what’s going on.   Simon’s definition of cold vs warm has to do with saturation of colour and undertones, which is why cool or warm browns and greys can exist, respectively. Your definition of cold vs warm seems to focus on the hue/colour spectrum from red to blue.   That’s what I was saying before, you just have different starting points/references so cool/warm mean different things to you. I seem to remember some confusion in his comments section addressing the same thing.	labels:Undertones make sense, but it seems like low saturation is a bigger part of his argument. Like, a cream with cool undertones quickly turns into a light blue. And I think of "cream" and "beige" and "taupe" as being warmer off-whites, and greys and stone as being more neutral / cooler on average. But he uses all of those interchangably, avoiding only "tan" and "khaki" and the very clearly warm terms like that.  He doesn't specify cool grays, cool browns, or cool olives. There are definitely warm / yellowish olives, I'd say it's easier to find warm ones than cool ones. And there are definitely cooler dark greens. Desaturation is a bigger part of his point, and he doesn't really address it.  Oh, and that's not to mention blacks, which... if they were cool, they just wouldn't be blacks. And blacks are technically saturated, too. True black is tonally neutral and fully saturated, not sure how they fit into either point he's trying to make, really.  If I were trying to implement this, I'd replace blacks with navies, but maybe look for dark desaturated blues where I can find them.	episode_done:True
text:Brands Want In on the Vintage Fashion Boom	labels:At least to me, the thing I love so much about shopping around at  vintage and thrift stores is that it feels so much less "corporate" than just going to a mall or ordering something off the internet. The more companies dip their hands into this area of fashion for profit's sake, the more life will be sucked out of it

I've said this a million times, and I hope it's said a million more times in the comments, shit its already been said here but i'll say it again: a good understanding of proportions and fit is the key to wearing whatever you want regardless of your body and what ever shape it may be/whatever unique features it might have.   I wish he went more into this idea in the video but it holds true save for a few very specific instances.	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:Very similar to you, fashion was an escape for me. Teenage angst and insecurity, and a smaller town, fashion was so unlike anything in my day-to-day. And there were so many ways to escape and so many facets of the industry to jump into! It was exciting to be passionate about something that always changed. About being able to put on a flappers inspired dress on Monday and go punk on Tuesday.  Teen Vogue’s website used to post weekly snippets about fashionable teens, which is how I found most fashion bloggers in the aughts/early tens. Sea of Shoes, Rumi Neely, there was a girl in SF who was one of the first to start shredding her t-shirts (Children of something???), etc. They then led to other online communities, like The Fashion Spot, the ONTD offshoot, tumblr in its heyday. So many different people who dressed in so many different ways, but all loved what they wore and showed it!	episode_done:True

Still, I almost always get dressed up to some extent when I’m WFH. I can’t bear to sit around in sweatpants and an old tee all day like a lot of people seem to do. Look good, feel good!	labels:Do keep in mind what you described is mostly American culture. Italian tailoring in particular is huge on unstructured suits and jackets still.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:In my experience, lower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose) and spending more tends to lead to a more noticeable improvement in quality up to a certain point. That's painting with a broad brush though... leather dress shoes and boots scale much better than sneakers or sandals, where mid-range options are going to be good enough for most people.  T-shirts, dress shirts, denim, and accessories in low-to-mid-range are generally good enough from a quality perspective IMO and I've only really paid more in those categories for a design I like rather than because I think I'm getting something higher quality. There's nothing wrong IMO with buying something because you like the way it looks even if a similar quality alternative exists at a lower price, but that's harder to do if you're shopping on a budget.  I'll also add that for all of the above, your dollar goes a lot farther if you're willing to shop used. Sites like Ebay, Grailed, reddit/styleforum B/S/T threads, etc. have made it a lot easier to buy preowned clothes without having to set foot into a thrift store.  TL;DR When shopping on a budget I'd focus first on having a high quality pair of shoes and jacket. Consider buying used clothes to stretch your budget further.

text:How would you store sentimental clothing?	labels:Safest way is to wrap in acid free paper, store in an acid free box (available at joanns and on line stores).  If you can’t do that, fold it and wrap it in washed, unbleached muslin fabric.   Make sure it is clean before you store it.  Perspiration and food spills can attract pests. If you hang it for display, do not place it in direct sunlight.  Also away from any source of moisture.

text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:I think the pressure is to not be "strange/unaware of your appearance" or more likely not to look "poor/can't afford more clothes." Some people do notice, and the rude ones point it out. This perception starts young. Growing up, there were teachers and other school staff who repeated outfits and other children loudly pointed it out.  I repeat outfits as much as possible if I'm not seeing the same people (my household doesn't count). The internal pressure is strong to not repeat within a few weeks of seeing the same people to avoid potential comments.
text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:This style isn’t really my style, but one thing I notice in these looks is that they look really well tailored despite being loose and drapey.

text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:Accessories are just as subject to cycles in fashion as anything else, but I always save mine even when I throw out tops and pants. Partly that is because my body won’t outgrow a necklace.   For some reason every woman around me was wearing stars the last two years, and I never saw it outside of this town. But because I had kept some old star earrings I had stopped wearing, I was already set to be on-trend. I think super thin necklaces are on the way out. But if you already have one you really like and don’t mind putting it away for several years, chances are it will be fashionable again.  And since you’re going for adult fashion, don’t forget black leather (or glittery plastic) business card cases. Even if your field doesn’t use business cards, you can put credit cards in them.

I throw a smaller handbag inside so I can take that to lunch or coffee instead of the whole backpack.	episode_done:True

text:I guess I'm not entirely sure what you mean. Nothing in any of those images stands out to me as particularly egregious. Sure, you might not see many of them out on the Appalachian Trail or Pacific Crest (though I could arguably see many of those pieces being perfectly functional for actual hiking), but you also aren't likely to see anybody wearing shipster/nautical workwear out on a trawler in the North Atlantic. That's not really the point. I think most everything in this album would be acceptable "outside the context of a fashion magazine" for people who are into the aesthetic.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:he's probably focusing less on navy bc he views it in a more formal context. Navy is mentioned as being a decent colour to add as a adjunct rather than a main focus. Certain shades of brown are colder than others because they have more cool tones like greys compared to a red-cast warmer brown.  I just posted this as an interesting illustration of how someone can think about colour, it's not meant to be a definitive authoritative post	labels:But grey isn't a cool tone. Grey is a neutral tone.  I understand if the premise excludes navy, but if it does, shouldn't th title be a "Neutral-Colour Capsule" or something like that?

text:This is so inspiring! I’ve always been sort of hesitant about wearing certain clothes and styles (eg. Boho, chic/sexy) even if I really like them, because I feel fake just like you mentioned, almost like I don’t deserve to dress like that because my personality doesn’t necessarily match the type of personality I associate with those styles.   But what you said about improving ourselves and how that relates to fashion is such an uplifting outlook. especially since I’m working on growing as a person and what to adopt more traits that I associate with the styles that I admire like confidence and a more laidback/spontaneous outlook.   Thank you so much for this amazing advice. I’m excited to carry this attitude with me into the new year.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Favorite brands to thrift?	labels:Not really about brands, but I love going through the outerwear section for both men and women.

text:My Gucci Addiction: Vanity Fair editor Buzz Bissinger's essay about spending $638k on clothes	labels:The line in the piece that stuck out for me was when he said he was on medication for "mild bipolarity."  The out-of-control spending, the hypersexuality, the losing a job due to temper outbursts...I'm not a psychiatrist, I just play one on the internet, but all of that put together  sounds like, at the very least, untreated hypomania.  To pass it off as only shopping addiction or "discovering himself" seems like underplaying some serious mental illness.

text:How do you feel about vegan/faux leather?	labels:I’m not a fan tbh. My experience which faux leather is that it does look nice... but not for long because it cracks/peels. Also it’s not very sustainable because it’s made of plastics and has a short lifespan (depending on how regularly it is worn). Real leather on the other hand can have a super long lifespan with proper care, and too me it just looks way nicer because real leather items (like boots and bags) are usually made with more care because it’s a more expensive material. I’ve thrifted all of my leather items too, which is also more sustainable for the environment (and my wallet!)	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:My aunt has a "1 of 3" rule that I like: only one of the following areas should be shown/highlighted, cleavage, legs or back. For example, if the top is revealing cleavage, no short skirt or backless top. If the skirt is short, no cleavage or back, and so on. She says "one is attractive, two becomes trashy".	episode_done:True
text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:Same, I only spot wash when something has stains and machine wash if something smells, otherwise I'll keep wearing it even if it's been a long time since the last wash. One thing I do often though, is air clothes out, even if they don't smell, specially if it's clothes that touch my skin directly, like tshirts and tight fitting knits etc, these items might seem clean and free of smells but if left in the wardrobe for a long time, will start to smell, airing them extends the freshness.  The only exception is pants and socks, they are washed after every use.	episode_done:True

text:Anyone here has the habit of needing to buy a new clothing/set of clothings when attending an occasion/going somewhere?	labels:Yes! I am so guilty of this.  But then I started to invest in quality blank canvas outfits and use accessories to change them up. So I have a great black cocktail dress that I wear all the time. But I might wear long strings of pearls and gold heels to one event and then the next event swap in red heels and a big gold statement necklace with a red lip. I have cocktail dresses in dark gray, navy, wine and gold and just layer in accessories, shoes and bags to change the look. And if I REALLY want something new, I buy some inexpensive accessory instead of an entire new outfit.  My exceptions are my birthday and our annual family Christmas party. Those are the two times I treat myself. But for all those other weddings, cocktail parties and work events, I stick to my tried and true.	episode_done:True

The media has a lot of influence over all stereotypes but I think they are trying to move away from them.

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.

text:What niche do you feel is missing from the fashion blogging/YouTube world?	labels:Middle-aged professional people who want to look put-together and stylish but not necessarily FASHION, especially budget-wise. I agree about mid-sized women, too. The 10-16 range that’s not skinny and not fat. Whatever “average” size is supposed to be these days.
text:Let's Talk about hats	labels:There is hat etiquette from the days of yore. Here are some of the conventions that were adhered to:  A lady does not remove her hat when indoors or for the national anthem. This is in contrast to men, who are to remove hats when indoors and for the anthem. However, if you‘re sporting a baseball cap at a ballgame, I would remove it for the anthem, whereas if you were wearing a more formal outfit with hat then I would not remove it.  A hat is a daytime piece in most cases not suitable for evening wear. The fascinator is an exception to this rule, but is more of a Commonwealth/British thing.  A lady does not wear a hat in her own home, ie when receiving guests, and as a guest in a friend’s home a lady would remove her hat.
text:Does anyone take their “power color” really seriously? Basing a whole wardrobe around one color - not just choosing an accent color for a neutral capsule?	labels:I think I sort of have one (raspberry).

text:MFA Theme WAYWT: Casual Tailoring	labels:This stuff looks great and the idea is nice in theory but after years of attempting this and being “that guy”, it really doesn’t work outside of the largest/most fashionable locales (NYC, London, Paris, Southern Europe, etc.). If you really want to do this and are comfortable with it then by all means go ahead. But from my own experience I did this, and actually did it fairly well after many years, but at the end of the day it stood out too much in real everyday life in a normal town, regardless of how nice the outfit was, and it definitely hurt my social reputation a lot. After toning it down a bit I immediately noticed a difference in how much more positively I was treated by people. You can still dress well, but remember context is key.

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.

text:Jewelry trends for 2021	labels:I feel like delicate, minimalist jewelry in general is here to stay for a while longer among the general populous (I personally think minimalist gold jewelry is timeless). It's easy to maintain and it goes with any outfit; can be a day and night piece.  Might just be me, but I feel that high fashion is always trying to promote the big, bold, statement jewelry, which is fine! The way you describe your style mixed with the beautiful pieces you like, it sounds like it fits you to a T. Just not sure if it is trending that direction though. But I think that you should shrug off today's "standards" and wear what makes you feel happy and confident!

text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:I miss getting dressed a lot. I don’t really have lounge clothes, just exercise, so I was really struggling with clothing at the beginning of this.   Additionally, I just graduated my masters program, and my job during the school year essentially had a uniform, so I was really excited about graduating and starting a new job to get dressed again. And then here we are.   I also miss getting dressed for occasions. I already had my graduation outfits picked out, and had three weddings this summers that I was looking forward to wearing dresses to. Going to the grocery store is now the only time I can put on clothing and I’m just really sad. I know there’s a lot of people who are like “just wear your clothing in your house!” Which yes, I can definitely do that. But part of the joy of getting dressed for me was the “going somewhere” part. Picking out my outfit felt like I was putting on a costume to play a part for the day, which I loved. I know I am so so fortunate that I can safely work from home; but I really miss my “characters”. Wedding guest, or fancy date night, or professional worker in winter. All those roles have been reduced to WFH and grocery shopper now and I’m just really sad about it.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 20	labels:Can anyone recommend a good brand of tank top to use as an undershirt that meets the following criteria?  - Long enough to be tucked into the pants without coming untucked throughout the day by doing things like raising my arms, bending over, etc  - Armholes and necklines aren't massive on larger sizes.   The few brands I've tried, I had to go for larger sizes to meet first criteria, but then I ended up with tanks with armholes and necklines so massive that it looked like one of those goofy wrestling leotards. It looked stupid, and it was also very uncomfortable because I often had the hems rubbing on my nipples. Ideally, the neckline should be low enough that I could wear a v-neck without it being visible, but not so low that it sits below my nipple line. And the armholes shouldn't go lower than a few inches below my armpits. And again, needs to be long enough that I can tuck it into my pants without it coming untucked (I'm 6ft and 220lbs, so I do have a bit of a gut).  Bonus points if it's incredibly comfortable.	episode_done:True

I'd suggest getting an entire outfit from there. They have EXCELLENT customer service and will handhold him through the process in as pain free a way as possible.

Bottom line, I'm not cool enough to pull off the more "dadlike" New Balances, which it seems modern style is trending towards.  The 998s were as close as I can get.  For the dadlike ones, you've got to have your entire fit absolutely on point.  If anything else is slacking, the shoes look unintentionally bad and not good at all.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:I hopped on r/coloranalysis and got an idea of my palette.

It has definitely helped me dip my toes into wearing more color and feeling confident doing so! Before I had an idea of what colors actually worked, I felt uncomfortable buying/wearing color.  I didn’t really think adding an accessory in a color helped me feel more comfortable. Understanding color theory a little more wrt how it works on my own coloring felt more intentional in my opinion, then I just went for adding a few tops.	episode_done:True
text:Totally.  To me, Gen Z is a lot of clothing that isn’t work appropriate but super fun. A lot of crop tops, bra tops, spaghetti straps, usually some tummy showing, and then some baggy pants.

Really fun and can be a really “hot but trashy” style   Millennial fashion is more professional/better quality/structured. Linens, trousers, heels, sandals, etc. Frankly I think it has to do with millennials having more money. Low key hair, nails and makeup. Neutral colours and patterns.

text:How to Combat Fashion Apathy?	labels:I was going tru similar episode in my life (lasted more than year acctualy) when I was gravitating into lounge wear and no effort clothes with „whatever” mindest. Something changed when I re-discovered other things that made me feel like THIS woman back in the days: music, fashion icons that inspired me, movies. I refreshed my memory when I was teen I was obsessing about single item and get so hype/wearing it on and on. I decided to put effort during every single day to dress myself like I’m worth it. Like I treat myself best I can!	episode_done:True
text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:One thing I do is remind myself that whatever I want isn't usually one of a kind. This helps me with makeup buying, because I fall in love with colours and buy them and my lipstick collection is out of control. I have to keep reminding myself that whatever beautiful colour I just found out about is either a dupe of something I probably have OR if that colour isn't something I own but the brand is garbage, that other brands will definitely have that colour too.  So for fashion, if you fall in love with a bag from a brand you can't support, just remember that no bag is unique (unless it's like an awesome bag that looks like a giraffe or something). If you love Chanel flaps but refuse to buy from them, there are so many other versions. I have one by Rebecca Minkoff but luxury brands make chain flap purses too without the ickiness of supporting Coco Chanel.  I'm a knitter and weaver, so most knit and woven things I can make myself if I don't like the brand. Same with yarn, if there's a yarn company I don't support, there are millions of other yarn brands out there where I can find something similar enough.  In general, no matter what you're trying to buy, there will be other brands that make something like it. So if you must have it, you don't have to buy from the brand you hate.	episode_done:True

Also the LL Bean 3-1 jacket, but not sure how I feel about how warm the jacket **alone** will be. But then again should I not focus too much on a jacket and focus more on layers?  I live in the on the border between PA/NJ so it can get cold at times during the winter.  Also I don't like any puffer jackets or one with too many pockets. The style of the Patagonia Insulated Quandary jacket or the LL bean 3-1 is what I'm looking for.  Anyone have any suggestions?	episode_done:True

In loungewear there's apparently four types with no middle ground: For mothers-formerly-known-as-women,  for girls, for seduction purposes only, and Jeff Lebowski.

text:Any thoughts on Private White VC?	labels:I mean they sell clothes that would fall into the Barbour aesthetic, I wouldn't wear any of their wax pieces, but they also sell other beautiful classic pieces. I'd be all over their wool overcoats. Their vibe is more towards the permanent style crowd but with as much as I spend on clothes I can't really claim the working class hero angle. The Barbour thing is probably more rooted in not wanting to look like I'm emulating the British elite.	episode_done:True
text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession). I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession 🤣

text:[Inspo Album & Commentary] In Recursion: Japanese Traditionalist Futurism & Futurist Traditionalism (x-post from /r/malefashionadvice)	labels:I figured I'd x-post my latest inspo album on MFA to here, given the potential crossover appeal; several of the brands discussed have unisex clothes or womenswear lines, and/or tend towards a masculine-leaning androgynous aesthetic. While the album primarily depicts men, women and individuals whose sex and gender are unknown to me also make up a fair proportion.  I tend to steal a lot of inspo from FFA myself, so I hope this might be useful to someone here or otherwise provide some uncommon inspiration.	episode_done:True
text:Indochino VS Local custom clothier (HM Cole). My fair review.	labels:I would agree with the overall sentiment to get an OTR suit and tailor but I will also add, in my own opinion, to avoid Indochino whenever possible.    I purchased a suit from them that was really bad because it was too small.    Then they sent a recut that was too large.  Both had arms set at different angles by a few degrees leading to weird darts of fabric showing up on the back and the chest.  One sleeve, out of the four, was wavy all the way down instead of a straight line with a bend at the elbow.  I'm not even sure how it was possible.    Then they sent ANOTHER recut that was again too small.    My local tailor I took it to said there was little chance of salvaging any of them, given the level of complexity it would require to do so.  Not a simple pinch-tuck-hem situation.  This process took over two months and when I got tired of the shot gun attempts they were sending me, I asked for a refund and they refused.  Even though their claim is  *"Every INDOCHINO purchase is backed by our Fit Promise. If your order does not meet expectations, let us know and we will make it right."* their customer service rep told me *"Yes, using alterations or a remake to get the right fit. There is no mention of refunds, as this is not something we offer."*  Once you drop $500 on a suit, you're stuck with it.  Even if they made it so poorly, the tailor tells you they can't do anything.  Today I'm down $500 on a wonky suit that I never wore and will likely end up giving to Goodwill.  I'd strongly advise everyone to look elsewhere and just avoid the hassle altogether. It's a gamble that's not worth it.

text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:1) Be early when you're dressed up. People will assume you're late because you were getting dressed even if that's not true.  2) It might actually help to wear the clothes around the house. Even just for an hour or two on your day off then hang them up again in the closet 3) Do you love to look at dresses or wear them? I really like to look at high heels, but I just don't buy them because they make me uncomfortable. If the dresses are making you uncomfortable, then maybe they're not really "you." Maybe you just enjoy collecting them?
text:A word of caution about tailoring - it’s the shoulders that will most likely need tailoring, but it is very difficult and very expensive to alter shoulders on a coat, and may not be physically possible depending on how much you need them taken in.   I tried it once with a men’s peacoat and brought it to the best, most experienced tailor in town, and even he really struggled with it. In the end, he could not take the shoulders in far enough without ruining the structure of the coat. He did the best possible job he could, it was not at all his fault, but it cost a lot and I didn’t really like the result.	labels:Oohh boy... yeah the shoulders seem really exaggerated. I do have broad shoulders though, so I def avoid any type of detailing/padding in the upper body lol	episode_done:True

text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:If you are a woman, then skirts are absoluely part of business casual.  In fact, there are still some business formal environment that insist on women wearing skirts, even though such a rule is coming to be seen as a red flag for workplace misogyny.    Business casual can mean pretty much anything that is less formal than a complete suit in conservative cut and color, but more formal than jeans and a t-shirt.  In some industries, 'business casual' might still mean suit and tie, but your blazer and skirt/slacks don't have to match and maybe you can wear khaki instead of navy.    In other industries 'business' casual might mean "just about anything that isn't jeans, shorts, or a t-shirt."  I've seen solid-wash denim trousers, bold patterned dresses, baggy sweaters, even sheer, sleeveless tops being worn as 'business casual,' even though I'd describe that more as smart casual.   If it's at all possible, try to find someone who has been to one of these events who can tell you more specifically what 'business casual' means to this club.  If not, then I would suggest wearing a white, button-down cotton shirt with a collar and a full or 3/4 length sleeve, paired with a simple, knee-length skirt in black, navy or gray suiting, black nylons.  It's boring, but it's your safest bet for something that'll pass muster while you scope out the crowd and find out what your other options are.	episode_done:True

There's cashmere and then there's the *softest* cashmere imaginable. There are coats, but then there are well-constructed, high quality coats. Of course there are occasional duds, but for the most part there's a clear difference in every detail - not just the label.

text:How do you guys find your style if you can’t try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:In college, I worked at a dept store.

They have runway stuff. Some cowichans that will remind you of RRL's. I don't know if they still make Polo suits in the US or Italy, but if they do, those might be fully canvassed. Maaaybe some c&j footwear, although that's still mostly RLPL. Of course, most of this stuff will be overpriced, and still not actual RRL quality.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:I don't like wearing synthetic fabrics for the most part and try to avoid them, but I am vegan and that leaves out wool and silk, so almost everything I own is cotton or linen. I find I sweat too much in most synthetic fabrics or they just cause weird sensory issues for me, but not all synthetic and blends are bad or cause me issues. It's hard because I generally need to feel the fabric to see if it'll cause me a problem and when ordering online, it's not possible.   I do think fleece is particularly problematic because of the plastic fibers that get into the water when washed, but there are bags to wash them in to trap it. I don't think all synthetics shed plastic like that but I'm not sure.	episode_done:True

text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I started in 2017 and just finished this year and I am very happy with how my closet looks now!  First, I got rid of everything. I was transitioning from a cheap college wardrobe to a semi-professional one (I teach kids). I wanted to strip my closet down to the bare bones, keeping only what I truly wanted, and then building on top of what I had. I did a Marie Kondo type thing, almost. I kept a few things that were of higher quality or that I really liked, and donated the rest.  Then I got the absolute basics: a few neutral blouses, jeans and black pants, replaced some of my most worn out shoes that "went with everything." Then I built from there.  After that, then came the dirty work. Hours upon hours of Pinterest-ing, reading style books, saving money every month and then teaching myself to be ok with spending that money, successful and unsuccessful shopping trips, plenty of thrifting, scouring online sales, swapping with friends, cataloging everything and building outfits via the app StyleBook. I did a lot of online shopping this year and there were some truly awesome sales so I was able to truly round out my closet for much of this year. I finally have it in a good spot.  My style skews very classic and preppy and timeless, so a lot of what I have in my closet will be in style for years. I couldn't be more happy with how it looks; it's easily mixed and matched and because I spent over three years building it slowly, much of it is also tailored and bought thoughtfully. I will add little things here and there, but for now, and for the first time ever, I am content with it!	episode_done:True

Previously I have almost entirely shopped vintage/thrifted my wardrobe but it’s just gotten bloated and unfocused. That being said I don’t know a lot about clothing brands. Here’s what I’m looking for:  -Ideally US made, or at the very least ethically produced. I want to avoid exploitive fast-fashion. This was a big reason I previously only thrifted.   -Decent quality, I don’t have the money to buy super high-end but I am fine with paying a little more for something that will last.   -specifically looking for some solid color cardigans and button-ups, a sweater or hoodie or two, black chinos and black jeans, and some decent priced white tees. I found that I almost always wear black pants + white shirt + black/navy/olive/beige top. I’m pretty happy with that formula right now, just looking on ways to riff on it endlessly.   -Previously I have liked Everlane and Los Angeles Apparel, if that’s any kind of frame of reference.

With a capsule wardrobe, I can have, say, 20-30 pieces and 50+ outfits with them instead of having 20-30 pieces of non-matching color schemes and having maybe 20 outfits.	labels:One more thing, if you can narrow your colors a little, it helps with cohesiveness. Like 1-2 neutrals and 2-3 colors for everything else. You still get some color, but there are a few limits. I have a rule that all my patterns need to have at least one of my colors in it. The primary color should be one of my neutrals or one of my colors, and then it can have anything else after that! If it is a pattern that prioritizes my neutral, then it also needs one of the actual colors too. In my world, that means, if I get a floral item with black, then it should have some pink. It can't be only blues, reds. and greens.
text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Hi! Former stylist.  1) Pay attention to the fit of things and figure out what cuts and shapes look good on you. Paper bag pants and some joggers have similar fits. Some mini skirts and shorts hit the same place on your legs and can have the same waist height. Find your sweet spot and don’t be afraid to buy multiple things in silhouettes that work for you.   2) Get some statement pieces that you would die for. If you are wearing a pair of jeans that fit well and a t-shit purchased within the past 3 years with some awesome earrings you going to look and feel great. If you are wearing an amazing dress and simple white sneakers you are going to look and feel great. Don’t overthink things but try and wear at LEAST one piece you are excited about at a time.   3) Don’t buy things just cause they are on sale, you saw your friend wearing it, or you feel like you “need” something in your wardrobe. You should love everything in your closet in its own special way unless it’s workwear and you hate your dress code for work. Something as simple as a T-shirt has so many different factors like cut, material, neckline, sleeve length. Purchase what feels good and don’t bother with the rest.

text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I like Lauren Messiah, she's a fashion stylist and gives good tips on how to find your personal style, different style types, how to use Pinterest as tool to find your style etc.   I mostly watch runway shows and take inspiration from them- how to wear a white shirt in unique ways, how to wear a purple skirt, etc. They are the most creative imo.

text:Let's Talk about hats	labels:There is hat etiquette from the days of yore. Here are some of the conventions that were adhered to:  A lady does not remove her hat when indoors or for the national anthem. This is in contrast to men, who are to remove hats when indoors and for the anthem. However, if you‘re sporting a baseball cap at a ballgame, I would remove it for the anthem, whereas if you were wearing a more formal outfit with hat then I would not remove it.  A hat is a daytime piece in most cases not suitable for evening wear. The fascinator is an exception to this rule, but is more of a Commonwealth/British thing.  A lady does not wear a hat in her own home, ie when receiving guests, and as a guest in a friend’s home a lady would remove her hat.

text:Thank you for this thoughtful and helpful answer! I come from the opposite end, full closet, constantly shifting from boho to grunge and then to sporty again until I was fed up with the whole "I don't know what to wear" thing - I never understood what exactly I liked about a clothing piece or style.  I ended up with some good quality basic pieces, not boring, functional, versatile and now I try to build from there. What I am really looking for are clothing pieces, in which an idea, a thought was invested - meaning there is something deliberate about it, interesting cut, texture, print. But I also want them to work together with other things I own.   Thank you for recommending Gianni and Comme des Garcons, I have some things from them and they are more affordable for me. I also like COS for good fabrics and robustness, but then again it is quite popular where I live and many people shop there too. Arket is even cheaper, but it is a little bland for me. There are also some european brands like Closed or Baum und Pferdgarten, Essentiel Antwerp, however it always depends on a particular season/trend whether I find something there or not.	labels:> Baum und Pferdgarten  Ohhh I love them, my local boutique has finally started carrying this and it’s so fun!	episode_done:True

It seems like it's all from another life now and makes me sad.	episode_done:True
text:I know “fashion” but people of minorities are always forced to try better. Some Insights	labels:As a black man I'm not surprised by this at all. I don't think I'm as affected as most because my clothes are overtly fashionable and often feminine, and that tends to disarm any preconceptions of "dangerous" and "violent". But I see it all the time, and I do notice a difference on the rare occasions I just dress plainly. Before Covid, if I walked home from the gym at night in sweats I wouldn't put my hood up or my hands in my pockets because I walked by one of campus police's favorite sitting spots. We only need to look at Trayvon Martin for confirmation. One note about the study:  > While it is tempting to tell individuals that how they dress can evoke negative biases, this avoids addressing a bigger issue … In fact, directing individuals to change what they wear places the burden of mitigating stereotypes and associated prejudices on the wearer. Instead, we need to consider how we can change the perceptions of those who hold and use such stereotypes in harmful ways.  I agree and I appreciate the sentiment, but I'll be dead before we change racists' perceptions on this. It's not a burden I or any other black man should have to carry, but realistically it's a lot easier for me to change my clothes than for a racist to change their thinking.  ETA: Black women have it way worse. They get to have racism **and** misogyny!

text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:I think that an under-discussed part of picking out a first suit for these types of things is getting out and trying them on before you buy. Being comfortable in a suit, even if it’s cheaper or in a less fashionable cut, is more important in interview settings than the eye to detail and quality that we normally discuss on here. A suit that fits in the shoulders, in a neutral color like navy or charcoal, that you know fits because you were able to try it on is way more important to your success than ordering something online that might be objectively better. Interviewers are looking for you to meet their minimum standard of professionalism, not for you to wow with with sartorial taste. Source: had a lot of interviews in college and law school.

text:TBH I feel as if there’s this underlying feeling of moral superiority that’s rooted in the minimalistic wardrobe (for some people). I’ll keep myself from getting too bashed by saying, yes for some people it’s an economic or environmental choice but for a lot it seems like... Ascetic nomad seeking moral high ground.  It’s similar to the painting community where there’s a fetish for having a minimal paint palette. Wow! You were able to paint that using only four colors?!? Who cares so long as the final product looks good??	labels:There are tons of valid reasons for wanting or needing a smaller wardrobe, for sure! But one thing that doesn't come up in the conversation often (at least that I've seen, and it was something that honestly didn't occur to me until I'd been seeing these conversations for a long time) is *laundry*. Like, if you have only a handful of items, do you also have the time and space to do washing at least once a week? That could mean having to go to a laundromat or it could mean handwashing in a sink and hanging things to dry. If you have an in-home washer and dryer (or at least washer) it's a little different, but otherwise, that is something to consider when you don't have many options...I'm not saying capsules are bad at all! Again, I think there are tons of reasons why people like them. But it was something that came up that I was like, oh yeah, that's another factor that involves some amount of privilege (because it does require time or space in a way that having 25+ shirts can give you wiggle room with...) Pros and cons to both...

Thanks for the review and introducing the brand. Winston & co seem to have launched some time this year? How has the cardigan been since you've had for a month or so. If it's made by S&C, I presume it's still immaculate as it can be.   It's unlikely that I'll pick up any cardigans or knitwear this year, but I like to compile a list and plan for future years.

text:Most westerners seem to have a big preference for uniqlo. I've checked them out locally, and in multiple countries. Quality is consistent across the board and good for the price.   I would say both brands are about even in quality cause Gap is actually pretty good especially when on sale (my experience is limited to Gap Japan though). The T shirt fabrics for both brands are nice, but a bit thin if that matters (tropical weather here so these are a big plus for me). Uniqlo has great collabs though and some of the seasonal collab designs might appeal to you.   I think for the dress shirts and pants...youre probably gonna have to base your decision on price, fit, and design preferences. That's what I'd prioritize when choosing between budget-ish brands anyways.	labels:	episode_done:True

I work in an office that is fairly casual so I'm not sure what I would do with dress pants or a blazer or even a "classic" white top.

For an evening dress I’ll spend $$$ for good quality, design, etc.   I just bought a $400 leather jacket.   So I guess the answer is it just depends!

text:20 Sweaters for Less Than $150, So You Can Achieve Peak Coziness - Esquire.com	labels:In my experience, sweaters are one of the few garments where there's a noticeable increase in quality as you spend more money.  Cheaper sweaters are noticeably thinner (both the threads and the sweater itself), which don't keep you as warm and don't last as long.   The good news is that there are some great options for getting high quality sweaters at low prices if you're willing to shop secondhand. For $150 you can find a gently used sweaters from Ines Meain and IMO that's a much better purchase than most of the cotton and fine merino wool sweaters listed in this article.

text:Looking for aesthetically pleasing pajamas	labels:I will put in a rave review for Recliner pajamas. I now own way too many sets to mention, as I've been slowly replacing all my pj's with this brand.   I have the second skin nightgown which is a midi length nightdress that is super flattering, yes you could call it sexy (my husband does). I also love the PJ set long sleeve version.   Not silk, not gauze, but infinitely washable -- my very first purchase is 4 or 5 years old now and I've washed it every week and it still looks brand new, no piling, no stretching, no fading. It holds up to its claim and you can wear over and over again without getting stanky. I say this as someone who's been wearing this brand since I was perimenopausal and had hot flashes.   The second skin nightie is cut in a way that is super flattering--- but so are the Pj's which i am basically living in since COVID. I just sleep too hot so the PJ's are for day and the nightie is for night.  I did give the Lilly Silk Pj's a try but they don't stretch at all and just weren't as flattering or as comfortable.  I tried Lunya as well but I'm 5'0 and they were designed for very slim and tall people.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 24	labels:I love buying clothes for my husband, but finding the right fit is hard. He's 5'8" with a 6'4" wingspan.

text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:Love poshmark! I got really nice clothes (like a cashmere sweater) for a very good price. If your style veers towards what's on style at the moment, you'll have a harder time finding it/pay a good price. But mine veers towards simple/trendless/hint of vintage-y things so it's perfect for me.	episode_done:True

text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:As much as I want to try many scents, I've worn Glossier You since 2018 and people associate it with me / recognize me by it now, so it's my "signature scent." I love how it smells anyway so I'm sticking with it. It's pretty affordable compared to a lot of fragrances I've seen and having just one appeals to my minimalist sensibilities.  In middle school my fav was Avril Lavigne Black Star. 😂	episode_done:True

text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:I definitely changed my wardrobe up when I lost weight. I wore a lot of black, a lot of graphic tees, hoodies and straight cut jeans, basketball shorts, cargo shorts. I definitely am now in the “basic bastard” category of dress. No more black, but more subtle natural colors like dark green, navy, browns, etc. avoid sneakers and big logos but instead casual boots and such. Oh and everything slim fit, but obviously not ridiculously slim. Levi’s 511, J crew 484, etc. I definitely experimented when I was dropping weight and still had to dress business casual. But yeah don’t overthink.	episode_done:True

text:I think it can look amazing regardless of your shape. It's a stiffer material that falls in a very flattering way.	labels:I think they mean for weight gain.

text:You are describing it perfectly. It feels fine at the clothing store probably because I'm so excited about how it looks and the atmosphere of the store. I avoid malls like the plague for this reason. Then I go to sit down for a long period in the office and I'm realizing how weird and sweaty the fabric makes me in certain parts on my body or the seams are rubbing me weird at random times in the office.   I have one pair of Aritzia pants that I love that have a stretchy band on the back. There's a sale right now, I think I'll just get a few more pairs. I used to like some stuff from Banana Republic too but the last time I went into the store, I found a lot of their shirts had poorly made seams, it made me really sad. I also used to love the JCrew that was not at the outlet but that closed down because their outlet business killed their regular retail.  My whole journey with this is the realization that ADHD can make me appear not serious because of my tendency to talk like my head is on shuffle and talk too much. Works great for my specific job, it's like a superpower. However, I do think I have a tendency to come off as a slob or not serious on occasion. I realized I need a bit of contrast in how I present myself to the world instead of just resorting to hiding. With my medications, I can actually get up and get ready without feeling overwhelmed thinking about all the steps of putting on makeup because there's no direct consequence to me not wearing makeup even though I love it.	labels:	episode_done:True

It’s baffling how wrong the remake is.	episode_done:True
text:Thanks for responding! I agree with the last paragraph I have a 20-70 and have been shooting between 55-70 mostly for the portraits. Thanks for the ideas with getting more stylized shots with the wider lens, I'll definitely explore trying some more unique angles out.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Dang alright then... To each their own! I love having fun with wild fashions and I try to encourage people to do the same, but I've actually been pretty conservative in my day-to-day choices lately. Maybe I'm projecting a little! :P	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:I actually find most people are in the same boat as you, so I wouldn't worry too much.  It does take a lot of time and effort and money to keep up with fashion.  It helps to think of it as a hobby; and people who are really put together generally go about it with the zeal of, say, a stamp collector and stamps.  Just like how some people are basketball enthusiasts and others are gardening enthusiasts, there's really no reason you have to be into fashion.  I find that there's this really pervasive expectation that women all ought to naturally love clothes and fashion; and any failure to invest in that interest is a failure in some biological sensibility.     If you find yourself struggling, then I really do recommend getting a stylist or tailor or ideally both.  The stylist will push you to try things outside your comfort, the tailor will help you with fit issues, and having both can really be transformative in a very quick and immediate way.  But in terms of continuing your education or interest--that really depends on whether you want to make this a bit of a hobby.  It does take time and effort and money, after all.  And if you don't naturally find yourself interested; well, there's no sense in forcing yourself just in the name of "fitting in" to some perceived societal norm.       I assure you, from Paris to Shanghai, there are plenty of women who would rather learn the nuances of cement than spend any time pondering the fit of a pair of trousers; and there's nothing wrong with that.	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: What do your shoes say about you?	labels:Hey hey! You'd like to think you are creative and into fashion and not getting old but really you just wear the same pair of boots everyday because you have slowly started prioritizing comfort over style but still try to justify it as an actual ~aesthetic~ and totally not because you now have bunions and corns and fallen arches and other old feet problems (why do things between my toes now bother me?!). #Blundstones4Lyfe #oldhagat32
text:I have a similar body type, though recently it’s gotten very slightly curvier. I’ve felt the same way, but literally everyone does this, not just us! Clothes create illusions. You’re not a fraud at all.   I’d also consider who you’re dressing for, like the other reply said. If you love what you wear obviously don’t do different because of something I say! But I felt a lot better about myself when I stopped trying to change my body type with clothes (which doesn’t mean I stopped wearing all of my more “flattering” pieces). But I actually found a lot more confidence dressing in clothes that are easier for us to pull off. For me, that’s 1920s and 1960s inspired dresses. The “sack” shape and drop waists are actually often really flattering on us (even with my short legs) and it’s unique because most people don’t find them flattering.   Yes, I probably look less traditionally sexy. But I’ve gotten lots of positive comments on the style that mean more to me anyway. I’ve gotten “Mad Men” comments so some people think it’s sexy anyway!   My advice is to step out of your comfort zone and try to find things that make you feel wonderful outside of people’s expectations of what your naked body should look like.   Good luck! I’m sure you look stunning.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:People should watch old seasons of the bachelor if they don’t believe this. Professionally styled TV glosses over or tones down some of the trends you forgot about. The ladies of reality TV, on the other hand, really deliver.	labels:Personally I enjoy watching early seasons of Project Runway and being flabbergasted by what I once thought was “timeless” or “neutral”
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:To add onto the rest of the great advice in this thread, following the color trends can be helpful in seeing how color looks on others and how you can apply them to yourself. I follow some accounts that specifically photograph folks during fashion week in various locales, and there's so much vibrancy that occurs there with colors that you might not expect to fit together. It helps to have these (kind of) practical examples in mind before you go on blowing money on colorful goods.  I've never actually done a color analysis, personally, but intuitively over time you will get a sense for what flatters you. You can even try holding random household items like Clorox wipes (lol) or notebooks up to your face or skin to see if that color would work as an actual item on you, preferably in good natural lighting where it won't distort the tones so much. I also like to accessorize with one small bright thing at a time, like bags, belts, scarves, or jewelry. Another way to do this is with wearing nail polish, either different colors on your nails all at once or specific parts of a palette to see if that combination is flattering with your skin tone.	episode_done:True
text:So happy to hear this expressed so well.  I am short.  I've been, at various times, self conscious about it & listened to the seemingly universally accepted notion that it is desirable to look taller.  Now, the idea that taller is objectively better is a crap idea I bought into mindlessly.  I'm embracing my height and rebelling against choosing my clothes with the aim of looking taller.  I will buy what I like and what I think looks good.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession). I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession 🤣

Everything is really simple and it's definitely ~ F A S H I O N ~ with the Alden boots, selvedge, etc. but it's such an approachable outfit.

text:General Discussion - October 25	labels:One of our old friend families we keep in touch with since they moved to the city beside ours has started to go off the deep end with COVID/qanon conspiracy stuff on FB. My wife is much closer to the wife and was really having some distress. My wife works in public health and directly with our COVID response.  Anyways, my wife posted a comment on a particularly inflammatory post and basically said it was affecting their friendship. They wound up having a phone call and it actually turned out positively, with the other person asking for some more information to look at contrary to her views.  Anyways, for now it was a positive outcome from something where I thought we’d have to cut someone out of our lives. Hard because our kids are friends too.  Also we had a provincial election here yesterday and our left-of-Centre (NDP) party absolutely wiped the floor with the centre-right party which is nice. They’ve done a good job with COVID and other stuff so happy to keep going with that.

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:Personally, I don't feel constrained because I feel like heels have kind of fallen out of style.

And even if it's a fancy outfit I'll wear flats.	episode_done:True

text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:I buy from The RealReal and sometimes Poshmark.   Poshmark has really good prices on some items, especially if I'm looking for something specific and not high-end, like a certain Express top I read about. (Ebay can be useful for this, too.) Prices on higher-end stuff aren't competitive IME, but I haven't looked for much in that range. Also be aware the shipping cost per item will add a good chunk to a cheap piece.  Prices on The RealReal are not cheap, but if you hang out a while you get a sense of what's decent, and sometimes you find something really neat for good deal. The best feature of TRR is measurements, something that's ruined me for other sites at that price point. It helps to be familiar with your own measurements and take into account materials and the shape of your body--I'm short, for example, so measurements are all well and good, but if my hips hit at the waist they don't mean much.   Caveats there: Be attentive to whether or not something is returnable; it's published on each listing. Bags usually aren't, as well as anything whose price has been marked down a lot. Also, shipping costs are $12 each way, so I eat the cost and buy several items in the same order, knowing I'll return half of them if they don't fit right. Shopping there successfully is a bit of a learning process, but I've really liked it overall.	episode_done:True
text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:kind of all of them? It seems like you have to pay pretty steep prices now to get the quality of clothes that mid-price mall brands had in the 1990s and early 2000s. It seems that most stores have switched to a model of selling poor quality pieces at huge markups with the expectation that they will sell most of the stock at clearance prices. The GAP used to have quality staples, and J Crew was "fancy." Now GAP is really the same quality as Old Navy, and don't know what J Crew is anymore. The quality has certainly dropped, but I also don't get what is up with the designs since you can't even get a reasonable women's suit there these days. Madewell is not made well. Anthropologie used to sell unique pieces with really good construction, now it's roughly the same as other fast fashion, though I do appreciate that they added petite and plus sizing and carry some high end brands too. Levi's main line is terrible now, and to get the heritage quality, you need to get the Made and Crafted line, which is really expensive!  I mostly shop secondhand because I can't afford the stuff I like. When buying new, I try to wait for sales and avoid buying anything "final sale" or with complicated returns unless I know it will work. Clothes that I used to get at Anthropologie, I now get from Sezane, Ulla Johnson, Doen, and Samantha Pleet. I started buying vintage jeans over Madewell/Levi's or expensive craft brands—my 1980s Chic and Gitano jeans were probably sold at K-Mart/Target but are better quality than anything I have gotten from Madewell. I don't wear jeans/denim enough to justify craft denim prices. Patagonia is still very high quality technical wear; I just scope out the Tyler sport outlet and secondhand for deals. Shoes are hard because I don't like to get them secondhand. I switched from Adidas to Veja and Diemme for sneakers (you can find Diemme shoes for huge markdowns on Yoox during the winter and summer sales—I don't think they are worth retail price).
text:For 1. What pants do you recommend for people who are thin but carry a bit more weight in the core (stomach and butt) instead of their legs and thighs.	labels:It’s hard to say. Even for people who put on weight in the core does it go “out” or “sideways”? Everybody’s body is so different. It’s hard to tell what looks good without trying on different things but usually people are a pretty good judge of what “works” once they find it! Just keep an open mind and be willing to take stuff into a dressing room. A big butt or rounded stomach/hips can be sexy! If you are looking to “hide” something however a good trick is to split it up -ie. layering or accessorizing with a belt, jacket, longer necklace etc.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:I'm a Sagittarius with a Taurus moon, so my formula is just abject chaos but make it luxe (ie. I wear a flat gold herringbone chain, gold or tortoiseshell earrings, a little gold watch, and a gold signet ring + my engagement ring at all times, even if I'm wearing leggings and a sweatshirt to play Stardew Valley all day).   More seriously, my jewellery basically never changes (see above), so I guess that's my formula? I wear that combo whether I'm wearing a dress and heels to go out (in theory, who even remembers going out?) or jeans and a sweatshirt to go to the grocery store (in theory, we just do pick up orders now). I did just get a new big-girl job, so maybe this will change as I'm able to better afford the wild 1940s wardrobe of my dreams?	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I often buy multiples of items I love. I bought several of the same cardigan after I realized that I wore it more than any other sweater I owned. It's great!  Another thing I do is, when I see an item I like, I mentally run through my closet and see if it will mesh with what I already own. If it works, I get it. If I'd have to buy several new items to make it work, I don't. For this reason, I don't own many t-shirts, but I do own lots of sweaters and dresses.

Your friend wants contemporary fashion, but most bespoke tailors make traditional clothes for a typically older crowd (you're in NYC though so there are some bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd; make sure you look for them specifically). The bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd don't have designs as good as high end ready to wear IMO. Tailoring and designing are different skills, and there's a reason Louis Vuittion, YSL, Dior, Gucci, etc pay their head designers millions per year. Of course some $4000 coats are worth more than others, so it would be good to know a bit about general quality.  Personally, I prioritize design over fit. I can deal with a less than perfect fit if I love the design of a piece. But I won't wear a piece if I don't love the design, even if it fits well.   The middle ground option is made to measure, or MTM. MTM for outerwear isn't as common for suiting, but it's out there.

I really just want to impress girls with my style but I never know what to wear or what girls like. I wear a bunch of different styles like hippie and business casual.
text:Yeah I hear that and my heart does ache!  I have a wool Aran cable sweater that I love but it is indeed itchy AF.  I'm usually wearing long sleeves below it so don't feel it, but a lot of sweaters you'll have at least a little contact at the wrists and neck.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 20, 2021	labels:My partner is now officially my spouse. I now wear a ring which will look good with my fits, but feels really weird being just ... there on my hand, all the time now.  They vetoed me posting pictures (we have public facing jobs, these pictures are all over social media, too easy to reverse image search etc.), but they wore a Rick Owens dress (that I picked out) while I went full minimalism with a collarless shirt with onyx studs, a sleek blazer and cropped trousers. I put this together from my existing wardrobe, since we didn't want to spend a lot. Covid measures made things a bit weird, but the court officer made a real effort into making it nice, which was great. (edit: just so nobody thinks we are totally irresponsible: it was literally just us at city hall, no guests, no party. We'll catch up with that after vaccination.)  It was fun seeing all y'all Americans count down to my wedding day.
text:How do you search for and find clothes from pinterest?	labels:I think it just comes down to learning the vocab. You might search "pleated miniskirt" for the skirt, or "dark green tennis skirt," I think your problem might be that you're running into different types of pleated skirts. And for the top maybe "bib front blouse", "peter pan collar blouse", "tuxedo blouse" depending on which of those elements appeals to you (I'm not 100% sure what the blouse is though).	episode_done:True
text:How does everyone here dress when bloated?	labels:Comfy pants paired with an oversized blazer! It doesn't even have to be oversized, just long enough to swoop over and hide your tummy. It looks sharp and you won't look at all like you're dressing for comfort!	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 18, 2020	labels:I really want to put together an album to offend lurkers now.
text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:I think it depends on the bag you want! If you really truly want a specific Dior bag for example but don’t want to spend $3k on it, you could probably spend about $300 on a nice rep. If you actually just want a specific shape/leather type, you can probably look at Coach and Tory Burch, or even smaller contemporary brands like Mansur Gavriel or Polene.  I’d recommend making a wishlist of bags and write out pros and cons of getting authentic pieces vs replicas, including price and how much you actually want it.  For a while I’ve been spending money on contemporary brands and a few auth designer bags, but recently I’ve been fulfilling my bag wishlist through reps and it feels liberating honestly. You can save money and still get the bag you truly want, and if there’s a bag you really like and you want to support the designer in some way besides wearing their logo/brand, you can always save up for and buy the auth.	episode_done:True

text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:I tend to purchase from Old Navy, Target, and various mall brands most often. I get pretty good longevity out of most of what I buy. I especially like to get athletic wear from Old Navy. My current supply of compression shorts/leggings from Old Navy are from 2016.  These are some of my longest lived items from fast fashion.  Fleece fall coat from TJ Maxx - 2012 - This was my go-to coat for chilly weather for several years. Now I just wear it for an extra layer on cold hikes, but it's still in really good condition. Has a couple of burn marks on the sleeve from bonfires though.  Running shorts (Nike knock-offs) from Wal-Mart - 2012 - I bought 2 pairs when I started running back then and 1 pair finally failed on me this past week (thread came out of the decorative piping). These have been a godsend during my pregnancy this summer (comfy elastic band for my growing stomach) and I've actually bought 4 more pairs off Poshmark to keep them in my rotation.  Navy blue trouser slacks from New York & Co. - 2014 - I bought these shortly after starting my first job after college. Wore them a lot at that first job, not as much at my second since I could wear jeans instead.	episode_done:True

text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:I probably spend on average $150-$200 a month on clothes (that includes workout stuff, loungewear lately, undergarments, etc.). That’s maybe 2-3% of my take home income. I’m probably a bit older than you though.   Honestly in college/post college I almost never shopped because I was so broke, which lead me to going a bit crazy once I did have disposable income.   I kind of think of clothes shopping in terms of “needs” and “wants,” but it sounds like new clothes aren’t really either for you right now. If that’s the case, don’t buy just to buy - keep spending your money on the things that make you happy.	episode_done:True

The mark that you have left for others will ripple into the way all of your readers will spend time with their own style. It means a lot to me to see someone who cares about where there clothing is sourced and that their habits related to shopping were not always perfect. This was relatable. Inspiring.  Also, your messy hair is always so chic. Your outfits seem to tell a composed and thoughtfulness that you don't see on fashion models or bloggers. This was truly great. Bravo.  Also, if I may ask where your black jeans are from in the second photo of 2020 going left to right. I saw you linked a boot cut pair from NA-KD. Are these the same?	episode_done:True
text:If anyone is looking for minimalistic and smaller jewelry here's a couple recommendations  www.miansai.com - Simple and clean designs with a few designs having some flare.

text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:I don’t plan to save any. Sounds terrible but after the pressure I got from my mom and MIL to wear some of their own wedding stuff I am just going to live my life and let my kids live theirs. Sure they might miss out on some vintage stuff but there’s no guarantee that my stuff will become cool again, that my things won’t be damaged by mold, bugs, yellowing etc. in decades of storage, or that they will be the same size as me
text:[Inspiration] Jewelry	labels:Nice album OP. I've been into jewelry for some time. I've always liked bracelets and such, but lately I've been into rings. Just wish I had the guts (and budget) to start wearing them. It's one of these things that I like seeing others wear but I feel that wouldn't be able to pull of.  I might start to wear bracelets again and go from there.

text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:I had to revamp my wardrobe over the last two years as I changed jobs and sizes.   I had just finished a no-buy year, while I lost weight so was starting with nothing at all.   1. Buy decent undergarments. As a large busted woman, I can’t tell how anything fits without a good fitting bra. There’s r/abrathatfits to get a good measurement as many women are wearing the wrong bras. I got a size and sister size from this, went to a bra shop with a good range of bras and tried a few on to find one everyday one that fitted perfectly. Get a decent sports bra while you are there if you exercise at any speed above a gentle stroll.   2. Know what you need for where. Having items for work, weekend and exercise is important. Some people don’t separate work and weekend wear that much and others have wardrobes that look like they belong to different people.   3. Start with one or two items/outfits (especially if trying a new look) before committing. There’s no point in buying a whole wardrobe that later doesn’t feel right. I had a strong sense of what I liked and still bought a couple of oopsies.   4. A classic/go-to item might not be a classic for you. I love the look of skirts but never ever wear them. I only wear trousers and/or dresses so wasted my money on a couple of classic black skirts for work. I have worn them exactly 0 times.   5. Take risks in the dressing room. Try different colours and silhouettes on in actual shops and think about what you like/don’t like about each piece. I have changed my style a bit as it is free to try it on!   5. A decent blazer that fits well makes any outfit more formal when you need it- even us more casual people.	episode_done:True

I have a lot of art and vintage stuff I love to death, but when it comes down to it I can't take it.  I am one of four people who would have to go in the same car, so I can't take too much. Here's my inventory. Nothing for work because if I have to leave my house my work is closed down too.   Clothing: seven pairs of socks, seven pairs of underpants, a comfy bra, a set of pj's (flannel shorts and nostalgic t-shirt), a cute comfy sweater, a pair of jeans, a pair of Adidas superstar shoes, a pair of bamboo leggings with pockets, two tank tops, 2 t-shirts, a flannel button up, and a rain jacket  Self care: inhaler, Advil, toothbrush , toothpaste, deodorant, face wash, face moisturizer, setting powder, fave eyeshadow pallet, waterproof eyeliner, waterproof mascara, lip tint, brow gel, hair brush, and fave scrunchie    Other: small box of photos, external hard rive, laptop, phone charger, box of important papers, cat carrier, cat kibble, cat blanket,cat treats, cat brush, box of valuable jewelry, favourite childhood doll  *edit: for those concerned, cat is not listed as packed because Winston does not enjoy being in his crate.	episode_done:True

text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:To me it's more about the materials and cuts than it is about the pieces, because fabric and cut define the range of casual, to business casual, to professional, to formal, etc. The same type of item can look any of these all depending on the fabric and cut. That's how I view it.	episode_done:True

text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Some websites (department stores, ASOS) have a true fit tool where you put in your measurements, body type, and well fitting item of clothing and that information is used to recommend sizing.   It’s also a good idea to know your measurements in general if you’re buying secondhand as many sellers will list the measurements of the garment.  But overall sizing can be so wild within one brand, much less across multiple that I dint think there’s much of a rule of thumb.

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:I'd say to some degree yes. Most fashion houses are rtw/couture first and accessories second. They dipped into the handbag and accessories market to make more money, but the real quality (and bread and butter) for most fashion houses is their rtw.   Chanel is in this weird spot where they're trying to outrun the secondhand market and regain the exclusivity they once had. They're trying to be Hermes but they could never be Hermes because Chanel is not known for their leather.   So yes, I think when it comes to handbags/SLGs/accessories most luxury houses are trying to put out the latest and greatest and kind of mimic fast fashion to some degree. They're appealing to a market that can't afford to become their regular clientele. The people whom they can't text when the latest $7000 tweed jacket is released each season and know that they can walk away with a $10,000+ sale. So brands are trying to push out the latest and greatest handbags, SLGs and shoes.   In terms of rtw, I do think the traditional fashion calendar is very fast paced, but several brands have said they will step away from the traditional calendar and cut it back down to 2-3 releases per year. It will be interesting to see what this means for S/S and F/W collections.   Commenting more on the handbag/accessories market:  I say this as someone is kind of handbag crazy, but I do wish people would do more research about the brands and bags they purchase. People assume that just because a bag is marked up it's handmade by an artisan who specializes in leather but that isn't the case for most brands.   If anyone is looking for Hermes alternatives I highly suggest Delvaux. Valextra and Moynat also have fantastic craftsmanship. But I bought my first box leather bag from Delvaux last year and it's on a completely different level from Chanel.
text:Office Clothes	labels:I like to buy off Mercari. My favorite brands are bcbgmaxazria, free people and Guess.

My style is what I’d consider to be prep/ivy with a little bit of Americana thrown in (lots of OCBDs, donegal sweaters, chinos, with more rugged boots like Viberg and the occasional Chelsea). My concern is that it might look a little costume-y, as if I’m missing the motorcycle and everything else that’s required with a black denim jacket.
text:General Discussion - November 16, 2020	labels:Wow these fits are hard to take seriously. Oh, what’s that? What do *I* wear? I dress in color with modern cuts. What are modern cuts, you ask? How do you not know? You fool. They have good colors. They have *modern* cuts. What are you not getting? They’re unlike the shit colored trash bag silhouettes you all wear. And by all, I mean *ALL*. There’s no variance, no personality in any of your echo chamber outfits. My friends and I used to dress like this 10 years ago anyways. Not only are these cuts not modern, but, even worse, they’re unoriginal.   ^ an aggregate of my favorite lurker takes in the fit battle thread. Can we get a lurkerbot made? Think that would be amazing

text:More Men Reach for Sewing Machines	labels:Mom was a nurse and so I grew up hanging around a nursing home. In that time I learned to sew, knit, and crochet and it's interesting how much of a stigma there was around it, I just loved to create things. This was in the 90s. One woman would even tell me not to be ashamed, that there was a football player who knit (name escapes me).  I've had friends recently finally notice a lot of my mending and sewing machine, and ask if it was a pandemic thing. Like, no it's just not something you really talk about for some reason.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:Bought a hoodie as a gift for someone. She specifically asked for the one I got; she provided the link and all. It arrived and was a major disappointment. The fabric was thin, the cuts and seams were weird as hell, sleeves were short, and more. It was obvious that it was just a "straight from crappy manufacturer" product with lies on the website. What's unfortunate is that I had a feeling prior to ordering it that it wasn't going to be good. It's just hard to tell someone that they're not good at identifying scam-like products that are all too common nowadays on FB and Insta.	episode_done:True
text:Congrats on being able to darn yourself. That's something I need to practice.  I too find it strange that sewing crafts have been deemed "unmanly." I learned how to sew (as well as cross-stitch, latch hook, needlepoint, and a bunch of other thread crafts; not to mention ironing too) when I was really little. I think its more "manly" to be able to take care of your own wardrobe (amongst other "feminine" household tasks) than it is to have to get someone else to do it for you.  Plus, some of my favorite clothing label and/or designers are men.	labels:It's a shame that more men aren't into it! I made so many toys for myself as a kid by hand and eventually machine sewing, I still have them kicking around. Nothing adds more sentimental value than making/fixing something yourself.	episode_done:True
text:>but if it was a very memorable outfit like a bright coloured pant suit I think some more observant people might wonder if I hadn’t had a chance to go home the night before  I work in IT.

Someone saw me and commented I must have been having a good time partying the previous night as I was in the same clothes as yesterday. One of my team had to almost drag me back into the server room before I could do more than growl I had been working all night fixing things.

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:kind of all of them? It seems like you have to pay pretty steep prices now to get the quality of clothes that mid-price mall brands had in the 1990s and early 2000s. It seems that most stores have switched to a model of selling poor quality pieces at huge markups with the expectation that they will sell most of the stock at clearance prices. The GAP used to have quality staples, and J Crew was "fancy." Now GAP is really the same quality as Old Navy, and don't know what J Crew is anymore. The quality has certainly dropped, but I also don't get what is up with the designs since you can't even get a reasonable women's suit there these days. Madewell is not made well. Anthropologie used to sell unique pieces with really good construction, now it's roughly the same as other fast fashion, though I do appreciate that they added petite and plus sizing and carry some high end brands too. Levi's main line is terrible now, and to get the heritage quality, you need to get the Made and Crafted line, which is really expensive!  I mostly shop secondhand because I can't afford the stuff I like. When buying new, I try to wait for sales and avoid buying anything "final sale" or with complicated returns unless I know it will work. Clothes that I used to get at Anthropologie, I now get from Sezane, Ulla Johnson, Doen, and Samantha Pleet. I started buying vintage jeans over Madewell/Levi's or expensive craft brands—my 1980s Chic and Gitano jeans were probably sold at K-Mart/Target but are better quality than anything I have gotten from Madewell. I don't wear jeans/denim enough to justify craft denim prices. Patagonia is still very high quality technical wear; I just scope out the Tyler sport outlet and secondhand for deals. Shoes are hard because I don't like to get them secondhand. I switched from Adidas to Veja and Diemme for sneakers (you can find Diemme shoes for huge markdowns on Yoox during the winter and summer sales—I don't think they are worth retail price).
text:Everyone’s opinions on Youtube fashion channels?	labels:I only follow 2-3 fashion youtubers now. This might sound really snobby but I can’t stand the way alot of fashion/beauty youtubers talk about their clothing. It’s hard to explain.. like it’s pretty clear they’re only wearing certain items for the sponsorship paycheck. They’re not very well spoken, and their style is kinda boring IMO	episode_done:True
text:How would you store sentimental clothing?	labels:Get some good pictures of anything that is precious to you.  Nice background on a dressmakers dummy. If it’s something you can wear a nice formal picture or happy photo of you wearing it. Store them digitally. I lost everything I had in a fire and I wish I had this advice. As far as the physical item,store in acid free paper in a bridal storage box.	episode_done:True

text:Indochino VS Local custom clothier (HM Cole). My fair review.	labels:I live in an area with a few indo stores near me. I have one suit and one blazer made by them.   I have a very V tapered build with a 12-14" drop so literally nothing OTR fits me or will fit me.   I was measured there and had a few after alterations by them and the result is fine.  For the $$ it's good value.  However, I want a high quality closet and find it absolutely worthwhile to spend the extra $$ for SS - Full Canvas MTM. The fit on my SS suits and materials just feel a world ahead of Indo.	episode_done:True
text:Happiest Season Inspo Album because I have a big gay crush on Kristen Stewart	labels:I feel like oversized blazers are still the trendy thing, which is why that’s all you’ll find at like Zara, asos, etc. Lots of more workwear focused stores still have more traditional and slim cuts.

text:WEEKLY DEALZ!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: What are the different use cases of boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes, and loafers?	labels:For me, the simplest distintiction would look at it in terms of the casual vs. formal.  Obvious with the name, boat shoes and driving shoes were originally designed for people who wanted stability/comfort when operating a boat or vehicle. But nowadays, boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes are all meant for casual outfits when you don't want to wear sneakers. They can be worn with tees and jeans, casual button downs, chinos etc for just a regular night out or weekend errands.  Loafers on the other hand, have a large variety (ie. penny loafers, horsebit loafers, chunky lug sole loafers that are trendy right now, unlined Belgian loafers, etc) that they can go from casual to formal. I would even argue that velvet slippers that people match with tuxedos would fall into the loafers category too. The popular look this summer had been pairing Weejun loafers with Patagonia baggies for a more casual look but the loafers on the higher-end price points (Gucci loafers, John Lobb, Baudoin and Lange, etc) can easily be paired with suits and tuxedos.

text:THIS. I have been working on a lot of \~self improvement\~ this year and part of making my goals for 2021 has been distinguishing "the person I aspire to be" from "the person I am willing to be" from "the person I can afford to be."   I too have been on a journey to live a budget life of luxury especially when it comes to things like matching lingerie all the time and sleepwear and what I've realized is that I'm not actually interested in luxurious sleepwear. I'm actually interested in being the person that has two hours to unwind every night, takes a warm bath in a massive tub with a v expensive lush bath bomb, does a full face care routine, brushes her hair out, has little tinctures on her vanity to apply just a bit of perfume, puts on a silk gown, lights a candle, reads in bed, and turns out her lamp at a generous 9:30pm.   The truth is that the desire for the sleepwear is really a desire to have more silence, more time spent on me, and more time doing things that look and feel good simply because I like them and not because they serve any kind of real function.   I have moved away from using old t-shirts because I like the idea of dedicated sleepwear but I usually just go with a solid color cami / tank top / shirt and either some shorts or some sweat pants depending on how cold it is. They're cheaper but still look thoughtful.	labels:This is so beautifully articulated that it made feel things.	episode_done:True

Over the past couple years I’ve switched to buying almost all fun socks, and just a couple boring ones for when absolutely necessary.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: what does your shopping process look like?	labels:I have a 'To Buy' Google doc that I update constantly. It has two main sections: an 'asap'/need section, and a 'consider' section. I only buy clothes/shoes/accessories if there's a 'hole' in my wardrobe- something I feel is missing, either because I need to replace, expand, etc.   I also window shop on TRR constantly, and Nordstrom and REI sometimes. I save things I like within my price range (including things that are currently too expensive, as they could go on sale). I save things I come across elsewhere that I like to Pinterest.   When I have something in the 'asap' category, I check my saves in the most applicable app/store, and choose from there.	episode_done:True

text:I did not know this, so this is great advice. Are there more examples of retailers who do this?	labels:Electronics like TVs, computers, and appliances are known to have inferior BF counterparts. Cosmetics too, especially if they're sold in holiday kits. Not sure about clothing though; the Levi's were just an example I made up. I think it's more common among mass market/fast fashion retailers who have high turnover and can push out tons of product in a short amount of time. Think H&M, Forever 21, etc.  A good rule of thumb is that if it's too good to be true, it probably is. If you have to shop at all, go with stores that have generous return policies so you're not stuck with unwearable crap. A quick Google search pulls up lots of guides about what to avoid on BF, so that's a good place to start.

text:FAQ: What is the environmental impact of different fabrics?	labels:Linen is quite amazing in that regard :  \- it doesn't have many natural predators so doesn't require a lot of pesticides, if any.  \- There's no need to water it AT ALL if you've chosen the field's location well, as natural precipitations will be enough.  \- Little to no chemical fertilizers are used, since they actively destroy linen's quality by making it lay on the floor.  \- Requires much less energy to weave into fabric than most other fibers, and is beautiful un-dyed.  \- It's a natural fabric, so recyclable.  \- Finally, since it wicks humidity and doesn't retain odors under "normal" conditions, you don't need to wash it as frequently, and since it has a "wrinkly" nature that is embraced by connoisseurs, you can get away with not ironing it.
text:Those of you who, like me, don't have a closet (sob).. how do you organize your clothing/shoes/accessories/jewelry?	labels:I’m in a railroad apt built in the early 1900s; lots of walls and no closets.   The Ikea closet systems are kind of amazing.  I have the tension rod system (floor to ceiling) with a large deep dresser, clothing rod, and cubbies at the top. I had an old over the door hook rail that I put on the clothes bar so I can hang worn-but-still-clean-clothes on hooks. Clean ones are on hangers. My sister got the PAX system for her place and is really happy with it.    I also have a normal dresser that I put anything foldable in to, including intimates. It’s also my “night stand”.   Shoes - i keep a few high use ones by the door. I have a shoe rack elsewhere. My entryway is nonexistant, otherwise I’d prefer to have the shoe rack near the door too. Got a slim one from Yamazaki. Occasion shoes and seasonal (snow boots for example) stay boxed and under or ontop of my Ikea closet until they’re needed. Then they go in the daily area.   Out of season clothes are in bins under my bed.   Jewelry and accessories - long stuff like necklaces, high use scarves, and long earrings are just hanging on a 5 tier pants hanger. The kind where you can release each bar? I had it laying around and it was cheap.  Smaller earrings and rings are in a jewelry box.   I have a peg rack for coats.   Overall you also have to have less stuff when you don’t have big closet space.	episode_done:True

It's fine if you are curious about what about this (or, in another context, X wristwatch from Y wristwatch, or whatever) makes it significantly more expensive than the average backpack.

text:How do ya'll express your culture or traditional fashion in modern clothing?	labels:My ethnicity is...half white American, half white English. Everyone already wears my culture's traditional clothing.  The world gets so much more rich and interesting and dynamic when people can feel comfortable wearing more of the clothing from their cultural traditions. I love this movement.

text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:As I gotten older, my weight has mostly gone to my thighs. So my emo/scene skinny neon jeans didn't really fit. I've also kinda changed how I view myself in general. So I've kept the music but changed the pants. I wear a lot of high waist loose/straight leg pants now. Most of my pants aren't jeans either. I've really gotten into other fabrics.	episode_done:True

I'm officially that queer woman who goes to the bar with her keys clipped onto her belt loop with a carabiner so I don't have to carry a purse
text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:I’be always loved dressing over the top and a thing I had to learn to get over quickly was the stares. If I notice someone staring at me, I stare back and give a little wave to let them know I can see them too. If they were admiring my outfit, they wave back or just straight up tell me they like my fit. If they were judging me, they usually go red and pretend I don’t exist.

text:This is the highest comment right now, so I just want to point out to other casual jewelry owners that fine jewelry holds value. It's highly unlikely that freshwater pearls you buy at retail are going to resell at a similar price, vs AAA Akoya pearls.  >Goes to show how easy it is to farm them  Farmed pearls aren't as valuable as natural pearls - similar to natural vs synthetic (aka lab) diamonds. The rarity of a natural pearl drives/retains its value.  >if you're savvy about how to shop and willing to compromise on quality, these items are all affordable.  This... really confuses me in a thread about investment grade jewelry. Store of value investments typically don't suddenly become more affordable; they aren't considered sound investments if this is the case. (There are exceptions, like copper, whose value is tied to demand for construction, but that's different than gems.) This statement is like trying to claim you can buy a blue chip stock on sale. Happens with recessions or a major event, but the majority of the time it can be counted on as a stable store of value.	labels:Fine jewelry really does not hold its value, I certainly wouldn't say (as a jeweler) that "the majority of the time it can be counted on as a stable store of value". Buying jewelry as an investment is like buying a car as an investment. You aren't going to get anywhere close to a full return on it unless it's a particularly rare or sought-after piece, which is the vast majority of cases. You might get what the materials are worth but that's going to be notably less than the retail value you paid. This is especially true for diamonds, which are relatively abundant and artificially marked up. Other gemstones like emerald, ruby, and sapphire hold their value better but even then, unless you have a truly remarkable one I wouldn't hold your breath about seeing a return on it.	episode_done:True

text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:I wear two types of makeup: red lip with no eye makeup or eyeliner with nude lip.

I like thrifting for this because just about every cut, color, fabric and style are available and you can get an idea of things you like that are not in new retail stores at the moment. And everything is much cheaper, of course.

Value and quality are nebulous terms. You wanna know a secret? So is everything else in every language normal people use to communicate.

Then work out if there are any specific outfits or item you want, and build around those.	episode_done:True

text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:No, I don’t think it’s tone deaf that fashion houses or designers are releasing collections that, like oconorris mentioned, were designed a year+ in advance.   As cities and *other* countries begin to re open people will begin to adapt to the new norm and resume their day to day activities so that will present more opportunities for them to go out and wear new clothes. I’m in America so don’t expect to relate any time soon lol  Having said that, there’s something for everyone. There’s quite a few brands that offer natural fibers, minimalistic looks, but no guarantee that greenwashing isn’t involved or that they aren’t treating their employees like shit.   The world doesn’t revolve around America so I’m not sure that more affordable brands will drop whatever collections they had designed for 6+ months just to adapt to whatever image people have in mind during this pandemic.

text:There was a reddit shower thought awhile back about how Dads are like time capsules because they wear whatever was popular / in style when they had kids... as if they just stopped buying clothes and keeping up with trends once they had the first kid.  It seems like mid-20s/early-30s white guys in tech are the same. Based on what they're wearing, you can tell when they first started paying attention to how they dress. And they're all convinced that whatever they wear is timeless or classic, without recognizing that they just bought in to whatever was trending at that time (menswear, minimalism, streetwear, etc.) and that they already are starting to look dated.	labels:I dunno about this. I've been watching a lot of 70s-80s horror schlock and one thing has stuck out is how often people look normal, with the Cool People looking really out of time. It seems like around sometime in the early 80s, things just sort of...stuck and your average casual clothes haven't changed too much. If you go back to the 50s, people weren't really dressed like today, but 40 years ago it's all jeans and tees. Sure we erred on the side of slim when the Big Internet Fashion Boom of 2012 happened, but the fundamentals stick around and if all you do is buy 501s and the OCBD you get off the rack at whatever store is closest, you'll probably look Fine, which is what 90% of the people coming through here care about and also assume other people care about.	episode_done:True
text:What Do You Wear With Strong Sentimental Value?	labels:I have two ll bean flannels which I've had since I was 13. I'm 30 now.

I plan on keeping them in good repair until it is literally impossible.  I also smile since I noticed my grandpa got one of the same pattern around the time I did.  I thought that was cool.

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I have similar connotations as you about them being kind of cheap or tacky looking, but would add one other angle to it. While I'm 100% against the use of real fur/exotic hides, I think part of the cheapness animal prints comes from taking something that in its natural state exists on fur and copy-pasting it onto all different kinds of fabrics. Real cheetahs look beautiful and elegant. A poorly rendered cheetah print on thin polyester leggings just looks like a terrible imitation. There isn't this mental comparison going on with other patterns, like stripes or polka dots, because there's no "real" standard to compare to. They're just decorative patterns.  Even if you attempt to create a faux fur that more closely imitates a real animal hide, it's going to look cheap and fake (to me) unless it is really well done.

text:I would agree. I already commented but there's a huge market gap for plus sized women that Shein fills. It's beyond obvious most people posting and commenting on this sub aren't plus sized or are on the smaller end of it like me, size 14/16. Shein accommodates women up to size 24/26 or so and those women are more likely to need inexpensive clothes (obesity/poverty correlation, it sucks but its true). Most people on this sub can afford or have the option of a huge variety of ethical and sustainable clothes that are not Shein either due to being straight sized or having enough disposable income. If you're committed to ethical and sustainable fashion and you're avoiding all new clothes, fast fashion, and mall brands, sure, I'll listen to your critique of Shein, but please realize most American women don't really have that privilege. If you're out here buying Zara and Express, you can kindly shut the fuck up with your hypocrisy.	labels:	episode_done:True

They're just tacking this on top Google Shopping and some Google.com search result pages. Which isn't going to be particularly helpful for certain fashion and clothing brands in my experience.

I think it’s from GQ, but I’m very well aware that I could be wrong. The ad features a man who gives advice on how to be a modern man. Some lines I can recall from the ad being things like, “Learn to dance, wildly and out of control.” “Get a book. Print is back in fashion.” And, “Exercise. A body in motion keeps the mind in motion.” Or something similar (clearly, I don’t exercise enough lol).   I cannot find the ad, which is driving me up the wall because I really like is style and I want to learn more about his sense of fashion.

text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:I taught my mom to have a little more fun, and to spoil herself. My mom has great style, but we live in the Midwest and looking at older photos of her I know later took on a sort of “mom” approach to style-to put it nicely, she likes good clothes, but appreciates them on other people. I have lots of photos of her in the 80s with amazing hats, gloves, and other things that had so much presence. I work in fashion so my goal is always to nudge her a bit so that she can feel like the center of attention, but not so far as to make her uncomfortable. This means buying nice and ornate little accessories for her, or introducing her to trends she might not know are age appropriate and easy to find at a good price. Last year I got her a 3/4 length sleeve top in navy from Jcrew with little ostrich feathers on the sleeves, and it was understated enough that it allowed her to feel like a celebrity wearing it, and it seemed to suit her. It BLEW HER MIND! This year she asked for a red clutch, and was afraid it was too specific. I promised that I would search high and low to find something perfect. There is literally no place I won’t go to find something specific if she wants it, and I often know where to look and have my eyes open all year long. I want her to feel special because she is the only reason that I do.	episode_done:True

I just had to keep receipts, and subtract the cost when we got home. Besides cutting down on “you don’t really need this” arguments, I actually ended up learning some useful lessons from the process—in order to set my budget for the year, it was my job to figure out what I needed and lay out a proposal, which was negotiating practice (my sister and I competed to see who could get a bigger one approved!), and we had to use Excel to log everything. I might’ve whined a bit about the process in the moment, but now I see that it was a neat strategy, and I’m grateful for it.

Inevitably the comments use the word "hipster" as an insult when it is so clearly a euphemism for "fag".    The whole thing is so gross and tiring. I guess that can be said for lots of stuff in 2020.
text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:Jewelry. Real metal and stones. Whatever your personal style is.  I tend to mark milestones with a new piece. I like Native American made sterling with turquoise and I work in an artistic field, so these are signature pieces for me. $1k would get me a bracelet with a large, fine stone or a reasonably important squash blossom necklace. I also like to support Native artists and buy directly from them whenever possible; this is how many support their families and put food on their table.
text:Craig Green Spring 2021 Menswear Collection	labels:Feels like a pretty of a retrospective collection this time around. The collection defining details are all in the small things (neckties, sneakers), while the big things that make the silhouette are refinements of things from past seasons (tents, fisherman hats, even an iteration on the window bags(?) from FW20). The vests look like they could be a reference to the tennis silhouettes from the Bjorn Borg collab Craig did way back when. Still a banger of a collection, though. Nothing wrong with a little comfortable consistency right now.   The Adidas collab is still going hard. Can't wait to see that cast shoe show up on r/malefashion.
text:Imgur users always forget that their social media platform of choice was created solely to host images and gifs for Reddit. So they don't comprehend how an image wasn't posted to entertain them on that platform, and if it doesn't entertain them, they screech like banshees about it.

I can't fathom just surfing that god awful designed site for hours, and just up and down voting things and making comments with a character limit smaller than Twitter's.	labels:Yes, seriously, this.

text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Expand your definition of "statement piece" to include texture, pattern, silhouette, and x-factors instead of just colors vs neutrals. A shiny pant makes a statement even if it's black. An oversized blazer makes a statement even if it's tan. A snake print bag or skirt  makes a statement even if it's shades of brown or grey.   Some other ideas that might help: make color decisions based on seasons - if you have a lot of winterwear you love in a certain color scheme, start there and weed out what doesn't go with those faves, and so on with the other seasons. Make pinterest boards with the colors you're considering. Take pictures of combinations you like. Consider what colors you like best on yourself.	episode_done:True

text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:Honestly I think you have to give way more detail on your old pair and what you’re looking for.  In my mind the biggest hurdle to perfect jeans is the fit, and since every body is different this is highly individual. Some people might prefer stretchier denim for a more forgiving fit, while others look for stiffer fabric, and have less leeway.   Personally I still struggle to find a high rise, non cropped, fits my thighs and waist, plain dark wash, straight/skinny, 90% or more cotton, pair of jeans. But hopefully I’ll find it eventually!

Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:i just feel like their price points are so high and the quality can be kind of mediocre. they’re stuck in a weird place where their pricing is too expensive for the average consumer who’s trained to expect bargains and too cheap for someone who buys luxury or higher end pieces.   even with their random extra 50% off sales, it’s still above what people expect to pay. but then again, madewell is thriving.

text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:This subreddit has a serious hate boner for synthetics and I will never understand why. It seriously depends on the fabric and the purpose of the garment. Not all rayon or viscose or polyester or nylon is the same. It's like you said, the Uniqlo heattech or their amazing wrinkle-free perfectly drapey rayon blouses are so good. Is all rayon wrinkle free or behave like that? lol no... Which is why you need to look at reviews or touch the material yourself. When you touch it, you can just tell it's good...  Not all "natural" materials are elegant or good either. Sometimes stuff like linen is so trash-bag wrinkly. Sometimes cotton/linen/silk really holds in the sweat and makes you stink, or forms sweat stains on your pits, whereas there's loads of moisture wicking poly athletic clothing or super expensive technical gear for hiking or professional sports which is designed for a specific purpose from synthetic material that keeps you ultra dry, ultra cool, whatever it may be. Poly is also good UPF protection from the sun. Some of my most expensive hiking gear is made from polyester. There is some clothing I own, which I can toss in the washing machine, and after the spin cycle, it's completely dry, without the dry rack.   Acrylics can be super itchy and pilly, or be super tightly woven, soft, and incredibly durable. It really depends. You can't just look at the label and put it away because "omg ew polyester 100%" you need to touch it, stretch it, scrape your nail against it to see how the fabric performs.   tl;dr There's loads of great high quality fabrics in all materials whether it's natural fiber or man-made and I don't really have any negative opinion of anything until I see it in person, and touch it and wear it and I don't think it should matter at all, so long as you personally like it

text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:I think it’s a must but I don’t think it has to technically be a “LBD”. As long as the color is a dark neutral like navy, burgundy, or charcoal it’s fine and a very subtle pattern or texture is okay too, like an obvious woven or tweed. As for the dress part, it could be a non-little dress or even a jumpsuit. For me, I think it’s a relief to have a go to outfit for certain situations. Here are some imaginary ones for someone your age: your boyfriend/girlfriend’s conservative parents decide to surprise visit them at school and they want to take you both to a nice restaurant for dinner tonight; you need to attend a wake for someone who passed away suddenly; you get a call that there’s a new spot open for a highly competitive summer internship and interviews are only a couple days away. In each of these scenarios, it’s so much easier to know that you have a go-to look that is always appropriate especially since some of these can be stressful without worrying about your outfit.	episode_done:True

Long story short, I did that but the guy I am interested in, totally saw that and is now completely grossed out and it also kinda ruined the shoes. So now I cant stand on my feet without being in agony and I am single. On the upside I can now fit in my stepsisters’ shoes.

My style is what I’d consider to be prep/ivy with a little bit of Americana thrown in (lots of OCBDs, donegal sweaters, chinos, with more rugged boots like Viberg and the occasional Chelsea). My concern is that it might look a little costume-y, as if I’m missing the motorcycle and everything else that’s required with a black denim jacket.
text:What are your favourite ways to style a black leather moto jacket?	labels:People have already covered the dresses, but the dress/leather jacket combo is for sure one of my favorite ways to style them. If there's enough room in the sleeves/body, i sometimes layer a hoodie underneath during colder weather for a more skater girl type of look. I love wearing it with a white top, light wash jeans, and my black leather combat boots (for me, doc martens but could be any boot with a similar color/texture to the jacket) bc i feel like a rocker from the 80s.

My hair was down to my bra line and all the ladies stopped hitting on me.   I kept telling myself after every date with a guy that my next relationship was finally going to be a woman, but only guys ever seemed to hit on me :(   I’m still not sure how I should have dressed in 2005 to attract the ladies but it definitely wasn’t what I was doing.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:Other people have covered the main points- find fashion bloggers or icons that look like you; buy from companies where people post reviews with pictures, so you can see how it looks on someone with a similar body type; don't be intimidated to go to a tailor, or tailor your own clothes (youtube has plenty of tutorials on how to do basic alterations!).  Please don't take this as intending to trivialize your struggles, but rather an effort to offer some validation: off the rack clothes don't really fit *most* people well. I have friends of all different body types and sizes, and we *all* struggle to find clothes that work for us off the rack. So please know that you're not having trouble because your body is somehow uniquely unsuitable for clothes. It's because, quite frankly, *most* clothing is badly cut and designed. Most clothing sucks. Clothing manufacturers, especially since the 2008 recessions (i.e. most of your life), have been making clothing that just gets weirder and boxier and less flattering with every passing year. It's almost impossible to find things that fit anyone (in the sense of being flattering), because they are made to fit everyone (in the sense of doing the bare minimum of technically covering the body). Instead of manufacturing clothes to fit a human body, with all its curves and variations, it's *way* cheaper and easier to sew a couple rectangles together and call it a shirt. And we don't really have better options, so we buy it, so they keep making it. And it may feel like other people don't struggle with this, but you're not seeing them in the dressing rooms or looking through their closets in the morning. You're seeing them out and about, or on social media, where everything is carefully clipped and styled, staged to look perfect and effortless.	episode_done:True
text:Naked and Famous Raw Denim Review/Fit/Experience	labels:It's a bit pricey but one option is having jeans altered to fit. Either by a competent tailor who is willing to **alter from the inseam** (and preserve the selvedge outseam) or a speciality shop like Railcar Fine Goods that you can mail your jeans to. RFG lets you take in the waist by up to 2" and you can specify your preferred thigh, knee, opening, length down to the quarter inch. I'm a guy with meaningful waist and hip/seat divergence, though not nearly a 10" difference like many women, and have relied on RFG to fix some issues. There are other shops in the U.S./Canada that do similar and similarly good work. RFG also carries women's cuts.  Just want to note that with 100& cotton / non-stretch fabric, you won't be able to have a super narrow leg opening since it'll be impossible to put your legs through. Relatedly, it's not the same, but maybe you can get your raw denim fix in the form of a jacket? Potentially not a Type 3 depending on your chest measurements but various other jacket iterations might be easier to size for.	episode_done:True

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.

In particular may be the hardest question to actually answer here(or maybe that’s just me), the past year or so I’ve very much been questioning my sexuality and as a whole I’ve never exactly felt like I identified with or liked traditional masculinity, I’d say my current wardrobe leans much more heavily into categorically masculine items and fit and it’s def something I’ve been wanting to shift away from.

text:This is an absolutely valid comment. I've bought and sold a lot of my mid-range brand pieces (stuff that costs ~200 - 600 USD new) in the last couple of years. Unless something is super popular, it can take MONTHS to find a buyer, and usually to a heavily discounted price.   And keep in mind, there are a lot of jerks. You'll end up arguing with a buyer sooner or later that you can't take returns because it didn't fit them, that the condition was indeed as described etc. Oddly enough, my most hassle-free things to sell were used branded jewelry.   Buying new and hoping for a high re-sale is a lost cause for most things. 2nd hand shops in my country will pay about 0-10% of the original price when you send/bring them your stuff. And that's for a good condition and no obvious signs of wear.   Even popular brands don't yield much. I've sent in a new with attached tags & packaging Tatras coat (costs ~900 usd here) and they offered me 240 USD. This was the most popular model of this brand.  For 2nd hand, you'll mostly win by buying second hand what you hopefully enjoy yourself. Buying something at 20-30% of the original value, use it for as long as you like, then donate/sell it for anywhere between 0-10%	labels:I totally hear you on the pains of resale. I agree that the situation is a little more hopeful if you buy secondhand to begin with, but from your and other's posts, there are still too many other variables that can make it difficult to "re-resale" so to speak.	episode_done:True

text:Does your language affect how you wear colors?	labels:I read an article in scientific American forever ago that discussed the way some languages are structured to center the group or the space rather than the individual speaker the way English does, which can contribute massively to how a culture's values are learned (individual gratification vs acting on behalf of the group, consuming/hoarding natural resources vs conserving/cultivating them). In my amateur  assessment, I'd say language effects our fashion choices more in the realm of what we're dressing to communicate (personal wealth, individual perspective and creativity, respect for the natural environment, etc), and in the realm of how we consume fashion (desiring to have more or better than others in our community, desiring newness, desiring to leave a smaller environmental footprint, etc).	episode_done:True

text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:Sometimes I have to get used to seeing myself in clothes that are a big departure from my usual style.

text:Why Ralph Lauren Never Goes Out of Style	labels:I f***ing love old Ralph Lauren. I eat that stuff up. I agree that the quality is part of why it never goes out of style. But also Ralph Lauren is still huge and relevant today, so vintage pieces feel both en vogue and archival, a very "intellectual" take on an American classic. Like an old Herman Miller chair. It was cool then and it's cool now. And RL has infiltrated all sorts of cultures, namely hip hop and streetwear meaning the demand for it isn't just bankers. And RL has been a titan of American fashion in that he sort of figured out his formulas a while ago and hasn't changed that much. RL from the past is just as recognizable as RL from today. In my opinion it's aged unbelievably well. Old RL pieces are like darling Americana that can styled with anything. An old RL knit hangs just as well with streetwear as it does with jeans and boots. And while similar brands like BB are nice, they are one trick ponies. RL has and continues to offer an expansive product line from tech skiwear to western clothes. I think this huge line up means that even if there are duds, they are hidden by the massive catalog of hit pieces like the bear line up.

I was mildly upset, actually, because I had just spent $200 on a similar secondhand Chiara Boni gown and thought it was a great deal...	episode_done:True
text:Agreed that showing you midriff is inappropriate and a big no no professionally. Even in the epitome of casualness in tech I would caution against it. However, one can wear crop tops without showing skin. You can wear an undershirt and high waisted bottoms (skirt/dress as underlay/pants).   It looks like a crop top if you get the proportions right so that there’s no gap and is work appropriate.	labels:	episode_done:True

The Kardashians are very rich yet they have no problem wearing leggings and a t-shirt or being all decked out in Balmain, Gucci, LV.

text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:As long as it smells nice, I can't say I have a particular opinion on the person because of their perfume. I would probably judge more on whether it is too overpowering.   I've always worn one that I think is nice, but I now wonder if it's too smoky when my clothing choices aren't overly feminine, so I'm wondering if I should mix it up with something more floral. Perhaps wear the smoky one when I'm in feminine outfits and wear something more floral when I'm in less feminine clothing.	episode_done:True
text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

Obviously it's inspired by letterman jackets, but removing the contrasting leather sleeves and not having a TGI Friday's wall's worth of shit stitched onto it completely changes the vibe. I don't know, maybe I just associate it more with rockstar because it's an SLP piece and Alex Turner was the first celebrity I saw a photo of wearing it.

text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:In this hypothetical I'd go with haute couture. In your friend's situation I'd keep looking until I found a designer I liked. Bespoke would be my last option for a couple of reasons. Your friend wants contemporary fashion, but most bespoke tailors make traditional clothes for a typically older crowd (you're in NYC though so there are some bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd; make sure you look for them specifically). The bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd don't have designs as good as high end ready to wear IMO. Tailoring and designing are different skills, and there's a reason Louis Vuittion, YSL, Dior, Gucci, etc pay their head designers millions per year. Of course some $4000 coats are worth more than others, so it would be good to know a bit about general quality.  Personally, I prioritize design over fit. I can deal with a less than perfect fit if I love the design of a piece. But I won't wear a piece if I don't love the design, even if it fits well.   The middle ground option is made to measure, or MTM. MTM for outerwear isn't as common for suiting, but it's out there.

text:What are your favorite bags at the moment?	labels:I like small, fairly structured bags for everyday wear. Lately I've been into short shoulder bags (so they hang above the elbow) and top handle bags that sit in the crook of the arm, but crossbody bags are classic and very practical. I recently scored a secondhand Little Liffner bag in sky-blue embossed leather; I'm excited to wear it in the spring with tonal browns and creams or with clashing shades of bright blue and purple. I also have a few fun vintage handbags, and I've always coveted smaller bags by Wandler, By Far and Mansur Gavriel—$$$ though!  If there's a lot of stuff to carry (like a big notebook and a change of shoes or something), I'll carry a separate bigger bag, like a canvas tote or an attache case. It's convenient to carry two bags in these situations; this way essentials like keys or a wallet don't get lost at the bottom of a giant tote.	episode_done:True

So, we get cheaply made fast fashion that has extra development costs.	labels:100% because it's pretty easy to sell women stuff if you make them feel bad about themselves. I've recently been actively avoiding fast-fashion and buying more high-quality stapes, I end up buying a lot of "unisex" clothes.	episode_done:True
text:Yep, I also have this same issue. I literally pick up whatever pants are strewn across the floor and then go grab a top that somewhat matches the bottoms. I also have this thing where in the evening, I imagine all these cool outfits that highlight my style and utilize all the shit I've bought trying to curate my wardrobe. However, when morning comes, I just want to be comfortable and wearing the leather mini-skirt with the 4" heeled booties I imagined the night before sounds unbearable. If I didn't have to adhere to at least a business casual dress code at work, I'd probably wear leggings and massive sweatshirts everyday.	labels:This is why I used to love packing for a business trip, because I'd plan every day's outfits (and throw in a few extra black things, because.)	episode_done:True

I’m enjoying using it at home but have discovered:  * it takes a long time to dry my wet hair. I use a normal blow dryer to mostly dry my hair then finish off with the Panasonic.  * it does seem to make my hair smoother than a normal blow dryer.  * I am still too clumsy to use the flat iron attachment and use the normal brush head 99% of the time. I should’ve stuck with the simple cheap brush version, hah.  Makes me think that a Dyson wouldn’t be worth it for me bc I can’t figure out how to do something besides a simple brush.	episode_done:True
