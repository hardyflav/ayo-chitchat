I've never seen so many designers and brands across several "genres" all thriving so well.  Saying something isn't "in fashion" just seems wild to me right now.

Why do so many men hold the sentiment that “dressing up” equates to being uncomfortable?

No problem with that at all, but 4 or 5 people made comments about my slacks/shirt/tie/bomber jacket/boots(he said be casual...I still over dressed with the tie) with things like “man I’m glad someone can wear those”.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 13, 2020	labels:Heyo,   I'm looking for some chino pants and am mostly concerned about the material.   Around a year ago, I bought some RSQ chinos and they were great, I liked the material, the fit (slim straight) was just right, and the cost was worth it ($45 a pair, BOGO 50% off)!   I decided to buy some recently and despite the website (Tilly's) saying they were the same fit/style, they felt off. The material isn't what it used to be I guess despite having the same ratio (97% cotton/3% cotton), it feels thinner. The pants also feel more loose on me, I made sure to order the same fit but I guess that changed too.   I'm interested in any recommendations where the pant material definitely felt nice and worth the asking price.   As for my price range, I wouldn't feel right spending more than $50 per pair as I'm just a college student.	episode_done:True

text:Schott 538 Nubuck Cowhide Mechanic Jacket	labels:I’ve been looking for a suede or nubuck jacket forever. Love this one besides for the contrast collar. Closest I’m leaning towards now is Todd Snyder’s suede chore coat but I’m not in love with the green color. Thanks for the review tho bud, wouldn’t have any doubt that Schott wouldn’t deliver a quality product  also Orvis had a couple decent looking suede jackets on their website but when I went to the store they’re only carried online, kinda skeptical about their quality of leather
text:It's pretty hard to find a good one! I like the nubuck material as it is stronger than suede and gives a bit more structure. Good call about Orvis, also unsure of leather quality. Overland is another shop that has good leather jackets but didn't have anything in stock with this design. The contrast collar definitely is the most controversial part about this jacket, maybe they'll make one without it!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Schott 538 Nubuck Cowhide Mechanic Jacket	labels:What perfect timing! I also just received this Schott mechanic jacket! It's my first Schott jacket and I love it! People here don't seem to appreciate the contrasting collar, but I think it makes the jacket stand out! It's a little touch that makes the design more unique and not as likely to see the same jacket from other makers. And the goatskin leather for the collar makes it very comfortable against my neck, and I wouldn't want the waxy/oily cowhide rubbing against my skin.  *** I love the chambray liner on the inside. I was turned off by a lot of other Schott jackets having the warm flannel liner as it would make the jacket harder to wear in the warmer seasons.    The buttons are definitely a stand out too! Makes it a lot easier to layer, which I believe was their intention. ***  And I'm very satisfied with the fit! I typically wear size M in my shirts, and I juggled over what size to buy, but eventually settled on sizing up to a L for the Schott, and I'm glad I did! The jacket has enough room to layer a sweater for the winter, but still looks great by itself. I was worried sizing up would make the jacket too boxy, but to my surprise it actually does have a slight V shape in the body, with a slight taper from the chest to the sweep. and the sleeves are not baggy, despite sizing up. If this was a moto or cafe racer style, I would understand the look to keep it super slim. But I feel this jacket style is more of a work-wear style, and that looks better a little boxy. ***  If I had to be very picky, I wish the sleeves were shorter, but I get it's for bikers to keep their wrists warm when riding. And the liner in the sleeves is polyester, which I thought was a little cheap for a 810 dollar jacket.  ***  Overall I'm happy with it. I  did not pay full price either. It was on sale at Nordstrom but it sold out very quick.
text:Nice! I also got it from Nordstrom on that sale! It definitely went out of stock very quickly. As for the sleeves liner, i agree it feels a bit cheap but i think most jackets like this has a polyester lining to keep your arms cool and also to make it easy to slide in and out. Glad you are enjoying it!	labels:What do you think of the fit? Did you get your typical size?
text:I think the fit is pretty good. The sleeves are long like you said, but you can roll up the cuff one, and the thick leather keeps the cuff pretty much in place so it's not flapping about. I also took a gamble on the size and got a medium. I measure about 37-38in in chest, 33-34 sleeve, 5'11 and about 160lbs. Definitely not the V shape athletic build, but this still fit pretty well at a medium. Overall, definitely happy with the fit as it is not too tight but also not super big on me.	labels:I have a 40 inch chest with broad shoulders, 6'0 and 180 lbs. And I got a L, which seems to be in proportion with the size M you got.  I'm pretty excited to start wearing it! I've been trying on outfits in front of my mirror this morning lol. Think it looks great over a flannel or thick denim shirt!

If you aren’t familiar with them they’re traditional Irish knit sweaters with the intricate designs woven into them. I was hoping someone might have some more experience with them than I do, especially since it looks like I’ll have to buy online. I’m looking to buy from an actual Irish shop if possible. Would like to support small business. However, I’m in the US.   1) first, Is anyone familiar with a good place to buy them? I was looking at Aran Sweater Market and they seemed reasonably well priced at around $100 USD. I know you can go all the way up to $700 for a super fancy one but that’s not really an option for my budget. I could probably go as high $200 if it’s something I know will be worth it.   2) Any recommendations on the fit? When buying most shirts I have a problem with getting the right size with a shorter body (about 5-8) and a larger chest. I’d say for a normal shirt I’m right at about the lower end of large, can usually get away with a medium if I don’t eat a lot of salt. But with these I obviously want something a little more loose but not sure if XL would be too big.   Would really appreciate any help on this. It’s been a long year and this is my Christmas gift to me, so I want to make sure I get something nice. Thanks in advance.	episode_done:True

text:I picked up a pair of black Thursday Boots Captains a couple of months ago. The company has been bashed on reddit pretty thoroughly in the past, but for $200 I'm quite pleased with them. Most of the "Buy ____ instead" suggestions I read involve waiting for sales on factory seconds or things like the redwings that straight-up cost more money.  The version I got is basically a combat boot for a smart casual office dress code, and they are great for that. Quality-wise they're worlds better than the $100 boots that they replaced.  In your case (Colorado, snowy sidewalks, etc) I might lean towards one of the "rugged and resilient" leather options.  If you want a lug sole, they have 2 color options on the captain for that, and the Diplomat has a wedge sole and a moc toe instead of a cap toe.	labels:	episode_done:True

I would get it tailored but the end of the coat would be coming close to the bottom button and look weird (the dock pea coat has an extra button and is a bit longer). Is there any peacoat that would be a 38-40 in the chest but also a 32-33 in the sleeves? Or should I just go with the traditional style (1 less button), go medium, and tailor it up?	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 11, 2020	labels:After looking at the casual blazer thread I just realized why I never liked or understood Paul Harnden when it was really big a few years ago. I think a lot of it was shoehorned into a more aggressive aesthetic than would suit some of those blazers. And we were still steeped in slim fit bottoms at the time, and people just threw a long, looser fit blazer over tight black twisted leg pants and called it a day. I think it's a great look when it's cohesive, but it came across as very bandwagon-y when it was worn with your typical Julius and BBS type stuff.  Interestingly, Elena Dawson - which is the same thing - was typically worn more cohesively, and I always really liked her work.

text:I mean... In New York City, it can be done, it's just not super natural. The main problem you'll see is not people telling you you look *bad*, but you being overdressed or underdressed for most occasions. You need a very particular occasion, and you can't just be the bow tie guy in your office and move to this, you need a certain amount of... Street cred? A certain amount of pre-accepted cool to see your friends, do this, and have their first instinct *not* be to make fun of you, but too recognize the cool aspects.	labels:Fair enough.  Fashion for fashion people, I suppose (and I don't mean that in a bad way).  I find that aspect of personality/aura/street cred to be one of the more difficult things to navigate when it comes to exploring more unique styles, whether be it new to yourself or new to the environment/context.
text:Well, I don't think it's just fashion for fashion people. You can just get a pair of the sweatpants. They're fun colors, they're cool... and maybe they're not the best you can get for $185, but they're very nice. The sweaters and scarves each look nice in a vacuum, you can wear each of them anywhere. But you can't expect them to style an entire lookbook based on what you're likelky to wear to work.	labels:Oh yea, for sure.

text:>I think he means tonally neutral, bland, desaturated colors  I would argue that’s what cold means, while blue is generally cold, I don’t think cold means “more blue”, it’s more about the relative saturation and intensity of the color, basically you have to judge what makes a certain color warm or cold totally in comparison to other similar shades, not as a general sliding scale of “brown is warm, blue is cold, always”, though, like I said this is all a semi useable way of describing it.

text:Yeah now that I’ve taken some time to think about it, I see what’s going on.   Simon’s definition of cold vs warm has to do with saturation of colour and undertones, which is why cool or warm browns and greys can exist, respectively. Your definition of cold vs warm seems to focus on the hue/colour spectrum from red to blue.   That’s what I was saying before, you just have different starting points/references so cool/warm mean different things to you. I seem to remember some confusion in his comments section addressing the same thing.	labels:Undertones make sense, but it seems like low saturation is a bigger part of his argument. Like, a cream with cool undertones quickly turns into a light blue. And I think of "cream" and "beige" and "taupe" as being warmer off-whites, and greys and stone as being more neutral / cooler on average. But he uses all of those interchangably, avoiding only "tan" and "khaki" and the very clearly warm terms like that.  He doesn't specify cool grays, cool browns, or cool olives. There are definitely warm / yellowish olives, I'd say it's easier to find warm ones than cool ones. And there are definitely cooler dark greens. Desaturation is a bigger part of his point, and he doesn't really address it.  Oh, and that's not to mention blacks, which... if they were cool, they just wouldn't be blacks. And blacks are technically saturated, too. True black is tonally neutral and fully saturated, not sure how they fit into either point he's trying to make, really.  If I were trying to implement this, I'd replace blacks with navies, but maybe look for dark desaturated blues where I can find them.	episode_done:True

text:he's probably focusing less on navy bc he views it in a more formal context. Navy is mentioned as being a decent colour to add as a adjunct rather than a main focus. Certain shades of brown are colder than others because they have more cool tones like greys compared to a red-cast warmer brown.  I just posted this as an interesting illustration of how someone can think about colour, it's not meant to be a definitive authoritative post	labels:But grey isn't a cool tone. Grey is a neutral tone.  I understand if the premise excludes navy, but if it does, shouldn't th title be a "Neutral-Colour Capsule" or something like that?
text:He does link to another post where he details the logic behind his warm/cold colour theory if that helps you to make sense of it. I think it's just a matter of semantics that seems to be your issue with it? As long as the main point gets across I think it's fine for people to have different wordings	labels:I tried reading that and didn't understand his point at all.  It's a matter of semantics about the title and core theme of the article. If you can't explain what he means by "cold" then I don't know what the article is about. If he means "neutral" the article is *much more confusing*.	episode_done:True

I love other British producers, have Trickers (official shoemaker for the Prince of Wales no less), Cheaneys and a good chunk of my wardrobe is SEH Kelly but that landed gentry aesthetic from Barbour just doesn't sit. I'd say it's an Irish thing but there's no shortage of people walking around Dublin in Barbour and I even remember a period in the late 80's / 90s when wax jackets were all the rage in rural Mayo.

text:I'll admit, I'm not gonna be mad, but I'm never gonna buy in. I dunno if they're the right terms, but the squared off corners are too brutalist and inelegant to me, and shoes with a formality level higher than a sneaker seem to need softness and elegance in my book.  That said, I think I've been less open-minded about shoes in general for a long time. I've got a laundry list of shoe/boots styles that I don't like but can't really articulate why.	labels:Footwear is probably where I’m most picky so I get the sentiment, it seems like it’s the easiest item of clothing to totally mess up. All that said the fact that only low end brands have been putting out(poorly designed) square toe shoes for the past couple decades now is probably a big reason why you have that perception, once you start seeing better designed versions of them it may change that opinion

I don’t see anything wrong with distinguishing between more day to day wearable pieces and much more outwardly avant-gard looks, even if they’re from a designer such as Rick who is acclaimed and popular to people who have familiarity with high fashion.  If I understand you correctly you’re talking about how functional items have become fashionable or are used beyond their original purpose (like jeans or like a leather biker off of a motorcycle) but that isn’t really what Rick is? He’s not starting from a functional utilitarian perspective. I only meant that this looks like it straddles the line better between more “normal” casual looks and full “high fashion” looks in an interesting way.
text:My whole point was that calling something costumey is a poor/negative description of avant-garde/high fashion, because at it's essence your saying that those people aren't dressing true to themselves (they are wearing a costume) and your not describing anything about the piece.  I agree with you though it definitely hits a nice middle ground between totally high-fashion and more traditional clothes.	labels:Oh I see what you’re saying now, thanks for explaining. I certainly don’t mean this in a negative way to describe how someone chooses to express themselves at all, and certainly don’t mean to say dressing avant-garde is inauthentic. At the same time, I don’t think those things are mutually exclusive. This sub is full of people half-joking or joking about capes and cloaks, and every so often someone asks about a long duster or the like from Blade Runner or the Matrix or something. You could still be dressing true to yourself and look a bit out of place.  I don’t think people advising someone to not dress like a movie character are impugning how that person wishes to express themselves as inauthentic. Rather, the perception of the layperson of some person dressed as Neo would be “costumey” I think the same could be said for someone in full Rick- it doesn’t change the layperson perception just because one of those two people choosing to dress outside the norm knows more about fashion than the other.	episode_done:True

Fit was awesome, quality was amazing for what I paid (~$70). I've worn these boots 100+ time and still holding up great.  Fast forward to this past Cyber Monday. I wanted a pair of cognac/brown colored Chelseas from Shoe The Bear. They arrived within a few days fron Portugal. I was so excited to open the box....and they are completely the wrong color.  They're so far from the correct color, customer service is claiming that I treated the leather myself and they don't carry boots in this color.  To say this experience is bizarre is an understatement - No, I did not treat the leather. I took the picture within minutes of opening the package because I couldn't believe what I received. I'm going to try and return them but now they're claiming I treated the leather so who knows what will happen.

text:Ordered from Shoe The Bear (rant, experience in post)	labels:Sorry, this isn't directly helpful, but I've ordered from Shoe The Bear two or three times. The first time I kept the boots (suede chelseas) and they were uncomfortable and never broke in, but did very soon expand to way outside the size of my feet despite following their guidelines and ordering what was eventually 2 sizes below my normal size (having ordered multiples to test) leaving my feet to flop about at the heel and yet rub on my toes to the point of leaving red and slightly blistered skin.  Each time after that I've sent them back, based both on sizing and the appearance of quality. I would never buy them at the full prices they charge based on the workmanship and materials they use, and even on sale, they are quite sneaky about how returns work - they put it out loudly that they include a return label, but you have to dig to note that that return label is then deducted from the cost of your refund, and it's not cheap.   The last time I did this, I couldn't use the return label at the post office, even though the website said I could, so I paid for my own postage. When they did refund me, not only had they still tried to charge me for usage of the label, but they appeared to have applied it twice. I contacted the customer support to query this, at which point they asked me if I had used the return label, which A) they should really know at that point, and B) wouldn't have explained the extra charge anyway. They said they would refund it and I should see it in my account sometime that week (it was on a Monday). Guess what? No refund - I had to contact them *again* the following Wednesday to remind them, and only then were the accounts department finally moved to action.   Good deal on sale or not, I would never order from Shoe The Bear again.
text:Their customer service SUCKS.  They're not even responding to my last e-mail of asking why they're accusing me of treating the leather myself and if they're going to anything to assist me considering I'm a repeat buyer.

They're accusing him of treating the leather with something that changed its colour, so they aren't accepting a return on that basis.

However, they do keep track of how often you do this in case you try to abuse it.

I imagine watches are actually probably one of the more common sentimental items.  Also used to have a hoodie that I'd had since 7th grade (so \~18 years), that got lost while moving just this year. It was from being on the swimming team and it was perfect. It also had the extra sentimental value of being a time in my life that I ended up meeting my, too this day, best friends. It still fit because it had most likely stretched out with me over the years and was fairly sheer in comparison to most sweatshirts. I run hot so it was great when a t-shirt was a little too chilly, but a sweatshirt was too hot. .  I also used to have another zip-up hoodie years ago that was a similar story that had just been one of my go-to items for like a decade .

text:The Perspective of Medieval Menswear	labels:Nice to have something written by Simon informing his primary audience (of affluent, often snobby 35+ y/o males) that their sartorial preferences are not the end-all-be-all and that fashion isn't something to sneer at	episode_done:True
text:The Perspective of Medieval Menswear	labels:A few notes in regards to medieval clothing: Tabards were worn by a large mixture of people, but it is more of a coat (and yes, knights later on wore them over armour, there were also surcoats etc). What definitely was worn by all peasants was a tunic, worn over a shirt and braies (basically boxer shorts). Hose (leggings) were tied to the braies and were usually both brightly coloured and a different colour for each leg. There are more elaborate ones with multiple colours per leg, but that was for richer people. Over time tunics got shorter and braies became longer, until they became breeches. Crakows are a particular type of pointy shoe popular in the 15th century, the more general name is turnshoe, so named because they were made inside out, and then turned. In regards to Philip wearing black, interestingly this change was initially spearheaded more by the middle class. Previous black dyes were a more browny black, but in the 14th century a deeper black dye was developed and so many of the city-dwelling middle class (hence bourgeoisie) started wearing black, both as a sign of wealth at being able to afford this new dye and also because of certain other expensive colours being restricted. The nobility and royalty of Europe began picking this up soon after.

text:My take on this is that it’s easier for Moncler, a premium/high fashion brand to venture into street wear realm with collaborations, than to elevate SI, a streetwear/sort of techwear brand into high fashion - where Moncler operates. I also love how Moncler is pretty selective with who they collaborate with, and on that note, I’m weary of the route Arcteryx (one of my favorite brand for outdoor wear) is going with their recent collaboration with Palace. My fear is they diverge away from their outdoor focus and become another The North Face. But there is still hope - there’s apparently a Jil Sander x Arcteryx in the works.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Grad/Masters Fashion Program Reality?	labels:Grad school is usually not worth it unless there is a very specific thing you want to do that requires it. There are many more people with advanced degrees than positions to be filled.

But I’m kinda caught at like is finishing these 3 semesters and then going on to grad school worth it. Or should I just drop it all and go to great fashion program at a fashion school.	labels:As I said, only worth it if you want a job where you have to have a graduate degree. Honing skills isn’t a good reason. You can get paid to do that
text:You don’t need an advanced degree to work in Fashion, but you definitely need a degree. Nobody in NY at least is going to look twice at you unless you come from Parsons, FIT, RISD or Pratt ideally, or a well-regarded program within another school.   I’d say finish your current degree and then maybe take some classes to be sure that actual fashion design is something you want to do. Design is a lot more than making clothes. It’s insanely hard work as a career. That said, there are a lot of great opportunities in fashion, especially in New York, where I’ve spent my 20+ year career.   FIT has great post-grad classes and associates programs too. Maybe you could work in fashion marketing while studying design? The combination of some design classes and solid marketing experience could very well lead to something interesting. Good luck!	labels:I’m actually currently differed from FIT, so I could just go there and do that.   Is that what your implying?
text:Yeah, or take classes while you’re working. I’ve taken several continuing ed classes there and it’s always been great. I’m saying take a little time before you enroll in another full time program.   Also, it quite normal for students at Pratt/RISD/Parsons to attend and get another bachelor’s. At RISD, where I got my BFA I actually think it’s a better education than a Master’s.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Grad/Masters Fashion Program Reality?	labels:If your goal is to start your own brand or become a fashion designer, or work in the fashion industry on the design and creative side, a marketing degree is an order of magnitude more valuable than a fashion design degree (granted, it should ideally be from a fashion school or a highly respected school). Everyone and their born-rich roommate in NYC has a fashion design degree just because they're interested in fashion and didn't know what to study in uni. In these industries with oversupply of graduates (who are willing to work for less than you), your goal should be to be significantly more valuable than your competitors. Having a marketing double major is one way, though it's also not very uncommon and you will still have significant competition.
text:Well see that’s my issue, I’m going to a general California State College Not an Art College. So even though I’m getting these doubles majors they’re not from a “good name school”.  I’m just at a crossroads, either I can grind out this double major (1.5 years) at my state school  Or transfer right away to PRATT or FIT, directly for fashion. But I’d have to go for 3-4 years.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:My goal is genuinely just get enough knowledge to work in clothing design. I have a pretty solid brand made thst ive been working on.  But a brand isnt my “goal” it’s more to get enough knowledge and experience to work in clothing and then maybe down the road do that.	labels:You don't need to go to FIT to work in clothing design. But the kind of company you want to work for will determine what kind of school you want to go into. Not because that school necessarily produces better graduates, but because school name and personal connections matter more than skills in that particular industry.   If you want to work for a designer or designer brand, then yes the best way to get there is to get into a reputable fashion school, make connections, and hope for the best. However, if you want to work for fashion brands that are still really good but considered more mid level (especially brands without a "designer" at the helm) then you don't need to go to a high fashion school; you need work experience and a good portfolio.   Your two choices have very different paths to your goal. If you complete your double major, you can begin your career working for smaller brands or larger fashion conglomerates to build your portfolio over a few years. Then, you aim for a well respected mid level brand like an Acne or Our Legacy to establish yourself in the field, and if you're good enough, take a step up to work for a designer.   If you switch schools for fashion design, then you're going to have to try and meet the right people, make the right friends, and produce work that will get people's attention (I cannot stress enough how deeply nepotism runs in these types of industries). If you're lucky (part of the 0.1%), you can graduate with a job at a designer house waiting for you. If you're not lucky, well, you start at a small brand of larger fashion conglomerate with a bigger student loan and fewer meaningful skills. High risk, high reward.   So, it really depends. Do you only want to work for a designer, and nowhere else? Are you willing to spend years building up to your dream job? Do you have a once in a decade talent for fashion design, or do you have grit and determination?
text:Wow, this is such a good answer.   Thank you   I enjoy high end and have a massive knowledge of it. But working immediately in high end isn’t really my goal. I wanna get a great education, be stimulated , be pushed, I wanna put all my time a nd energy into fashion. It’s all I think about, all I do, all I want.  My father is ironically a fine artist, that’s how we live as a family, Off his art. I’ve grown up knowing the work, dedication and talent you have to have even to even make a living off fashion.   It’s taken me a long time to realize how much I want this, but I’m 21 and it’s all I can think about.  If you wanna check some of my work my Instagram is @liepkes. Dm me tell me what you think.	labels:A lot of people live and breathe fashion and say it's all the think about. One of the downsides of an industry that is also a hobby for many, is that there is no shortage of people who desperately want to work in it. That means that: 1.) there is an oversupply of applicants; 2.) it can be a race to the bottom just to get in (unpaid internships, low wages); and 3.) your passion is not enough to get by.   Good luck on your future, and always remember that a job is still a job. And sometimes, it's worse when it's also your hobby.   If your dad is the first result for Liepke then I actually follow him on IG and really admire his art.

I’m very lucky to have grown up with such a unique outlook on the arts.  Thank you for the kind words, If I choose the Pratt path I knows it big gamble. I’ll have to live with the decision I make, I’m leaning towards Pratt but it’d gonna be hard convincing my parents.	labels:I agree with u/Reactionaire that a marketing degree is extremely valuable. I also agree that fashion is a field with no shortage of talented people. If you want to do actual apparel design, sketching, building concepts, technical design, etc I don’t see how you’re getting in the door without a degree unless you have an EXCEPTIONAL portfolio, even at at ‘mid-range’ brand whatever that is. Even FIT grads with exceptional portfolios have a tough time finding a job.   As someone who has worked in fashion in New York for over 20 years and hired for countless entry level positions, take it from me: you have to do the work.
text:Oh yes totally, I definitely need a degree in it. Never Said anything about that. In addition the work has to be put in is definitely massive I understand that.  My question more should I tough it out for 1.5 years at my state university and double major in Marketing/fashion design.  Or  Go to PRATT in nyc and do purely fashion but have to go 3-4 years again.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Grad/Masters Fashion Program Reality?	labels:Are you actually getting two bachelors by double majoring?  If so then stay the course and finish your degrees. Two bachelors will give you options in both fields and certainly make you a better candidate for a job. If not, then I’d consider taking the two year hit to do what you really want, I didn’t do that and spent my 20s flopping around in different fields.  Best of luck to you!
text:Yes, I’d be getting 2 bachelors!  it’d be a lot of work, but I would have both marketing and fashion design. I think it’s a smart move to get both.  It was Covid at the time when I had to make a transfer decision and it just felt weird starting 4 years all over again. especially while being online. I only have 3 semesters left and thought double majoring then going to grad would be a good compromise.   But I don’t know if it’d just be too late by then.	labels:I would stay the course and get two. I’m in my masters now for a field I should’ve been in a decade ago
text:So you think putting my head down for 1.5 years and getting the Marketing and Fashion Bachelors. Then move onto a grad/MA in fashion design would be more with it?	labels:Oh yes certainly, although I would talk to your advisors and see if grad school is even necessary. I worked in digital marketing (not fashion) with a BS in Psychology and no one cared about masters at my agency.  I started my masters this summer and in two weeks I’ll be over the halfway mark to graduation. A year is nothing and a year and a half is a little more than nothing ;) You’re still so young, I really wouldn’t worry about it!
text:Interesting, I’m just worried that my current school won’t give me enough to go right in to fashion being that they’re a California State school.   I was hoping a masters or even associates from a my focused fashion college could really solidify my skills.	labels:Oh I see, well definitely talk to your academic advisor before deciding on your own to invest in another degree, they can help you make an informed decision. It might just be a matter of taking a few extra courses instead of a whole degree.	episode_done:True

text:What is your favorite clothing purchase of the year, and why?	labels:If I'm honest, with this year being what it was, the purchase I'm most excited about is four pairs of slim-fitting fleece joggers from Gap. A close second would be two pairs of decent-looking New Balance 574s.  I've been working from home since March and really only go out to get groceries, get a haircut, and occasionally go for a walk on a nearby biking trail. My uniform for the last few months has been joggers and a polo shirt, sometimes an Oxford. It's just enough that I still feel professional at work (I do video calls with clients), but it's the most comfortable I've ever been at work.  When I have to leave, throw those New Balance sneakers on. Cold? Grad a denim jacket. Had I worn this outfit somewhere nice a year or two ago, yeah, I can see that being a cause for ridicule. But now, I'm frequently the best dressed person I run across when I go outside. At work, some people dress a bit better, but it's still comparable.  I look forward to seeing what happens to fashion when we get this pandemic taken care of. Some people have been putting effort together to make things like joggers and sneakers work and look great, I wonder if fashion in general will adopt more of the comfortable trends.	episode_done:True

I'm glad I got one from the 2019-2020 and not the new 2020-21 line.  This year's one doesn't stretch as well and feels uncomfortable.  &#x200B;  I only wish I could have bought another color from the 2019-20 so I'd have more variation  I guess when I get something that fits well, feels comfortable, and cheap to buy..

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 05, 2020	labels:Curious to see the opinions here.  How would you modify wanting to dress the way you want in a forever-hot and humid country, like the Philippines?  I know MFA (and other fashion boards) say to get stuff like shorts-above-the-knee, lightweight linen pants, short sleeve button downs, versatile shoes, etc.  But say, if you're enamored by something like the Japanese Americana workwear aesthetic, or something like techwear, or even something like legitimate vintage clothing/workwear. How do you dress like that here in the PH? I'm so interested by the possibilities of fashion but it's so frustrating not being able to put heavier fabrics on to experiment, lest I die of heat stroke.   To make it worse, I'm one of those people who is "allergic" to sweat and heat (I get really itchy), so ugh.

One of the pieces is a 1980s japanese denim kimono that i'm sashiko stitching in the traditional patterned styles, and I'm loving how it's coming out- but it still is scary to put so much time and thread into something that has no garuntee or obligation to sell at all... it feels much riskier somehow, even though all art is risky.

A chore jacket will be heavier again - wool or heavy twill or canvas maybe, and classically have two patch hip pockets and an external patch chest pocket and an internal chest pocket.

text:Why Ralph Lauren Never Goes Out of Style	labels:I f***ing love old Ralph Lauren. I eat that stuff up. I agree that the quality is part of why it never goes out of style. But also Ralph Lauren is still huge and relevant today, so vintage pieces feel both en vogue and archival, a very "intellectual" take on an American classic. Like an old Herman Miller chair. It was cool then and it's cool now. And RL has infiltrated all sorts of cultures, namely hip hop and streetwear meaning the demand for it isn't just bankers. And RL has been a titan of American fashion in that he sort of figured out his formulas a while ago and hasn't changed that much. RL from the past is just as recognizable as RL from today. In my opinion it's aged unbelievably well. Old RL pieces are like darling Americana that can styled with anything. An old RL knit hangs just as well with streetwear as it does with jeans and boots. And while similar brands like BB are nice, they are one trick ponies. RL has and continues to offer an expansive product line from tech skiwear to western clothes. I think this huge line up means that even if there are duds, they are hidden by the massive catalog of hit pieces like the bear line up.
text:I think at its best, RL pulls from all the great American heritage brands:   * Prep outdoors brands like Ll Bean or Woolrich * American Trad like Brooks Bros * Western brands like Pendleton or Levi’s   And finds a way to blend them and tweak them in such correct but interesting ways.   Ralph is the ultimate Americana guy, he just gets the genre. Very Ralph is a great doc too.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 03, 2020	labels:So, it turns out “””Escape Room””” is not a genre but more akin to a quirk of spotify’s algorithm that just so happened to coincide with a handful of artists I don’t remember listening to this year. Basically they analyze not just the genre of the artists you listen to, but what also what artists you listen to together, and I guess break it down into the smallest bubble of artists that other people also listen to together and ig just give it a random name for categorial purposes...which is not how you fucking define a genre and leads to weird shit like Xiu Xiu, Aphex Twin, and ASAP Ferg being in the same “”””genre””””, but, whatever, mildly interesting peak under the hood of the machine, and my friend got “city building pop” so I guess it could be more bs  In other news, anyone else feel like beginning of the year was weighed a lot more heavily than the end?

text:Down Jackets	labels:Maybe not the MOST stylish brand for some but, I've really liked my Feathered Friends Eos down jacket. I mostly use it for winters in Montana where it can reliably be in the negatives on my way to work. Couple mornings we were like second coldest on earth that night at -30F or so. But this thing is crazy warm and extremely light. It's 10.6 oz with 3.7 oz 900+ fill SUPER lofty Canadian down. Premium stuff. They also have other more robust expedition jackets and parkas. Again maybe more of a tech piece than a "flex on 'em" type jacket but I think it looks as good as any Patagonia down jacket. Also gotta add, these guys are the best in terms of their ethics and sustainable practices. They were one of the first adopters of the Responsible Down Standard which ensures the down isn't live plucked and is humanely sourced. And they are made in Seattle, WA (and Vancouver, B.C. now) since '72. Not a paid advertisement lol, just really dig these guys.  \*They also have bedding, pillows, and more famously sleeping bags that are top notch.	episode_done:True
text:My thoughts of the Cote&Ciel Isar L after a year	labels:I’ve owned the same exact model for some 6 years now. It holds up very well, although the issue with the shoulder strap slipping is annoying and has gotten worse.  Proudest moment was when a group of Japanese girls crowded behind me trying to figure out what brand it is.  When I still lugged a laptop and then some everywhere I was using it a lot. But  I’m not carrying as much anymore. I just need a tablet and a water bottle for which the Isar is overkill. It alone weighs more than both of these together.  So great bag with great design but specific use case. Smaller than your typical carryon but big for something to take everywhere.  What traveling I prefer a carryon plus a bag I that doubles as my daily carry, but the Isar is for me just a bit too heavy for this.	episode_done:True
text:My thoughts of the Cote&Ciel Isar L after a year	labels:Just want to chime in as another C&C Isar (I think mine is M, not L) user. Eco-yarn construction. Context: I'm in a doctoral program, live in another city, commute to campus when necessary. Pre-COVID, that was 2-3x/week. East Coast/New England, so a good amount of exposure to rain, snow, etc.   I bought mine circa 2014/15 in Copenhagen. It's been my go-to for pretty much everything since then. Everyday commute stuff fits very easily. As OP describes, space is massive, yet the construction of the backpack allows you to cinch everything down to a pretty small (if tall) package. I've used it for 2-3 day conference trips. The open duffel compartment really fits a lot. The more structured "backpack" compartment has cushioned dividers, pockets, etc. for flatter or more delicate/smaller objects.  Frankly, I love it and its one of the most interesting and functional backpacks I've ever come across. And the design, which variously recalls elements of modernist architecture, is pretty distinctive. My best experience with it was when I fit an absolutely massive doorstopper of an exhibition catalogue (600+pgs, oversized art book, hardcover) into the duffel compartment and it just...swallowed it up.	episode_done:True
text:My thoughts of the Cote&Ciel Isar L after a year	labels:I've lusted for this backpack since I saw it but then covid hit and it didn't make much sense getting a backpack when I shifted to WFH.

text:My thoughts of the Cote&Ciel Isar L after a year	labels:Have this in ecoyarn M and was my daily driver for about 2 years until covid hit. I like it for its intriguing look, but it's not the most practical of bags. It is quite heavy, and the damn shoulder strap adjusters always loosen up. It doesn't have a quick access pocket as well except for the secret one where I just put my coin purse for commuting.  It's more of a show-off/flex backpack imo. I got an Aer Fit Pack in X-pac for practicality but will most likely keep my Isar M.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 02, 2020	labels:Thanks heaps to /u/dai_due' for selling me one of his Uniqlo +J hybrid down parka! finally received it and love it. Can't believe size XS actually works on me (normally medium in uniqlo stuff). Still has enough room to layer and somehow still has that oversized look. Amazed!  Also, after about 6 months of wear, I can confidently say the Auralee seamless tee is my favourite one that I own. I immediately knew it was gonna be my favourite as soon as I received it but I wanted to see how it was after many wears. One of the best features about it is that it's so soft but still drapes so nicely. And any wrinkle it develops after being folded in the closet basically straightens itself out after being worn for about 10 minutes. Shit! now i'm looking for more in different colors. A bit expensive at retail price but I've seen them on sale for around $50 which is doable for me.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 02, 2020	labels:Spotify basically confirmed to me that I don’t have any taste in music. Apparently I listened to over 400 different genres. Listened to the same song 300 times in three days (I remember writing a 15000 word paper from scratch that week). I do tend to use music for its psychoactive properties more than anything else.  Fashion: my partner noted that most of the stuff I bought this summer looks like stuff they still own from 10 years ago. Checks out.

Keeps me awake and energised. Extremely juvenile. Number 2 for this purpose is *Bück Dich Hoch* ("Bend Yourself Up") by German Electropunk band *Deichkind*, which is a parody on "entrepreneurial thinking". Basically the singer is shouting that you should work yourself to death. Highly effective.  Sabaton's *The Great War* album also deserves like 40% of the credit for me always having fully prepared teaching material this year. Should really throw them a thank you in my next book.

text:Red Fleece is fantastic and distinctly different from the main line. Skews younger and has better cut of jackets in my opinion. Most of their main line suits are padded, lined, and boxy. They’re good but the overall result is pretty conservative, even with lighter fabrics and fits. It’s good stuff off the rack for sure, just not terribly flattering.

I would like to meet Thom Browne.(Fashion designer and business mogul) I have two of his known addresses but as a man of that importance I’m sure he’s not at either typically with all the international business he conducts. I’d also like to point out that I’m currently a nuclear engineer in the U.S. Navy. There are a few restrictions I have due to this. Therefore, I cannot have a computer. I’d further my investigation through those means if those were viable.  Since I’ve joined the Navy, I’ve not been able to keep up the development of my programming and hacking skills. My heart would have immense renitence if I didn’t ask you this: Can you find a way to put me in contact with Thom Browne? Anything would help; from his personal cell phone, to being in the same room, or his future known future location, etc... You will be compensated handsomely at the end of this daring mission. I do know how difficult this is or could be, but I would not ask if it wasn’t important to who I became today.	labels:Fucking gottem	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 01, 2020	labels:Some of the best ring sizing advice I've seen from Alicia Hannah Naomi:  > You are strongly encouraged to check your ring size carefully before placing your order.Ring sizing is not an exact science. Tools and techniques used to read and take sizes can vary from jeweller to jeweller, but being sized professionally by an experienced assistant at a reputable jewellery store is always the most accurate way to determine your ring size. Using string or paper to work out your circumference size is often unreliable.  >Make sure to factor in which hand you want to wear the ring on, and the temperature the day you are fitted as this can affect your size. Check that space between the base of the finger and the knuckle is wide enough to accommodate how tall the ring measures. Personal comfort is also a factor, but ideally, a ring should need a hard wiggle to get over the knuckle - too easy and you may risk it falling off, too much resistance and you may not get it back over the knuckle again.   >The heavier and wider a ring is, the larger the size you will typically need to wear. You may need to add one or two full UK sizes to your usual ring size when choosing a heavy and wide ring. An experienced jewellery store assistant should be able to advise you whilst you are being measured.

Why is it different than other rubber boots? Cause it has a shank and it’s just so much more supportive. Also the part that’s usually more fragile is thick ass leather.

text:I'm Not a Watch Guy I Swear - Street x Sprezza	labels:I am a watch guy, but very much a relatively broke one.  Had I known how much trouble it would be to break into watches, I might have said never mind and wisely walked away. I didn’t, though.   Some pointers for those interested:  1.	The cost of the watch is only the upfront cost. Like a car, a mechanical watch needs regular maintenance. Generally speaking, this will be anywhere from $300 to $1,000+...every 5-7 years.  2.	Because of point #1, entry level (~ $500) mechanical watches are not pieces you will pass down to your kids. In fact, it is usually cheaper to trash them entirely and buy new than to bother having them serviced.  3.	People will tell you there are deals to be had in the vintage market. That’s true, but it can also be difficult to find parts or people willing to work on them. 4.	There is relatively little offered between entry level and about $3,000.  5.	There is nothing wrong with wearing a quartz or digital watch.   All that being said, I still love my small collection. Just wish I had known those things from the start.

text:All great points!   What always got to me was that the "good" stuff always cost money.  It was like tailoring in that sense, where say Ring Jacket and Drake's clearly has a different aesthetic than H&M or J. Crew, but you just need to have the income to support it. And then of course for me, I'd rather have a nice jacket/shirt/etc than one watch.  Then there are vintage watches and swatches which are affordable and quirky, so it worked out at least for now. And I agree: nothing wrong with digital or quartz.  Hopefully others see your comment and they can also start collecting!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I'm Not a Watch Guy I Swear - Street x Sprezza	labels:I could not agree more about 36-38mm watches. I've always worn watches, inexpensive ones but I've always put one on first thing in the morning and worn it until I'm getting in bed at night--even if I'm doing nothing beyond sitting around the house all day. My small collection was all 40mm or 42mm.  A couple of years back I decided I wanted to take a slight step up from my $125 Orient automatics. I purchased a 42mm Hamilton Khaki Field and it just didn't feel right. I loved the aesthetic of it but I couldn't pinpoint what was wrong so I reluctantly returned it a few days later.    Fast forward to this summer and I couldn't get the Khaki Field out of my head. I read more about it, mainly forum posts, and read a good conversation--I can't recall on which forum--about the 42 vs the 38. I read enough to be coaxed into trying the 38. I remember opening the box and thinking, "this is SO tiny. It looks like a toy." One poster said to expect that reaction and wear the watch for a week and you'd come around on its size. Man, was he right. With 7.5" wrists I absolutely love 38mm watches. I ditched my older Timex Chrono Weekender (40) for a classic Weekender (38). My Orient Bambinos (40) now feel too large even though I thought they were too small when I bought them several years back. Every time I wear them I look at my wrist and wish the watch was smaller. Every time I see a character in a movie or show wearing a watch I think to myself about how bad and how huge the watch looks.  As for price, I also agree that most expensive watches are too busy or simply don't appeal to me. Even if I was loaded I wouldn't buy luxury watches.  A quick thought on wearing a watch in the smartphone era, at least in my profession, I sneak a glance at my watch during meetings or at times when it's not appropriate to pull out my phone.	episode_done:True

text:Why do you think there's such an aversion to luxury digital? Given the general love for techwear, you'd think this would be a space flush with opportunity. As much as I love the look of luxury, artisanal timepieces, some part of me is just disgusted by how we're solving the problem of telling time in the most Rube Goldberg way with all these mechanical movements that lose time so fast. It's 2020, and we should be able to have both precision and aesthetics.	labels:A few reasons, I think.   1.	Your typical watch person is attracted to that Rube Goldberg sort of idea. That and the fact that traditional dials are very attractive. I just love the look of a dive watch or chronograph, for instance. The fact that they have purposes beyond telling time is just cool. 2.	Artisanal Digital is hard to market. Apple has had the best luck so far, but no one wants to invest a ton of money into a digital piece only for its hardware to be outdated in 5 years. 3.	On the other end of digital, you have G Shock which is hard to beat for its price and ability to take anything you throw at it.   Just my thoughts.	episode_done:True

text:yeah it's weird. in my experience with talking to people about this specific thing i feel like it's really clear that the reason they have trouble dating isn't really the height, it's usually bc of *at least* one pretty evident character flaw that overshadows their height. they might be really insecure (either about their height or something else), poorly groomed or dressed, or honestly just kind of disagreeable lol. the list goes on but you get it  from talking with my friends who date men i really don't think people care that much and it's not a problem for most people unless you make it one	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 29, 2020	labels:Just finished Legend of Korra and it was really good. The first season was good, the second was meh, but seasons 3 and 4 were fantastic. I went into it super skeptical but I think it was a worthy successor to Avatar, although I don't think anything can top that show (it was the only TV series I followed as a kid and I've rewatched it a ton since).
text:I liked it and I think the art style and music match the pace well, however, my only two problems were:  * not nearly as relaxing and soothing as Avatar. Avatar has really nice nature connections that are kinda lost in the city setting The filler episodes in Avatar are relaxing and nice looks into either the nature of bending/human-nature relationships or the friendships/personalities of the characters.   * Korra never learns anything. Aang learned how to solve problems without using his powers and Korra just hits stuff until it’s fixed. Aang had to grapple with his moral code constantly. Korra just gets the major issue of the end of the first season solved for her with out doing anything. It seemed like an interesting dilemma for her character and she gets out of it with out changing at all or even a hint of self reflection. Plus her villains are all way more interesting and actually have some nuance and personality.	labels:Yeah, I do think that they really missed out on developing most of the characters. Very few of them had an arc similar to Zuko, Sokka, or Katara. They went with more characters with less development, which is just a different approach IMO. I do think she really doesn't show much growth in S1 and S2, which is one of my main complaints. She consistently loses in fights and never really seems to change anything. I also could have used like 100X more meetings with Aang, I think Aang had more time with Roku than Korra had with Aang.	episode_done:True

text:I agree with the other guy. The styling is supposed to make him look masculine and casual in women's clothing. He already walks the red carpet in Womenswear regularly in many ways an elegant look would be less groundbreaking.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I like it precisely because it looks slightly unfinished or unconsidered. Harry Styles has a really intense stylist and it’s vogue, there is absolutely no chance that these outfits were not considered to death by a bunch of really knowledgeable people.   He is definitely not meant to look pretty, and to me that’s part of the point. He’s just ... wearing a dress. It doesn’t even really look feminine per se, which I guess is what you’re reacting too. I think the point was really to not associate the dress with femininity, but to just treat it as another piece of clothing. That’s kind of how he deals with his sexuality: he studiously avoids making any statements whatsoever.   I think the place that I see something historical is not in the dress but in the fact that it’s a vogue cover. I don’t know if this was a one time thing or if vogue is going to now be more gender diverse with their cover models. To me that’s the question: is the point that he is a feminine man or rather that Vogue can set these categories aside on one of their covers, which is a really culturally significant object.  This made waves precisely because it was a Vogue cover. He has worn dresses before without this reaction. But it doesn’t clarify vogue’s position on gender really. My sense is that to they will occasionally feature male-identified models on their cover, and just generally observe more fluid norms around gender. In a way Harry is just the tool for Vogue to make a big move within their own history, maybe...	labels:Thanks for that response. I can totally see how my angle was gendered. I was projecting my personal aesthetic and not considering the greater statement. I’m glad it resonates with you both symbolically and in the visual presentation. I love conversations like this.
text:Yeah I like conversations like this too. I can suddenly see how it would just like weird and uninteresting if you had pretty clear gender categories. I feel more in the mix like he seems to, so it definitely does resonate with me. I think the thread below is interesting too, that it’s because he was seen as a hot male celebrity in One Direction and has gradually wound up wearing a dress on the cover of Vogue. I am not actually a super radical gender person, but there is something about Harry Styles that resonates extremely strongly with me. I frankly can’t say why.  The ppl in the other thread are emphasizing how there’s nothing inherently new about what he is doing but I disagree. I think he represents a very widely-consumable version of a gender queering position. He is at once legible as a British rock star and something very contemporary. It comes back to the sense of insouciance. I know everything he is doing is deliberate, but his attitude is that none of it should matter. I think other instances of celebrity gender bending were framed as being subversive, whereas he is trying to treat us as precisely not subversive but nothing. It’s a complicated move, for his radical thing to be to pretend that what he is doing isn’t radical. But for me it works and is quite smart and meaningful (even if it is, as the ppl in the other thread are saying, a series of calculated decisions, I don’t think it’s only that. I think he is following something genuine and internal, even if he is a professional concerned with having a successful career. He does strike me as being actually genuine in a sort of rare way. Idk. This was a long response, which shows how intensely his dress thing is impacting me.	labels:I’m glad you feel safe to express yourself here. I like what you had to say. I work to live without gender categories and I definitely projected just some of my aesthetic choices. I go for polished looks that are “complete” from head to toe so my first reaction was “needs some makeup”. But you’ve pointed out it’s more of a dejection of all that instead of just putting together a feminine look.   I wanna pose a question to you. Do you like Harry as the subject for something like this over someone like Billy Porter? Why or why not?	episode_done:True

text:My theory on why Harry is this: playing with gender in fashion isn't new as you pointed out, eternal icons like Grace Jones have been there and done that. However, Harry's instance is unique because we have seen in a highly publicized way the evolution of how he sees his gender. He started as a (sorry fans) generic white musician with bland style and has since sort of aggressively redone his look. I'm sure he's been called "brave" in numerous articles documenting his steps towards this moment. Similar pretty boys like Ansel Elgort and even people like Post Malone have played with gender, but none in an as aggressively pursued and marketed way as Harry did. I also think people see that he has an X-factor because of his sexual identity. Billy Porter being a publicly queer person is sort of expected to do these things. Yeah his gown moment was highly publicized but it certainly didn't "break the internet" and spawn discussion like this did.  edit: also exactly what u/Anthraxistaken said	labels:I was thinking that too about how it was all because we've seen his growth and I couldn't have summed it up better.	episode_done:True
text:Just how revolutionary is Harry Styles’ Vogue cover?	labels:Women look better in dresses.  You can be as progressive and woke as you want, and encourage whatever you want so people can express themselves, but aesthetics dont care about that stuff. Womens clothing is typically styled to cater to the female (sex) body. People always comment on the dress itself, or whether it works, but never how that same outfit would just look better on a female.  This is a matter of aesthetic and taste to some extent, and thinking that men generally look bad in dresses is a justified opinion.
text:This seems like an incomplete comment to me for a couple of reasons.  First, the argument that women look better in dresses isn't particularly useful, because that same reasoning could be applied to everyone, but just in this way; 'a more attractive person would look better in this' the comment doesn't isn't actually talking about this person in this piece of clothing.  Second, I think a big flaw around this is that women tend to look better in dresses because women have had thousands of years of aesthetic development to make dresses look good on them. I think that this dress itself conveys that quite well, the collar of this dress looks out of place to me and I think that is because the dress is held back by that idea that a dress is for women, and the design language and cut's haven't developed around men so much.  In particular, the style of ball gowns in particular which this dress effectively is, fall into that much harder than another type of dress might, more casual shirt-dresses that button down the front that can repurpose some of the aesthetic of mens shirts etc and would make the transition over to being worn by men with less of this friction.	labels:	episode_done:True

Shorts are generally worn for comfort -- they should be lighter, or softer, or both. And there are a few more reasons that jorts are... unnatural, but... They are, don't wear them unless you *really* know your shit. Like, "studies runway shows like an academic" level of knowing your shit.

text:Are jean shorts on men really that bad?	labels:I’ve seen them cycle in and out of style a couple times in my life. Like a lot of things, when they’re on-trend it’s relatively easier to style them, when they’re not it’s a higher degree of difficulty. To a lot of Americans they summon up associations with certain groups of unfashionable men (like stereotypes of hicks or rednecks), gay men (esp. if they’re short), and/or are a punch line (ala Tobias Fünke). Undercurrents of classism and homophobia in some of that, unfortunately. So when you wear them, some of the reaction you’ll get will depend on how you play either against or into all that.

text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:Congrats mate  I used to be obese as fuck like 35 BMI but now im at 20 BMI.

text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:First off congrats on not moping around and leveraging 2020 in a positive way.  Your style will keep evolving but a few suggestions from having made this journey.  1.  Get your workwear wired.  Not sure of your dress code but if you are biz cas go basic bastard and pick up some cheap j crew type of stuff.  Not to much but enjoy some 484s, you've earned it.  This will tide you over professionally.   2.  Start exploring. The best way to do this is look a lot of places for inspo but keep your lens wide.  It's a wide world out there.  3.  Start picking up a few pieces here or there.  Vintage and thrifting are your friends.  Try different things.  Some will stick, some won't.  But by getting it cheap you can experiment at a discount.  4.  Think about how you can accessorize and leverage what you have.  Simple things can raise your level (but don't do them all at once).  Throw on a cardi or blazer over your biz cas.  Buy a pocket square or two.  Switch the laces in your shoes.  Have fun and congrats.	episode_done:True
text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:I definitely changed my wardrobe up when I lost weight. I wore a lot of black, a lot of graphic tees, hoodies and straight cut jeans, basketball shorts, cargo shorts. I definitely am now in the “basic bastard” category of dress. No more black, but more subtle natural colors like dark green, navy, browns, etc. avoid sneakers and big logos but instead casual boots and such. Oh and everything slim fit, but obviously not ridiculously slim. Levi’s 511, J crew 484, etc. I definitely experimented when I was dropping weight and still had to dress business casual. But yeah don’t overthink.	episode_done:True
text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:Congratulations on the healthy transition.   First, don’t buy a new wardrobe all at once. Have fun buying a shirt or pair of pants in your new sizes but your body might still be changing shape and your taste and confidence in clothing with it. Vintage is a good way to go if this is your first time really branching out into fashion.  Second, don’t overcorrect for slim fits. Mercifully the super skinny fits trend is over and I wouldn’t be too self-conscious about not having muscles. I’m tall and slim, but a too-right shirt can still look like a sausage casing.

See what you like an experiment with detail and little areas of outfits to find what you enjoy, and eventually ideas for a whole wardrobe will come from there.	episode_done:True
text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:First off congrats. I'm curious how you made the transition during the quarantine, but that's a big accomplishment and give yourself a pat on the back.  It sounds like you have gone from chubby to skinny but you are about to put on more muscle. I wouldn't go super-slim if you're still gymming and putting on muscle. I basically went from  medium to a small then back to a medium from putting on muscle.  I probably would hold off on investing in more rigid pieces like jeans for a bit, but if you work out a lot I would invest in better gym clothes (i.e. Nike Tech Pack is something I really like), and get nice stretchy clothes that can accomodate your physique like cardigans. I would also invest in a good fleece (i.e. Patagonia or North Face). Essentially anything that you imagine stretches a bit and is something you wear every day, I would get nicer versions of. T-shirts should not be a big investment and I would just get from Uniqlo for slightly oversized from any brand really.  I think pants are a bigger question mark and for now it would help to go with an elastic waistband or wear something inexpensive that you can experiement with (i.e. Uniqlo, Levis, Unbranded, J. Crew if on sale). Honestly I don't really wear either much these days and don't recommend buying them if you're expecting to be at home for the majority of the time, as you'll want things that you wear a lot (IMO).  If you provide your height and weight I'm happy to provide my input there too. I went from \~170ish to \~150ish at 5'8" a few years ago, then put on muscle, then am back to being a fatass so will be making a similar transition over the next few weeks.	episode_done:True
text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:Congratulations, man! I cannot express how much better I feel now that I’ve dropped weight; I’m sure you feel the same way.   I really just turned what was normal normal fit and maybe a half-size big to more of a tailored look and the actual, correct size.   I’ve also felt more confident which has led to slightly different looks. I’ve always been a little more of a conservative dresser but now I’m incorporating a few more styles into the wardrobe. Really nothing major but a few tweaks that I really love.   Side note: it is super frustrating that tailored clothes look off as soon as you lose weight. I had to completely rebuild my formal wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 28, 2020	labels:There's a part of me that wants to lean into "Small business Saturday" and buy something from Etsy or wherever, but damn, they don't make it easy. It's such a wasteland of drop-shipped Alibaba products, cheap crafts (like Gildan tees that have been tie-dyed or bleached and then upsold for $50), and just straight up scams (i.e. polyester being marketed as wool), finding actual stores by actual craftspeople seems a total crapshoot. I know they must exist because I know actual craftspeople who sell through Etsy but unfortunately they seem like the minority. I wonder if anybody has ever made like a Chrome extension or something to cross reference Etsy with Alibaba/Aliexpress to at least filter the shameless "I'm even reselling using Aliexpress's same photography" 1:1 matches.
text:This is the same problem I have with eBay. I'm sure they have exactly what I want _somewhere_ but digging through all the mislabeled or fake crap is exhausting and not worth it.   Especially disappointing when you see something "handmade" that looks nice in the photo, immediately followed by several listings from different sellers with different titles using the same photo.  Or how the reviews for an item saying "great quality!" are actually for different items from the same seller.  _Ugh._	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Be careful with cheap rings like those, they'll stain your fingers green. I don't think there's any danger of it damaging your clothes, it's just annoying when after a couple of wears the silver has worn off and your fingers are a mess for a few days.

Sadly I couldn’t make the decision and had to transfer him to a coordinator who eventually brought the details to our VP, who declined (stupid reasons why).

text:early 2000s looks are already hugely popular again, especially with younger people.  If you go to the hip neighborhoods in brooklyn you'll see tons of cool kids wearing big baggy jeans and oversized tees/racing jackets, which makes sense as fashion is trending toward looser fitting clothing in general.  The main difference is cuffed/cropping in the pants, but even then there's a lot of people, especially girls, wearing baggy low-rise cargo pants that go full break at their big chunky sneakers.	labels:i see where it comes from, cause for the past few years cuffing pants and having a more looser fit became alot more popular, this just seems like a normal transition from that to a more oversized/cuffed look from the tapered look thats kinda falling out tbh.   like its something i see alot of people who cuff their pants above the shoe moving to. like me honestly and i see it being a thing in the future i just cant see myself doing it.	episode_done:True

text:That’s very broad and incorrect. Plenty of cholos were and are criminals, but to say they were “as a rule” just isn’t true and frankly is xenophobic at best, racist at worst. It’s like saying guys who wear black leather jackets sell meth in biker gangs. Only more racially-loaded.	labels:Ha, I am Chicano. Don't get it twisted, trying to glorify evil through a lifestyle choice is idiotic. Especially by waiving the race flag/Xenophobic flag. Get over your virtue signaling brah.
text:I’m not Chicano, but I grew up in a place with plenty of folks who dressed like this, and plenty of them were not criminals.	labels:I'd say this, Cholos wear this style because it identified them as banging and are far different then those rare...rare unicorn exceptions where people dressed like this as a style choice and weren't trying to appear affiliated to a gang.  BTW, Cholos weren't growing into a size 50 pant.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand?

text:FAQ: What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I haven’t made myself any rigorous challenges, but i have tried to be more mindful about purchases.  In my opinion, a bit of self awareness goes along way.  If i am thinking about an item i write it down on my wishlist. I dont buy anything that hasn’t been on that wishlist. If I come across something online, even if it is a flash sale, just put it in the cart, on the wishlist, and chill. I come back to the list periodically, and see what i still want, what i still think about, and what ive either forgotten or don’t really want anymore. The time waiting on that list should be directly related to the price.  Don’t succumb to the FOMO. For me, not filling my life with extra stuff i might not actually want is far better than missing out on a deal. If i only thought about it because of the sale, i can afford to wait for the next sale.   This has been effective for me. There are plenty of things that I would probably enjoy, but most often, after thinking it out over time, it’s clear that I wouldn’t enjoy them significantly more than things I already have. If i had implemented this technique from the start of my clothes interest, I estimate id be about $2-3k richer now. The only thing i can think of now which ive consistently been interested in for a few years would be some guidi boots, but honestly those are too far out of my price range to make happen	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I try my best to only buy during sales and when I buy it's under two circumstances. The first if I need something that I don't have that are absolute necessaties such as work pants, or to update a particular item if a similar item is found that offers the same benefits if not more e.g. old, thinning bomber jacket vs insulated bomber jacket.  I haven't bought any new casual button downs or dress shirts in a year since I'm satisfied with my current collection and most likely it'll be the same for the upcoming year.  For shoes,  I live in an area that's notorious for its weather so I take extra precaution on wearing the proper footwear to and from work or the gym inorder to extend the life of the shoes. Annual cleaning and maintenance is necessary.  Note: It helps to wear items for their intended purposes. I  wear jeans at times but I don't go camping or hiking in them, nor do I wear them when it's exceptionally hot or humid. I have an interest in raw denim and have heard stories of people wearing their raws for everything in order to get fades. I don't do that. Same thing applies to welted boots.	episode_done:True

Buying pants is a huge struggle because I have large calves (~17in circumference)and usually have to try on a bunch of pairs to find something that isnt too tight.  Does anyone have any good suggestions for brands to look at? My last good pair is Banana Republic but they do not have any indication of what type they are.  Been looking at Bonobos but hear they’re pretty inconsistent with sizing.	episode_done:True

I’ve been training at the gym on and off for a fair few years but recently I’ve been struggling to find comfortable fitting t shirts.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 26, 2020	labels:I've always heard "match your leathers and metals". But it's honestly pretty hard to match all of your leather and metal items perfectly. I often have items in varying shades. Is it a big faux pas to mix leather colors or is it not a big deal? (E.g. natural colored leather accessories while wearing dark brown leather shoes)
text:Matching  metals is not a thing,  except in men’s tailoring where you match your belt buckle, to your cufflinks, to your tiebar. It doesn’t apply to jewelry or watches both of which come in two-tone varieties,  making it impossible to match in those circumstances.   Matching leather is a little more nuanced.  With men’s tailoring you should match your shoes and belt pretty close. Same with the upper levels of business casual say blazer and/or tie. It also doesn’t apply to watch straps or accessories  Anything below that level, getting it approximate is close enough. I like to match brown to  brown but don’t worry about the shade all that much.  if I’m wearing oxblood shoes I wear a brown belt.   For actual casual outfits; jeans and iron rangers or streetwear etc,  it doesn’t matter at all	labels:	episode_done:True
