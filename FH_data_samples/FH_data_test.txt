text:I second the Blundstones! I've had the #1351 Original High-Top Boots and the #584 Thermal Chelsea Boots, and I love them both. The #1351 have a slimmer ankle and are water-resistant. The #584 are completely water-proof and have a removable sheepskin footbed and are super warm. I wore them nearly every day last winter, and they still look new. They do take a bit of breaking in though, especially the #584 because the ankle is slim.	labels:	episode_done:True

If they get too broken down, you can send them in and they’ll replace the rubber sole and spruce them up.  Every couple of weeks I keep the leather soft by rubbing Chamberlain’s Leather Milk on them and they’re soft and supple despite frequent negative degree temps (0 degrees today!).   I truly can’t recommend them enough.	episode_done:True

My makeup look depends on what is going on that day?  Do I have a work Zoom where I need to look presentable?  Then I'll do a neutral look with taupe/pink.  (Meanwhile, I can wear a nice top and PJ pants on that Zoom call.) If I don't need to be on camera, then the sky is the limit and I will go wild and colorful.  I have over 30 palettes and do a shop my stash rotation.  Also if it is a holiday, I will do a look in that holiday's colors.  Coming up is a pink look and later a green one.	episode_done:True

When I wear makeup, it’s always minimal and designed around hiding my flaws and making me look healthier.

If Im wearing my black velvet blazer set I’ll do thé likes of and orange and gold Smokey eye to make it more bold and less professional looking! I have a very dressy style with masculine, Victorian, and highly detailed elements so bold colorful makeup makes some of my more stuffy looks less boring. I’ve lately been after doing my foundation putting a bit of blush from the bottom front of my eye bags to the top of my brow bone. I love how it makes makeup a little more unique and makes me look a little less baby faced.  I used to wear very skater boyish/ art kid outfits and hair ( I still respect the style still though ) but wore heavy Instagram glam style makeup. I still do glam makeup but it looked quite odd at times! I didn’t really think much about makeup in relation to clothing then, not that it’s really necessary! I feel I’ve come far with my style!

I love makeup, especially lipstick so much. If I’m wearing a red dress generally I’ll also wear a red lip. I have a mustard yellow dress that I think looks amazing with an orangey-red lipstick I have. I have a light lavender/lilac coloured dress that I like to wear a plumb lipstick with or a lilac coloured eyeshadow. If I’m going for a more neutral look I do beige or pink eyeshadow and a nude lipstick. I also think white tops and dresses look really good with red or bright pink lipstick.	episode_done:True

text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:You Need A Budget. No, really - it's the best money-management app/process I've found. I signed up when I realized that I had promise to pay for a family Italian cruise because I had my first well-paying job - But I didn't seem to be getting ahead even though I was making twice as much as I had before. Zero-based budgeting in general is the way to go but I love YNAB for making that system easy to manage.  The thing that works for me about zero-based is that I can really easily prioritize the things that are important to me and also see the trade-off I'm making for every purchase if I change those priorities. It keeps those little windfalls or pay raises from just vanishing into the ether. I got paid $64 last week for a poshmark sale, and I immediately put that money in my March rent category. Before, I would have gone and bought a new shirt, or spent it all on soup dumplings, or bought a new shirt and then spilled the soup dumplings I also bought on the new shirt. 😅  If fashion is important to you, then you can prioritize that and invest in a wardrobe that will give you joy. If it's travel, put your money toward that instead, and you'll feel the power to walk away from a good sale because you know it's just a distraction from your real goals. I still spend a lot on clothes and eating out, but I no longer feel guilty or stressed about it, because when I spend it's a conscious choice.  I guess this is more general financial advice than specific to OP's situation, but I find it useful for any of us who have expensive hobbies (aka all of mine) or potential big expenses like OP's.	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I have a pretty extensive budget that I still have plenty of room for clothes shopping in! I have had a budget since I started working professionally 3 years ago.  I have three sections: Bills (phone, rent, student loans, power etc), Expenses (food, gas, “fun”) and Savings (anything I’m saving up for: laptop, trips, gifts, my niece’s college fund, hobbies, and clothes! As well as an emergency fund where everything else goes).  I generally consider the clothing fund to be a low priority so I set about $40 a paycheque to it, but I don’t necessarily spend that much every two weeks. I also usually cap it at $500, where if it’s grown to that amount then I take my $40 every two weeks and put it to something else.   Generally I don’t spend all of it before a new paycheque comes along but if I do, I will use some of my “fun” money in expenses to cover the rest.   I have gotten two pay increases in the last two years as well as moved houses twice + paid off my loan (different bill amounts) so whenever I readjust my budget I start with my bills, generally keep my fun + grocery amounts the same, and then increase my savings categories a bit while mostly prioritizing putting the excess into my emergency account. When I started working I think I was setting aside $20 or $25 for clothes, now up to $40.  Maybe more long-winded than you wanted but that’s the jist :)	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I had a career and location change where I had a lot more disposable income than before and I definitely overspent on clothing/shoes/bags I didn’t need. It’s weird because it’s something I never did when I made less money. This years focus is to pay off debt and sell items I’m not actually using or don’t actually love. And stick to my budget on mint.com.	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:Raising awareness of what I actually use.   Complimenting people's insistence that you budget, you also need to know where YOU will find the best VALUE of your wardrobe spending. What do you use? What are statement pieces of your fashion? What brings you the most joy?   * I have been using a closet inventory app. Stylebook tracks the costs and number of times I actually wear my clothes with which outfits too.   Although some styling habits might seem like common sense (like basic quality t-shirts and winter coating pay off), I learnt about other neat tendencies:  Scarves vs Sweaters. Scarves might seem more versatile and can pair with so many outfits for other people. But honestly, I live in sweaters.. maybe because it's cold... or maybe because I want to be cozy. If I didn't have the style app, I would probably think about 'investing' in a cashmere scarf. Now, I'm so much happier to budget for vintage pre-loved cashmere sweaters.   Do I even put on my accessories? Bracelets? Necklaces? Nope. Apparently throwing on colourful clothes is my go-to. I save so much money, not buying any jewelry - no bracelets, no necklaces, no earrings. (It makes my savings happier)  * I prioritize my next purchases from there.   The other thing I've invested in: **10x spending more in proper clothing care.** Proper laundry detergent, keeping old toothbrushes to scrub stains, a foldable drying rack, a sweater comb, and leather conditioners.   * Clothing care, only way to keep clothes looking professional and last.

text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I don't have a prescribed budget that I stick to, but I try my best to ensure I max out my generous 401k match and other accounts provided from my employer. I have a certain amount I keep stashed away as an emergency fund if I can't work for several months, some for paranoia from being raised lower-income and some for the fact that I live in a HCOL area. Other than that, I am super flexible with how I spend my money, which is ~dangerous~. Luckily, fashion and food are my only pricey hobbies. I'm really privileged to be in this position with a rewarding job and understand that this is not the norm for many.  I got a substantial promotion and raise this last summer, so I definitely have been overspending this year as I try to ramp my wardrobe back to my ideal self, rather than my more practical self; I was also purchasing a limited number of pieces since I was in a client-facing role making half as much. I moved from buying clothes on the more affordable spectrum (mainly pre-scandal Everlane, and KOTN) to buying pricier pieces, usually in the pre-owned designer spectrum (mainly bags, shoes, and outerwear ranging from $200-$3000). I'm finally scaling back by having a curated wishlist and aiming to resell any unused pieces (easier said than done).	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:Hmm I don't set money aside for clothes specifically. I have a general budget divided into monthly bills, savings, food, and other expenses. Clothes usually fall under "other expenses", unless it would be a huge purchase that I'd have to save up for specifically - but that rarely happens).  I only buy clothes like 3-4 times a year, usually to replace old stuff, or if my wardrobe needs some extra something, or if I find a really nice item that I'll definitely wear a lot. I know what sort of styles, colors, fabrics etc I tend to go for. I avoid impulse purchases, I already have enough stuff sitting around because I have nothing to match it with or nowhere to wear it lmao	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:Budget + plan ahead! I definitely fell for the lifestyle creep when I first started working, and it unfortunately took me too long to dig my way out. Now that I have, I use the 50/30/20 budget, and if there's something I want and it's not currently in my budget, I'll wait until the next month to get it when there is. I also mostly shop at Aritzia bc their sizing works best for me, so I've also learned their sale cycle and I usually plan ahead so that I do most of my clothing shopping during those times.	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I finished up grad school last year and started working full time, so I totally went through that transition. For me, I don’t have a set clothing budget, but I do have a monthly “wants” budget that clothing purchases go into. I try to be strategic and identify gaps in my wardrobe and work from there, buying things as I have the money/need for them. It has been a big change going from mostly buying secondhand to having more to spend, but I still love to thrift/posh etc. My budget now is significantly more than it was in grad school though, so I have more flexibility.   One of the more difficult parts for me was feeling like I needed nicer, high quality items for work. Those get expensive! For example I recently bought a wool dress coat since I only had a parka. I am lucky in that my work is quite casual, so most of my wardrobe works for both work and casual stuff.	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:When I had to buy business/work clothes, I invested in a really nice, fitted black suit, a couple of collared shirts, and a pair of flats. Those were my basic essentials that I knew I could mix and match with a lot of stuff. Everything else I picked up at Goodwill.   My coworkers commented on my cute clothes so I think it was a great strategy. I collected a pretty huge work closet for practically pennies.  After that, I've never had a clothing budget. My closet is a pretty good deterrent of overspending because I hate clutter and I hate having a crammed closet so if I think I dont have room and an item I'm looking at isn't worth creating room in my closet, I dont buy it.	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:For the last few years I started tracking all of my spending. I then make an educated guess for what my budget should be for the upcoming year, based on past averages and predictions about what type of life events might be coming up that year.   Each paycheck, I set some money aside to my Girly Savings. This way, when I do a bunch of shopping or find an expensive item, it's not just coming out of my general spending money.   Currently I'm setting aside $400/month to my Girly Savings which includes clothes, makeup, skincare, hair and accessories. I buy most of my clothes in large batches in the spring and fall so it helps me to have an accumulated stash of cash.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:Honestly, I feel like the best way to be sustainable is to just buy less. I try not to buy much and attempt to not buy from companies that seem particularly egregious, and I do thrift, but I’m also still paying off student loans and hardly raking in the cash.  Is it better to buy your one shirt every 3 years from a sustainable brand that treats its workers well? For sure! But I’m typing this my iPhone with a Macbook in front of me and to be honest, so are a lot of people that claim to only shop ethically. Do what you can, absolutely, but let’s not let perfect be the enemy of good.
text:Absolutely!! I do what I can, but mostly I just try to buy less because even cheap clothes are a huge portion of my income. If your budget is such that a $50 jacket is already a big purchase you're only doing every few years and a $900 jacket is impossible, it's ok to buy the cheap version and keep yourself warm.	labels:1000%! I have a parka from American Eagle that I got in high school (I graduated 11 years ago...) that I still wear every winter. Was it sustainably and ethically made? Likely not, but thanks to that $70 purchase I’ve avoided buying who knows how many new coats.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:My personal philosophy: If all you can afford is fast fashion, but you buy minimally and wear frequently and for a long time, no one should judge you for not being sustainable. That’s absolutely a valid way to participate in slow fashion. If you can afford ethical brands though, then I think you should purchase from them instead.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:I love that you brought this up. Of course, there are are ethical retailers out there that have lower prices, but if you are young and/or poor, there is a certain amount of fast fashion that you need to buy because it fits your price/budget. Even though it isn’t ideal, not all fast fashion is gone in a couple years, if you are buying less trendy pieces you can wear for a while.  Many things I’ve bought from fast fashion retailers I’ve had for years - I haven’t changed my height or weight much in over 10 years, so I have tops from Old Navy I have had for 10 years and other clothes that have lasted way past 5 years.  Reducing consumption is a key part of ethical fashion and even if you buy it from a retailer that is cheaper because that’s what you can afford, if you keep it a long time and don’t buy a bunch of clothes all the time, you are reducing demand and helping the environment.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:I’ve struggled with this as well. I think the most important thing is to just consume less. Easier said then done that’s for sure.   I’ve definitely had clothes from forever 21 last longer than aritzia. I’ve gotten clothing from thrift stores that have lasted me longer as well.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:The reason why fast fashion is often seen as bad is because fast fashion is synonymous with trendy clothes that wear out within 2/3 washes and unethical labor practices.   Trends change very fast and If a shirt is $5, how much do you think each person who worked on it is getting paid?  I personally have a hard time believing in sustainable fashion nowadays because so many brands that marketed themselves as sustainable have been found to use the same practices as unsustainable ones. This includes high end fashion labels that sell a T-shirt for $2000 but pays their employees the same as forever 21.   So I think of you can get multiple wear out of a fast fashion item, it’s a win for you as an individual. More expensive doesn’t always mean better practices or quality. I’ve bought more expensive items that lasted just as long or not even as long as my Zara items.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:r/zerowaste has had discussions on the topic. So has r/frugal I guess and there are a few other subs. I don't think there is a fixed rule. The world is changing too fast for that.  Maybe the key is to scale down spending, thrift as much as possible and be critical when shopping. Price does not necessarily equals quality.    The way I see it, high-end brands are just expensive. Nowadays luxury brands seem to be as mass-produced as anything else. Profit above all.  I also have realized that brand loyalty in the 21st century might have become a bit silly. I have trusted brands in the past but it seems pointless now, bc even sizing can change randomly.  Maybe customers shd spend more carefully. Buy what is needed, make sure what you are getting is looking good on you, it looks well-made and it feels nice on your skin. It is better to have fewer garments that make you look superb than many trashy pieces that will not do you any justice. Every person has their beauty, we shd only have and wear what makes us look fabulous.  My two cents	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:The most sustainable choice is the one that is already in your closet. If you already own something that wasn’t made ethically or sustainably, there’s no benefit in trashing it if you still like it and can use it. In a similar vein, there’s already so much clothing out there, that buying something second hand that’s still in good shape is often an option.  I think aritzia and j crew are still fast fashion, just more expensive fast fashion than old navy or forever 21- they’re still introducing tons of new products and feeding in to the consumerist drive to have the newest things.   No one is perfect, but we can strive to reduce our impact on an individual scale and aim to reduce our purchases, focus on buying used when it’s possible and try to purchase ethical and local when it’s not.  I definitely am not perfect on this front, but I try and buy from consignment shops as a first choice when I want something, and I’m working to choose smaller brands that have clear supply chains and ethical manufacturing. If it’s made in Canada (where I’m from) then that’s awesome.  At the end of the day I hope that my fashion choices exploit the least number of people and has the lowest environmental impact possible, and often that looks like me telling myself I don’t really need the new thing, even if I think it’s amazing and really really want it	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:Capitalism has made us believe we can always buy our way out of problems--that consuming differently will fix the consumption problem. The true antidote, like others have said, is buying less and taking good care of the items you have and like (ethically sourced or not). I don't think there is much difference between Forever 21 and J Crew, just the price. No one is going to advertise "buy less", "wash your stuff gently!" because...how do you make money doing that? It's on us to see the sham and make the changes necessary	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:Sustainable consumption complicated and everyone is going to have their own ways to go about it. It's good that you're keeping and using what you buy for years (no matter what the brand), so that's a start.  Synthetics are made of plastic and can release microplastics into the environment when they are worn and washed. Cotton takes up lots of land and water. Leather lasts way longer than pleather but then you have the cruelty aspect and tanning leather does require a lot of harmful chemicals. Expensive doesn't always mean ethical, but ethical clothing does tend to cost more. There is always going to be a footprint - not buying anything at all is probably the safest and most sustainable way but obviously we still need things now and then!   It's taken me YEARS to change my habits and transition to a better wardrobe, and even then I'm still not fast fashion-free. I had to wait to use up what I had and be able to afford something better. It took time to refine and define my style to determine what pieces would give me the most mileage. Each person will have to determine what is important to them when it comes to sustainability. Like, I'm not very picky about my purses but I tend to vet my shoes and what my options are when it comes time to repair or dispose of them.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:> So where does that leave the consumer who has a closet full of items purchased at fast fashion retailers, but rarely makes new purchases and many of their current pieces have remained in their closet for years?   If you already have a closet full of fast fashion, taking good care of it and using it for as long as possible is the most ethical choice.  I'm in the same boat.  I'm doing a year of no new clothes/shoes purchases (only thrifted/poshmark) and I'm trying to only get things that are high quality and will last, even if they are used.    Most of these online clothing boutiques (at least the ones I see on Poshmark/Facebook/Instagram are not sourcing ethically produced items.  I'm sure there are some that are, but they all seem to have the same stuff and you can tell just from the photos that it's cheaply made.  Again, I haven't seen every online boutique there is so I'm sure there are some out there that are fine.	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I usually don’t experience any negativity when shopping in the men’s dept. Go after what you’re into and don’t worry about the employees anyway! One thing I will say is for pants or shorts, in my experience, it’s better to buy masculine styled clothes fit for women. Then you avoid the weird men’s fitting and bulge.
text:Agreed. My son is FTM and finds most men’s pants to be problematic because his hips aren’t straight. He does a lot of elastic waists and athletic wear. You’re probably better off with bottom items designed for women. As for the employees...I wouldn’t worry. People are more open minded than ever, and if they do act rude you can take your business elsewhere.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:No one has ever bothered me, I’ve even had a female sales clerk agree with me that men’s shirts are more comfortable.  I typically only buy men’s tops, tees or hoodies or sweatshirts. I don’t try for fitted, only loose, and usually go for second hand since I mostly wear it as loungewear.  Pants I haven’t had much luck with. If the waist can be cinched small enough, that means the hips barely fit or they are way too tight when I sit down or bend over. A medium is too large and can’t be cinched small enough.  Board shorts/basketball shorts are ok, the leg is loose enough to accommodate the lady hips, regardless of the waist size. I generally don’t like the look of these on me, but you may have different preferences.	episode_done:True

text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:Not trans and don't dress intentionally masculine, but I'm a woman who shops in the men's section all the time and it's fine! Just do it and after the first couple of times it'll feel easy. Anybody who is rude to you has the problem, not you, but it's never happened to me, including while shopping in other countries - - in Japan I wouldn't fit in most women's clothes, so I basically have to shop the men's and they seemed to think it was interesting and were happy to make the sale.  Maybe not the most apposite comment for your situation but wanted you to have the perspective that there are a lot of reasons you might be shopping there so you don't even have to feel like you're under undue scrutiny. One more suggestion: if you can, it might be easier to shop in a bigger city; in New York nobody would blink.	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I used to get heaps of stuff at the men's as well. Some  pieces are much nicer when made for them, don't ask me why.  Just go there and if you feel uncomfortable you can always say you have to try them on in order to see whether it fits your husband/partner/boyfriend/etc.   I actually did this many times, including for my dad, bc I knew how it shd look on me in order to fit them (sleeve length, shoulders etc).  Staff shd not really care, I guess -?   Imho, trousers are a bit trickier but I have bought men's shorts and pants as well, you just have to check them out and see....  Good luck and happy shopping :)	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:My partner shops in the men's section and hasn't had any issues, to my knowledge.   Brands that have worked include Lucky brand (especially for jeans), Banana Republic (boxer briefs and button-downs), and I think American Eagle (t-shirts, maybe shorts I think). I'll try to think of others.   They've also had a lot of luck at a certain local thrift store that carries a lot of menswear, which admittedly can be tricky to find and is especially challenging during a pandemic. That's a great way to find out what brands and styles work best for your body though: try out a ton of different ones.   Consider if there are any ways to access hand-me-downs from friends for this, too - my friends had a lot of clothing swaps in the before times and lots of my queer friends wear or used to wear men's clothes. If not your friends, there may be groups in your area that share or trade clothes. And on that note, regardless of your own identity, you might find some other ideas online by looking at queer fashion resources online.   Regarding the brands I've mentioned above, my partner's physique is relatively long and lean, so take this advice with a grain of salt if you are plus sized and/or generally have curvier proportions. For example, I'm close in size to them or possibly even a bit smaller right now, but I am smaller on top than on the bottom. That's pretty inconvenient for men's clothes, so I would probably need to shop a bit differently. There are definitely plus-sized and curvy queer bloggers out there who look awesome in menswear wardrobes, so hopefully you can find some inspiration about how to make menswear work for your shape.   Finally... If you have the funds, there are definitely custom options available. My partner got a custom suit for our wedding, including some tailored shirts. You can also get off the rack clothes tweaked by a tailor, which is probably something I would want to do.	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I have shopped the men's department before and never had issues with sales associates. The biggest thing was once, they wouldn't let me in the dressing room and I had to go to one on another floor, because there were already men in there (but everyone had their own room and the only communal space was the mirror area? Like, not sure why it mattered, I ended up making the purchase at the register near the other dressing room and the guy lost a sale, which may have been petty but...I'd used that dressing room before with zero issue, so 🤷‍♀️) But I have had issues with some cuts of men's clothes--they aren't really cut for boobs and hips, so I had to get them tailored. There are some companies that do masculine/androgynous looks for those bodies, like Kirrin Finch, that might be worth checking out!	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I work at a mid-higher end men's clothing store and we have women come in regularly for themselves. I can honestly say we 100% don't care who tries on/buys our clothes! We're just happy to help you find something you like and are comfortable in :) The only reason I can think of why you might not be able to try clothes on is if the store doesn't have their dressing rooms open, which unfortunately is the case for a decent amount of retailers around me. If you feel uncomfortable you can always just buy items you think you might like and return them. When it comes to pants I do know they're cut to have extra room in the "bulge" area. I'd recommend finding a lower-cut mens pant just so there will be less room in the fly. Welcome to the world of actually opaque white clothing!	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:Is there a way you could achieve the same vibe/aesthetic but using different cuts or shapes? I love those silk skirts that are trendy, but I have scoliosis and they just don’t work on my uneven hips. However, pleated maxi skirts achieve the same vibe but fit me better! Maybe there’s something similar you could find too.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I noticed it’s the pants with pockets that creates that problem.  Maybe sewing them shut would help the silhouette issue.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:One thing we don’t talk about much is the importance of tailoring and undergarments for those 50s and 60s looks.  There’s a reason a lot of the actresses on Mad Men had to wear crinolines and girdles and cone bras with their costumes; that’s what created the silhouette.  Also 50s and 60s inspired clothes that have a lot of stretch in the fabric won’t hang or move the same. ETA:  oops, I see you said ‘men’s fashion’.  The part of my comment re: tailoring and fabric content still applies!	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:This is pretty much what finding your style is.  You're taking what you like or whatever vision you have in your head, and combining it with your reality; your budget, your time investment, your lifestyle, & your actual body.  That said, it's not impossible to pull of a specific look, but if it plays against your strengths, but it's going to be more of a time investment to get it right.  The most efficient way to do this would be to learn how to sew, so that you can either tailor or make everything yourself.  Alternatively, you've got to try on a ton of clothes to get the fit you wan,t and probably still need to get things tailored.  There are a ton of ways that you can get an outfit to lean one way or the other, either through styling or accessories.  Personally, I love a good menswear inspired look; but I don't love it on my body and I'm not gonna be bothered with finding curvy, petite pants when I don't even particularly like pants.  However, chopping off my hair really helped me feel a lot more comfortable wearing more feminine silhouettes without it feeling so feminine.  It might make sense to pick out the elements that work for you (colours? materials? tops?) and mixing it with other things that you like/work for you body.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I definitely feel this. I have a large butt/hips and do often find that they impact the shape of silhouettes that I'm trying to wear. I'm very inspired by menswear as well and dress fairly androgynously. I tend to modify menswear silhouettes slightly so that I can achieve something similar. I personally feel much better in high waisted pants with a tucked in shirt/sweater - somehow I feel like it emphasizes my lower body less and gives me a sleeker line from top to bottom, so when I'm drawing influence from menswear I tend to modify it with a higher waistline. I also make sure that I'm defining my upper body with tops that are more structured around the shoulder. Drop shoulders don't play well with me.  I find with these tweaks I'm able to both find a nice balance where I don't feel like I'm fighting against my body and I'm also able to invoke more masculine references and play with most silhouettes I like. Although it did take me a lot of trial and error to figure out it out.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:It took me quite a bit of time and money to realise that there are some styles I like looking at but do not suit me - either my body type or my personality, or both.  The hardest to let go of was the sort of floaty, drapey, effortless boho style. I wanted to waft around the place like a modern Romantic whilst gardening and being all artsy and shit. But my shape is basically round with hints of hourglass, my personality is not best suited to wafting anywhere (I bounce, mostly), and show me mud or art supplies and I will be covered in them before I've actually got near them. And any skirt that's made of light enough material to drape and waft elegantly, or goes below my knees, is going to be ripped to shreds within a day. So yeah - I admire those looks on other people and have discovered a style I like, that's practical for me and reflects my personality a bit.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:Figure out what inspires you about the style and then "translate" that to your own shape (and vibe and lifestyle etc). The retro men's khakis probably look good on the men in the photos because they're tailored to flatter that specific shape - they communicate ease and perfection and the possibility of summer fun. Try a capri pant in a bright or summery color that fits your shape to communicate those vibes on yourself.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I feel you on this. I love me some 20s and 60s, but my DNA said LOLNOPE  A lady on this very same site told me that she’s got wide hips, but can still wear some stuff designed for the “ideal” 20s body with help from shapewear. Would you try that?	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I feel this. In my case I think the problem stems from me getting pieces that I like aesthetically but that have something wrong with them that I ignored/didn’t realize until later. For instance I got these shorts that looked really cute but got really wrinkly around the crotch after I’d sat down, and then they just looked like a monstrosity. Like my entire outfit was completely overshadowed by my goddamn crotch haha. I ended up donating them because I realized that even though they were a style I liked and a great color, the fabric was not right for me. Getting a good pair of khakis that flatter your curves will go a long way. Get them tailored if there is something wrong with the fit on an otherwise good pair of pants. Just look for that holy grail pair that fits you nicely, and don’t buy stuff that is *almost* good enough but has a problem (unless it’s a problem tailoring can fix).	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I struggle with this as well, but I have sometimes succeeded in making a style work that didn't come naturally to me. The things that help me the most are:  1) Really studying the references I like. Where is the silhouette loose? Where is it tight? At what point on a limb are the seams tailored to fall? What are the other key styling details I need to recreate? With proper tailoring, I think you can recreate a lot of looks (think of how much contouring your makeup can change your face; it's easy to create illusions on your body even if your body proportions don't cater to the typical silhouette of the lewk)  2) Take photos of your attempts and study those. Having a reference photo of what you tried and then studying it in a similar way can really help you hone in on what's working and what's not. I especially recommend looking back on the photo over the course of a couple days. Seeing a photo of my own styling after some time has passed since I created the look helps me see what is and isn't working more objectively.  3) Experiment, experiment, experiment. This was easier when there wasn't a pandemic and you could go try lots of things on, but it can still be doable. And it often takes a LOT of experimentation, but it can be really fun if you're motivated to expand your style. May not be worth it for everyone though! I think it takes a hobbyist's amount of effort.   Of course, sometimes it may just be that you appreciate a style more on others than on yourself (I will never feel like myself in a bohemian look), or you don't appreciate it enough on yourself to invest the time it would take to nail the execution (which is totally fine!)
text:I find photos super useful when I *cover my face* and revisit the photos a couple days later. I am able to be much more impartial about fit & proportions and am less hypercritical.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:kind of all of them? It seems like you have to pay pretty steep prices now to get the quality of clothes that mid-price mall brands had in the 1990s and early 2000s. It seems that most stores have switched to a model of selling poor quality pieces at huge markups with the expectation that they will sell most of the stock at clearance prices. The GAP used to have quality staples, and J Crew was "fancy." Now GAP is really the same quality as Old Navy, and don't know what J Crew is anymore. The quality has certainly dropped, but I also don't get what is up with the designs since you can't even get a reasonable women's suit there these days. Madewell is not made well. Anthropologie used to sell unique pieces with really good construction, now it's roughly the same as other fast fashion, though I do appreciate that they added petite and plus sizing and carry some high end brands too. Levi's main line is terrible now, and to get the heritage quality, you need to get the Made and Crafted line, which is really expensive!  I mostly shop secondhand because I can't afford the stuff I like. When buying new, I try to wait for sales and avoid buying anything "final sale" or with complicated returns unless I know it will work. Clothes that I used to get at Anthropologie, I now get from Sezane, Ulla Johnson, Doen, and Samantha Pleet. I started buying vintage jeans over Madewell/Levi's or expensive craft brands—my 1980s Chic and Gitano jeans were probably sold at K-Mart/Target but are better quality than anything I have gotten from Madewell. I don't wear jeans/denim enough to justify craft denim prices. Patagonia is still very high quality technical wear; I just scope out the Tyler sport outlet and secondhand for deals. Shoes are hard because I don't like to get them secondhand. I switched from Adidas to Veja and Diemme for sneakers (you can find Diemme shoes for huge markdowns on Yoox during the winter and summer sales—I don't think they are worth retail price).
text:Woah, thank you for this very detailed list of what you have experienced with your favorite clothing brands too! And for ideas of where to shop Anthropologie styles outside of the store.

text:How is sezane quality for you? Do they hold up?   I love the aesthetic, but both times I tried ordering from them, I was so disappointed with the feel of the fabric and thought I wouldn’t want to pay more than Madewell prices for the quality.	labels:It really depends what you get. My Sezane silk pieces are high quality for the price, especially during the archives sale. My 100% merino wool sweater is also super soft, warm, and pretty—as soft as cashmere but warmer and without all the pilling. I don't like the jeans and would avoid the viscose and polyester pieces. The shoes are overpriced; I have a few pairs that I got secondhand but I won't be buying any more. I have some good Sezane dresses too but they aren't as consistently good as the blouses. One thing I quite like about Sezane is that returns are free and easy, even during Archives sale. The customer service has been good in my experience too—if there are issues with your order, you usually get credit notes or free gifts.  The best quality pieces have just really thoughtful details—beautifully designed patterns, nice buttons, buttons up the back (so no gaping in front!), viscose (as opposed to polyester) linings, laces made out of cotton so they sit well and aren't itchy. It you like a tailored fit or have a very curvy body type the fit may not be idea. But I kind of like that tops are boxy/oversized because they fit my larger bust and shoulders, and I can just tuck them in for my preferred silhouette.  It's hard to describe how the pieces have held up over time because they are typically things I wear to work, and I haven't been to work in almost a year. I had one viscose dress that shrank, so I swore off the viscose! My silk shirts have done great with just hand washing. I have a wool coat that I got secondhand that has gotten very pilly, but I think that's just the fabric. I have had it for years, and there are no tears in the lining or loose buttons or misshapenness (issues I have had with many winter coats before). The linen is a little on the rougher side, but my linen pieces have kept their shape and the color didn't bleed with hand washing. I also have a secondhand pink cotton blouse that I put through the washing machine all the time and it still looks great.	episode_done:True
text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:This comes up here a lot, but many of the outdoors brands have turned into mostly fashion brands, and the quality has dropped as a result.

You can get very good deals on vintage on poshmark, and it's a lot easier to find mid and plus sizes than vintage shops. Just include "vintage" in your search terms and look at product measurements. I thought I would never be able to find vintage jeans my size, until I realized that my modern size 12 is a 16/18 in 1980s vintage. Then I was able to find lots of denim.  When I go on road trips, I like to go to thrift stores in odd little places—they tend to be less picked over for the things I look for. You can also find good stuff at lower end vintage stores and vintage by the pound. There is a cute antique store that opened up near me with a vintage clothing room, and I got one of my favorite skirts there for about $25. It's a corduroy midi skirt from some western wear brand, probably late 1980s-early 1990s. Thredup doesn't really do vintage, but if you search brands you like regularly, you can get super good deals on nice brands. I got a basically new Ulla Johnson dress for $60. I am also in a few facebook groups for brands that I like for new resale.

Yes, That's how well they have been lasting. I doubt that the current ones would hold up that well.  Anthropologie pants also always end up with holes and stretched out. The tops always feel very cheap to me when I look at them in the store. Even buying on sale is becoming not worth it.  I have tried Sezane recently and am very pleasantly surprised at the quality from the feel of it. It remains to be seen how well the pieces hold up.

When buying new, I try to wait for sales and avoid buying anything "final sale" or with complicated returns unless I know it will work. Clothes that I used to get at Anthropologie, I now get from Sezane, Ulla Johnson, Doen, and Samantha Pleet. I started buying vintage jeans over Madewell/Levi's or expensive craft brands—my 1980s Chic and Gitano jeans were probably sold at K-Mart/Target but are better quality than anything I have gotten from Madewell. I don't wear jeans/denim enough to justify craft denim prices. Patagonia is still very high quality technical wear; I just scope out the Tyler sport outlet and secondhand for deals. Shoes are hard because I don't like to get them secondhand. I switched from Adidas to Veja and Diemme for sneakers (you can find Diemme shoes for huge markdowns on Yoox during the winter and summer sales—I don't think they are worth retail price).

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:kind of all of them? It seems like you have to pay pretty steep prices now to get the quality of clothes that mid-price mall brands had in the 1990s and early 2000s. It seems that most stores have switched to a model of selling poor quality pieces at huge markups with the expectation that they will sell most of the stock at clearance prices. The GAP used to have quality staples, and J Crew was "fancy." Now GAP is really the same quality as Old Navy, and don't know what J Crew is anymore. The quality has certainly dropped, but I also don't get what is up with the designs since you can't even get a reasonable women's suit there these days. Madewell is not made well. Anthropologie used to sell unique pieces with really good construction, now it's roughly the same as other fast fashion, though I do appreciate that they added petite and plus sizing and carry some high end brands too.

text:How are the Veja trainies? I keep eyeing those up	labels:I have the V-lock sneakers. I bought my first pair \~2 years ago and replaced them with a newer pair this summer. The only ones were in wearable condition, they just were very worn and dirty looking because the shoes are white and stuff gets into the velcro. I wear those as a backup now. Vejas are not the most comfortable sneakers ever—they take a while to break in and aren't made for running/sports. But once you replace the insole and break them in, the leather softens up and they really do last. The seams of the sneakers got dirty, but the white leather itself did not scuff or stain despite heavy use. The soles are very thick and only seem to have minor wear after a year of very frequent wear—usually I will destroy sneaker soles within a few months. Veja leather sneakers are great for walking around cities and just throwing on as casual shoes. They also seem pretty weather resistant and are comfortable in most weather. I definitely recommend them as long as you are prepared for them to be uncomfortable at first! And definitely replace the insole.

text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:I used to work in a funeral home and can tell you that I've seen it all. There will always be the guy that shows up in jeans and a barely nice t shirt, for some reason. There will always be a woman who shows up wearing a skin tight tiny club dress that barely covers her bum, but I guess she thought it was okay because it was black and also a dress? I've seen people wear sheer black clothing like somehow that's supposed to be a shirt. I've also been to funerals with wacky dress codes: everyone wears Hawaiian shirts or the everyone wears a chosen colour associated with the deceased.   But good rules to stick by: Wear clothes that are darker in colour; black, navy, dark green/purple. White dress shirts are appropriate, but having a jacket to go over it is ideal. If it's the summer and it's hot; boys, skip the jacket, but wear a tie and tuck in the shirt and girls, wear a flowy dress, ideally to the knee, with a light shawl or dress pants and a light blouse.   The purpose of the funeral is to pay respect to the deceased, and you want to keep the focus there. Wearing something too bright, or tight, or short, or casual can distract from what's going on and the importance of the funeral. The goal is essentially to blend in, not stand out, because the funeral isn't about anyone other than the deceased, so the attention goes to them. It's one of the few times that I believe everyone should put aside their own ego and allow the day to be about the deceased.	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:It’s depended on the person. In general it’s been “smart casual”, with women in mostly black dresses or black blouse and pants/skirt, and men in a button up (with or without tie) and black pants/jeans.   The last funeral I went to was for my partner’s grandfather; he was a big bold man who liked bright bold shirts and hated black. We wore the loudest shirts we could get our hands on, most were made by my MIL. True they were still button ups but they definitely shunned the traditional funeral wear.
text:That’s so cool. I love when funerals and memorial services have a distinctive dress code that honors the person being mourned.	labels:So do I, it was definitely the cheeriest looking funeral procession I’ve ever seen and we were all commenting on how much he’d have loved it. And honestly, we all felt almost *happy*, like we were celebrating his life rather than mourning his death. There were a lot of tears, but there were a lot of laughs and smiles. It’s hard to be glum when you’re in a bright yellow shirt, two sizes to big, with cacti printed all over it! It really was a beautiful way to remember him and send him off.	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:In my experience it varies greatly on the family of the deceased and what they want. Most funerals I’ve been to have specifically stated a dress code required. Most of my wife’s family generally has a “dress like you’re going to a party” kinda vibe.  I usually split the difference if I’m unsure and just wear a grey suit 🤷‍♀️	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:I think that if they are a NICE pair of BLACK jeans paired with a very nice shirt, it’s acceptable. But looking like you are going to a mall is just poor taste and a little insulting.   I had a friend who wore bright red skinny jeans, a brown “Domo” tshirt and black converse to a friends mom wedding. We all dressed up and she could have too. I’ll forever shudder at the thought of someone dressing like that for my wedding one day	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:I went to a funeral after a death in the family and everyone tried their best to dress formal. We didn’t say anything about a dress code. It was just understood that this was a special and serious occasion. A few relatives flew in at the last minute and couldn’t bring much so they wore dress slacks and a collared shirt. One of my cousins needed to borrow formal clothing from another family member which just goes to show how much we all wanted to dress right for the occasion. It wasn’t all black but everyone tried to wear darker colors. The service was at the funeral home where our relative was to be cremated.	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:It depends on the crowd, but at the last 3 funerals I went to, I wore a simple black sheath dress, black hose, and black flats, with one piece of jewelry.   I did see people mostly in what I would call "Sunday Best" and this ranged from skirts + heels to nice pants and a simple knit top. However these were all funerals for people who lived in a super small town their whole lives and were farmers most of their lives, so YMMV!	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:I’ve been unfortunate enough to have been to two funerals in the past few years, and the idea of wearing all black to a funeral doesn’t really seem to be a thing in Australia. I wore all black both times because I thought that was what you were supposed to wear but lots of people wore casual clothing. I’m talking singlet (tank top), shorts and thongs (flip flops). I was very taken aback that people would wear that to a funeral but I guess them being there is the most important thing.
text:Im in aus and the last funeral I went too (for an elderly aunt) there were a group of early 20 year old women in melb cup crossed with club wear. They were cousins of cousins type thing.  I'm talking like orange neon body con mini mini dresses with the fake tan, huge fascinators, glittery platform stilettos. When they walked in they seemed to realise it was not appropriate and spent a lot of the church service trying to yank their dresses over their bums and looking awkward.   At my wedding my brother rocked up with holey jeans, a flanno and a bouquet of dead roses he got from the servo for free.   I'm from syd so maybe that's it because people from melb really out do us in the fashion stakes.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:generally quite formal although in my family we don't tend to do black.

text:For the parents of girls	labels:As a daughter. My mom and I went shopping together. And we figured what would be appropriate for my age that we were both happy with. And then i would dress myself. My mom always says that i came up with some crazy choices. But it is part of your development. You figure out who you are through clothes.
text:Same, My mom would set outfits together in the closet at first but I would always mix and match so she eventually stopped at around 4 years old. As long as I had clothes on my body appropriate for the weather she let me do what I wanted (even from before I could actually put on the clothes on my own). Some days I would literally put on a clown wig with my clothes and my mom let me roll with it. I’m 24 now but we did a lot of shopping limited too and thrifting at the goodwill &salvation army. My sister and I were the same size in everything until after we graduated high school so we always shared a single wardrobe. I could pick out what I wanted (within reason) even from a really early age.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:For the parents of girls	labels:My mom and dad bought all my clothes until I got a job and started buying all my own stuff. My mom dressed me until I was about 9 or 10 and then I started picking my own outfits. My mom and I have very similar body types, but somehow my dad was, and still is, better at finding things that fit me nicely. My mom never really pushed her personal style on me and my sister, even though she bought and picked out 99% of our clothes growing up because it’s just hard to find little girls clothes that are the same style as women’s. My dad just liked to go in stores on a whim and ask employees what was in style at the moment, so he picked out some pretty good things.
text:I love that your dad was so involved!	labels:He still is! Even though my sister and I are 17 and 19 and have jobs, he still buys us things he finds on eBay for cheap when he’s bored at work. My sister and I love fashion now so we talk about it a lot and he has picked up on our favorite brands, the ones he remembers best are Free People and Zara.

My parents were super controlling over what I wore, and I hated it.   So for her, we try our best to compromise. Like, you have to get dressed for school. Even if you are more comfortable in sweats than you are in PJs, we can compromise with athletic wear, but they have to be clean and fit correctly.   Now, in high school, she’s gone more towards skater/alt kid, which means she steals my clothes and shoes.	episode_done:True
text:For the parents of girls	labels:I have three kids, one girl, one boy and one trans-boy (13, 10, 15) who still dresses fairly feminine. My kids have always been allowed to pick their own clothes and style them how they want. Sometimes I give them advice on their fashion choices which they are free to ignore. They love my style and frequently steal stuff from my closet.  We don't have a lot of body type discussions in regards to clothes, because I don't want that to be their focus. I want them to focus on creativity and enjoyment of their clothes. Plus for my trans kid, their hourglass figure is a stressor for them. If they are struggling to style something, I help them out.	episode_done:True
text:For the parents of girls	labels:My daughter dresses herself, and chooses her own clothing. She is a whole and intact separate human being from me and has autonomy and her own sense of style.

I just had to keep receipts, and subtract the cost when we got home. Besides cutting down on “you don’t really need this” arguments, I actually ended up learning some useful lessons from the process—in order to set my budget for the year, it was my job to figure out what I needed and lay out a proposal, which was negotiating practice (my sister and I competed to see who could get a bigger one approved!), and we had to use Excel to log everything. I might’ve whined a bit about the process in the moment, but now I see that it was a neat strategy, and I’m grateful for it.

Found so much good stuff that way.)      I'm very much going to let her develop her own style and experiment from as early as she wants.  As long as she is weather appropriate, I plan on taking a supportive, hands off approach once she actually shows interest.    She has definite fit preferences now though (when I do dress her, leggings are a must - no jeans or wide legged pants).  She also hates long sleeves.	episode_done:True

If it is not weather appropriate, I make her adjust (like a long sleeve shirt under a tank dress). She rarely matches but I think it builds independence, confidence, and creativity. She hates it when I ask her to wear something specific (like for a holiday) so I just try to buy special outfits we will both love. I let her pick out some of what I buy for her (give her some options to pick from). We shop mostly online so it’s easy for me to have some control over what she can choose.   The 20 month old pretty much wears hand me downs lol and I mostly pick what she wears but she’s starting to prefer to select herself (she’ll tell me “pick dress” in the morning to tell me she wants to choose a dress). I will let her pick her clothes more and more as she becomes more independent.   I imagine over time my girls will start to put together more and more fashionable outfits as they become more aware of style and what their peers are wearing. I will always let them choose for themselves and only intervene when what they want to wear is truly inappropriate for some reason. And even then I will continue to give them options for alternatives and let them choose. It’s their body after all!	episode_done:True

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom didn’t care about fashion until she started watching What Not to Wear on tlc. Then she threw out all her embroidered sweatshirts and appliqué jeans and got some more stylish clothes. She maintained this for a few years and now that she’s in her late 60s, she wears what makes her happy- embroidered sweatshirts and appliqué jeans.   I don’t wish she taught me anything but I think if she kept a pulse on trends it would’ve saved me from some teasing in middle school. But, on the flip side, is it fun to fit in? Middle school sucks regardless.
text:What Not to Wear was a big help for me. It helped me see how things should fit together and flatter the figure you have.  My mother has serious issues and we never talked. She was very authoritarian and would not allow me to wear makeup at all through high school or wear anything other than baggy clothes. My sister showed some fashion sense and ended up mercilessly mocked and told how vain and shallow she was.  It would have been nice to have some kind of guidance, but that's not the person she was.	labels:I grew up with a mom with mental health issues. She still won't let anyone cut her hair, won't wear makeup and refuses to spend money on clothes, even if I've offered to pay for it. She made comments like, "Isn't my daughter pretty? She doesn't look anything like me." And she made me feel bad for taking care of myself. I think she wanted to be seen as attractive, but her mental illness won't allow her to admit that.I realized it was a set back pretty young. I even paid for "modeling classes" when I was 15 with the money I made working at a pizza place. I feel really lucky to have had shows like that and internet access to learn skills I didn't get from her.	episode_done:True

text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:Oof, I definitely know those thoughts. I'm sorry your brain is being a jerk right now. <3  Something I've had some success with (and YMMV) is to constantly remind myself that "Clothes are supposed to fit ME, I'm under no obligation to fit THEM." If a pair of pants doesn't fit me comfortably, then the problem is with the pants, not my body. Items of clothing are inanimate objects and I owe them nothing. It's far from a perfect system and I don't always succeed, but it does help sometimes.  On a more practical front, have you considered using a tailor? From the problems you describe it sounds like you've got more of a waist-to-hip/leg difference than most brands allow for, and if that's the case, it's actually something that a tailor can fix pretty easily (and often relatively cheaply.) You would just buy pants that fit your legs comfortably and get the waist taken in. Fair warning, though: once you've worn clothes that actually fit you the way they're supposed to you'll never be satisfied with ill-fitting pieces again.	episode_done:True

text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:I don't think there's anything wrong with preferring dresses and leggings and it doesn't inherently signify that you are somehow unworthy for pants or "letting yourself go".   The thing is, historically speaking, dresses were actually far more practical for a woman's body due the cyclical changes we all experience, from menstrual bloating/cramping, to minor weight fluctuations, to pregnancy and breastfeeding (historically there wasn't much choice about the last two but obviously now there is), cuz you could cinch up or let out your dress depending on how you were doing.   It's only now that stretchy fabric is truly mainstream that pants have truly become as practical and cost effective in that they can tolerate a lot more cyclical size changes, which are *normal*.  Edit: not to mention all the times people would gain and lose weight due to the availability of food.   I'd say I have a pretty confident mindset and 90% of my non work wardrobe is dresses and skirts/shirt combos. I wear undersummers in the spring and summer, leggings and sweater tights in the winter and I've gotten SO MUCH MORE USE out of my dresses... They lasted me up until my 8th month of pregnancy, I barely had to buy maternity clothes.  I have been able to wear the same knit dress/leggings combo at 180lbs prepregnancy and later at 210 lbs post partum and still look cute.  What pair of pants could pull that off? Almost none, I tell you.  Saved me a lot of $$$.   No matter what I weigh, I always have a bit of a belly, so most pants dig into that anyways, which isn't comfortable. Only truly high waisted stuff feels ok, but I don't want to wear that in the summer.   It sounds like disordered thinking is creeping up on you, and you may have to consciously remind yourself that there's nothing wrong with enjoying comfy clothes that don't restrict your abdomen.

text:I cannot thank you enough for this! I’m a huge history buff,and I’m really interested in fashion and costumes, so the whole historical explanation really resonated with me.  I hope I’m paraphrasing correctly, but I really like what you said about separating your preferences from body image,because ironicly, my fellow adhd-friends who have the same anti-pants sentiments as me are all pretty petite and thin. Also on another ironic note, I definitely have been the fittest i’ve ever been when I’ve let myself wear what I want and feel best in, it’s hard to have the motivation to work out and eat for your body when you are so dang uncomfortable!

I had enough jackets (am currently rocking my mom's old leather jacket, a patagonia puff, and a mountain hardware insulated ski jacket depending on the day).   The big things I did add were 8 new tops (5 good, thick sweaters, 2 waffle long sleeves, and a hooded long sleeve). Everything I get was from REI or L.L.Bean. One sweater and one waffle shirt is an REI Co-op (their in house brand), an L. L. Bean, Icebreaker,  Patagonia, and Prana sweater, the other waffle was North Face, and the hooded long sleeve was Smartwool. I love them all and have gotten rid of almost all my other tops. They are so comfortable and can be worn in many ways.  My other big addition was Kamik Sienna mid duck boots in a coffee ish color. I am in LOVE with them. They look super cute with jeans and leggings and are well put together. I have worn them almost everyday in slush, snow, rain and my feet have never been cold. I can not recommend them enough.

When I put the hood up on a windy day I can’t adjust it so it just gets blown back down.  Artix snow pants- warm and can take a beating, very durable.

Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:I am very sensitive to temperature changes so I suffer when I wear layers. Every time I come indoors, I need to strip off everything except a t shirt but I’ll be shivering my butt off the second I go out. Best solution was to get a thick and heavy parka. I have the Moose Knuckles Beaver jacket (discontinued now). It’s so warm that I can wear only a bra under it and still leave it half zipped in -25C.   I’ve been wearing it for 5 years now and the only signs of wear are on the slightly yellowed fur that used to be white, and the stretchy cuff where some threads are coming loose. The only reason this even happened is because I wrap my whole hand in it while writing on paper, so there’s more friction on them than with exclusively winter use. I’ve even gone skiing and snowboarding with it when the slopes were icy and had absolutely no issue. I was learning too, so I spent more time on the ground than upright. It’s been beaten up quite a bit but i can honestly say that it’s still in at least 8/10 condition. The fur is also great since it doesn’t get ruined at all. I’ve been rained on too many times to count in this coat but you just gotta dry it and it’s good to go.   Compared to my aritzia coat, I’d say that it’s not even half as warm as my moose. It also doesn’t last anywhere as long and I ripped through the shell after a slip on ice. I think it lasted me 3 years, but the fur on it was ugly at the start of the second winter season so it required a lot of upkeep it keep it looking in better shape.	episode_done:True

text:How does everyone here dress when bloated?	labels:I avoid pants for that reason. I have a lot of loose (either straight or slight A line) or empire waist dresses.  In winter, they get paired with tights/leggings (highly recommend either Hue wide waistband or Uniqlo extra warm HeatTech) and a sweater on top.   I also have a bunch of roll waist skirts and leggings from when that was a thing. If you can find them, they’re super comfortable.	episode_done:True

text:How does everyone here dress when bloated?	labels:A loose dress if it's warm enough. If you don't want to go with all baggy clothing, I'd recommend a comfortable pair of leggings and a loose sweatshirt that a bit longer. Then if you want to could dress it up with some accessories and cute shoes. If your normal clothes still fit you comfortably could put on a bold accessory to possibly distract from the area you feel insecure about.	episode_done:True

text:Brilliant hijack, now we're all stuffed with cheese and need larger wardrobes!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:Anuschka Rees does a great job of explaining how to merge styles in one wardrobe:  “If you think about it, a style is nothing but a set of individual elements. To merge two different aesthetics, you need to break them up into their elements, carefully select exactly which of these you want to incorporate into your own style concept, and then figure out how to turn them into actual outfits.   *As a first step, you need to ask yourself which exact elements—colors, shapes, textures, specific pieces, details, and so on—of those two styles you want to be a part of your own unique look.* By doing this, you are reducing those big, restrictive top-level concepts into a simple set of tangible elements that are much easier to work with.”  For my wardrobe last year I wanted to add some typical cottage+cowboy style pieces, since I live on a farm now and it felt kind of fun. Using her method I broke down what I liked about the cottage/farm style into this: - patterns and colours: plaid, paisley, traditional embroidery, light colours, plant/animals print, fringe - materials: cotton, leather, suede, denim - items: flowy dresses + tops, cowboy boots, sandals   Using all of that I added the following items over the last year ish: - white embroidered denim jacket - black denim jacket with plaid lining - cowboy boots - flowy embroidered blouse - flowy paisley dress - embroidered jeans - fringe skirt  I usually have a tougher/punker look, so i can wear eg my plaid sundress with sandals + embroidered jacket for a countrier look, or I can wear it with my combat boots. I can wear my embroidered jeans with my embroidered blouse for a cottage look, or I can wear it with a colourblock sweater and ankle boots for a day in the city. It added a bit of feminine with the flowiness but also more of the masculine that I usually gravitate towards. Still really versatile!
text:Wow this is very good advice. I never thought of it this way. Thank youuu	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:Figure out what your signature thing is. It is fine to pull from a myriad of influences, and evolve over time.   I have found that over the years I have incorporated other things but I have some unofficial style signatures:  * probably something colorful or patterned * I love pointy flats * I like to add one casual thing to a nicer outfit and vice versa * I mostly wear skirts and dresses * I have a few outfit templates: dress plus cardigan or jacket, slimmer pant/looser top, longer skirt/shorter top or tucked (this is a new one) * bigger earrings in mostly metal and geometric shapes (I do not really do colorful jewelry) * I love sneakers with skirts and dresses (since I was a preteen)  After that most stuff is fair game. Most outfits follow one of my templates and incorporate my rules. Over time you’ll find your rules too.
text:Thank you so much! I also like to add casual items to dressier outfits and vice versa. I'll try and find some signature items	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:I think it can be huge to just have a consistent color scheme, even if you wear different styles, if you do it all in similar colors then it will always look cohesive. It will allow you to combine more style-specific items together, like combining something vintage with something more modern, or something more edgy/rocker with something more frilly/soft.	episode_done:True
text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:I've spent so much of quarantine trying to find my personal style! Here's what worked for me:  I got all the clothes I regularly, reliably wear, and I laid them out on my bed. Then, I wrote down some observations about them. The materials, the colors, the styles, the patterns...anything that seemed noteworthy. I realized I had three different color palettes going on, so I grouped them accordingly. After assessing everything, I tried to come up with a few adjectives to describe what I was looking at in front of me, and those adjectives became how I describe my personal style. In other words, rather than gravitating toward an aesthetic and trying to make my wardrobe fit into it, I just looked and described what my style, in practice, as it already exists, is.   And ever since I loosely nailed it down, now I make sure that any new clothes I purchase relatively fit those descriptors too. So everything I own is pretty stylistically compatible. :)	episode_done:True
text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:Personally I’m still somewhat new too this but I’ve had many different fashion phases and have done many different looks throughout my three years of personal fashion experimentation. I feel the biggest thing that’s helped me is sticking to a sort of color scheme.    It’s definitely not for everyone necessarily but it’s helped a lot as I have grown my wardrobe, slowly adding more colors. It makes things very easy to match. I started with three colors ( I know that’s extremely little however) now I’m up to six!  I feel accessories ( not just jewelry necessarily but belts, hats , bags etc. ) are also very important to obtaining a certain look.   I feel organizing ones closet can also really help. There’s no specific way I’d necessarily recommend I organize mine by grouping items article then group them by color , as I mentioned color and matching things is very important to my personal style so that’s what makes sense for me.   Hope this could help some! I’m new at this too as I mentioned lol!
text:Thank you! ❤️	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:Who I am is not defined by my outfits. If I have very different styles on different days it really doesn't matter. There are days when I leave the house wearing a corset, hoop skirt and three layers of petticoats. There are days when I leave the house in jeans and a t-shirt. I am still the exact same person.  A fashion style cannot tell you who you are. You have to know who you are first.   As far as the practicalities of merging different aesthetics, my approach is that I have a spectrum of  "looking like an escapee from a medieval vampire brothel" to "average 2020s adult woman". I mix things up between those based on how much attention I want to draw and what I need to do for the day. It's okay if things are perfectly cohesive. Nobody cares that much about a slightly gothy accessory on an otherwise unremarkable outfit unless I draw from way on the goth end of the spectrum. I get away with wearing medieval kirtles on public and no one cares. I get away with wearing medieval kirtles and modern boots and hats and no one cares. I also get away with wearing cauls and suits. No one cares.  People don't actually pay that much attention to other people's clothes. Which means that you can get away with a lot and no one will notice. Clashing really isn't as big of a problem as people think it ism
text:I don't care how people see me, i want to feel good with what I'm wearing and i want it to be cohesive, but that's just my personal preference. I know people don't notice fashion inconsistencies because I don't and i also don't care much for what other people wear, i want everyonre to express themselves however they see fit. Of course, who i am is not defined by my outfits either but it is an expression of what i like and i have a hard time transforming that into the outside.

Buy what you like, wear it were you are feel safe. You might start by just wearing it around your room. Taking selfies and such. Get a feel for how you wear the clothes for yourself. Eventually start pushing your boundaries a little. Be paciente with yourself  This will get easier as you get older, think of your age as an advantage for your adventure not a hindrance. Do the same thing with your body. When I was your age, I was self-conscious of my big butt and thighs. Now they are in style.  You are enough as is

That said, you can pull off any look you want to if you do the work! I actually find the egirl style pretty cute and I don’t think there is anything about being a fat WOC where the style wouldn’t be cute on you!  As for your family, this grinds my gears so much!!!! I’m old enough to be your mother and it makes me so sad when adults crush the creative expression of their children. You don’t have to ever fit in the box they want you to. As long as it makes you happy and you aren’t hurting anyone else, it’s your life to live and they are just clothes. If you can muster the courage to do it, have an open conversation about how your family makes you feel when they trash the style you like. Tell them it hurts and makes you struggle with self confidence in a world that already does that to fat WOC every day. I think if they get that it hurts you, they’ll stop being unsupportive.  Keep your chin up! It’s gets easier to give less of an EF what others think about you as you get older, I promise!	episode_done:True
text:I want to be that bada*** biCTH (Ik it's spelt wrong, it's meme bro lol sry.

You being a woc does not make you less badass, I am not a woc but you ladies are literally stunning as hell and your skin tone doesn't prevent you from being the baddest bitch in your block. So what if you're not a skinny white girl, it's not like a certain skin tone or weight determines whether you can be an egirl or not. You are capable to be the baddest egirl being woc and not beansprouty. I'm not sure what to tell you about your family, but I know a girl who would always put on something baggy over something revealing at home and before she left for school, then take it off. That could possibly be an option for when you get to go outside, or just dress like that in your room or something. When I started wearing clothes I thrifted instead of shopping at my small town's h&m or the other 3 fast fashion stores I thought I would get judged, but actually quite the contrary happened and I got compliments on my vintage clothes. I'm not exactly dressing edgy,more very colourful, but at least from people our age, they don't seem to judge edgy clothes. And honestly, when talking about strangers and not family members, I don't think anyone actually judges that hard. Seriously, why care anyway? Other than sorta needing to conform to social norms when looking for a job, like when you need professional pictures for a CV because egirl makeup isn't seen as "professional" or whatever, there's nothing you have to lose. You're not losing friends over glittery makeup and short plaid skirts, if anything, they might rather admire you for your cool new style. And strangers? They're strangers anyway, you won't ever see that mean ass grandma at the grocery store who frowned at your eyeliner ever again, it's not like you dress and do your makeup for her. You'll be a super pretty egirl, you can do that shit
text:Wow thank you for that reply :) that really made me feel better. I guess the stranger thing isn't something to care about honestly, you're right. But it's going to take me a longgg time to reach your level of confidence lol.	labels:I don't really feel very body confident, but honestly what's stopping us other than ourselves from being the baddest bitches, we have all the potential! Honestly I really appreciate other strange people's cool outfits when I see them on the streets. So, wear what you feel comfortable wearing, and if anyone shits on you for your choice of clothing, they don't really deserve your niceness anyway, they're not accepting how you want to express yourself and that is fucking shitty, but if anyone does, then wear whatever you like proudly just to spite their asses, likely they envy your boldness and your style anyway	episode_done:True
text:I want to be that bada*** biCTH (Ik it's spelt wrong, it's meme bro lol sry. Plus idk if we can swear, I don't post) tl;dr at the end cuz I tend to rant :)	labels:I'll start with #2. I started shopping for my own clothes around 16/17 . My family don't really care what clothes I buy with my money as long as my closet wasn't bursting at the seams.  I sometimes get the "are you really going to wear that/buy that" when they see me in something new. I remember buying a pair of wide legged, long jeans, and wearing sports bras as tops. Maybe it's because they saw how happy and comfortable I was in them that they didn't try to put me down for wearing stuff like that. What I buy is with my own money anyways, which does give me more confidence in some ways and probably helps them accept it too.  I know you mentioned ripped jeans -- I know some ripped jeans can cost, like, $150-$300 a pair. My advice would be to buy it with your own income (if that's possible, I know you aren't even 18/21 yet) and purchase things that you want to wear AND feel confident in wearing. It really sucks to spend money on items that sit around collecting dust.  My story with #3 is that people around me are either 1. creative energy or 2. dress with a similar vibe to me. I try to play a game -- if I'm going out in something "basic"/very messy, it's to blend in and likely not to talk to anyone that day. If I'm going out in something I love wearing, it's because I love it and I want to share it with the world. So I welcome the stares (and the questions). I try to match what I'm wearing to a purpose or mindset for that day. I value my own productivity more than how I'm being judged for something so shallow: my outfit. So my advice would be to find a purpose for what you're wearing, a purpose that is strong and way more important than how others might judge your outfit.  Honestly, I found that finding and building my style (which is really just a collection of stuff I will wear often) was a combination of having some financial independence and buying pieces that I loved to wear. Best of luck to you!	episode_done:True

Plus idk if we can swear, I don't post) tl;dr at the end cuz I tend to rant :)	labels:You've gotten on the wrong train to self confidence. You're becoming a negotiation between different people, rather than your own self. You're totally focused on your appearance and your clothes as a way to get confidence, but that isn't the way. Body image is not related to the way that you look; study after study has shown that even after drastic appearance changes, most peoples' body image stays the same unless they work on it in other ways. Aim for body neutrality, and focus your efforts on things that will actually give you some level of self confidence. Consider reading the book My Body Is Not An Apology and detoxing your social media from "self-improvement" accounts that are only focused on appearance under the guise of "wellness."   What's your 5 year plan to become independent? What are you doing to become involved in your community? What opportunities have you not considered for your future - from teaching English abroad, to artist residencies, to trade school, to university, and beyond? Whose advice have you sought out? What have you read, and who have you contacted? What inspiring WOC outside the entertainment industry, who are NOT self-help "gurus" or "wellness "inspo", do you follow on your social media? The only thing you have to do now is become who you are. Concentrate on figuring out your values, your hopes, your dreams, etc, in isolation of what other people think. This is hard to do, but it's possible.  Dress however you want. The most common outcome of a teenage girl going on a diet of any kind is that she becomes obese; studies have shown that when compared to overweight teenage girls not put on diets, overweight teenage girls put on diets are much more likely to become obese. Set up healthy habits for yourself, like going to bed at the same time every night and getting an hour of good exercise that you enjoy - whether that's an hour long walk, or walking and jogging, or yoga, or boxing. Literally whatever.	episode_done:True
text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I have three or four distinct styles. Most of the time I like wearing dark, edgy punk-inspired clothes. However, I’m a style chameleon. If I need to be professional, I have a whole separate wardrobe of high-quality suiting. Take out my piercings, and I’ll have anyone fooled that that’s the realest me. In the summer and family gatherings I often wear more earthy boho and beachy surfer looks. Fashion is a great tool for self-expression, matching the mood, and setting the mood.
text:I'm convinced that there's something deeper than just boho styled, edgy, punk, professional styled etc. that we find ourselves liking, that creates our style.   Like music. There's something deeper than simply genre that makes me like a song. It's not genres that define my music taste.

In the summer and family gatherings I often wear more earthy boho and beachy surfer looks. Fashion is a great tool for self-expression, matching the mood, and setting the mood.
text:I'm convinced that there's something deeper than just boho styled, edgy, punk, professional styled etc. that we find ourselves liking, that creates our style.   Like music. There's something deeper than simply genre that makes me like a song. It's not genres that define my music taste. It's a combination of all my songs I like that creates my taste.	labels:My favorite songs blend two distinct genres together, like metal and synthwave (with a sprinkle of rap?!). And my style I can't have distinct very well, never straight up punk, never fully professional (I firmly believe I am a professional because I work professionally - they can take my badass spreadsheets and perfect grammar, but they will also get my dyed and shaved hair and eclectic clothing). I have to blend them because there's so much I want to express! Yes, I am punk/emo, glam, neon, normcore all at once. I was probably inspired by my early childhood fascination with Queen, and then Danger Days as an adult. Eclectic doesn't even begin to cover it!	episode_done:True
text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:A variety of looks can be a signature style. Idk why this sub makes people feel like fashion has to be this simplistic one aesthetic thing. It's supposed to be fun. Moving art. You only get a certain number of years on this earth, if having multiple styles makes you happy, DO IT. Stop overthinking your happiness	episode_done:True

text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I unrepentantly have four distinct styles: renfest/earthy boho chic (linens, lace, fancy sleeves, flowy skirts, harem pants, tunic tops, earthy tones, etc.), grandma incarnate (chunky knitted sweaters and dowdy but comfortable and sensible), cryptid/alien/paranormal theme (mostly tees/long sleeve tees with The Theme, bold bright colors and graphics), and artsy college girl (leggings and oversized shirts/sweatshirts, sometimes funky). There is no way to marry most of these styles and in fact they clash horribly but some days I feel like my Mothman tee and some days I feel like a forest fairy, and I will not be denied these benign little pleasures that make me smile.	episode_done:True
text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I guess I would say I do, because I don't "use looks/trends" I use shapes and colours that suit me and that fit parts of me i'd like to express.  And that does create a signature "look" without trying too hard because well.. I can't change my shape, and the colours that suit me are very defined within a colour palette.  I'm almost always wearing something stretchy that accommodates my body gently, and I like deep colours, soft colours and neutrals. I can have different elements (such as a romantic element, or a classy element) but the underlying fundamentals of "me" is there.  The problem with having different looks is that less pieces go together and some aesthetics don't really suit people as well as other looks might because the "structure" of the piece clashes with the person. I'm thinking of someone who might like sleek aesthetic inspired by 6 foot tall people, when they are more small and rounded, and it may be better to keep to their lines and add "touches of sleekness". Keep the air of sleekness but twist it in a way that suits them.. in other words, not "copy the aesthetic".	episode_done:True
text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I personally swing wildly between an academic honors student, vaguely retro, more gender-neutral street style, and then something a little more punk. I just wear whatever I’m feeling like wearing on a given day (or what weather dictates, occasionally), so I don’t consider it strange to have more than one style. I admire the people that can just do one style and be happy, or have a capsule wardrobe, but there’s nothing wrong with enjoying mixing it up.	episode_done:True

Bralettes when they start to smell!
text:Same. I started washing my bras a little more frequently because I noticed the straps discolor after 3-4 wears. I do have two elementary age kids, and I wash their jackets (along with masks) after every time they play outside (double masked) with a couple of friends in their pod. I've ruined a few zippers in the sanitary dry cycle, but it's worth it.	labels:	episode_done:True

So if you have not washed something in a darker color before, absolutely wash it by itself before tossing it in with whites! If the underwear is delicate, a delicates or lingerie bag is a good (reasonably inexpensive) investment, though I’d still be wary of tossing them in with anything denim or generally rough (t-shirts or blouses are fine). When I was living with the rest of my family, we separated out by “hot water” (socks, underwear, etc) and “cold water” (everything else) more than color.	episode_done:True

I've found that washing whites in a mixed load can make them go dull or a bit grey looking. Sometimes I will put one or two light pastels in with them if I need to make up a full load- but only if I know they're colourfast.  I don't separate out all my other colors though. Reds and greens etc just get whammied in with my black jeans	episode_done:True
text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:it depends on the item of clothing? like I do laundry weekly, but I wash things separately. sheets and towels etc are washed with an unscented soap in one load, certain clothes are hand washed and line dried, some clothes are run in a cold cycle, some clothes are worn multiple times before washing. so it varies widely but laundry every 1-2 weeks makes sense for me when I’m only doing my own laundry
text:I'm with you on the unscented detergent bit. They put WAY too much fragrances in them and they all make me gag.  I do a lot of hand washing, too. Many years ago, I ran out of Woolite and had to use shampoo...it works great. It gets hair clean, so it is a cinch to get clothes clean without an offensive amount of fragrance. I all my bras/lingerie tops and pantyhose/tights this way and they turn out pretty nice. I love making my clothes smell like Dove soap. :D	labels:	episode_done:True
text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:Note-- I have to do laundry offsite and pay per load.  I air dry my clothes, but draw the line at hand washing ANYTHING.  Underwear, socks, masks, gym clothes (in normal times), cotton facial pads-- after each use.    Bras-- 2-3 wears depending on how sweaty I get.  Shirts, bottoms, skirts, dresses--- Usually 3-4 times depending on use.  Skirts-- 5-6 times (these don't touch the crotch area so they don't get as dirty as other bottoms).  Outer layers (sweaters, sweatshirts, etc)--- As needed (I always have something under these).  PJs-- 3-4 wears  Sheets-- Every 2 weeks or so  Towels-- Washcloths-- after each use (I use two a day to wash my face), body towel-- after about a week.  Hair towel-- when I remember to (I only use this towel for my hair and wash my hair twice a week).  Hand towels, dish towels, etc-- as needed.  Other bedding-- (blankets, comforters, etc)--- twice a year (Spring and fall).	episode_done:True

text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:It depends on the item. Underwear, socks, and face masks get washed after every wear. Jeans get washed about 3 times a year. Wool gets washed once it starts to smell funky. If I don’t really sweat, shirts and blouses get washed every 2-4 wears. So I do a load of laundry whenever I have enough things dirty to do at least half a load. This is usually every 2 weeks for me.	episode_done:True
text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:Between my dog and Covid-19, I do laundry pretty often. Anything worn outside at the dog park gets muddy and washed after one wear.

Pyjamas are worn twice before getting laundered.	episode_done:True

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I moved from the Midwest to Atlanta. If it’s a similar climate dont get rid of all your winter clothes! I got rid of so much thinking it would be warm year round but it still gets really cold about 3 months out of the year. I kept one good winter coat as well. Also because you get used to the warm weather high fifties/sixties can feel wayyyy colder than it should
text:it's New Orleans! i'm moving from Maine	labels:That is so exciting! New Orleans could not be more different than Maine, but I hope you love it. I move from Oregon to Texas, and it was a huge adjustment, but now I really like it here.  Like the other commenter said, keep a coat and a few sweaters. When it’s “cold” here, it actually feels colder to me than when I lived in the North. The summer is pretty brutally hot, so I only wear natural fibers now (polyester makes me very sweaty), and lots of short and dresses. No jeans in the summer at all. You do need something to put on when you go inside because of the A/C, but don’t be like me and think you can still wear sweaters in the summer in the South like I did in Oregon.  Have so much fun! Moving to New Orleans is worth it for the food alone.  Edit: This is not weather-related, but the biggest difference to me between northern and southern dressing is that in the South, women generally look way more polished than in the North. I’ve been in Texas long enough now that when I go to Oregon, I’m always thinking “Why doesn’t anyone take care of themselves up here?” Haha just something to keep in mind...	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I live in Austin where the heat and humidity get prettyyy ridiculous. I pretty much live in skirts and shorts in the summer time. Tops-wise, I'm usually in short sleeves. If I'm daring to wear anything that doesn't show skin, it's loose and flowy!      No matter what clothes I wear, I think fabric makes the most difference. Polyesters and chiffons are the most miserable to wear in the heat and humidity because they're not breathable at all. Cotton and natural fibers all the way.      Hope that helps!

text:it's New Orleans! i'm moving from Maine	labels:Awesome!! I’m not familiar about their winter weather but I assume it’s quite similar that you’ll want to keep sweaters and at least one coat just in case. Something you won’t need that I brought was heavy winter boots! You’ll be happy to say goodbye to those.

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:New Orleans is super humid all summer. Dresses, shorts, and athletic/moisture wicking fabrics will be your best friend.   You’ll be able to get by with one coat that you may never wear. I have pictures of me at Mardi Gras (in February) in short sleeves and jeans, perfectly comfortable.   Light cardigans for going inside are a great idea for southern summers. They have to blast the AC just to control the humidity.   It’s also important to consider what that humidity will do for your hair!

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I used to live in the southwest and wore sundresses almost exclusively.

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I wear a lot of dresses, skirts, and wide-leg flowy pants during the summer. I almost never wear shorts because I've always hated them. Breathable fabrics are important especially with humidity; you'll be a lot hotter in polyester than in cotton. Also thigh chafing is a thing, so I like to alternate between days I wear a skirt and days I wear loose pants.   I do tend to carry a lightweight top layer for air conditioned buildings. But it doesn't need to be something super warm; mesh or a loose weave is fine. I tend to like that layer to be something that won't wrinkle so I can toss it in my purse.	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:As someone who moved from Boston to Houston - leave your LL Bean behind.  You don't have to spend a fortune on new clothes (target is fine).  Women do not tend to wear khakis down here.  Loose linen pants would probably feel good though.  Colors will be brighter, bring sunglasses.  New Orleans will be a swamp most of the year, so whatever you would pack for a beach vacation.  You don't need snow anything (shoes, coat), maybe a light jacket for the colder months.  I didn't use my wool coat for a couple years, it wasn't cold enough.  You could probably get away with a wool sweater and layers under if it dips to the 30s and you're still acclimated to cold weather.  Yes to a light cotton or linen cardigan for the AC.  Do not underestimate the heat and humidity.	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:Having a heavier coat on hand isn’t a bad idea, especially if it’s already available - but for context I grew up in Austin, TX and the *only* winter coat I ever had I purchased specifically for a vacation. There’s an odd day every couple of years where you might want to use it... but for the most part people just stay inside and the weather warms up.  Things like a lighter fleece will take care of you pretty well on the coldest typical winter days.   A big thing I would recommend is a lot of light layers that are easily removed - cardigans, button ups, jean jackets, whatever. They served me well year round, even on the hottest days. I’m not sure specifically about New Orleans, but it’s pretty common to run the air conditioning really intensely in that part of the country (I swear my high school was kept at 50 degrees year round) and being able to cover my arms indoors was important to my comfort. Basically just something that’s light and easy to store away when you’re in the heat.	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I also live in Louisiana. You definitely want to have a pair of rain boots or waterproof shoes because of how much it rains in the spring and summer evenings. I have a pair of cute Chelsea boot style rain boots that are a lot easier to style. Also, get a pair of good quality sandals that are comfortable, I prefer Birkenstock’s.   I strictly wear shorts or mini skirts in the spring, summer, and most of fall, then jeans or leggings/joggers in the winter. I have denim shorts, chino shorts, and some cute dressy shorts, depending on the occasion.   I don’t really like dresses because it’s hard to find summer dresses that aren’t sleeveless, and I just prefer to have some kind of sleeve.   I personally would get too hot wearing a sweater in the spring/summer, and I am very cold natured, but I keep a lightweight jacket in my car in case I go somewhere and the AC is really cold. I am not really big on tank tops, so I just wear a lot of short sleeve tops. I don’t even rotate my tops because I will usually just wear the short sleeved ones under a jacket in the winter, and I only have like 3 sweaters anyway.   Also not big on hats, personally, and the only time I see other people wearing them are for photo shoots or going to the beach. However, I do recommend some nice sunglasses.

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:Lots of good comments already so I'll just say plan for one additional layer in the summer when you work in a professional AC environment. I used to live in sleeveless shirts and dresses in the summer for commuting in my miserably hot car and the walk to and from the building, during lunch, after work.  Then I'd throw on a blazer or a cardigan once inside.	episode_done:True
text:Using Pinterest to Help Find Your Style (or: how to tell Pinterest it is no longer 2012)	labels:I also think something that really helps me is when I find something I like, I scroll down to look at the “similar items”. The algorithm often does a really good job at finding similar items, and then if you interact with those items it makes your home feed even better.	episode_done:True
text:Using Pinterest to Help Find Your Style (or: how to tell Pinterest it is no longer 2012)	labels:Great tips, I definitely have not been using the "More Ideas" button to its full potential.    I've been trying to pin fashion and style again, and I find I really miss the website Polyvore.  I never used it, but the ease with which other people made outfits and shared them meant that there was always something new to pin.    I follow a few fashion bloggers who seem to be popular, but I sometimes forget the work that goes into doing a blog post, styling things just right, taking the photos, etc.  Not to mention buying the clothes!  With that old Polyvore website, users were pushing out complete outfits everyday.  I hope something like that comes back around again soon, because I found the flat lay design of the pins easy to identify with.  With real people or models, I start to worry about whether something would work with my proportions, what kind of style tips they're using, etc	episode_done:True
text:Using Pinterest to Help Find Your Style (or: how to tell Pinterest it is no longer 2012)	labels:This is really helpful, and detailed. A lot of effort went into this! I am fascinated by how clear and organised your approach is.   I would use pinterest in a different manner more a style "mood board" than practical.      * So I might have events or things I am desiring (like a manifestation board). I desire to perform this year for example, so I have board for dancing style inspiration and a new board for each vision * Then I have a board for my "colours"; I am a Summer (cool season), so I have a board of colours and combinations that inspire me, such as baby blue and creamy white * I have boards with different themes, such as renaissance, vintage, exotic/seductive and in those boards I place pieces or photos that evoke those moods.	episode_done:True
text:Using Pinterest to Help Find Your Style (or: how to tell Pinterest it is no longer 2012)	labels:Thank you for the in depth breakdown! I actually use Pintrest for most of my fashion finding needs and I've been in the habit of reworking my algorithm often. As soon as I start getting recommended a bunch of things I don't like I start unfollowing boards and abusing the hide button like crazy. I also went through and organized all my boards with the new subcategory option to combine a lot of my boards together.   Another note that might help people is if you can't figure out why your still getting recommended out of date pins, go back into your boards that your feed recommends from and delete the older pins that you no longer like. I went back into all my fashion boards and went to the pins I'd pinned when I first got into Pintrest (in like 2012) that were definitely no longer my style. Once those were no longer there to draw from my feed changed pretty dramatically.	episode_done:True

I know virtually nothing about this figure as a person or platform and don’t want to name them as I don’t know how I’d feel about them if I did. But their style? Perfect for my needs, and something I likely wouldn’t have come across otherwise.	episode_done:True

text:Goals and Resolutions Check in: February	labels:My goals are going well! A couple of ours are essentially the same. Good luck, we got this!  1) Wardrobe Overhaul  At the beginning of the year, all I owned was athleisure. I was a very cozy, but very bored, person. So I’m working on filling my wardrobe with clothes that really make me happy, and it’s working! I’m in a fortunate position right now, so I’ve been spending the last stimulus check on ThredUp and Poshmark. I gotta say I am loving online thrifting.  2) Dress for my emotions rather than comfort.  Part of moving away from athleisure. My clothes really influence how I feel, so dressing up to look like a badass bitch makes me feel like a badass bitch. Even on days I work at home, I wear outfits to emotionally prep myself to enjoy being productive. I change into pjs when my work is done for the day, so I actually get to look forward to my comfy clothes rather than feel like it’s just another lazy day in leggings.  3) Focus on fit and proportions.  This one is harder but is making me feel the most ~fashionable~. I’m trying to identify how/why certain pieces work on me while others look slightly off. I take videos of myself where I make a bunch of tiny adjustments to my outfits to identify the little details I do or don’t like. This is definitely the biggest of my goals, and will take a long time to really figure out. I can often tell when something isn’t right about an outfit, but identifying that element is tricky.

text:Goals and Resolutions Check in: February	labels:Later last year, I decided to go a year without buying clothes (with a few exceptions, e.g. if I end up getting a job that requires things I don’t have), so my style lately has been about making use of things I own. Last month, my goal was to spend time mending an article of clothing every week, and I’m happy to say I’ve salvaged a few things and improved my sewing! This month, I’m learning about embroidery. I want to add subtle decorations to pants.  The struggle is wanting to splurge on cute things. :( Another: sewing is time-consuming, but I often do it while I watch TV.  It’s cool to hear about your goals! I care about sustainability, too.
text:Thats really awesome! I hope you have a good embroidery journey this month - that is definitely on my desire list this year as well. I have a jean jacket that I would love to embroider with the national parks I visit. I have a design in my mind and everything but it’s intimidating.  I also get the struggle of wanting to splurge on cute things or find time for sewing. I’ve tried to mend or embroider while watching tv but my lighting is terrible (that or my eyes are aging). I guess I need to get one of those bright task lights/reading lamps.   What was the most complicated or difficult mend you had to accomplish?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Goals and Resolutions Check in: February	labels:I think I have been doing well. I am planning on a low buy this year but needed some new pants since I lost some weight.

I am also appreciating better the clothes that I already own instead of constantly trying to find something new to buy. It's nice! Hopefully I won't fall into my shopping addiction this month.	episode_done:True

I’d love to wear it as part of everyday wear, but it looks a bit formal for most occasions. I have seen some more modern versions and a bit trendier versions, so I’m trying to get my hands on that. As for now, I just wear my cultural dress to church on Sundays, which is a more appropriate setting.  But I wouldn’t worry yourself about what your mom has to say about it. If it you like it and it makes you feel good, then why not wear it? I bet you look amazing in them, it sounds so cute!

That means I'm prepared in case of an emergency or something unplanned. My uniform is jeans and a "cute" top. Right now, my kids are doing virtual learning, so I'm running around helping them, plus fixing their lunches and snacks, in addition to my normal chores and errands.   My favorite shoes are Gabor loafers, which I have in several colors. And I just purchased a pair of Dansko Nora loafers. They are super comfortable, lightweight, and have great support. I typically go barefoot at home (which is why my Bombas wear out), but I walk my dog every day and these are great for that.  I really love having a uniform, and I have several pairs of the same style jeans, and multiple tees in different colors and styles. If I have to leave, I can throw on jewelry, grab my bag, and I'm ready to go. I was a teacher previously, and having a system works for me at home.

text:Another vote for apron, with a suggestion to look up japanese cross back aprons. They provide great coverage, stay on without restricting movement and don’t fit tightly at all, so they work with multiple outfit profiles and multiple wearers.

text:Dressing for “housework” vs “working from my house”	labels:For the most part, my WFH clothes are versatile and can be worn for housework/lounging/telework.  I don't wear shoes indoors, just cozy slippers.  In general, my work-from-home wardrobe consists of things like wide-leg soft pants, cozy-but-washable sweaters, washable knit dresses, and jeans and a blouse for days that I'm feeling fancy. These are all things that I'm comfortable doing light housework in, e.g. cooking/dishes/laundry. Sometimes I'll throw on an apron over top if I'm doing something that might splash.  But one rule with all of my clothing is that I don't buy things that aren't easy care/machine washable. I have a lot of environmental allergies, so I need to be able to thoroughly clean things if they're exposed to pollen/animal dander/etc. And the bulk of my clothing falls into the range of mid to dark colors, so nothing's likely to stain.  Now, if I'm going to be doing heavier housework (e.g. scrubbing the bathtub, deep-cleaning the stove, anything gardening, anything involving bleach or paint), I'll put on old sweatpants and a tee. But that's the exception rather than the rule.	episode_done:True

text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:Goodwill totally depends on the area. I'm from a college town and their Goodwill has amazing stuff, probably because there isn't a consignment store in town so they get everything. I live in a big city now and the Goodwills are completely picked through and don't have many trendy items but I would still go to find jeans to turn into cut offs or something. Buffalo Exchange is a consignment store so they don't accept anything damaged or dated, but its a little more expensive. I recommend Poshmark for workout clothes because you can search by brand and size. I buy shoes at Goodwill and don't have a problem since usually you can tell if they're heavily used or not.
text:My local goodwill is sooo overpriced! You’re so lucky! We have a local consignment shop run by my friend's mother and it is awesome, but I think they’re suffering due to the pandemic (the shop is very small and jam-packed).

Having to pay shipping on every item kinda sucks but I figure that's the price I pay for having access to thrifted items from across the country/world and not just whatever's available locally.	episode_done:True
text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:Kinda depends what you’re looking for. I love vintage, so small, local thrift shops in smaller towns can be a goldmine.	episode_done:True
text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:It really depends on your area. My favorite in my town in Salvation Army. You really just have to check all the ones in your area out and decide for yourself which has the best selection and prices. Also, figure out which days they do sales (my SA has a color tag for 99 cents on Fridays) and plan trips strategically. I moved from a city to a small town and at first was really disappointed in the thrifting since I rarely find modern brand name items, but the prices are way better, there is lots of great vintage, and I feel like there are less 'trendy' people shopping for the same style of items as I am.   So it also depends what you're looking for!	episode_done:True
text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:I'm a big fan of going local if you can. My city (Richmond, VA) has a place called Diversity Thrift that funds the local LGBTQ Community Center. You have to dig sometimes and I don't know what it's been like since covid but I've found some amazing, unique pieces there.

text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:I’m a fan of Savers cuz my Savers is HUGE. Plus, my Savers is much better organized and more often restocked than my Goodwill.	episode_done:True
text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:For me - I love value village especially when they had their 50% everything sale days. For some reason the Goodwill's in my area are really expensive (not sure if it's a regional thing or not - but I often find shoes there that are close to retail price	episode_done:True
text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:Mostly I just go to Value Village (which I believe is affiliated with Savers) and goodwill. There are one that are more curated like Buffalo exchange and Platos closet, but i usually just stick to VV and goodwill.   Largely with these thrift stores the location of the store is what matters. Bigger cities/nicer areas you’re more likely to get donations of nicer quality items.   I buy a lot of my shoes from thrift stores, but it often takes a lot of searching before I find ones that aren’t beat up and worn.

text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:My local Goodwill, is... adequate.  I've found some decent things, there but nothing amazing; it's overshopped, but one could find good things if one went regularly. There's a spot on the far side of town that's a great for, like, furniture and winter coats, but I don't hit it often.  We had a Salvation Army but it was, like all the other Salvation Armies in the area, incredibly terrible and I'm not sad it's gone.  The best spot in my town is the Hospital Thrift store.  It gives serious 'little old lady' vibes, but also consistently has very wearable, quality items as well as cool, funky stuff that's nice to look at.  Bonus is that it's tiny  (Covfefe restrictions have pushed the store limit to 10,) so digging around doesn't take long and is well worth the effort.	episode_done:True

text:Knee-high boots, classy heels, or trendy sneakers?	labels:Well I have been wearing sneakers with dresses/skirts on a regular basis since I was around 13 or so. Typically minimal types or when I was way younger even Keds. I am 42 now so that is like 30 years.   I also like pointy flats and those are a more walkable and polished option - and have been doing so since my early 20s. I also like ankle boots and have also been wearing those since my 20s.    These 3 are the shoes I wear the most - pointy flats, ankle boots, and sleek sneakers. I wear a lot of flats - those get the most use. The other two are regulars that can be a bit more seasonal.  In the before times it would be something like 4-5 days a week with flats and 2-3 days of sneakers. And in the winter or rainy season the boots replace the flats for many days.   I do not do heels very often and have been swapping out the ones I have for block heels since they do not get messed up on sidewalk grates. I love a slingback or mule so those are the styles I get the most.   I do not do knee high boots for a myriad of reasons.

text:Knee-high boots, classy heels, or trendy sneakers?	labels:In a dream world/climate, I would wear only sandals. I have an irrational dislike of socks and own/wear them purely out of necessity.

I do have a pair of shiny silver reebok’s that I occasionally drag out when I want to feel like a superhero- but I generally stick to flats (ballet, loafers, chelsea boots).   I’d love to be a heel person, but I’m already about 5’11”. I don’t have any sort of insecurity about being extra tall, but it’s a pain when you have to bend down for everything.	episode_done:True

text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:Honestly lululemon. Find a pair that fit you well and with all the features you want and you’ll never turn back. Leg pockets and waist drawstring for me.
text:I haven’t shopped at Lululemon in years (seriously, probably 8 yrs) & I always loved the brand, but fell off the athleisure train.  I went online to order a pair of high rise, plain black, full length leggings hopefully slimming & the product ratings were just so bad that it surprised me and deterred me!  Do you have a specific style that you recommend?!	labels:Honestly, I think lululemon reviews skew negative bc sale styles/colors are non-returnable - unless you can convince them that there was a quality defect with the pair you received. And the easiest way to get CS to initiate a quality return/exchange seems to be leaving a negative review...   Personally I love align leggings for everyday (knowing that they will eventually pill... but for me at least, usu more like a year or two in), fast & frees for lightweight running/spin (pockets!!!) and wunder unders or wunder trains for more of a sleek compressive feel (probably the best at achieving the slimming look you’re going for?). Hope that helps!	episode_done:True

Do you have a specific style that you recommend?!	labels:This question is so subjective! R/lululemon should help you out if you know what you’re looking for in a legging. Aligns are very popular, I love them they don’t slide down and are very smooth, however the quality isn’t as great. Wonder unders are popular too but they come in two fabrics that are very different from one another so you need to watch for that. The ones mentioned above with the side pocket and draw string are invigorates I like these but I find they slide down.
text:The issue with Aligns isn’t the quality. It’s the fact that it’s one of their most delicate fabrics. Most people wear them for workouts, and they’re really only designed to withstand light yoga.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:Coldwater Creek brand. Have worn/washed them at least 150 times and no fading. Excellent quality fabric, found another pair on eBay.	episode_done:True
text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:Depends if I plan on always wearing something over them or not, but one of my favorite pairs is from Nordstrom, Halogen brand. The fit is perfect and the fabric is stretchy and durable enough to be slightly slimming. I've had them for years and they look brand new no matter how many times I wash them.	episode_done:True
text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:The brand from TJ Maxx with a ballerina on the logo. $14-$25 for leggings, and they have super unique variations! Not exactly high end, but great when you’re unemployed and ballin’ on a budget!	episode_done:True
text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:Athleta’s Salutation legging in 7/8 length! I don’t like any more compressive feeling leggings, but lululemon Aligns are also a bit too soft and non-supportive feeling; the Powervita fabric on these is soft but also hugs so better for the ass lol. Also, I don’t like leggings that cover my ankles, and the 7/8 length is just right, though they also have full length. Also good if you want mid and high rise and pocket/no pocket options.   Someone else commented about Athleta’s Elation legging, and I’m not sure what the difference is between these two styles, but they’re both made out of Powervita fabric.	episode_done:True

text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I have a teal suit that is similar in brightness to your pink one. Some tops that would work/that I think work with my suit are: - white/cream button down - white/cream turtleneck - turtleneck or mock neck in a shade lighter or darker than the suit for a monochrome look - silver (for mine) / rose gold (for yours) colour camisole or shoes  - lacy bodysuit + heels - graphic tee + sneaker for a casual streetwear look (I don’t really like wearing sneakers with suits but lots of people like the look)  You can also simply wear the pieces separately!! I tend to wear my blazer a lot more than my pants.	episode_done:True
text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I'm a fan of combining bold pieces with more bold pieces. They say less is more, but I believe the inverse is true too: more is less. Meaning that when a piece feels like it's "too much," it can often help to add other "too much" pieces to balance it out and create a more intentional look.   The pink suit would rock with a base layer in red, light pink, tan/brown, or even a print or stripe if the mood strikes.
text:I think the print idea would be great! Also tan with pink is a color combination I wouldn't have thought of! thank you	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:For the pink suit, I think it would look great with any kind of tutleneck. Black could be safe, but if you really wanted to go mad you could go for a green or bright blue. it would look so fun.   The top I think would look really fun layered over a form fitting tube dress and then paired with some flat trainers.   The jacket would elevate anything for sure, byut what's stopping you just trying on a load of outfits you have and testing them out in the mirror? Have a fashion show!	episode_done:True
text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:Pink and burgundy can be a great combo. Pink and charcoal gray is one of my favorites.
text:My mom used to wear charcoal gray with red accesories.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:For the suit, I'm picturing a hot pink crop top underneath to go for a full monochromatic look, but with some more minimalist heels.  I've definitely seen a light/hot pink outfit before and thought it looked bomb.  As for the organza pink top, it would look lovely with some true black straight leg jeans and silver heeled pointed toe boots or nude strappy heeled sandals with your hair up in a bun and silver hoop earrings.	episode_done:True
text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I usually wear one statement piece with more basic items, but if I want to combine more dramatic items, I try to pick items that stand out for different reasons (unless I'm going for full on maximalist).   So like with the pink suit, it's 100% the colour that makes it stand out. So I would pair it with a top with a bold pattern, or a dramatic scarf that creates an interesting silhouette, or a belt or necklace that has a lot of interesting detail.
text:i love that you thought of accessories, I'm definitely going to give them a try!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I always like a graphic pattern. Maybe with 2-3 colors (like polka dots or something abstract). Or a graphic tee shirt. The pink suit can act as an almost neutral.    I do not love light pink paired with dark colors - so I’d pick something leading with a light color. Or a graphic pattern that is bright or light.   If your suit is hot pink or darker - I love mustard and bright pink. It is a really fun combo. Green is pretty classic. As is grey. Cobalt blue can be nice with a saturated pink. You could do tone on tone with another pink top.
text:never thought of mustard with bright pink! now I wanna try, thank you!  do you have any more tips or resources on color combination?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:Actually i woould pair it with a black turtleneck as well. I got a pink tweed skirtsuit and i love the bold pink and black contrast. I have plenty color too and i am interested in what people think. I also paied it with lacy black body suit.  I m also doing plain cropped woven shirt but so far only black and white tops. Will be interested to see more answers.

It’s cheap crap made by underpaid and exploited workers so we can wear it for a month and be thrown in a landfill. It drives me crazy that influencers constantly advertise clothes from cheap retailers because I know they are getting the outfits for free/are getting paid to post about them. The loungewear sets are thin and warp when you wash them. The dresses are paper thin. Bathing suits feel like they’re going to fall apart. But they say “omg look how cute!” for a buck.

text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I think the size of your wardrobe is going to depend on your climate, job, hobbies, and general lifestyle. I have a lot more clothing than that. I also live in a place with four seasons. I have outdoorsy hobbies that require some tougher clothes. I can‘t wear my casual clothing to work (and I’m also holding onto some more professional clothing from a past job in case I return to that field). I don’t have a lot of disposable income either, so I always keep things like dress pants even though I never wear them in my everyday, because I can’t afford to go shopping when interviews and funerals come up.  For instance, I probably have at least 15 dresses alone, once you count all the strappy sundresses, nice work dresses, wool sweater dresses, the cocktail dresses, and the evening gown that’s in the back of my closet - and everything in between.  I swap out my clothing with the seasons and have one closet that I share with my husband, so I try to be judicious about what I keep, while giving myself grace that I don’t need to get rid of something just because I don’t wear it regularly.
text:Living in a place that has a cold winter and a hot summer makes a capsule wardrobe pretty much impossible. I don't have that many clothes per season, but as there's four of them, stuff adds up quick. Not to mention things you need to keep around even if you don't wear them in years. I'm not going to throw out my snow boots and parka just because we've had two mild winters.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I have no idea how many total pieces I have. I counted black dresses recently and I had 18.

text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I think the size of your wardrobe is going to depend on your climate, job, hobbies, and general lifestyle. I have a lot more clothing than that. I also live in a place with four seasons. I have outdoorsy hobbies that require some tougher clothes. I can‘t wear my casual clothing to work (and I’m also holding onto some more professional clothing from a past job in case I return to that field). I don’t have a lot of disposable income either, so I always keep things like dress pants even though I never wear them in my everyday, because I can’t afford to go shopping when interviews and funerals come up.  For instance, I probably have at least 15 dresses alone, once you count all the strappy sundresses, nice work dresses, wool sweater dresses, the cocktail dresses, and the evening gown that’s in the back of my closet - and everything in between.  I swap out my clothing with the seasons and have one closet that I share with my husband, so I try to be judicious about what I keep, while giving myself grace that I don’t need to get rid of something just because I don’t wear it regularly.
text:Hobbies are a big one. I ride horses, work out, sometimes hike, and have a professional job. Along with my regular riding clothes, I have my competition clothes, chore clothes, and then the separate clothes for different workout activities, and then the rest of a "regular" wardrobe.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I mostly try to use the same clothes across hobbies, though maybe I can get away with this because I don't need specific clothes for hobbies.   For me summer is super thin wool. Fall and spring I add on a lightweight wool or puffer jacket. Winter I wear both the puffer and wool jacket and a rain coat to block the wind. Though I am worried about having too many clothes, so I was very careful about being able to layer across seasons. Having one coat for each season would be the problem for me. Having multiple that I can layer and get use throughout the year is fine.   I have a little linen that can be added in here and there for purely aesthetical reasons, worn between the lightweight wool and warmth layers.  I also work in tech, so it is all t-shirts and jeans, so I'm usually the one who is "over" dressed. I pretty much only work, hike and lounge at home. So everything I do is "casual." I haven't been to even a business casual event in over 6 years. So yes, lifestyle definitely means I just don't need many clothes.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is your favourite item from a discount brand?	labels:I have a 10+ year old floral dress from Kohl’s. It magically works for any occasion, doesn’t wrinkle, and needs no special care.  Works for a pool coverup, a bike ride, and a wedding. It also magically works across size fluctuations. I have gone 2 up and 2 down and it still looked cute.
text:Not familiar with kohl’s as I am in Canada. What other brands would they be akin to ? Dress like that sounds amazing!	labels:Kohl’s is a low to mid tier department store. A bit like Target without the food/toilet paper stuff, and lower end than Macy’s. Fancier than Walmart. But it is like the unhip middle age mom suburban store - so you are supposed to be embarrassed to shop there. 🤣🤣🤣  Now in retrospect, I might have actually bought this dress when I was still in my 20s, barely! And now I am 42.   They have a wide mix of “exclusive” brands, and mass market ones like Levi’s, Nike, and Lee.   The ones I have the best luck with are the Elle brand (like Elle Magazine). And the Apartment 9 brand - which is like Target’s Merona and the Hudson stores INC.	episode_done:True

I told them it was from. some little shop I didn't remember the name of, lol.	labels:LOL. Yes! No one believes there is cute stuff at Kohl’s.

text:What is your favourite item from a discount brand?	labels:My boyfriend has a really nice H&M wool (I think) blazer/coat. It’s at least 5 years old and is still great condition. I was amazed that something that nice came from H&M! I also have a pair of shoes from ardene that I wear all the time and they are still just fine after 3-4 years. That was really surprising because Ardene just smells like bad quality. Some forever21 stuff really is good though..... I got a pair of shorts from there via goodwill like 6 years ago and if they still fit me I would totally still wear them. Great shorts !	episode_done:True
text:What is your favourite item from a discount brand?	labels:Below are the top picks Ive had that lasted me surprisingly long! - $8.99 Hanes t shirt from Amazon (2 years at least, a little wear but nothing too crazy) - $5 knee length quilted jacket from Walmart (1 year of frequent wear and little to no wear)  - $5.50 long sleeve thermal top (3.5 years until I spilled food on it)	episode_done:True

text:What is your favourite item from a discount brand?	labels:I used to work at a local boutique whose markup was unreasonably high but managed to be mostly fairly priced, only because of how ridiculously cheap the clothes came from the vendors and the store’s overall fast fashion policies.  Anywho, after a few weeks/few months on the rack, any piece selling significantly less than its peers was marked for clearance and shoved in a messy stack of racks and buckets at the back of the store. I have a pair of soft purple shorts and two perfectly shade/texture matching crop tops that have survived a considerable 3 years or so now, all of it definitely cost me less than $20 before my employee discount, I think it ended up being like $11 once all was said and done. I love them, but they’ve definitely outlasted most of the other items from the same boutique 😂

So I guess my advice is to look around at what the popular brands are in your locale, follow them on Insta and trust Zuckerberg’s algorithm to lead the way.
text:This sounds like a solid plan, but I don't have IG	labels:I bet you could do the same with pinterest if you're trying not to get too deep into social media. Onc you start pinning certain types of images, you'll see more that are similar to it. But you can follow folks on Pinterest and brands from the same hemisphere as you, who are following current seasonally appropriate trends.

I like anything pastel and cute. Someone else mentioned Lirika Matoshi and I love her stuff. Edit: is it necessary to incorporate hard edged details?

text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:I love this! Personally, I love to dress *majority* of the time in what I would have to call, “neutral academia” which is edging closer to, “dark academia” but with softer neutrals and occasional splashes of pink. This tends to be seen as professional, so it’s my work go-to. The closest reference I have is from the Chinese drama Meteor Garden, the newer one (2018?), I was amazed to see the Hua Ze Lei and I dress almost identical. A lot of that style section of my wardrobe is from Abercrombie, Little Lace, Reformation, and Nordstrom.   On the days I’m feeling playful, I dress more, “girly grunge” where I mix distressed jeans, with baby tees or crop tops and layer on a sweater or open cardigan. That section of my wardrobe is typically from Tilly’s, WildFox, Free People, Patagonia, or PacSun.   The days I feel moody/sexy remind me of the edgy part of your posts. I don’t wear black often so when I do I’m sultry about it. I love wearing Doc Martens or Paladins with distressed black skinny jeans and mesh tops, or a edgy graphic tee/sweater, or I wear fitted black dresses with any combination of shoes. I’m also really into wearing lingerie bodysuits with outfits—it’s feminine in the bedroom but reads as edgy once you step outside your house. That section of my wardrobe is typically from Ruckus, Dolls Kill, Gooseberry, Intimissimi, or Nasty Gal.   I incorporate hard details with accessories. A soft outfit can be topped off with a dark brown or black wool hat. I’m always wearing my All Saints goat head necklace, shortened to be almost a choker, and when I eventually replace that I’ll be looking on Etsy for a new one. It’s so dainty that it looks sweet until you *really* look. I also tend to carry a black purse no matter what the outfit. Plaid, gingham, and houndstooth also feel (to me) to work well together when making an edgy/soft combination look.   Such a great post, and good luck cultivating your dream wardrobe; you’re going to look amazing!	episode_done:True
text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:Great album! I like to dress as girly or non-girly as I want, but always have dark nail polish to show that I'm edgy on the inside.	episode_done:True
text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:I love this style!! I don’t wear it a ton bc, well, I haven’t been able to go anywhere. I have a sort of style I’ve dubbed “glitterbitch.” Basically it’s throwing on whatever you want and topping it with sparkly eyeshadow. This is along the lines of what I like, I love the sweater in the thumbnail and stuff from Lirika Matoshi or Selkie, both sadly too expensive for me but still my inspiration. I think adding neutrals or structured pieces can offset the soft nature and age it up a little.	episode_done:True
text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:Oh my god that straw hat/doily dress?? Perfection!!!   I love wearing a 'cute' look at the grand old age of 37, but I try and make sure all the cute bits are always neat, tidy and made of quality materials to avoid looking too 'kiddy'. Quality fabrics and well-made vintage always elevate a look, I think!	episode_done:True
text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:First and foremost, this album is AMAZING!!! I fucking love the pieces, and you definitely channeled the essence Cassie so well with every outfit.   Truthfully I think there doesn't have to be a line between cute and sensible. I just make sure that I cater "cute" to my setting- like what's "cute" at the club, isn't going to be "cute" at work and vice versa. In terms of sensibility, fuck it. As long as your outfit is appropriate for your setting, and the heels aren't hurting your feet too much,  don’t worry about sensibility.   I typically like to interpret edginess into softer looks with significant color contrast, thoughtful accessories, and statement pieces. Like for instance, a soft colored dress with dark colored, edgy shoes and a bag to match the shoes. But statement pieces and accessories are the easiest way to give a cutesy, girly soft look some edge.	episode_done:True
text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:You might want to look into Japanese fashion magazines for inspiration. Dressing in sweet saccharine hues, ruffles, bows, polkadots, and just general cutesy-ness is a big thing. Refer to the magazines Ranzuki, Popteen, CanCam and AneCam, and Farfa if you're on the plus size side. Good luck!	episode_done:True
text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:I LOVE this album. As for walking the line between cute and sensible, I really think there is no wrong way to do anything with style as long as it is 1. appropriate (fits the environment and situation you're in), 2. fits properly (including not too short, not ill-fitting, etc.) and most of all 3. makes you feel like you are stylish and makes you feel amazing. The album you have created really incorporates hard edged details into a softer look well. Notice how it's just 1-2 items, mostly accessories. That's the way to do.
text:You're absolutely right, as long as one isn't inappropriate, personal flair is a-ok.

text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:H&M is pretty good! I have a lot of dressy stuff from there. It’s not dirt cheap but it is pretty cheap, especially when things are on sale.

text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:I haven't yet shopped FashionNova/Shein. But have spent plenty of time shopping cheaper brands like Target, Old Navy, NY and Co, Kohls, H&M, Forever21. And honestly I have plenty of things from these places that have held up fine. Especially when you follow wash instructions and avoid the dryer as much as possible.   Even cheaper stores have some gems among the low quality items.  The biggest issue I found is that certain things needed to be replaced like annually or sometimes 2x a year. But on the other hand some stuff will just last forever. I had (have) some decade+ stuff from all of those places that still get worn.  Some were super frequent, some weren't.  Now that I am a bit older - I realize there are a few things I always wear - vetted by years of experience - that is makes sense to spend more on. I'll always use a black cardigan, grey cardigan, and black knit pencil skirt (ponte or similar) year over year - so those can be upgrade picks. But as for dresses? My vibe changes often so I am ok at saving on those and trading them out as I see fit. There are some that live in my closet forever, but really as long as I have a couple of black/white print dress options I am happy!	episode_done:True
text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:I would not recommend Shein. I see a lot of their clothes in thrift stores and I see why—the quality is really low, fabric is really thin. Plus it’ll take a long time to ship.   H&M is a great option for cheaper workwear pieces. Have you thought about using Poshmark or ThredUP?
text:Thank you for the advice! I think I'll go for H&M.

text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:My 20s were spent wearing fast fashion as business casual! The really cheap brands (e.g. F21, Fashion Nova - this was before SheIn) did NOT work well for me - the low-quality was obvious in the fit and drape of the fabric, plus it was pretty difficult to find office-friendly pieces in the first place.  H&M and the Banana Republic/J Crew Factory Outlets (they're online!) were a lifeline, and I still wear many items!  You may also have luck with resale sites like Poshmark and ThredUp.	episode_done:True

text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:Full disclosure: I am not addressing any ethics concerns in my comment.   I've ordered a few times from Shein. I've gotten some really nice unique and flattering things that I get a lot of compliments on. I've only returned things that I didn't like on myself, not because they weren't as pictured. I find the exact measurements of every size and picture reviews very helpful. Don't order anything without reviews, at a minimum text reviews, and triple check the measurements and material on each item. I found the shipping to be decently quick and my refunds were processed quickly. No complaints.
text:Same I've had really good luck with some shein pieces but I also will only grab what has good reviews and photos.	labels:Same here. You can tell from customer photos which things have suitable cuts for the office (e.g. houndstooth/tweed stuff can be great but can be bodycon and the model photos don't always emphasise this), and which ones look to be good quality.	episode_done:True
text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:I think you would be best off buying from reputable brands during their sales. Their returns process will be better typically too. A $20 blouse on sale from J Crew Outlet is usually going to be better than a $20 blouse from Fashion Nova. A lot of these sites have customer service issues as well.  I have purchased from ROMWE (basically SHEIN they are the same company) and depending on the material you may be able to score some things decent enough for Zoom meetings, but not good enough that you will want to wear outside of a webcam.	episode_done:True

I think places like Fashion Nova don't have the best material which I think is fine for a club dress but everyday wear it's a bit more obvious.	episode_done:True

text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:Back when I still had a waist, I'd pair my Edwardian-ish skirts with turtlenecks, to kind of tone down the vibe a little, but I threw cardigans over them, so things weren't *too* modern.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:I've always loved vintage/historical clothing (Edwardian and 1940s/1950s are my favorite), but it's just not practical where I live (tropical country) to dress like that all the time, so I just add a vintage touch here and there to my outfits. I wear a lot of brooches, midi skirts, broderie anglaise blouses, and lace-up heels and boots. Usually I would mix them with more modern pieces or mix decades (so an Edwardian blouse with a 1940s skirt, for example) so it doesn't look like a costume. Most of my stuff I got from vintage/secondhand stores.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:I regularly look like a time traveling medieval witch. My wardrobe includes modernized kirtles, stays and petticoats. So yeah.  I got started long long ago when I was a historical costumer who decided that I really liked the way my medieval gear looked for everyday wear. Plus it's pretty practical for a cold winter. I make most of my historybounding gear still though I'll pick up anything that I find randomly that I think I can reuse.   People around me rarely react to my outfits. Occasionally I'll get compliments on them but I can full on wear a late Victorian walking skirt in public and nobody notices that it's a Victorian walking skirt. They do notice the pretty embroidery and I get comments on that. This trick relies on having a fairly modern silhouette for most of my stuff though. No obvious bustles and corsets. Mix in the occasional modern style clothing and it just sort of blends into people thinking I have a quirky fashion sense.  I have never felt a desire to hand sew underwear for a guinea pig. I'm honestly not the biggest Bernadette Banner fan girl. She's cool enough but she rarely goes into enough detail for me to replicate her techniques. There are other youtubers I like better for showing off how to do stuff in more detail.   I currently working on a piece that's inspired by Victorian depictions of medieval witches that's almost finished though. Next up is going to be a dress that's kinda sorta based on a Roman stola but with elastic cord involved.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:I love that lots of vintage eras hearken back to others, so you’ll find lots of 1930s inspirations in the 70s etc. You could start with prairie dresses, Gunnesax style and play with adding details. Right now massive puffy sleeves are everywhere! I love a good edwardian style blouse with jeans,and you can find real ones at reasonable prices if you’re willing to learn some simple repairs. Edwardian cottons are super durable! I also love a tweedy street urchin lad look with knickerbockers and vests. I’m dying for my city to host a tweed ride!	episode_done:True
text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:Well, I’m no fashion expert, but I’d try...  - mixing and matching old-timey-style things with modern things (like a corset over a tee (or blouse, for more vintage points) and modern pants/jeans, an old flowey dress with a modern leather jacket, things like that) - maybe adding vintage accessories (an antique locket, vintage hair pins?) - styling your hair in more vintage styles (like Bernadette)  Hope this is a good starter! If I think of any more I’ll try to update.

text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:I do this and nobody notices they aren't modern pieces, some are on trend.

text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:When I was in university I was super into the 1950s look. My wardrobe had been a mix of vintage finds from specialized shops, eBay & Etsy, items from vintage reproduction stores, and things from regular stores (H&M, Zara) that had a vintage flair. I never went 100% as it felt too much like a costume to me, but wore a lot of day dresses, circle skirts, button up short sleeve blouses, etc. Paired with more modern items like ballerina flats or high waisted skinny jeans. I also frequently wore red lipstick and either slept with rollers or used hot rollers in the morning to get retro curls.  This was 2012-2014 in western Canada and the reaction was pretty mixed - some students made fun of me and I got a bit of a reputation on campus for being a weirdo, and I got a lot of stares when out in public. That said, I also got some really positive reactions (mostly from women). I eventually moved on from this look but still LOVE vintage items. I have a lot of vintage lingerie and a still have a few of my vintage dresses, tops, and pieces of jewelry. I also recently bought this gorgeous linen blouse from the 1800s at a flea market in Paris that gives me Shakespeare vibes - I like to wear it with distressed jeans and ballet flats. I want to try to find more pieces like that as I think paired with the right items it can look quite modern.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:I feel this! I’ve grown up obsessed with stories like little women, Anne of green gables, and a little princess, so I’ve always had an affinity for feminine, old fashioned styles. They are so wholesome and pretty 🤩 I’m a little afraid to dress that way in public since it’s not the norm, but I have some flowy night gowns with lace and ribbons and such, and I wear them to bed. I also have bloomer shorts with lace that were custom made for me. They’re so pretty. I’ve been buying more flowy dresses with little floral detailing lately. I don’t have a lot of money to spend, so I mostly buy from online stores, but you can get lucky finds at thrift stores, some unique pieces from Etsy, or from a specialty shop that specifically sells vintage clothing. A lot of those types of stores are located in downtown stores, so I’d look there!	episode_done:True

text:Office Clothes	labels:I am in a male-dominated field but in a sector of creatives in a professional office.  I usually wear:  -	Solid or patterned (houndstooth or understated plaid) pants. -	tops with interest like puff sleeves, boat necks, crochet detail, etc.  I don’t really like patterned tops. -	Tea length feminine dresses.  Not sheath style.  Usually a-line.  Most of my dress are in a mellow print.  -	cardigans or blazers depending on my mood  My personal palette is navy, forest green/dusty green, dark red spectrum, ivory, mustard, and sometimes black.  I can’t do pastels except pink because it washes me out, but they looks lovely on others.  I’d say 75% of my clothes come from Boden and the rest from Gap, Banana Republic, J. Crew, and some from Old Navy. Boden is my fav and their clothes feel and look nice in me and have lasted a while.   I get my pants mainly from any of those places that aren’t Boden.  Everything else, dresses and tops are from there for the most part.	episode_done:True

text:I am with you Pawbean. I am all about comfort At the office and cheap buys or things that I know will last. Banana republic had a version of the Sloan pant that they marketed at “travel” pants because they were breathable and stretchy. Loved them. This is a trick I “learned” in Boston, our building was in front of cobblestone/brick and my shoes would get ruined in no time. So I wore sneakers in and kept nice shoes in a locked drawer.

text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I bought/sold on Poshmark when it was starting to get popular, and found great deals and sold pretty easily on it. I stopped a year later - by that time, I had started seeing wholesale distributers flooding the site and making it alot harder for me to find actual used clothing for decent prices. I'd agree that there are likely too many sellers now compared to buyers - or at least too much merchandise compared to buyers. To me, that makes Poshmark too much like Ebay, and is no longer as distinct a platform as it used to be.  Edit: typos
text:I mean tbh I have a harder time with random people wondering why something they bought at target two years ago isn't worth retail price or above now and arguing that its out of production so it's worth more (girl it's our of production because they don't keep producing the same things season to season oh my God).   I think some of this comes down to the encouragement of bargaining on the platform. People will say they anticipate being offered a lower number so they'll overprice something, but if you're a buyer that's just an additional layer of hassle that would stop impulsive purchases which isn't great for getting things sold.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:There's far too much merchandise, too much of the same stuff, too much complete junk to sort through, and a lot of sellers who have no idea how to sell their items. The categories and filters aren't that well thought-out, so you need to have a pretty specific idea of what keywords to search (or the patience to go through multiple categories). They could seriously improve the site for sellers and buyers by reorganizing their categories, adding boxes for measurements (and a checkbox for "listing contains measurements"), and removing items that don't sell after 6 months (the seller could always relist, but there are hundreds (probably thousands) of items that haven't even been updated in a year and sellers who seem to have abandoned their accounts).  As far as I know, you can't even set alerts for certain keywords or filters, which makes it even harder to use than Ebay--that said, when I do secondhand shop/browse I prefer Poshmark because it's easier to see at a glance whether the information is all there, which is a key aspect in whether I even consider buying an item.	labels:Yes absolutely with the old listings and abandoned accounts. I feel like everyone and their mother is jumping aboard the selling train right now, but the wholesalers grind my gears. No escaping them in this day and age, but eBay is worse than Poshmark because it’s nothing but Chinese scammers and drop shippers from Ali express and Taobao. Same for Etsy. Poshmark seems to have less of that (for now) at least in the categories I browse. But I agree there’s way too much crap on there. You can pretty much only sell if it’s a higher end brand name piece of clothing and not just general clothes because there are so many accounts with literally 1000 pieces of fast fashion garbage eternally listed   I’ll also add the constant invitation to go to peoples dumb selling parties and people constantly sharing my items is weird as a casual seller. I get that they’re trying to make it like a social media thing but it’s pretty transparent people are sharing my stuff so I’ll share theirs but I don’t have time for that and it clogs up my notifications so I’ve missed people bundling my stuff  Edited because i fumbled trying to correct it and hit send too soon!

text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I bought/sold on Poshmark when it was starting to get popular, and found great deals and sold pretty easily on it. I stopped a year later - by that time, I had started seeing wholesale distributers flooding the site and making it alot harder for me to find actual used clothing for decent prices. I'd agree that there are likely too many sellers now compared to buyers - or at least too much merchandise compared to buyers. To me, that makes Poshmark too much like Ebay, and is no longer as distinct a platform as it used to be.  Edit: typos
text:I agree. I like buying secondhand mostly so I used to use Posh/etc a tooooon and have pretty much stopped. I actually find better deals on eBay now for the same things. Sellers want to charge full retail (or more) for items and act like negotiating is a personal attack when that's literally what the site was designed for. Couple that with expensive shipping, no returns, and the high occurrence of issues with orders it just isn't worth it. The last time I was on this site was the summer and everything that I made reasonable offers is still sitting, now cheaper than what I originally offered, and because the sellers gave me attitude they lost my sale. I don't see Posh being successful for much longer, honestly. Mercari is just as bad and harder to find things on.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I buy/sell on eBay, Poshmark, depop, and Mercari. There are pros and cons to all of them. For me I’m not trying to make money or save money necessarily—I just want to recycle clothes that didn’t work for me and from everything I’ve read most donated clothes end up in landfills. I also prefer to buy secondhand for similar reasons.   Poshmark definitely has the best customer service. I’ve dealt with a lot of bad sellers (listing the wrong size, clothes not as described etc) and whenever I’ve reached out to Poshmark they basically refund all my money and let me keep the item. On the flip side, as a seller people have unnecessarily complained (item didn’t fit) and Poshmark didn’t allow them to send the item back for a refund—maybe Poshmark gave them a refund and let them keep the item but I wasn’t effected. This is something that REALLY irritates me about eBay—they always take the side of the buyer and u end up having wasted time, money etc shipping something even when u aren’t at fault. I really wish eBay would absorb the costs like Poshmark does, but this is probably why Poshmark has the highest fees.  Ultimately I think the downfall of Poshmark will be the wholesalers and people who are doing it as a side hustle. It’s becoming harder and harder for sellers with 20-30 listings from their actual personal closet to sell things because there’s so much garbage for buyers to sift through. It’s also hard for me as a buyer to find bundles anymore. In the early days sellers closets were made up of actual clothes from their closets so they were all the same size and the style of the person selling. Now if I find something I like it’s impossible to find another item in someone’s closet because there are 500 random listings to sift through.
text:Your assessment is great. Yeah eBays fees are super low so it makes sense that the seller absorbs the cost of shitty buyers. I think poshmark could Ilve half its issues by just deleting unsold listings after six months.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Exactly my problem with it.  I get so excited now when I find a closet that's just a few items all clearly the same size.  Those sellers are usually more reasonable on price too because the items would just get donated.  The people selling full time as a job on there have kinda ruined it for me.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:What Poshmark has going for it is that Google will show items when someone searches. Mecari doesn’t have that. I prefer Poshmark for their customer service and typical clientele. Idk if one is easier than the other- Poshmark requires the most seller engagement whereas the others are “list it and forget it”.
text:Mercari is a disaster from a buyer's point of view. Half of it is fake, and the interface is hard to navigate when I'm looking for something specific, which I usually am. I'd rather pay more on eBay. Poshmark used to be my go-to but only like 1 out of 3 things I buy actually ship. What a waste of my time and emotions.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are the Luxury IT Bags right now? And which ones are actually worth the $?	labels:The #1 It bag right now is the Prada Re-Edition. Because of that, you will be seeing a lot of nylon and half-moon shaped shoulder bags over the next few months. Bag trends go in and out pretty quickly, so it is much more important to pick one that you really love (especially when you are dropping that kind of money!). The Dior Saddle Bag is an older bag style that they brought back in and saw a huge resurgence in popularity. It's not as trendy as it was when they reintroduced it, but it looks pretty likely to stick around as a staple style for the brand. Dior has been getting more expensive recently. The price doesn't really reflect the quality (the quality is just as nice as many luxury brands with lower price points), so you are really paying for the brand.
text:Yeah you’re right the Prada is everywhere but I’m really not a fan of it! It’s just so small. I think you’re right about the saddle bag too, not worth the cost especially for such an impractical shape! But it does look awesome with the various Dior straps	labels:Dior definitely knows what they are doing with the guitar straps! Which is why they charge $1k+ just for the strap on top of a $3.3k+ bag! If you want your bag to be relatively timeless, you can invest in something like a Lady Dior or Chanel Classic Flap, or opt for a more simple style bag from most any of the major brands. But if your style is more edgy and youthful like the Saddle Bag love suggests, you might just want to get what makes you feel happiest and what is most practical for your lifestyle and budget, regardless of what people are wearing at this exact moment in fashion.

It’s not really unconventional but given that everyone around me is always in sneakers or some kinda boring rain shoes, I love to show off a metallic silver oxfords or platform sneakers or like a cool platform Doc Martens. 😉  Edit: spelling

text:Favorite unconventional workwear?	labels:I have some linen wrap pants in a sienna color that are really fun. Also bright orange suede loafers. Hot pink vintage sequined sweater got some compliments. Those are probably the closest I get to exciting, I’m in a pretty relaxed environment but most days I’m definitely looking for comfort and freedom of movement over more fussy styles. (Rip to my favorite hot pink button up that shrunk in the wash and digs in to my arms now.)	episode_done:True
text:Favorite unconventional workwear?	labels:I had a jerb as a biologist, and my task was doing an environmental impact study in a place with utterly miserable weather. Rain? Wet? All the time. Windy? All the time.  My fave was gearing up for the day in my Helly Hansens. Wind blowing rain sideways? No problem. I had my pop tarts and H&H gear. I loved being cold, wet and miserable.	episode_done:True
text:Favorite unconventional workwear?	labels:At my old workplace for my old job description, showing up in anything but a hoodie, sneakers, and jeans was unconventional. The people a rung above would be wearing business casual but still a little uninspired. Here I would come in my bright colored dresses. layered with cardigans.	episode_done:True
text:Favorite unconventional workwear?	labels:I love wearing different colored shalwar/harem pants (in saffron, plum, navy), high waisted with a silk, sometimes cropped top (that doesn't actually show any skin), under a sleek, tailored blazer (or leather jacket depending on my mood/schedule) and long layered necklaces. I also go the opposite, slim fitted trousers and ponte pants with more whimsical tops. I'm not really pushing an boundaries because the industry I work in is pretty relaxed even for execs, but I definitely look a little different from most others in my office. I feel like I'm giving a nod to my love of hippie shit and my half Indian background at the same time, while looking professional and pretty polished

text:Favorite unconventional workwear?	labels:I have some shiny pants I wear! I find they are a bit better with something covering my butt, so I usually wear them with a cool printed button down + blazer or a long sweater and ankle boots. One pair is sort of a disco pant, one is actually a disco pant and one is a pair of faux leather leggings. Definitely toes the line but my manager is one of those ladies who clinks when she walks because of how much jewelry she wears and she has tons of visible tattoos, so I think I am good!	episode_done:True

I've got a thrifted leather jacket that fits me like a dream and looks both elegant and badass, and so of course I'm on the lookout for one just like it in case this one wears out to the point that I can't rock it anymore.   That, and my two favourite silk blouses, and my perfectly oversized black t-shirt.	episode_done:True
text:Shopping for clothing items you already own: confessions of an outfit repeater	labels:Little black dresses for me. Sometimes I look at my closet and think, "I should really get more color in there," but the fact is, I feel happiest and most myself in neutrals. Past couple years I've been trying more colorful clothes. They do get compliments and objectively I like them, but what are my workhorses? The neutrals. Mainly knee-length black dresses. And a single red bodycon dress that's made its way into the regular rotation.  So now I'm trying to look for clothing with interesting texture, silhouettes, and architectural details, but color is no longer a requirement. I make up for it by having a colorful home.	episode_done:True
text:Shopping for clothing items you already own: confessions of an outfit repeater	labels:I'm quite picky about tops so if I find a style I like in a good, durable fabric that won't disintegrate after 3 washes, I like to buy it in different colors so I have some variety in my outfits (even if it's just the same silhouettes all the time lol).  I usually buy "basics" in multiple colors too since they're blank canvases -- I can dress them up or down or layer them so it gets quite a bit of mileage in terms of use :)	episode_done:True

text:Shopping for clothing items you already own: confessions of an outfit repeater	labels:It meeee.   I have the black sweater in at least 8 iterations. One fuzzy, one ribbed with thick turtleneck neck, one longer ribbed with thinner turtleneck, one cable-knit with pearl buttons, one similar with regular black buttons, one boat neck, one cowl and that's not counting the chunky boyfriend ones.   Don't even get me started with red dresses. Last year I counted 14, but they're too many to now to recall from memory alone.	episode_done:True

But when I find something I love and buy it brand new I always buy two!	episode_done:True

text:Shopping for clothing items you already own: confessions of an outfit repeater	labels:I’ve recently stopped doing this, actually! I was a sweater collector for years. Boxy crewnecks in super thick woven materials and weird patterns. I had like 50 for awhile, it was straight up out of hand. I’ve finally stopped buying them and managed to part with most and actually wear through a few (and unfortunately stained several and never wore again, which happens to anything light colored that I own). Now I’ve got a handful of good sweaters with enough room for another if I find one I *really* need.              All that said though, I’ve gotten into my mid twenties and my body has changed so now I can barely even wear sweaters at all anymore because I’m too damn hot all the time. Has anybody else had this change too? I used to be cold all the time and now I’m roasting in a t shirt at 70 degrees.	episode_done:True
text:Store closings at malls	labels:This has put a real damper on my online shopping too. I really miss shopping in person to try things on. I also only go to physical stores to return but now I realize if only I can try everything on (meaning stores actually have inventory and all sizes) I wouldn’t have to rely on the internet and returning when they don’t quite fit. Honestly all physical stores should have all sizes for fit try-on purposes but they don’t 🤷🏻‍♀️

text:Store closings at malls	labels:The biggest loss IMO was the Aerie at my local mall, during the first lockdown back in March/April. I know #aeriereal is just marketing, but it really did made me feel comfortable going in there and buying and trying on nice sweaters and cardigans.   We're under strict lockdown again in my area, so I'm sure there will be even more stores gone once malls open again. I really do miss physical stores - my sizing is weird, so it really helped to be able to try things on without going through a cumbersome returns process.	episode_done:True
text:Store closings at malls	labels:There’s been closings of things due to the pandemic but like Sears & JCPenney’s. Also on the food side there’s been restaurant closures.  As far as returns go, the place might be lenient with you on the return window and accept a return, worth a shot if you do find yourself going back to those malls.
text:I'd expect closings from Sears and JC Penny's...  I'm wondering how bad the carnage will be when this is over. I have not gone in person, just googled and found out they are closed.  Early in the pandemic, they were lenient. I wanted to return an item and at the time, the store was still in the mall but they were not open so I couldn't return. I returned by mail and they refunded me the shipping costs.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Store closings at malls	labels:I haven’t been to my mall yet to survey the carnage but apparently the urban outfitters in our cute downtown is relocating to the mall which I find really odd, brand-wise.
text:I’d bet the cost to lease the space in the downtown was getting too expensive? Meanwhile it’s dirt cheap to rent space in malls right now	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Store closings at malls	labels:I pretty infrequently went to the mall, but stores closing retail locations really doesn't impact their online store much. It can, if the stores are fulfilling the orders, but most major brands should be adapted to online long before today and are able to fulfill orders. It impacts the business in that they're not getting the retail location revenue but they're already established online with processes and can usually just adapt. Unfortunately, brands with retail locations can't be like Amazon because Amazon's business is really hosting the retail of other brands with some of its own products, which means it has more resources and volume to make various returns, deliveries, etc. more efficient. It's not without its issues itself. Unfortunately, it's a hard time for retailers. :(	episode_done:True

Luckily he was already in the process of moving and they transferred him to another store.	episode_done:True
text:Store closings at malls	labels:I’m kind of amazed at my local mall - businesses have actually come back in recent years and there have been no closures due to the pandemic.

What are some of your favourites?	labels:Someone recently posted on the fragrance subreddit about how they started the day in sweats but once they put on one of their strong sexy perfumes they described it as “the scent taking over” and forcing them to change into a super cool outfit, and throughout the day the scent kept inspiring them to do more like add red lipstick, etc even though they weren’t leaving the house.

The first version was giving one of the people in our office headaches, so she changed up the components and that solved that problem. For me, most perfumes trigger headaches at best, and migraines at worst, so I avoid people who wear perfume. It seems like perfume has become less prevalent in recent years, and as far as I'm concerned I'm thrilled about that since it's difficult to avoid scents as a health trigger.	episode_done:True
text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind?

I wear mainly Hermes perfumes only (because they don’t give me a migraine like a lot of other perfumes do), and I rotate between them based on how I feel and would like to be perceived if someone catches a whiff of my perfume as I walk by. I also have been in a situation where someone I’m talking to seems genuinely nice, etc but has horrendous perfume on. I can’t focus on anything else but the bad scent when this happens.	episode_done:True

I would probably judge more on whether it is too overpowering.   I've always worn one that I think is nice, but I now wonder if it's too smoky when my clothing choices aren't overly feminine, so I'm wondering if I should mix it up with something more floral. Perhaps wear the smoky one when I'm in feminine outfits and wear something more floral when I'm in less feminine clothing.	episode_done:True

text:Best way to buy clothes locally?	labels:There are websites that feature many different “local” boutiques that you can shop at with one click, so to speak. I use Trouva and Avocadostore to buy from different sustainable boutiques across Europe for clothes and home wear. I can even narrow my search to just my particular city. Even though I use one online site, I have to pay shipping if shopping from different stores. There is an incentive to shop at one place though, like they give a discount on shipping or something.   I know some local boutiques use farfetch as well.	episode_done:True
text:Best way to buy clothes locally?	labels:In the Before Times, my family made a habit of attending the local fairs and farmers markets, which was a great way to find local jewelry and something I really miss.  Summer before last, I got weirdly obsessed with googling and visiting *every* thrift/consignment shop when I was out and taking notes, so at this point I'm intimately familiar with what kind of stuff all within about a 60 mile radius tend to get, which has been a godsend in looking for things nowadays.  It's also worth hitting up wherever Main Street/the old part of your city is.  It can be pricey sometimes, but it's a good method of finding local sellers.	episode_done:True

I’ve made good friends with the owner of my local one after visiting quite regularly over the past few years (COVID permitting of course). My most recent purchase was a grey wool blazer from Jigsaw. It was bnwt and only £35, but would have been well over £100 originally.

text:Matching shoes & purse	labels:I don’t think fashion has any rules anymore unless you’re royalty or it’s cultural.   I personally don’t like matchy matchy bag and shoes unless I’m going for a monochrome look. I tend to match tones rather than colours. I like a patterned bag (say Gucci dionysus or Fendi zucca or LV canvas) as opposed to patterned clothes because I find they blend in well with a variety of outfit choices.   If I do colour, I will make sure the tone matches. I can’t stand mixing warm times with cool tones. Eg I have a cool tone lilac paid of heels that I love wearing with my cool tone magenta bag.   You can also do opposite sides of the colour wheel with shoes and bags like a green bag and a purple/magenta pair of shoes. But again keep to the same tones. The key with fashion is the tone of colours, and that includes neutral colours too. I would always suggest everyone does a colour/tone analysis and then stick to buying items in that range. It makes mixing and matching easier.

text:I do the exact same thing with warm tones! Most colors have variations that fall in either side, like mint green and dusty teal read warmer than spring green. Even navy can go cooler or warmer. Black and white are pretty neutral, anything else has to be warm toned to work for me. If everything is the same tone, it's way easier to mix and match!	labels:	episode_done:True

I walked away from that about 15 years ago and love being more creative with combinations.

text:Is Chanel going to be better off without Karl?	labels:I feel like Karl Lagerfeld's legacy & tenure really glossed over his last decade or so of design.

Virginie Viard is always going to come up short because she's Lagerfeld-esque and has the misfortune of coming directly after Lagerfeld. Lagerfeld was good at making his name and Chanel synonymous so that if you see a tweed jacket - you immediately think of both. As Viard tries to draw upon Chanel classics & house standards, it's seen as copying Lagerfeld (and failing) rather than her being referential. She hasn't really presented her point of view, separate from Chanel or Lagerfeld, either, so it's really hard to pick up on the specific aspects of her designs that are *hers.*

I'll be interested to see what direction it takes however and see if it grows in popularity amongst "normal" people or not.	episode_done:True
text:Is Chanel going to be better off without Karl?	labels:Karl was a great creative and brought a lot of creativity to the brand, but it was A LOT different than Coco Chanel's classic, timeless, etc. His creativity helped elevate the brand with younger and trend-centric customers, which was good, without necessarily alienating the legacy customers who are not aspirational consumers buying the lower priced items but truly wealthy customers buying the $$$ items. It is a feat in itself to meet both, but that's also from excellent marketing and business team (not just him). The brand may be trying to cater more to its true wealth vs aspirational customers at the moment to keep the brand afloat during this time since the supply chain and margins are likely different, and the aspirational consumers are not able to buy as much due to impact on income, etc. But, fashion brands also play to the mood of the market, what more fashion-focused less trend-focused consumers are heading, etc. and it's global so it is much broader than just one country, etc. The new collection is still very fashion forward and very pretty. But, not as rocker/edge/creative as Karl's days. The thing with Chanel is that it has the younger aspirational consumer so hooked on its lower priced items, it really doesn't need to innovate for it - they consider the earrings, lower priced handbags, wallets, etc. to be status no matter what it is because they're buying the brand. Where, overall, it likely all works out. It's nice to see the change of vibe, but I did enjoy Karl's. His vibe was also getting a little tired, he was there forever. But, they are wise not to try to replicate him.
text:Of course people like Chanel because of the status quo the brand gives off but Karl impacted it to greater heights which we have seen today. It was a dead brand before Karl joined.	labels:The brand was huge before Karl, Coco was alive until 1971, and it was a major luxury brand at that time, before and after. He joined in 1983. But he did a great job at getting the mainstream aspirational consumer and young wealthy into the brand, which is what it needed. I know women who are in their 60s and 70s who have Chanel from way back when. There was a time after WW2 that the brand struggled a little, but so did nearly all luxury European brands at the time. Overall though it's always been a key brand in the category.
text:It was huge but it was struggling real hard to the point the owners wanted to just keep it as a perfume company. 11 designers after Coco's death. The Wertheimer brothers approached Karl and he is the one who changed the classic flap for the better and like you said made Chanel grand and even a larger status people aspire to be apart of.	labels:Agreed! I studied Chanel for a project, I love that we have both geeked out on Coco!	episode_done:True

I am really sad I got rid of some square toe summer sandals years ago, because square seems to be back and will have some staying power.  The best part, comfort for our toesies. I’m down for the square resurgence over the past 1.5 years, I think it will only keep growing to msm fashion. I don’t mind, it’s nostalgic to my childhood.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Fellow clothing trackers, what coveted items are you tracking now?	labels:I thrifted the PERFECT jeans 8 years ago... American eagle “super stretch” high waisted jeans. They are from the era just before Jeggings. Still enough denim to be warm, thick and resilient. Well I wore them so freaking much I wore them out. Holes and stains the works. They have now become my house project jeans. And every time I put them on I actually sigh they are so comfortable! Just enough give to just move with me. So long story short I have them on poshmark notifications, every time I go into a thrift store I look for them in my size. They aren’t super hard to find but I’m a 0 long and that’s not a size I see often. It’s to the point I know what they feel like compared to other jeans and can spot them really fast. THREE DAYS AGO I FOUND THEM IN MY SIZE AGAIN. I practically ran to the check out. When I pulled them out of the dryer and put them on I actually danced. They are so perfect! Don’t give up on your hunt it might be out there! I’ve decided to start looking for a replacement pair now so I never have to go with out them again.	episode_done:True

text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:Not a lot of people still wear hats, but I keep hearing that many people *wish* they were still stylish to wear... so please feel free to help make hats fashionable again!  Typical etiquette for hat wearing is that if it's a very small decorative hat--something that stays close to the head--you may wear it indoors, but if it's a larger hat, you take it off indoors.  With something like a cloche or beret, which isn't exactly tiny but also isn't oppressively huge, it follows nearly the same rules as a coat:  If you're just popping by on an errand, it's fine to keep it on, but if you're planning to stay a while, you should take it off.  This is especially true if you're visiting a place of hospitality--a friend or relative's home, for example, or a restaurant--where somebody is offering comfort and relaxation, keeping your hat/coat on might be seen as a rejection of their hospitality.

text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:Everyone still wears hats! I keep the hat on at all times usually but it depends on the hat. For example, if I am going to be indoors for a duration of time (longer than average grocery trip) I will sometimes take a winter hat off because it'll get too warm to keep it on, or if it is out of place indoors for a long duration. Wear the cloche out! Hats are a great and super easy accessory to up level a look and make items into an outfit.	episode_done:True
text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:Oh man I frickin love hats. I feel like I see beanies all the time (doubt these will ever go out of style completely), and berets become popular every few years. Sun hats are kinda like beanies, I think they’re always in for the summer.   I wear beanies all the time in fall/winter and have quite the collection. I recently have gotten into berets. In the summer I have a few caps, but I don’t wear them as often as I do my beanies.   Personally, I keep my hats on everywhere. No one needs to see my hat hair.	episode_done:True
text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:I wear beanies and baseball caps a lot. I leave them on inside usually (usually my hair get messed up by the hat, so I actively avoid taking them off). I know my grandparents used to have a rule about no hats at the dining table, so I’d take mine off then (this was when I was a kid and had a sunhat - it was also impolite to put your hat on the table even if there was room).   I want a bucket hat but haven’t found one I like yet!	episode_done:True
text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:Honestly the biggest issue with hats for me is wind. Especially in England. I pretty much exclusively wear extremely wide brimmed hats because I'm still doing the  'wide brimmed hat for a witchy vibe' thing - especially on a bad hair day. I find that very feminine romantic looks really suit hats like this and I have similar large straw hats that kinda go with anything soft and flowy in warm weather. The appearance of cottagecore really helped bring back big beautiful straw hats, including ones with large ribbon ties for the neck/chin.	episode_done:True

text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:If it's a small brimmed hat, I typically leave it on indoors.  All my wide brimmed hats are foldable and are pretty much only used when I'm mostly outdoors; I stuff them into my handbag when I'm indoors.
text:It does have a small brim. It’s not the type of hat that should be folded so maybe it’s belt to keep it on. I wish hat racks were still a thing, that would make it easier, haha.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:I follow the IG feed Parisians in Paris (@parisiensinparis) and it’s given me more courage to wear hats when I’m out. The people on there are cool and practical, which is honestly the goal, right?  I just bought a black corduroy engineers cap at Anthro yesterday and I loved it so much I wore it the rest of my shopping trip. It felt appropriate with the outerwear I was wearing, and kept me warm and dry in miserable weather.

text:Style rut: Pinterest vs reality	labels:I think 'fashionable' and skinny/ white/ young etc. get confused a lot. A young, thin, white conventionally attractive woman wears and oversized tee and some leggings and its a 'look', and if I do that I've given up on myself.   I also think the overall styling of a look plays into whether its fashionable or not. A lot of the people you see on pinterest/ insta are wearing tailored clothes or have the photos edited or the clothes pinned at the back to make it look perfect. Hair and make up are also a part of how 'done up' you look.   Also, its not okay for people to be making comments that are hurtful even if they're not intending to hurt you. Its okay to say you're not okay with that.

text:Spring/Summer trends: Dresses	labels:Woof, I’m not into these looks at all, but thanks for compiling! The puff sleeve + pilgrim collar + tiered prairie look is really giving me polygamist cult vibes. 😵   I also think the side cutouts just look toooo trendy and juvenile, but maybe I’m just getting old. Some of the back cutouts are cool though.  I strongly prefer cleaner lines and more sculptural silhouettes as opposed to the poofy, frilly silhouettes happening here. I wish prints were trendier though! I like the silhouettes of the more minimalist dresses, but the colors are soooo boring. I love a dress that has a simple shape but has a fun print or cool texture or interesting details like embroidery.

text:Yah, thank you for voicing this. This question is problematic. I just wrote a reply about how actual feminism is an intersectional issue, and true feminist practices (like paying a living wage) can be practiced by non-female peeps, too.   the h&m shirt that says "girl power" is, in fact, the product of slavery and exploitation, and the opposite of feminist anything.	labels:Can I ask what you find problematic about OP's post?

text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:To me above jeans and below full suit. No maxi dresses or tank tops.  Bottom: Slacks  Khakis Skirts   Tops: Button down Polos Blouses  Sheaths and other “work type “ dresses.

Full suit or dress and jacket are business formal.	episode_done:True
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:It's really dependant upon where you are. In South Florida, business casual is golf slacks and a polo, or a wrap dress with sandals (and this isn't the entirety of business casual in South Florida, I'm just pointing out things that would not generally be seen as such elsewhere.)   The best bet is to go online, find this group's Facebook or Instagram accounts and look at what people are wearing at their events. I doubt very much that anyone is going to bat an eyelash at you wearing a skirt, and I'm sure that your work clothing is absolutely appropriate for whatever events you're attending.

text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:I usually do a nice blouse + skirt or a sheath dress for business casual. But I work in finance so my business casual may be different.

text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:My usual office wear is midi circle skirt and blouse, sheer black tights, pointy flat shoes, cardigan or blazer.  Or a midi or knee length dress, cardigan or blazer.  In some offices I've worked in, solid coloured jeans with no rips count as business casual.  I would wear them with solid coloured tshirts or knitwear and boots or shoes but not sports shoes.	episode_done:True
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:To me it's more about the materials and cuts than it is about the pieces, because fabric and cut define the range of casual, to business casual, to professional, to formal, etc. The same type of item can look any of these all depending on the fabric and cut. That's how I view it.	episode_done:True
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:I go to a lot of networking events in the STEM field, where the dress code is business casual, and I know that business casual in STEM is a whole different beast to business casual Law, and as Australians in a hot city, I'm guessing it's a lot different to a colder climate city. Probably way more casual.  After work networking events: whatever I wear to work. Generally long sleeved button up, mini skirt or skinny jeans, ankle boots, loafers, oxfords or sneakers. No effort into hair or makeup.   Networking event where I know there'll be bigwigs: I'll swap out the mini skirt for a pencil skirt, or a sheath dress. Definitely avoiding sneakers.   For an event with kids (like industry engagement): I'll make an effort to present more femme and do nicer hair, makeup, work heels, pencil skirt, polo. Sometimes blazer. I am almost definitely overdressed, but I think it's important to subvert the stereotype of female engineers as "pink steel cap boots" because that's not really indicative of me.	episode_done:True
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:I think it's basically woven or high end knit items that are tailored and polished. So chinos, a button down, a merino sweater, skirts, dresses, etc.   I think jersey knits, tees, jeans, sneakers---those can squeak in on a casual day and if styled impeccably, but I lean towards woven in general.   Coverage wise, it's usually from the neck to the knees continuously or more (meaning no belly shirts, no cut outs, and if it's sleeveless, it's not a tank top or camisole alone).   Tightness wise I think it's "skimming" the body. It's not tight, snug, or showing off curves, but it's not baggy in a casual way. I do think biz caz can be oversized, but that's like...advanced biz caz, like a loose linen dress with a loose linen blazer and simple flats on a hot day type deal.   Generally patterns and prints are small and discreet, no slogans, and no "novelty" items or promotional wear.   No workout items, no sleepwear or lingerie.   In your case, I think the events are indicating "smart casual" meaning no open toes/flip flops, no jeans, shorts, tees, or other overly-casual items.	episode_done:True
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:If you are a woman, then skirts are absoluely part of business casual.  In fact, there are still some business formal environment that insist on women wearing skirts, even though such a rule is coming to be seen as a red flag for workplace misogyny.    Business casual can mean pretty much anything that is less formal than a complete suit in conservative cut and color, but more formal than jeans and a t-shirt.  In some industries, 'business casual' might still mean suit and tie, but your blazer and skirt/slacks don't have to match and maybe you can wear khaki instead of navy.    In other industries 'business' casual might mean "just about anything that isn't jeans, shorts, or a t-shirt."  I've seen solid-wash denim trousers, bold patterned dresses, baggy sweaters, even sheer, sleeveless tops being worn as 'business casual,' even though I'd describe that more as smart casual.   If it's at all possible, try to find someone who has been to one of these events who can tell you more specifically what 'business casual' means to this club.  If not, then I would suggest wearing a white, button-down cotton shirt with a collar and a full or 3/4 length sleeve, paired with a simple, knee-length skirt in black, navy or gray suiting, black nylons.  It's boring, but it's your safest bet for something that'll pass muster while you scope out the crowd and find out what your other options are.	episode_done:True

I‘m trying not to get sucked into any nee handbag trends, I really want to shop my own closet this year. That said, I got a piece from the Loewe x Totoro capsule collection that I couldn‘t be more excited to wear this spring!   If I really had to pick, I‘d say that I‘m still eyeing a Loewe puzzle or a celine belt bag. I do like the Dior Bobby and the newly released Caro as well.

I also like that they are less popular because they look like a super good quality bag but only those “in the know” so to speak, will know where it is from!   I am also curious about hunting season bags. They have piqued my interest a bit as well.

text:In kind of a similar way-- when I first moved to NYC, I ended up living in a kind of sketchy neighborhood in Harlem.

text:I think this is an excellent example of when I think overdressing is rude.  How you dress communicates things. If you show up to a situation where messy and/or physical activities are planned and you're not dressed appropriately, you're essentially communicating distain for the planned activities. It's a non-verbal declaration of "you all go ahead and get dirty, I'll just watch."   If you're too good for picking up trash, why did you come to the trash cleanup day? If you knew you weren't going to participate in our frisbee game, why did you come to the frisbee party? Why did you come camping if you aren't prepared to let any part of you touch dirt - are you expecting everyone else to do extra work to make your camping experience squeaky clean? The only way to avoid that message is to dive right in and ruin your nice clothes.	labels:Aw this reminds me of the time when, in our honeymoon in France, we last-minute booked a grape-picking experience at a vineyard. I had no proper shoes so I just wore a pair of golden flats which were the most comfortable pair I had packed. When we went to the vineyard it was rainy and muddy and I felt quite judged by the looks when the rest of the people saw my shoes, they were all wearing rain boots or more appropriate gear. I was not expecting to go grape-picking in the mud when I packed! Anyway, the tour guide and the other women in the group made a bigger deal out of it than I did, I just went straight into the mud with my shiny shoes. It was incredibly fun and yes my shoes ended up all muddy but a good clean and they were good as new.

I'd also add that being overdressed (or underdressed) to an event with a dress code can also show disrespect for the host who chose the dress code.

They also have relatively good sales around holidays!  I personally wouldn’t dip into the Michael Kors / Kate Spade of it all unless you get it from the outlets. I’ve found their bags can sometimes be made with cheaper materials and don’t last as long.  I do really like the Rebecca Minkoff bags I’ve had.

text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:I buy pre-owned past season bags exclusively. The discount is 80%-90% off the retail usually. So, I’d pick that option? I don’t believe replicas have the same quality, IME. Also, I don’t feel the same joy when I carry them so it’s not worth it for me.	episode_done:True
text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:I have a few designer bags, but I bought them heavily discounted. I went through a PHASE and bought a bunch of bags, and now I'm done. I also regret spending thousands on waxed canvas??  I have a friend who fucks with reps and she's always concerned that someone will call her out for owning fakes. I wouldn't be able to deal with that constant stress, even if the bag were a really good knock off and I got a great deal (compared to retail) on it. I also think that the whole "they aren't QCing the bag, they're QCing you" is really fucking rude.  If I buy more bags, I wouldn't buy designer and stick to okay quality and mid-tier prices. There's nothing wrong with indulging if it's going to bring you joy, but I think that a lot of people drop $$$$ on a bag and then never  fully enjoy it because they're afraid of scuffing the leather.
text:Waxed canvas, lol. Yup. I got tons of that.  Worrying about people being able to tell you have a fake and being self conscious about it is not worth it.	labels:The self-consciousness wasn't worth it to me, either. I decided I was better off going quality no-name, since the brands I could afford were not doing anything I liked. One day I'll have the money for even a used name that I'm interested in, but for now I'll support a smaller operation.	episode_done:True
text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:I’d probably go with a lesser known brand/designer or something on a great sale (yoox, outnet, etc) instead. Some of the bigger names (like Kors and Kate Spade) I find to be mediocre quality for the price.	episode_done:True
text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:I think it depends on the bag you want! If you really truly want a specific Dior bag for example but don’t want to spend $3k on it, you could probably spend about $300 on a nice rep. If you actually just want a specific shape/leather type, you can probably look at Coach and Tory Burch, or even smaller contemporary brands like Mansur Gavriel or Polene.  I’d recommend making a wishlist of bags and write out pros and cons of getting authentic pieces vs replicas, including price and how much you actually want it.  For a while I’ve been spending money on contemporary brands and a few auth designer bags, but recently I’ve been fulfilling my bag wishlist through reps and it feels liberating honestly. You can save money and still get the bag you truly want, and if there’s a bag you really like and you want to support the designer in some way besides wearing their logo/brand, you can always save up for and buy the auth.	episode_done:True
text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:I wouldn’t spend money on a replica no matter how high quality it is. I wouldn’t feel right ripping off the intellectual property of the original designer.
text:I like your integrity but i think of how crazy it is that most fashionable ideas are copies of other fashionable ideas. I have seen a few Kate spade bags that are pretty direct copies of YSL’s Sac Du Jour, Rebecca Minkoff and Michael Kors are pretty notorious for being inspired by whatever the it bag of the moment is. high fashion dictates and then that idea is typically diluted to the masses so intellectual property becomes an interesting conundrum. 99% invisible has a great episode about counterfeits if you are interested!	labels:>nspired by whatever the it bag of the moment is. high fashion dictates and then that idea is typically diluted to the masses so intellectual property becomes an interesting conundrum.

text:Shitpost Saturday: Beauty is Pain	labels:Everyone knows that true beauty is inner beauty, so over the past year, I've really focused on psychological pain and suffering. My top three habits include:  - Putting on a cute outfit every day and wearing a full face of makeup so that I'm not only slightly uncomfortable all day, but I'm also reminded of the fact that I haven't seen another person in over 10 months, so no one cares what I look like.  - Every Saturday I make myself a cocktail and put on one of my formal dresses to reminds myself of how much weight I've gained since I last attended a fancy party.  - I cut my own bangs  I'm pretty sure I'm at the brink of a nervous breakdown, but my *soul* looks radiant over zoom.	episode_done:True

Long story short, I did that but the guy I am interested in, totally saw that and is now completely grossed out and it also kinda ruined the shoes. So now I cant stand on my feet without being in agony and I am single. On the upside I can now fit in my stepsisters’ shoes.

text:Shitpost Saturday: Beauty is Pain	labels:I squeeze myself into the stiffest raw denim there is. I’ve heard of these things called leggings or stretch pants, but the idea that pants could provide a modicum of comfort means they must be entirely unfashionable. I avoid them. Instead, I adorn my lower half with the most unyielding, unforgiving denim they make. I don’t “break it in” or other such nonsense as that could potentially soften my rigid mom jeans into pants that I don’t grimace while wearing. If your bottoms aren’t leaving crease marks on your hips and thighs, then I don’t think they even count as pants.	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: Beauty is Pain	labels:I once had this gorgeous denim dress, smart and sharp, I looked totally hot in it. It was quite tight. One evening, due to my own poor judgment, I decided to wear this bloody amazing dress to a dinner. It was going great, we had an entree, then the main... until I reached the point where I had one tiny potato left on my plate and I knew all too well that if I eat this potato, either the dress will burst, exposing guests to an unsightly view of my semi-naked body, or the guests will be exposed to an unsightly view of everything I have eaten that day.   Since I am a person who got their life priorities straight, I elegantly excused my guests and I delighted their eyes with yet another gorgeous outfit. No potato was left behind.	episode_done:True

text:“I'm all locked down with nowhere to go – but that hasn't killed my lust for fashion”	labels:I have one suggestion, get dressed and take pictures. It doesn't have to be for Instagram/facebook. It can be for just yourself. If you really like an outfit, remember it with a picture. You can take it in a park, or at a location that is memorable for you, with your SO, or with your cat. You should at least get a few good pictures with you pet in the 10+ years they reside with you.  It's actually a fun learning experience, on how to use the cameras. I am interested in photography and usually use a dslr, but for selfies, dslrs are not as good. With an iphone, I think it's an entirely different genre of photography. You have to use completely different lighting system, etc., to use it to its full potential.

text:Underwear review: Soma vs. Parade after 6 months	labels:I've never tried soma's panties, but if their bra quality is any indication, I'd choose soma any day. I have three pairs of parade panties and I liked them initially but the waistband got warped(/wrinkly almost?

text:Underwear review: Soma vs. Parade after 6 months	labels:I bought a pack of Parade recently and the high rise brief cut is one of my favorite pairs of underwear. They do give a bit of a wedgie, but the fabric is light and soft enough that I don’t feel it and it isn’t visible under clothes. I wish they were cotton, but the fabric hasn’t given me any problems yet. I’ve been considering Meundies for a similar high rise cheeky cut, but am not thrilled about the price point.

I wear smalls in most underwear, and medium in others so based on them running bigger, I got small. They're loose in the hip/waist, but the crotch part is tight and uncomfortable. The bands are also really apparent under clothes, and there's a seem that gives me sensory rage	episode_done:True
text:Underwear review: Soma vs. Parade after 6 months	labels:I've been looking for better underwear than the 8 pack of crappy ones I got on Amazon! Thanks for the thorough review.

text:Underwear review: Soma vs. Parade after 6 months	labels:I ordered some Parade and I really like how they look and feel.

text:What's the greatest length you've gone to obtain a much coveted fashion item?	labels:I purchased glasses from Korea. They wouldn’t ship to the USA so I sent them to my in-laws in China. They gave them to a friend of theirs who regularly flys to Los Angeles. Friend gave them to another local Chinese friend who eventually shipped them to NYC.   At the end I didn’t like the glasses.

If you don’t want to give money to Bezos, though, that’s super valid. I’ve bought them in the past from Uniqlo as well.	episode_done:True

text:Yesss, I just broke the strap on my house dress. Sends recs	labels:No specific links but old navy always has them as well as target and Walmart and Costco.  Just make sure it’s not 100% cotton or 100% polyester blend. So look for something with both so it’s easy wash and no shrink but still feels super comfy.	episode_done:True
text:What are you most comfortable clothing items (cute or not)?	labels:I've got these super soft house dresses that are apparently made from chenille. They're so fluffy and kinda feel like bath robes (I also bought my first pink fluffy bath robe, which is amazing as well!). It's as if you're wrapped in clouds <3	episode_done:True

text:Aw I wish! My heat is turned up all the way but it's an old house so it doesn't get all that warm when it's -15C outside! Don't worry lol I'm not freezing to death, I just need to be covered in fleece or wool then I'm perfectly cosy! :)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are you most comfortable clothing items (cute or not)?	labels:Not clothing, but I got a $20 electric heated blanket from Target and it is LIFE CHANGING. Now I don’t even need to wear pants or turn on my thermostat to stay warm and cozy.	episode_done:True
text:What are you most comfortable clothing items (cute or not)?	labels:Not a clothing item but my husband got me a Pendleton wool blanket for Christmas, and it is the most comfortable blanket that I've had. It's twin size but we use it on the couch, and it's perfect for Netflix binging and lazy working lol
text:I recently got a pile-lined fleece throw blanket from Uniqlo.  On especially cold days, I place it \*under\* my top sheet so it's directly on my skin and OMG...it feels so warm and comfortable!  I actually sleep better with this blanket.  The other great thing about this blanket is that it has snaps so you can wear it over your shoulders around the house...so I guess you can count it as a clothing item!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Summer outfit inspiration: An inspo album and 6 lessons on how to make complete outfits even when you are dying of heat stroke	labels:Yet another South Aussie here! In the last few years our summers have become so brutal I now plan clothing ahead of time for the really hot days because just throwing on normal summer clothing can be too hot and unbearable.  I hate the feeling of necklaces sticking to sweaty skin so when it's really hot I prefer to wear statement earrings or an interesting neckline rather than something around my neck.	episode_done:True

Also searching for the multicolor wrap skirt on the woman with the curly red hair and turquoise earrings!	episode_done:True
text:Summer outfit inspiration: An inspo album and 6 lessons on how to make complete outfits even when you are dying of heat stroke	labels:Used to live in US Southwest, temps 100+F in summer.    Clothing depends on what your activity is. If you're just going to the office, layers are key. Pants, short sleeve shirt, blazer/cardigan. Air conditioning can be brutal.   Day to day errands, dresses can be super nice (with safety shorts). DO pick ones that cover your shoulders/back/neck if you can, those areas sunburn very easily!   After the sun goes down, dark colors are fine and will make lighter clothing look more formal.   As someone else mentioned, moisture wicking athleisure can be nice (think tennis/golf polo).  Sneakers work surprisingly well. Sandals are nice, but make sure you don't get sunburn on the tops of your feet. Also don't ever go barefoot, pavement gets hot enough to give you 2nd degree burns in seconds.      Notice how many times I say "after dark" here, there's a reason many cultures with hot summers have a culture of socializing/doing errands in the evening!	episode_done:True
