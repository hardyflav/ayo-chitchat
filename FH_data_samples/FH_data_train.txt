text:Topman is now a part of ASOS	labels:I just received an email myself from ASOS stating that the Topman brand is being brought under their website. I also had a couple of Topman items I had my eye on, and their website has been replaced with the "part of ASOS" message.  Generally not a problem for me; I only made an order with Topman once and it was because I had some vouchers to heavily reduce the price. I only considered Topman items when they were in the sale anyways.  Since I shop semi-regularly at ASOS, this change won't affect me too much. I'm not concerned about the uality of ASOS products either; they seem fine enough for what I need. I'd rather have a good quality item at a sensible price, than an excellent quality item at a much higher price than what I could possibly afford.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 01, 2020	labels:lol I just remembered I wrote fan mail to Thom Browne and he never replied  Edit: before you jerks make this into copypasta let it be known I did this in middle school
text:I’d like to preface all this by saying I don’t know where else to post this on Reddit. I figure the best method to achieve the end goal is to branch out and see if anything comes back. I’d also like to preface the following: I rarely ask favors of people as it’s always been my understanding not to lean on others for help. However, I’m dead in the water. I’ve attempted to complete this mission myself, but it’s not lead anywhere significant because of level of importance this person possesses. I was hoping the Reddit community could play a part in accomplishing it with me. I’ve always seen Reddits and watched a bunch of the videos of the community on YouTube. Honestly you are a bunch fun loving individuals and have accomplished crazy things from what I’ve seen.  From working on a nuclear reactor, to climbing Mt. Everest, and even diving in a submarine to 1,500 get below the oceans surface: nothing has made me shake or to be as nervous as my dream of meeting Thom Browne. I would like to meet Thom Browne.(Fashion designer and business mogul) I have two of his known addresses but as a man of that importance I’m sure he’s not at either typically with all the international business he conducts. I’d also like to point out that I’m currently a nuclear engineer in the U.S. Navy. There are a few restrictions I have due to this. Therefore, I cannot have a computer. I’d further my investigation through those means if those were viable.  Since I’ve joined the Navy, I’ve not been able to keep up the development of my programming and hacking skills. My heart would have immense renitence if I didn’t ask you this: Can you find a way to put me in contact with Thom Browne? Anything would help; from his personal cell phone, to being in the same room, or his future known future location, etc... You will be compensated handsomely at the end of this daring mission. I do know how difficult this is or could be, but I would not ask if it wasn’t important to who I became today.	labels:Fucking gottem	episode_done:True
text:How have you been doing your shopping since Covid?	labels:Online only/curbside pickup for the most part. I went inside into a fancy boutique once a few weeks ago because I was walking by and saw a dress in the window I had to have (plus they were having like a 50%-70% (but final) sale. But I was in and out in maybe 10 mins.  Almost all of the clothing stores I frequent have a website or even an instagram. In fact, one of them managed to get “online” really fast with just instagram posts and call to order. I’m still very much supporting my local stores in that I’ll order online and pickup and try them on at home and return if it doesn’t work. I’m a bit more selective in trying clothes now in that I’ll only try things that I’m certain I will purchase if they fit. But my purchases have increased a lot due to COVID sales.	episode_done:True

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:If I picture my mom's typical winter outfit it was a sweater with snakes wearing sombreros and margaritas embroidered on it, a burgundy "sweater jacket" with fringe, and a pink/orange/green bucket purse.*  So I guess she taught me "fuck it, wear what you want", but it did take me a while to adopt that attitude.   *tbf, this was a look for moms in the 90s
text:That sweater sounds amazing.  source: am mom.	labels:I really didn't appreciate her taste enough. One thing I did steal from her were a pair of earrings that are just dangling wooden parrots. I did like her Christmas party uniform, which was a long navy dress, a cream colored military style jacket, and block heeled sling backs.  The 90s really were a trip.

text:Favorite brands to thrift?	labels:Honestly I don't have any. What I love about thrifting is seeing pieces removed from the context of their stores, marketing, and other items from the same brand, so I can judge them on their own merits.   I'm not trying to be condescending or corrective at all, though: If you find a brand whose clothes you tend to enjoy at a price point that works for you, more power to you!

text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:There's some variation, but usually:  Phone, keys, wallet, a compact, sunglasses, a pouch with chapstick, Halls, a pen, headphones, and Tylenol, a lipstick or three, a notebook, a book to read, my planner, a phone charger, my keep cup or water bottle (or both), and hand sanitizer and a mask at the moment. Sometimes a travel umbrella.   I manage to fit most of all of that, sometimes with an exclusion or two, in my Fossil Rachel satchel. I love it.	episode_done:True
text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:In this hypothetical I'd go with haute couture. In your friend's situation I'd keep looking until I found a designer I liked. Bespoke would be my last option for a couple of reasons. Your friend wants contemporary fashion, but most bespoke tailors make traditional clothes for a typically older crowd (you're in NYC though so there are some bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd; make sure you look for them specifically). The bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd don't have designs as good as high end ready to wear IMO. Tailoring and designing are different skills, and there's a reason Louis Vuittion, YSL, Dior, Gucci, etc pay their head designers millions per year. Of course some $4000 coats are worth more than others, so it would be good to know a bit about general quality.  Personally, I prioritize design over fit. I can deal with a less than perfect fit if I love the design of a piece. But I won't wear a piece if I don't love the design, even if it fits well.   The middle ground option is made to measure, or MTM. MTM for outerwear isn't as common for suiting, but it's out there.
text:Well, but bespoke tailors can do anything. They all have a house style, and maybe the Haute Couture brands do something a given house won't replicate, but unless theres' something really unique happening, you'll probably be able to find *some* house that can make you at least as happy. Probably.  The real issue with Bespoke is just the amount of time it takes.	labels:I think I see what you mean. Bespoke tailors are great pattern-makers so they can theoretically copy anything. So if you show them a YSL/SLP or Dior coat, they should be able to make it for you. Some won't do that on principle. Some won't even copy a garment you own that's damaged or too small. It's also impossible for it to look the same because it'll be a different pattern. If what you want is an exact copy of something, you're better off buying the thing and tailoring it	episode_done:True

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:Sustainable consumption complicated and everyone is going to have their own ways to go about it. It's good that you're keeping and using what you buy for years (no matter what the brand), so that's a start.  Synthetics are made of plastic and can release microplastics into the environment when they are worn and washed. Cotton takes up lots of land and water. Leather lasts way longer than pleather but then you have the cruelty aspect and tanning leather does require a lot of harmful chemicals. Expensive doesn't always mean ethical, but ethical clothing does tend to cost more. There is always going to be a footprint - not buying anything at all is probably the safest and most sustainable way but obviously we still need things now and then!   It's taken me YEARS to change my habits and transition to a better wardrobe, and even then I'm still not fast fashion-free. I had to wait to use up what I had and be able to afford something better. It took time to refine and define my style to determine what pieces would give me the most mileage. Each person will have to determine what is important to them when it comes to sustainability. Like, I'm not very picky about my purses but I tend to vet my shoes and what my options are when it comes time to repair or dispose of them.	episode_done:True
text:How would you style or rebuild your wardrobe around your holy grail fashion piece?	labels:Pear shape with a big arse - I want Lauren Bacall style wool trousers.

For brunch dates with a bateau neck tee that fits like a second skin, and for evenings with a low backed long sleeved version of the same. A chunky, cropped length fisherman’s jumper if theres a chill on casual strolls

text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Expand your definition of "statement piece" to include texture, pattern, silhouette, and x-factors instead of just colors vs neutrals. A shiny pant makes a statement even if it's black. An oversized blazer makes a statement even if it's tan. A snake print bag or skirt  makes a statement even if it's shades of brown or grey.   Some other ideas that might help: make color decisions based on seasons - if you have a lot of winterwear you love in a certain color scheme, start there and weed out what doesn't go with those faves, and so on with the other seasons. Make pinterest boards with the colors you're considering. Take pictures of combinations you like. Consider what colors you like best on yourself.	episode_done:True

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:Go through your wardrobe minimum once a year. It helps me to have a 4 tier system.  A - Cothes I like, wear, and fit me well. I have worn them recently and would wear them recently again. These are my go to.  B - Clothes I like but might not fit perfectly but still wear. These are out of rotation but just don't get worn as often. Could also be sort of like a specific situation sweater, these I would hate to lose.  C - clothes I want to sit on to give another chance. If I don't end up wearing it in a season/year/whatever period it will get donated  D - For donate/sell. Don't wear or don't fit. No use in taking up space for something I don't like or may have not held up so well. If you can get money back great but I also say have a time limit. You don't want to hold onto it because it doesn't sell.  I also kind of have a category for gifts/memorable occasion clothing. And that just helps me know, hey I am visiting a friend who got me a shirt let me wear the thing they got me. Might not be my style but I do try to hold onto these for a least a little while.	episode_done:True
text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:Yes and no.   I have been wearing way more loungewear - and all day loungewear. I have been going to my workout class and it feels silly to change clothes midday to get ready for an afternoon class. I would bring a change of clothes before of course.   One of my fashion goals for this year was getting better at separates. I am practicing this! In the before times I wore more dresses. I haven’t been doing it as much because my desk area is a little chilly. I have a few looks I am happy with and should translate nicely.   I did wear some of my dresses during the summer. But more solid ones vs patterned ones. I have been also experimenting with solids this year.   I have been wearing way more pants so that will likely translate in the future. Surprisingly. I have avoided pants a lot in the past.   I can’t wait to get back to my fave shoes and the dresses I have missed - that feel a little wrong for sitting at home. My wardrobe has gone through a massive shift over the past 5 years when I started biking for errands.  This means I mostly buy items that are bike friendly. And that works well for sitting at home as well. I have snuck in a skirt or two that may not work on my bike - and jeans which I hate biking in - but one the whole that rule serves me well.	episode_done:True

text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:I found myself at age 27 having lost every good pieces I ever owned, had gained 32 lbs, and was wearing the same two pairs of leggings from Ross basically every day. I’m 32 going on 33 now and have built a beautiful new style, I don’t have everything, but a lot of great wearable pieces.  My advice is to start with what you’re missing in that moment, and buy ahead for the season when you can.   Do not try to buy everything at once!  Pay close attn to materials (what you like vs. don’t) and remember to look for that when shopping online. Things that will last and are versatile.   Accessories are fun 🤩 invest in pants shoes and bags and jewelry!  Don’t just buy things because they are on sale, be thoughtful about what you’re choosing.   Do not be afraid to buy things oversized!  I was so afraid to up size for so long that I ended up with tshirts I never wear sweatpants sweatshirts, jackets etc. even SHOES!   Which brings me to my last point, remember to bring socks when trying on boots!  Xoxo 😘	episode_done:True

It’s possible the boyfriend has an art school education, or participates in online fashion forums, or is very tapped into visual style (if so, he still could keep his opinions to himself)... but I’m betting it’s more likely he wears too much hair gel and the same crumpled t shirt and jeans most of the time. Which is also fine, but doesn’t make him qualified to comment on anyone else’s fashion choices.  OP, if you feel comfortable in it, go ahead and wear it. You’ll work out what you like, and it’ll probably evolve over the years.

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:I associate Gen Z fashion with crop tops and sweatpants, so yeah it makes sense that people in their 30's buying expensive ethical clothes aren't going for the sporty spice look.
text:Totally.  To me, Gen Z is a lot of clothing that isn’t work appropriate but super fun. A lot of crop tops, bra tops, spaghetti straps, usually some tummy showing, and then some baggy pants. Lots of thrifting and also cheap fast fashion. Doc Martens and other platform shoes. Very 90s/early 2000s. Long acrylic nails, false lashes. Really fun and can be a really “hot but trashy” style   Millennial fashion is more professional/better quality/structured. Linens, trousers, heels, sandals, etc. Frankly I think it has to do with millennials having more money. Low key hair, nails and makeup. Neutral colours and patterns. It’s a more mature style   I’m 25 so I get to do both 😎 woohoo	labels:I don't think it's that millennials have more money, it's that we are older, and more likely to be in the professional job phase of life. Millenials also wore crop tops and baggy pants, in the late 90s/early 2000s when they were cool the first time around.
text:I think it has a little to do with it! A lot of teenagers can only really afford to thrift/buy fast fashion.  Whereas now that millennials are getting older, we ofc have to buy more professional clothing, but we also have the funds to buy clothes and accessories made out of better quality fabrics and materials. I think wearing polyester vs cashmere sweaters makes a big difference in style   Def not saying one is better than the other and that ALL millennials spend a lot of money on clothes, but it’s def a trend	labels:	episode_done:True

I'm thinking brown brogues for more formal occasions but looking for a pair of durable boots that will allow me to stay on my feet all day but won't lose me fashion points because they look like something I should be wearing on the hills.  Thanks for any help!

text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process? What would you prioritize?	labels:You know what? I’m middle aged and secure in my job. I’d go full cyber goth. Not even joking. I’ve spent my whole life trying to dress appropriately for my work and lifestyle and it’s boring me. I have all kinds of office appropriate slacks and cardigans and button up shirts in cutesy patterns, casual jeans and sensible shoes. I want to wear plastic corsets and fluorescent clip in braids and platform combat boots.
text:I'm 34 and maybe in the beginning stages of a pandemic induced mid-life crisis. Also feeling the darkness calling. I really like the idea of creating a goth capsule wardrobe for the two days of the month I go somewhere other than work.

He was always a great dresser and a great man. We were very close, he's been gone 9 years now, I still think of him daily.

text:Revisiting Tim Gunn's List of 10 Style Must-haves	labels:To me, this is “wardrobe staples if you have a traditional office job with a business dress code” tbh. I do, so I own a version of most of these, but that kind of work environment is less and less common, and I think a lot of women no longer have much use for blazers, trench coats, dress pants, etc.
text:I tend to agree. I think most women today who have office jobs would probably actually feel overdressed in a fitted blazer, not to mention outside of the office. I personally own a black blazer that I think I've worn to two interviews, and that's about it.  In fact, I think I would just update the list to replace a blazer with some sort of cardigan. I feel they fit in with a wider range of styles than a fitted blazer does at this point.	labels:Its jeans and t-shirts at my job. Maybe... someone wears a polo. Higher-ups dress more professional, though. Wearing even business casual can feel like one is overdressed.	episode_done:True
text:The RealReal Alleges Chanel is Maintaining a “Monopoly” With the Help of Big-Name Retailers, Publishers in New Filing	labels:> Chanel became concerned that its classic flap handbag was being carried by too many people ‘without style'  LMAOOO this is this is elitist pete level of gatekeeping.
text:Also imagine dunking on yourself that hard  "People without style like our products" is another read of their statement, basically.	labels:It's not saying that, but, it isn't too far removed. My takeaway is more that "our products aren't desirable enough on their own to maintain secondhand/resale value, we have to artificially increase demand to synthesize an air of exclusivity".   It's really not unqiue to Chanel as a luxury/elite product producer, but they are more notable than other designers in the (silly) lengths they go to protect their brand image. That said, I'm not a lawyer, and I kinda doubt they are a monopoly, so I guess we'll have to see	episode_done:True

text:What are your tips for dressing a big chest!	labels:My chest isn’t massive, but I have had some fit issues with clothes before, where the shirt is really tight around the chest but way too loose at the waist. Never a good look. My best tip for that is to buy shirts in a larger size that fits your chest, then tailor in at the waist. It’s relatively simple so you can learn to do it yourself and save lots of tailoring costs!	episode_done:True
text:Coveteur: An Ode to the Striped Shirt	labels:I have...entirely too many striped shirts.   I am a sucker for them. I was always told to wear vertical stripes because it would make me look slim. Growing up, I was a beanpole. no boobs, no hips, just enormous feet. So I started dabbling in horizontal stripes to make me look a little less scrawny.   then in my 20's I got my boobs done. those horizontal stripes now made the new boobs look absolutely vulgar and *I loved it*. I still do.  wide horizontal stripes are great for toning them down, thinner horizontal stripes really bring out the wow factor. I have a few tops that are a little baggier, with stripes, and I find that those are the perfect way to wear a casual tee while still being like LOOK SHE HAS A SHAPE!	episode_done:True

text:I agree plenty of stuff is marked up and overpriced. I would never base my decision solely on whether or not it originally retailed higher.

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:My handknit sweaters look great and have lasted much longer than my store bought sweaters.

text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:Haha I definitely run into this same issue! I tend to associate items really strongly with the context in which I got them, and personally feel weird reselling gifts, so donations or trash bin it is for me.   I usually donate jewelry (depending on the piece) to organizations that specifically help people with interview/business-wear or prom outfits. I’ve also donated gifted jewelry or suitcases to women’s shelters before.
text:I feel that! I agree, I like the idea of donating to someone who wouldn't otherwise have pieces like that. I think my main concern with donating is that it runs the risk of just being resold anyways at a thrift store, and likely not for what the item is worth.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Fashion Grave Robbing	labels:Cold shoulder tops. I hated them when they first came out, and my hatred has only grown. I was searching through tops the other day on some big site (maybe Nordstrom?) and there were cold shoulder tops STILL FOR SALE and my mind was blown.   Oh and I also hate the tops that are split at the back. I’m sick of seeing them everywhere. At first I thought I liked it, but it turns out I don’t! I hate any sort of cut out in anything, apparently.

text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:I taught my mom to have a little more fun, and to spoil herself. My mom has great style, but we live in the Midwest and looking at older photos of her I know later took on a sort of “mom” approach to style-to put it nicely, she likes good clothes, but appreciates them on other people. I have lots of photos of her in the 80s with amazing hats, gloves, and other things that had so much presence. I work in fashion so my goal is always to nudge her a bit so that she can feel like the center of attention, but not so far as to make her uncomfortable. This means buying nice and ornate little accessories for her, or introducing her to trends she might not know are age appropriate and easy to find at a good price. Last year I got her a 3/4 length sleeve top in navy from Jcrew with little ostrich feathers on the sleeves, and it was understated enough that it allowed her to feel like a celebrity wearing it, and it seemed to suit her. It BLEW HER MIND! This year she asked for a red clutch, and was afraid it was too specific. I promised that I would search high and low to find something perfect. There is literally no place I won’t go to find something specific if she wants it, and I often know where to look and have my eyes open all year long. I want her to feel special because she is the only reason that I do.	episode_done:True

text:What are the Luxury IT Bags right now? And which ones are actually worth the $?	labels:The #1 It bag right now is the Prada Re-Edition. Because of that, you will be seeing a lot of nylon and half-moon shaped shoulder bags over the next few months. Bag trends go in and out pretty quickly, so it is much more important to pick one that you really love (especially when you are dropping that kind of money!). The Dior Saddle Bag is an older bag style that they brought back in and saw a huge resurgence in popularity. It's not as trendy as it was when they reintroduced it, but it looks pretty likely to stick around as a staple style for the brand. Dior has been getting more expensive recently. The price doesn't really reflect the quality (the quality is just as nice as many luxury brands with lower price points), so you are really paying for the brand.
text:Yeah you’re right the Prada is everywhere but I’m really not a fan of it! It’s just so small. I think you’re right about the saddle bag too, not worth the cost especially for such an impractical shape! But it does look awesome with the various Dior straps	labels:Dior definitely knows what they are doing with the guitar straps! Which is why they charge $1k+ just for the strap on top of a $3.3k+ bag! If you want your bag to be relatively timeless, you can invest in something like a Lady Dior or Chanel Classic Flap, or opt for a more simple style bag from most any of the major brands. But if your style is more edgy and youthful like the Saddle Bag love suggests, you might just want to get what makes you feel happiest and what is most practical for your lifestyle and budget, regardless of what people are wearing at this exact moment in fashion.

text:What would you wear to elope during a pandemic?	labels:I would still wear a wedding dress. I sort of eloped and the airlines lost my wedding dress for 5 days and I got married in a sundress. It's been 11 years and I'm still sad about it. We always said we'd go back and have a do-over, but things happened and life continues to happen and I'll never get to run around Vegas in my wedding dress. I have worn it any chance I get though! Holiday parties or other random events. People are always weird about it "um. Is that a wedding dress?" Me: hell yeah ! I love my wedding dress. I'm gonna wear it as long as I can! I feel like a mother fucking princess in it!" Also, I'm happy I work hard to stay fit enough to still fit into it. Haha. I bought it on Craigslist for $400. I love it. I will continue to wear it as much as possible without any cares because I feel good in it.   That being said. Wear what you feel best in! If it's a wedding dress or sweat pants. YOLO it with all your confidence.	episode_done:True

text:Ordered from Shoe The Bear (rant, experience in post)	labels:Sorry, this isn't directly helpful, but I've ordered from Shoe The Bear two or three times. The first time I kept the boots (suede chelseas) and they were uncomfortable and never broke in, but did very soon expand to way outside the size of my feet despite following their guidelines and ordering what was eventually 2 sizes below my normal size (having ordered multiples to test) leaving my feet to flop about at the heel and yet rub on my toes to the point of leaving red and slightly blistered skin.  Each time after that I've sent them back, based both on sizing and the appearance of quality. I would never buy them at the full prices they charge based on the workmanship and materials they use, and even on sale, they are quite sneaky about how returns work - they put it out loudly that they include a return label, but you have to dig to note that that return label is then deducted from the cost of your refund, and it's not cheap.   The last time I did this, I couldn't use the return label at the post office, even though the website said I could, so I paid for my own postage. When they did refund me, not only had they still tried to charge me for usage of the label, but they appeared to have applied it twice. I contacted the customer support to query this, at which point they asked me if I had used the return label, which A) they should really know at that point, and B) wouldn't have explained the extra charge anyway. They said they would refund it and I should see it in my account sometime that week (it was on a Monday). Guess what? No refund - I had to contact them *again* the following Wednesday to remind them, and only then were the accounts department finally moved to action.   Good deal on sale or not, I would never order from Shoe The Bear again.
text:Their customer service SUCKS.  They're not even responding to my last e-mail of asking why they're accusing me of treating the leather myself and if they're going to anything to assist me considering I'm a repeat buyer. I sent them the e-mail within minutes of recieving the package and do not even have any knowledge on treating leather.  Thanks for sharing your story.  Hopefully potential buyers see my post and yours when searchinf for Shoe The Bear on Google.  It sucks I spoke really highly of them previously on Reddit and to friends being like "This company from Portugal is the shit, check them out".  Fuck this company.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:Yeah, I wear dresses probably like 80-90% of the time, I think, and usually if I'm not wearing a dress then I'm wearing a skirt! For me it's just that it's easier to find dresses and skirts that fit better off the rack so they need a lot less tailoring, whereas jeans and trousers need a lot of tailoring for me and it gets expensive and time-consuming.  I have a lot of jumpers because I often wear them over a dress in autumn/winter, but otherwise my selection of tops is woefully pitiful haha. I quite like a nice lightweight camisole tucked into shorts or a skirt in summer though! But generally I don't wear a lot of separates (easier to coordinate that way too 😆).	episode_done:True

Think vintage made in USA items made using natural fabrics (cotton, wool, cashmere). Sometimes they are made with older, odd, or boxy fits that are slightly off. Which leads me to the diminishing returns of...   Tailoring and Alterations (in relation to fit): These costs can add up quickly - and sometimes the end result will not be satisfactory.  Simple alterations like taking in the waist or sleeves usually work out - but major surgery with jacket shoulders and major pant adjustments usually are not worth the effort.    It's ok to pass on a sale or leave an item on the rack if you know the fit or alterations won't work out for you. On the other hand, it can be worth the extra $ to purchase something if it fits very well off-the-rack.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 03	labels:I was wondering if anyone had any athletic/lounge shorts suggestions that are really comfortable? I’ve tried the Chubbies gym mesh  5” shorts but they aren’t comfortable at all IMO because the crotch area is really tight. I also tried the HiSkyWin brand 7” athletic shorts on amazon (had really good reviews) but the liner and fit is still not very comfy. I keep reverting back to my baggy gym shorts that are almost below the knee when I leave the house. Any feedback is appreciated!	episode_done:True
text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:Since quarantine I’ve been WFH and not going out socially. So, the grocery store now gets my best looks and I really hope Kathy at the register enjoys my new booties as much as I enjoy wearing them for once!  In general, it’s better to be overdressed than underdressed. I don’t normally show off my fits at the grocery store, but desperate times call for desperate measures!
text:My husband has a little outpatient procedure under light sedative at the hospital. I need to go with him because he’s going to be a bit zoinked out. Now, do I care about going to a place where Covid is rife and full of vulnerable people? Do I care that my husband’s about to undergo a not fun test? Yes, I do. But to my shame, after 5 weeks inside and 9 more predicted to come (UK) I am mostly thinking about  what I am going to wear. I AM GOING OUT! Fake fur, big red shoes, velvet, leopard and sequins are firm candidates. BUT I doubt I will follow through because I am afraid it will show a degree of carelessness and disrespect to hospital workers and patients. So it will be comfy and neutral, but it’s fine because I AM GOING OUT!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:While we can't say for certain: is it possible that the second experience is the correct one? A lot of men believe that they need a fully custom suit to fit well, but in actuality for most body types the patterns are rather close. If an OTR size with alterations would look great, paying for MTM is a waste of money. I've done MTM suits and bought OTR suits and have generally found that getting OTR with alterations is a faster way to a well fitting suit than the low to mid level MTM stuff we're talking about here. I've done Indochino MTM which was generally a mess and a tuxedo from Black Lapel which eventually worked out well, following one full remake and $100 of local alterations (that they paid for). My OTR blue line suits from SS fit great after alterations.
text:I know this is hard to do, but I really think men committed to getting a great fitting suit within a reasonable price need to try on several OTR companies and stick with the one whose cuts fits the best with the least needed alterations. I've done that with SS; their Havana and Lazio cuts fit me perfectly, and I only need to get the pants hemmed.  Unlike Spier & Mackay for me, whose $199 liquidation suit needed $240 of tailoring in NYC. At that price, plus the extra slight risk of returns since they're in Canada, I'd rather stick with SS despite them lacking in more conservative fabrics when compared with Spier. But for some people, Spier fits them the best, whereas SS is too slim.	labels:Agree 100%. Most of the go-to's offer free exchanges as long as it's your first suit, so it's not at hard as it seems. At least based on my experience, I had much better lucky buying decent fitting OTR suits and turning them into well-fitting ones than sending my measurements out into the ether.	episode_done:True
text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:It's like visual art - things that make a great statement or important artistic point in a gallery are  not necessarily going to be what you want to hang in your home where you see it every day. Theatre that makes you think about the world differently might not be the ocr you put on for a roadtrip. Some art lives in a different space than we live in everyday and sometimes that's more elevated but also less accessible.	episode_done:True

text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:My first (meaningful) boyfriend gave me a diamond necklace when i was 18. It was lovely, I wore it constantly, and received many compliments. And then we broke up, as one does with their teen boyfriend, and blah blah blah, after a while I was like, "wtf do I do with this?"  I was *never* going to wear it again and selling it felt a little mercenary.   I ended up giving it as a gift to a girl I babysat/nannied for when she turned 18. It was nice because it was a way for me to give it to someone I cared about and I was able to give her a much nicer gift than I normally would have. And now when I think about that particular piece of jewelry, I don't think about my imploded relationship with my ex, but my relationship that I had with this girl as she grew up.
text:That's a beautiful way to pass on a gift like that! I think if I had that kind of mentor/caretaker relationship with someone I would love to do something similar. Good on you!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 17, 2020	labels:I just got the new Feng Chen Wang x Converse CT70's at my normal CT70 size (US 10). I'm kinda anxious that they look like clown shoes on me lol. What anxiety I've had from wearing normal chucks have doubled with this pair.   Here's some pictures and videos of me wearing said pair. Is there such a difference between this pair and my other shoes? And yeah, I'll probably exclusively wear this with wide pants. I'm aware slimmer pants just fuck up the silhouette way too much.  Height is 173 cm. Average build, around 155lbs or so.
text:I think the chunk of the FCW Cons is the appeal in that they can be worn to balance a chunky, wider silhouette on top. If you wear them with a slim shirt and slim pants they’ll look like clown shoes, but if you relaxed the shirt and (more importantly) relaxed the pants then it’ll all come into proportion	labels:I figured that's the case. I guess it's finally time to cop more relaxed-fitting clothes, been wanting to buy more anyway. Thanks!	episode_done:True

text:How have you been doing your shopping since Covid?	labels:I normally buy almost everything thrift. However,  even though the lockdowns have lifted, thrift  stores are keeping the change rooms closed. I won't buy anything used if I can't try it on.   I was on a no buy kick but now that more witchy librarian looks (dark academia) are showing up in stores, I've been on a little spending spree online, to stock up before it goes off trend again.

text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:Congratulations, man! I cannot express how much better I feel now that I’ve dropped weight; I’m sure you feel the same way.   I really just turned what was normal normal fit and maybe a half-size big to more of a tailored look and the actual, correct size.   I’ve also felt more confident which has led to slightly different looks. I’ve always been a little more of a conservative dresser but now I’m incorporating a few more styles into the wardrobe. Really nothing major but a few tweaks that I really love.   Side note: it is super frustrating that tailored clothes look off as soon as you lose weight. I had to completely rebuild my formal wardrobe.	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Hitting up thrift stores to experiment with new looks is an easy entry point for a lot of people. I'm sorry your mom talked you into returning things you were excited about! That's a bummer.  I try to remind myself that realistically no one will remember what I wore. Or at least they won't spend time thinking about it. If I put together an outfit outside my comfort zone, I can take it off at the end of the day and it's like it never even happened. Same way makeup washes off, clothes come off in an instant too. The stakes aren't as high as they feel.  I used to feel boxed in by what I describe as "school picture day mentality," meaning I felt that every outfit had to be *just right*. It had to represent me perfectly as if that's how I would be preserved in other people's minds forever. But that's so goofy, idk why I thought that. Every day is a new opportunity and every outfit is temporary. I hope you can have fun and tap into your confidence!	episode_done:True

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I got my first fancy bag after calling off my wedding lol I figured it cost around the same amount as the dress I wouldn’t ever wear so why not? The woman at the LV store thought I was on drugs ... “are you celebrating something?” And I’m like as a matter of fact, yes, yes I am. I just lost a ton of money on a wedding but I dodged a bullet and left that POS. All she said was “well you can always make more money” anyway, I’m getting a Chanel bag for my next milestone birthday. Not sure which one but it’s gonna happen soon.
text:Kind working off of this premise, my mother always emphasized that a expensive designer purchase should be attached to a goal or important milestone. Ever since high-school I wanted a designer bag, and as soon as it become possible for me to buy one with my own money I had a goal in mind. I had been worked as a contracted worker for 2 years and was aiming to get a stable full time job. When it finally happened I gave myself the go ahead to purchase a bag and waited till I found one that I liked and fit my lifestyle (Small Chanel Gabrielle).	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:I feel the same. My idealized self wears much more tailored and polished clothing (I really love Dearly Bethanys style). The reality is that I work as a social worker for former foster youth where I prefer to look relatable and not overly polished or “adult.” Ive definitely gotten comments from my clients that my style is “different” or “unique.” I live in a very rural and small community so fashion isn’t the highest priority here. I wear jeans and solid colored tee shirts, blouses or sweaters. I think I experiment with silhouettes to an extent- purchasing different denim styles like cropped wide leg, straight leg, mom jeans, etc. and shoes: I have a few pairs of mules, Veja sneakers, Nisolo boots... so things that are understated but I think still look more polished. I can’t really go too crazy with my footwear and outfits though...for example, last week I was in a home and an unrecognizable bug crawled up (and fell out) my pant leg. Sometimes that places I go into are not very clean and I just don’t know what I may be stepping in. I don’t really have any suggestions. Just wanted to say I relate. I’ve almost quit buying clothes for my fantasy wardrobe - but sometimes an item just catches my eye and I can’t pass it up even if I don’t have many places to wear it.	episode_done:True
text:What are novelty leather keyrings/keychains for? How do you use them?	labels:Just a PSA for anyone who keeps them on the same key ring as your car key.   My locksmith gather told me that heavy key rings or chains or lots and lots of keys attached to a key you put in your car ignition causes the ignition to wear out quicker and require replacement.  Not a problem in the push button cars these days but something to think about if you regularly drive a car that isn't.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 01, 2021	labels:You guys I had my baby yesterday! She is the sweetest, most precious, most important thing to me ever and I’m so happy.

text:More Men Reach for Sewing Machines	labels:Learning to sew darts, hem trousers, bring in trouser legs, and wastebands, have been some of the biggest savers of my favourite items and keeping up with the fluctuations of weight and style that come with life.        Not to mention jeans repair, crotch on my nudies is more darning than original fabric now. Worn in look on a reliable pair of jeans that fit nicely is hard to imitate.      It's wierd how the simple home repair craft has been labeled un-manly, despite most of those paragons of manliness people put on pedestals singing the virtues of repairing objects used every day.
text:Congrats on being able to darn yourself. That's something I need to practice.  I too find it strange that sewing crafts have been deemed "unmanly." I learned how to sew (as well as cross-stitch, latch hook, needlepoint, and a bunch of other thread crafts; not to mention ironing too) when I was really little. I think its more "manly" to be able to take care of your own wardrobe (amongst other "feminine" household tasks) than it is to have to get someone else to do it for you.  Plus, some of my favorite clothing label and/or designers are men.	labels:It's a shame that more men aren't into it! I made so many toys for myself as a kid by hand and eventually machine sewing, I still have them kicking around. Nothing adds more sentimental value than making/fixing something yourself.	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:I have worked in casual places for the last few jobs now, and my motto is dress up but add one casual thing to dress it down or only have one dressy element per outfit.  That might mean wearing some sneakers with your fave dress. Wear your fancy skirt with a t-shirt or sweatshirt instead of a blouse. If you want to wear a blazer - make it a fun color, fun pattern, or softer less structured fabric. You wear your fancy trousers with a graphic tee and a jean jacket/leather jacket/chore jacket. You wear some vintage wash mom jeans with a t-shirt/boxy sweater and heels (or fancy boots).  This gives you one foot in casual, but gives you space to wear your favorites. And you do not feel ridiculously overdresses when your peers are wearing leggings and flannel shirts.  You also learn to go with it, and everyone thinks you are a dress up person.  These are my tips as a dressy person who works in casual Bay Area tech land.  And I'll chime in on the no crop tops if skin is visible! Not appropriate (although I know dress codes are loosening and people are doing it.... but it is a bad idea!).	episode_done:True

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I have a similar style and I like adding 1-2 accessories to a basic outfit. My favorite is scarves! Not only can they be cute and lightweight, they can also be cute and big and cozy, like you’re wearing a blanket all day but it’s socially acceptable. Other accessories could be a pair of statement earrings, or a chunky belt, or a long necklace. Sometimes I just try different hair styles to feel like I’m doing something different.	episode_done:True

text:20 Sweaters for Less Than $150, So You Can Achieve Peak Coziness - Esquire.com	labels:In my experience, sweaters are one of the few garments where there's a noticeable increase in quality as you spend more money.  Cheaper sweaters are noticeably thinner (both the threads and the sweater itself), which don't keep you as warm and don't last as long.   The good news is that there are some great options for getting high quality sweaters at low prices if you're willing to shop secondhand. For $150 you can find a gently used sweaters from Ines Meain and IMO that's a much better purchase than most of the cotton and fine merino wool sweaters listed in this article.

text:Do you have any pieces that "should not" work with your body that just seems to work?	labels:I find most rules are trash, and ascribe to shaming women for having different features. If you have broad shoulders, a padded blazer with sharp lines can be such an aesthetic.   I find if you don't believe in fashion rules, there's always a version of something that will work for you.
text:I don't find that at all. I watched a video where 4 women with different body shapes all tried styles that weren't supposed to be flattering. At the end of the video, the opinions hadn't changed.  I do see how that can be limiting & believe that people should wear whatever they want regardless though.	labels:Right sometimes the rules make sense.  I was scrolling through Pinterest and looking at vintagey fashion rules, where they would actually tell fatter women “HEY don’t wear this - you will look like a refrigerator”.  I am all about wearing whatever you want and defying every “rule”. But it’s kind of fucking annoying when I want to dress to look my best and most flattered and every resource out there is saying “YOU GO GIRL you can rock ANYTHING YEAH”. It’s almost an EXCUSE to not have to do any research or have any design knowledge.  Honestly the whole “wear whatever you want” kind of ignores fatter women - like, oh I realize literally everything that’s “in” right now is not flattering on you because it’s made for a straight thin body - but IDC - fend for yourself. But I will hide this thought process behind “THERE ARE NO RULES - you’re beautiful and can wear ANYTHING”.   Tell it like it is. God I wish someone had told me to never wear mom/boyfriend jeans.	episode_done:True

text:MFA Theme WAYWT: Casual Tailoring	labels:This stuff looks great and the idea is nice in theory but after years of attempting this and being “that guy”, it really doesn’t work outside of the largest/most fashionable locales (NYC, London, Paris, Southern Europe, etc.). If you really want to do this and are comfortable with it then by all means go ahead. But from my own experience I did this, and actually did it fairly well after many years, but at the end of the day it stood out too much in real everyday life in a normal town, regardless of how nice the outfit was, and it definitely hurt my social reputation a lot. After toning it down a bit I immediately noticed a difference in how much more positively I was treated by people. You can still dress well, but remember context is key.

text:MFA Wearing Big Coats	labels:My big coat is like a blanket I get to throw on over the rest of my clothes before braving the cold. It's in this album twice.

I find that this way makes the process less overwhelming and is an easy way to incorporate new pieces into your cycle.   You can also try and replicate an outfit that you see on Instagram or even google an “aesthetic” that you’re interested in with what you have in your closet!	episode_done:True
text:How to wear nice casual clothes with a cotton allergy?	labels:Have you tried looking for clothing made out of hemp or linen? You can find casual tshirts and whatnot that are 100% hemp fabric. You can also find causal shoes that are hemp (i have an older pair of Adidas that are 100% hemp fabric uppers). Plenty made out of leather as well.  Do you have a budget for clothes? A lot of companies that use these alternative materials are considered "premium" brands and carry their price tags accordingly.
text:Hey thanks for the suggestion. Sorry, I should have clarified this but I'm also allergic to hemp, linen, wool, and a few more obscure fabrics.  I'm willing to pay as much as needed for this kind of "alternative material" jean.

text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:Your “style” is basically what you are comfortable in. If you are not comfortable browsing the mall for hours then it’s obviously not your thing. Although what we wear do play a factor in how people perceive us we cant really let that affect our style, because at the end of the day literally everyone has their own opinion and you cant make everyone happy. You can only make yourself happy so do whats best for you. Other than that if you do want to experiment with various aesthetics but Don’t wanna spend time at the mall just shop online, or maybe try thrifting (just give everything a wash first).	episode_done:True
text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:It really depends on your area. My favorite in my town in Salvation Army. You really just have to check all the ones in your area out and decide for yourself which has the best selection and prices. Also, figure out which days they do sales (my SA has a color tag for 99 cents on Fridays) and plan trips strategically. I moved from a city to a small town and at first was really disappointed in the thrifting since I rarely find modern brand name items, but the prices are way better, there is lots of great vintage, and I feel like there are less 'trendy' people shopping for the same style of items as I am.   So it also depends what you're looking for!	episode_done:True

I have a pretty well-stocked closet, but I also don't love most of my clothes. I did too much stress shopping because of Covid, and spent more money than I needed to on mostly cheaper clothes, and I made this resolution to help change my mindset about shopping.  With my resolution, I'm not even looking at outlets of other cheaper stores. Yes, it is still hard to stomach spending more money on clothes, but after I've had an item in my cart for a couple days and feel certain that it's the one new thing I want to get for the month, it has been easier for me. It  has also forced me to be much more thoughtful about what I need. We'll see how the rest of the year goes!  I think that thrifting can (obviously) be great, but it can be a lot easier to buy things that you don't love because they are great pieces that just don't work for you.	episode_done:True

text:Feeling self-conscious with changing style around family - anyone relate? Tips?	labels:My family always comments on what I wear if it’s not super casual. My dad will comment if it’s revealing and my mom will comment if it’s fancier than the occasion calls for. And usually this will be done with a sarcastic question like “where are you going?” or similar when obviously I am not going anywhere because we are quarantined, and heaven forbid I decide to put on a nice outfit to boost my mood. I’m lucky that my family is at least a real-pants-in-quarantine family. If I couldn’t even wear jeans without getting a comment, I’d be sad.	episode_done:True

text:what are your fashion flaws?	labels:I simultaneously buy things I like regardless of having the occasion to wear them and also have a tendency to "save the good stuff" for these nonexistent occasions, which has resulted in a practical overabundance of clothes that are just a little too dressy for my lifestyle, and that this year I have literally had no reason whatsoever to touch...  I also don't know if it's just me but I'm constantly hooking parts of my clothing (belt loops esp) on cabinet handles?

Swap in button up shirts for tees and/or layer under sweaters/sweatshirts, non tailored jacket, overshirt, etc.  2. Swap in trousers for chinos or denim. Knit, sweatshirt, tee, polo, hoody, etc for the top. 3. Button up shirt and trouser. Layer with knit, sweatshirt, non tailored jacket, overshirt, even a hoody. 4. Jacket with denim. Non button up shirt top (knit, sweatshirt, polo, clean solid tee) 5. 4 but with a button up shirt 6. Jacket and odd trouser (odd meaning it's not a suit). Non button up shirt top. 7. Jacket, button up shirt, odd trouser. 8. Suit and non button up shirt top. Could be tied with 7 if the suit is casual enough.	episode_done:True

I was just daydreaming of where to find more options on another tab actually.. I'm really short though so I've been shopping in the little boys section.

text:Rick Owens Wearing Rick Owens	labels:I don't own a single piece of his clothing, and I probably never will, but one of the quotes attributed to him that really stuck with me when I first started browsing mfa was "No outfit is going to make you look or feel as good as having a fit body. Buy less clothing and go to the gym instead." He was right.
text:That's probably the single most recognizable quote of his outside diehard avant-garde fashion circles. It needs some contextualizing though. Like everything else, you have to consider where the speaker is coming from. Rick is addicted to working out. He's on steroids. His addiction is understandable because before he got into working out he was doing drugs and was, by his own admission, on a very unhealthy path. His wife got him into working out instead. But he's effectively swapped one addiction for another. Working out is generally one of the best things you can do for your health, but not when you're pushing 60 and regularly taking steroids. When it comes to that Rick quote, it's worth knowing that he's not speaking from a well-balanced position.  All that is to say, the general spirit of the quote is solid advice. But Rick Owens is probably not a good authority on moderation, which as with all activities, should be a part of your workout routine.	labels:I really appreciate you offering this perspective and context	episode_done:True
text:Review: Church's McPherson Brogue Derbies with Commando Soles	labels:Great review!  Totally agree re: church's, I've got a pair of their cornwood (Chunky Chelsea boots) which I got around 40% off last year and they're brilliant, they're a tumbled leather so have a softer grain to the embossed calf but have held up to my abuse brilliantly. I've noticed that Church's are excellent at the clicking process and only the highest quality hides make it in (in my experience, they're the only brand I've never seen any inconsistencies in leather quality from).   My only complaint is the last (103 as opposed the the 133 on yours), it looks amazing but leaves me swimming at the heel with a relatively stubby toebox.  I agree too about C&J, their scotch grain is softer (and I'd argue maybe a little *finer*) than church's. But Church's firmer leather is not a bad thing for country shoes and is more in line with the Zug grain you see from Trickers.

I intend to wear them with white pointy toe leather ballerinas or pumps and with a matching fitted cardigan. Colors: all the blues, reds, whites and aquas for me. And I want pockets in my dresses.   Screw this current oversized look that looks horrific on me. Screw these horrific washed out colors. I am a woman and want to feel like one.

text:Inspo Album: Vintage Wool Sweaters Need Good, Loving Homes	labels:Awesome that they are still around. A testament to the durability and quality of real wool. I’m 75, so this kind of sweater was all we had to stay warm in the winter when we were young. I knitted quite a few as well. When Polar Fleece became available the woolies were less used. However I still appreciate the warmth of a real 100% cashmere or the feel of an Icelandic cardigan knitted in the natural colors . As a knitter I love to see the hard work in a wool garment and the lovely colors that you can find in the older handmade sweaters. They need some care(laundering by hand and blocking to keep their shape, air drying) store away from bugs in the off season ( mothballs!) and kept folded on a shelf or in a drawer not on hangers when in active use. You’ll also find wonderful interesting buttons on the vintage (yikes that’s my childhood years!) items. Lovely sweaters that deserve to be enjoyed by a new generation ❤️ Buying vintage? Look for stains, moth holes, odd shape from improper laundering, missing buttons. These are major faults.
text:I recently bought a very fine-gauge cashmere sweater that was advertised as “in excellent condition”, but when I received it, it had a tiny hole. It was only $10, so I bought a skein of close-enough wool tapestry yarn, separated the yarn into very thin, small strands, and “sewed“ the hole up with an embroidery needle. I'm planning on dyeing the entire sweater black with acid dye, to disguise the slightly-different color of the repair, but it's not very noticeable as is.   I'm not a knitter, so I don't have experience with darning or mending (other than needle-felting tiny tiny holes in already-felted wool). I've had one cashmere sweater for ages, and when it developed holes from constant wear (it wasn’t the best quality) I was able to felt them with matching wool roving.  However, if you know how to Swiss darn (duplicate stitch) you can fix really large holes, provided that you have the right color thread or yarn. If you find a sweater that you absolutely love but it has holes, you can also drop it off or mail it to a repair service to be fixed (but it is pricey).	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:You don't have to make your own clothes, but learning to do some basic repairs (reattaching buttons, patching a small hole or fixing a split seam with needle and thread, maybe using a sweater shaver/depiller or waterproofing your leather shoes) can be really helpful in making things last and look nice longer - so maybe your 2 pound shirt lasts 3 years instead of 2, which means you don't need to buy as many in the long run.	episode_done:True

That’s what I can remember.

Don't spend much time, effort, and money until you see how you really feel after at least a year of seasons. Maybe you want warmer stuff than you thought you would, or realize you should invest in nicer socks, or discover you don't actually like turtlenecks, or shift to a different style when you're surrounded by a new area's vibe.

text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:A huge chunk of my wardrobe is built out from Amazon. I add everything to a list, and wait until Amazon's algorithms decide they need to sell it for $6. They also offer Tall sizes on quite a lot of items, which is great for having sleeves that fit.  Uniqlo for jeans, Amazon's Peak Velocity brand for Tshirts, and Goodthreads for everything else is what I would do if I had to start from Scratch.  If there's a certain type of item your looking for, feel free to ask for recommendations and I can send you a link to what I'd look at.
text:Thanks for sharing!   Items I'm looking for:  \- White sneakers - preferably leather   \- Jeans - Slim/skinny light blue, navy, black   \- Jackets - from bomber jackets to other non-bomber kinds  \- Sweaters or sweatshirts I can layer under my jacket  \- Long sleeve shirts/henleys  \- boots   If you've come across any of these on amazon that you think may be decent purchase I'd love to check it out	labels:Amazon has pretty decent t-shirts and sweatshirts (not knit sweaters!) that you can get for a good price. You can also buy some decent quality sneakers from Amazon too, just make sure it's from a reputable seller and from a recognized shoe brand (Adidas/New Balance/etc.).  &#x200B;  However, for stuff like jeans, jackets, boots, and knitwear, I'd look elsewhere. I've bought jeans from Amazon in the past that came with low-quality buttons and ripped after 2 months of wear, so I don't think the quality is quite there. My recommendation would be to search on places like Uniqlo/Carhartt/Champion or even thrift stores to get better quality jeans/jackets/knitwear that can last you a lot longer than whatever you'd find on Amazon for a comparable price.
text:Yeah - I wouldn't skimp on denim and footwear. A nice pair of boots that will last years and grow patina, same with denim fades. You can skimp a bit on the rest -    for example today I'm wearing: $300 Samurai Jeans, $x00 boots, $x00 vintage watch - but paired with an $8 Hanes cotton/poly sweatshirt from amazon and $5 generic khaki hat from walmart.	labels:As much as I love denim, $300 for a pair vs a brand like Uniqlo that you can get for $49 is absurd to me.

text:Haha yeah - I will admit that there were a few periods where I was unable to wear them frequently. I have actually lost weight after purchasing them 5 years ago, and the relaxed fit probably reduced any chance for common crotch blowouts. Other than that, I just wear them like jeans.

text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Hi! Former stylist.  1) Pay attention to the fit of things and figure out what cuts and shapes look good on you. Paper bag pants and some joggers have similar fits. Some mini skirts and shorts hit the same place on your legs and can have the same waist height. Find your sweet spot and don’t be afraid to buy multiple things in silhouettes that work for you.   2) Get some statement pieces that you would die for. If you are wearing a pair of jeans that fit well and a t-shit purchased within the past 3 years with some awesome earrings you going to look and feel great. If you are wearing an amazing dress and simple white sneakers you are going to look and feel great. Don’t overthink things but try and wear at LEAST one piece you are excited about at a time.   3) Don’t buy things just cause they are on sale, you saw your friend wearing it, or you feel like you “need” something in your wardrobe. You should love everything in your closet in its own special way unless it’s workwear and you hate your dress code for work. Something as simple as a T-shirt has so many different factors like cut, material, neckline, sleeve length. Purchase what feels good and don’t bother with the rest.

text:I know what you mean and I agree. I don't particularly like the tone of the article, and the man himself is defensive in his instagram bio:   > I am just a straight, happily married guy that loves Porsches, beautiful women and incorporating high heels and skirts into my daily wardrobe.   In other words, "I like cars and hot women, so I'm manly. I just happen to like women's clothes too. But really, I'm manly." It reads like a masc gay guy trying to distance himself from "the fems".   Despite all of that, considering where most of the western world is regarding gender roles and expression, I think highlighting something like this is important because you don't typically see successful corporate boomer men in very obvious womenswear, especially at work.

text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I have a teal suit that is similar in brightness to your pink one. Some tops that would work/that I think work with my suit are: - white/cream button down - white/cream turtleneck - turtleneck or mock neck in a shade lighter or darker than the suit for a monochrome look - silver (for mine) / rose gold (for yours) colour camisole or shoes  - lacy bodysuit + heels - graphic tee + sneaker for a casual streetwear look (I don’t really like wearing sneakers with suits but lots of people like the look)  You can also simply wear the pieces separately!! I tend to wear my blazer a lot more than my pants.	episode_done:True
text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I've written about this before, but as someone who is 5'2 on a good day, I have stopped giving a shit about looking "longer and leaner."  In fact, I reject the idea that I should want to look taller. Maybe all those 5'7 women should be taking advice on how to make their legs look as stubby as mine. <--Obviously a joke but to make a point. How stupid is it that I should feel like my natural body is something to correct?  I'm an old woman, lol, and over the course of my life I have never found that my stubby legs (that I was once self-conscious about) have kept me from career advancement or from finding people who thought I was beautiful and wanted to have sex with me, so what's the freaking problem?  Fuck conventional figure flattery.  That being said, of course there are things I think look better on me than other things and I tend to wear the things I think look better in ways I think look better most of the time.  Except when the comfort or beauty of a garment is so outstanding it overrules that.  Thanks for coming to my TED talk.  There are cookies on the table in the back.
text:Best comment here.  But really, I can just head my mom telling me that my outfit is “figure flattering” as the greatest compliment...  I used to abide by that idea 100 percent when I had no confidence and felt I needed to try to look as skinny as possible - because that’s what figure flattering means. F that. I still pick out clothes I like on my body, but don’t worry about it as much if it doesn’t elongate my legs but it’s a kickass piece!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:So far I've done pretty well just putting my things in mesh laundry bags and washing them on the delicate cycle in the machine, then air drying them.  That being said, we have a machine that was chosen specifically because it had a very good delicate cycle, and most of my pieces weren't terribly expensive to begin with. The tag may say hand wash only, but I'm not too worried about polyester.  For things I really really love and for my bras, I do actually hand wash them, and I'd probably do the same if I were to make a really expensive purchase or if I were handling an extra delicate fabric.	episode_done:True
text:Dress Sneakers Are Alarmingly Popular	labels:I also think it's on the rather unfortunate looking side... counterpoint: I know a surprising amount of people who have to wear dress shoes for professional reasons... but comfortable sneakers for health/pain reasons... this caters to them and after several have told me in how much pain they are I don't give a hoot anymore. Let Cole Haan/whoever do their thing.  Edit: this is not counting people I know who may have very different requirements throughout a workday/ work trip and may not want to pack/ bring several shoes and are in a constant haste.
text:I have a medical condition and can’t comfortable wear heels. It’s...such a pain in the ass. Even the sneakers in this article all have a non-apparent heel on the inside of the shoe.

Something cozy enough to set up shop on your couch in, that won't break on the first scoot, actually keep your arms warm.   In loungewear there's apparently four types with no middle ground: For mothers-formerly-known-as-women,  for girls, for seduction purposes only, and Jeff Lebowski.
text:Indigo Chapters actually has fantastic lounge wear despite (or maybe because?) they’re a bookstore! It might be Canada only though?

Usually it’s jeans and a tee with some black biker boots or faux snakeskin trainers, plus some fun jewellery - I recently got some small, silver, spiked hoops which I love.

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:Honestly, I feel like the best way to be sustainable is to just buy less. I try not to buy much and attempt to not buy from companies that seem particularly egregious, and I do thrift, but I’m also still paying off student loans and hardly raking in the cash.  Is it better to buy your one shirt every 3 years from a sustainable brand that treats its workers well? For sure! But I’m typing this my iPhone with a Macbook in front of me and to be honest, so are a lot of people that claim to only shop ethically. Do what you can, absolutely, but let’s not let perfect be the enemy of good.
text:Absolutely!! I do what I can, but mostly I just try to buy less because even cheap clothes are a huge portion of my income. If your budget is such that a $50 jacket is already a big purchase you're only doing every few years and a $900 jacket is impossible, it's ok to buy the cheap version and keep yourself warm.	labels:1000%! I have a parka from American Eagle that I got in high school (I graduated 11 years ago...) that I still wear every winter. Was it sustainably and ethically made? Likely not, but thanks to that $70 purchase I’ve avoided buying who knows how many new coats.	episode_done:True

text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:I once got the tip to put everything in your closet with the open part of your hanger hook facing out. Then, when you wear something, turn that hanger the right side out (i.e. round side of the hook facing out). Set a time period that you want to revisit cleaning your closet (i.e. a season/year etc) and after that time period donate or throw out everything that still has the hook turned in. Similarly, pack all the things you aren't sure if you want to keep into a box and set a time frame. If you find yourself wanting to wear something in that box, take it out. At the end of the time-frame, donate what's still there (especially if you forgot that item existed).  Recently due to COVID, I moved across back the country so I had to fit my closet into suitcases. That involved donating a lot of things that are perfectly nice and wearable but what I had to admit to myself that 1)I actually never wore in the 3 years I lived there and 2) didn't miss in the few months that I was living without them (I was living out of a carry on when I got unexpectedly stuck back home).  In terms of the never throw anything out, perhaps donate it to  a charity that's helps dress the less fortunate for work? They're definitely pieces that others will love.
text:Yep, this. I used to hesitate to donate "perfectly good" clothes (ones that weren't ill-fitted, out of fashion, or ill-suited for my lifestyle) because I was so afraid I'd regret it - like one day I'd find the "perfect outfit combination" for that item.   I've learned that 99% of the time, you won't even remember what you donated after a few weeks. But also... yeah, there are a few items I regret giving away. It happens, and it's okay: you'll have a day or two of "ah damn, I should have kept that", and then you move on. It's better to just make the decision to donate and feel less anxious about your wardrobe size overall.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:2020 in Hindsight: A Year in Fashion — Die, Workwear!	labels:Athleisure’s popularity was already sky-high. I think this cemented it’s status as the new status-quo.

text:This an opinion that can easily be applied to every way to dress, but I feel like most people don't do athleisure well or interestingly. I don't expect it from an average joe but influencers need to do more than logos and prints.   What I like most about the basics of MFA is that you don't need to be a model to look good in clothes.

text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:NGL you can make some decent fits with amazon/target/walmart tier items - but they are not very good quality and not very good for the environment or workers.

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I’m queer and get read as straight a lot, so clothing is a tool, albeit one I don’t always feel comfortable using.  The other thing for me is that I sometimes feel like my body is incompatible with queer fashion? I’m pretty fortunate to have a relatively “desirable” body, but I’m short and top-heavy, so I feel like the androgynous queer outfits I like are meant for people much more willowy than I am, the femme-er stuff is more feminine than I feel comfortable with, and the more masc stuff is too masc for me. So I default to just whatever I have that I like, which tends to read as straight, if not quite conventionally feminine and sort of sweater-heavy. And when I’ve leaned into what feels like queer fashion to me, other people tend not to read it that way.  Anyways this was kind of long but to actually answer your questions:  1) Yes I do, though at this point mostly in the form of jewelry and more recently hair 2) Sometimes it means signaling and sometimes it means wearing clothes that (joyously?)  reflect your authentic self even in defiance of cultural norms. I would probably be better off if I figured out which definition I want to define myself with  3) IMO sometimes the stereotypes are a way to signal because the media denies us representation and sometimes they exist because of the representation the media gives us. For people my age (20s) I think it’s more the latter  4) I always feel pressure to present gayer. I think impostor syndrome is common in minority groups and when the thing that makes you different isn’t immediately visible, it’s natural to want to either bury it or lean in and use it as a shield or a signal. I haven’t figured out what that means for me in practice, but the urge is there.	episode_done:True

text:A Bespoke Shirtmaker On How A Shirt Should Fit	labels:Sleeves are my eternal issue with shirts, and why for so long I opted for short sleeve shirts. So often with RTW shirts the cuffs are so big they start sliding down my hand (looking at you, Charles Tyrwhitt). If they have a second button quite often it makes a dip in a bit rather than the complete circle and often still goes down my hand enough that the cuff bends when I move my hands. So many RTW shirts also have their sleeves a bit too short for me (kind of acceptable considering overly large cuffs). Some end up being too tight in the upper sleeve, painfully cutting into my arms if I reach forward (looking at you again, Charles Tyrwhitt) no matter the size. I don't remember shirts doing this in the past so perhaps an issue since I gained weight.	episode_done:True

text:How to Combat Fashion Apathy?	labels:I was experiencing the same problem especially during the confinement. I decided to push myself to get dressed even put make up on to work from home. The first days felt like a chore then it started bringing my appetite for style back.   On another note, I’m 28 and I can feel the need for comfort. What I did was to invest on nice quality comfortable pieces. For example, I bought a pair of cashmere lounge wear it changes your mood instantly to be home and feel so good inside what it used to be sweatpants.	episode_done:True
text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.
text:Well-said! Body type especially has a big impact on how an outfit/style is perceived. Models showing off androgynous styles rarely have curvy body types. Meanwhile, "sexy" looks often go hand-in-hand with curvy. And the "off-duty model" look pretty much requires already looking like a model, otherwise you're just a chick in casual clothes. A beautiful woman looks good in damn near anything, that's why most models are beautiful women, lol.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:I’m going to go one further and say weight also has to do with it. Picture Bella Hadid in mom jeans, dad sneakers, and a tucked-in vintage t-shirt. Trendy and casual, right? Now picture someone like Sandi Toksvig from GBBO, who is 62 and more sturdily built, wearing the same trendy, casual outfit. One of them is going to get called “so stylish” and the other one may be criticized as “frumpy” or “did she even try” or “Walmart fashion.” There’s that quote about how some fashion influencers aren’t stylish, they’re just thin... and I think that saying should also include that they’re young. The more you deviate from the social “ideal,” whether that’s age, weight, or anything else, the less favorably some people will look at whatever you do because of their ageist, fatphobic, etc biases. There are definitely other factors this applies to, such as race, socioeconomic class, having “bad” teeth, and many more, but I’ve already written a novel here and I feel like you guys get the picture.
text:I was about to say! The reason I'm not buying "mom jeans" is because they're going to make me look like exactly that--a frumpy mom, not a cool, hip 20-something who is wearing them ironically and who has a body that looks good even if the clothes aren't flattering.	labels:	episode_done:True

I think an amazing jacket or coat will elevate even the most basic outfit, whether it's a more classic piece, something utilitarian like a puffer jacket or something more extravagant. Personally I think Acne, Chloe and Tibi are brands that make great high-end outerwear in a variety of styles.
text:OMG yes if you just moved to the Midwest you need some outerwear. I am from Wisconsin. It gets cold as fuck here	labels:I didn't just move here but I'm also never prepared for winter here.

text:How has lockdown affected new purchases?	labels:I've sold a few clothes I never really wore. Bought one jumper/sweater, a few thermal layers and soft wool casual trousers for working at home. I can wear sweatpants but it doesn't really get me in the working mood, you know?   My best purchase was probably 2 crossbody bags. A cheap one off Uniqlo and a Peak Design bag off eBay for mega cheaps. Easy to throw on, put a mask in, small water bottle, or whatever when I decide to go for a quick walk-break. And the peak design is slightly padded and larger which helps for cameras or small food shops lol.  I *do* have some stuff I want to buy, but honestly it's more lust than utilitarianism. I have enough shoes and jackets as it is. If I bought something new I'd feel obliged to sell something of mine.

In contrasting colors works best!	episode_done:True
text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:Hi! As a stylist I get this question ALOT. For starters don't get rid of too much before buying replacements. What ends up happening is we get rid of everything without establishing what pieces we actually need.   Start with establishing your personal style. What do your want your closet/style to be? What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping! Now that you have a moodboard and list of things you need you can shop to fin in the gaps and more importantly you can shop with intention!   &#x200B;  I hope that wasn't too much and was helpful haha. I'm always happy to help.

text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:You're kinda making a mountain out of a molehill here. It's not hard to wear colors. Relax about it. It's not a disaster if things clash slightly. You'll be fine. There are no fashion police.   My usual style is I get either brightly colored top or a bright bottom (or a bright dress). The other is relatively neutral to avoid clashing or being overwhelming. This is not a hard and fast rule. There are times when it's fine to break it. It's just a guideline for when I'm in a hurry.  Match saturation and brightness. Burgundy and plum are fine together because both are relatively saturated and dark. Pale pink and lavender work together. Burgundy and lavender are harder because they don't match in saturation and brightness. They aren't impossible to put together and look good but it's a bit harder.  You will not look good in some colors. This is 100% fine. Try things on. Figure out what makes you look awful. You can do this. It doesn't need any special knowledge.
text:In total agreement with this. I kept trying to find my season/palette/whatever using a bunch of systems and always got frustrated. But then I found friskygatos on IG and she was just like... "Hold up colors next to each other and if you like them together, wear it." And her lizard brain concept was super freeing.  Today I wore an all pale pink outfit and got tons of compliments and felt fabulous. I don't even know/care if it was my most flattering color, but just the fact that I looked different than the sea of neutral outfits out there made me happy!	labels:> "Hold up colors next to each other and if you like them together, wear it."  That is literally how I choose outfits and I've been told I look well-put together.	episode_done:True

text:Start small and work your way up! Maybe sew some pillowcases first to learn making straight/even hems and borders (or I guess you can use scrap cloth but that’s not as fun or rewarding) - also maybe kitchen cloths - and then maybe you could try tailoring your outfits. Maybe a pants is slightly too long, or a blouse is too loose - now you can hem up the pants and take in the blouse. Don’t cut cloth until you’re comfortable!! Sewing is the opposite of cooking - you can subtract but never add, while cooking you can always add but not subtract. And even then, when you build up to the stage where you want to cut cloth, maybe try that project on scrap material first lol. Cloth can be expensive, so as pretty as it is... start small.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:I used to work in a funeral home and can tell you that I've seen it all. There will always be the guy that shows up in jeans and a barely nice t shirt, for some reason. There will always be a woman who shows up wearing a skin tight tiny club dress that barely covers her bum, but I guess she thought it was okay because it was black and also a dress? I've seen people wear sheer black clothing like somehow that's supposed to be a shirt. I've also been to funerals with wacky dress codes: everyone wears Hawaiian shirts or the everyone wears a chosen colour associated with the deceased.   But good rules to stick by: Wear clothes that are darker in colour; black, navy, dark green/purple. White dress shirts are appropriate, but having a jacket to go over it is ideal. If it's the summer and it's hot; boys, skip the jacket, but wear a tie and tuck in the shirt and girls, wear a flowy dress, ideally to the knee, with a light shawl or dress pants and a light blouse.   The purpose of the funeral is to pay respect to the deceased, and you want to keep the focus there. Wearing something too bright, or tight, or short, or casual can distract from what's going on and the importance of the funeral. The goal is essentially to blend in, not stand out, because the funeral isn't about anyone other than the deceased, so the attention goes to them. It's one of the few times that I believe everyone should put aside their own ego and allow the day to be about the deceased.
text:>The purpose of the funeral is to pay respect to the deceased  I disagree 100%.  Funerals are for the living, they do nothing for the deceased.  You seem to lay out a lot of guidelines, but honestly, when I die I am expecting and hoping that people just move on with theirs lives and dump my ashes wherever they will be the least amount of trouble.  I have often thought it would be cool to be mixed with potting soil or grass food so my nutrients can help sustain new life.  But please, stop believing that funerals are for paying respects for the deceased, at best they are to help the living say goodbye and gain closure, but in the 18 or so I have attended in my life, they were mostly for people to compare how terrible this is for them in some gigantic, disgusting pissing contest of grief and in general, I consider them a waste of money, more so than a wedding.  I remember the joy my mom gained from my brother's funeral, when it was so expensive for the most basic services that she had to make payments on that funeral for 5 fucking years.  As far as I am concerned, the funeral industry is 100% \* 100% predatory and should have more regulations slapped on it than a Russian drug dealer with a windowless van in an alley.	labels:I’m of similar thinking. I go to funerals to support the person who’s grieving during this hard time, as it’s their way to say goodbye.  I also think that it would be considered taboo not to have a funeral, even though some wish they could actually just not do it. As for the cost of it, it’s absolutely disgusting how expensive it is. I want mine to be as cheap as possible. Maybe getting cremated by a veterinarian would bring the costs down.	episode_done:True

text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:Why would it be tonedeaf? This is kind of a U.S.-centric view. Not everyone in the world is still struggling with COVID, and a lot of the rest of the world isn't nearly as casual as America is, fashion-wise.   Call me crazy, but I'm tired of shapeless billowy clothing in earth tones, and I am READY for some structure and interesting textures. All summer has been about beige and washed out green and brown linen, let's see something else.   Plus, it's a weird take anyway, because high fashion doesn't really target loungewear, either way. Do we really expect major fashion houses to all abandon blazers and leather pants and start showing PJs and sweatpants on the runway?   Others have already pointed out that these collections have been designed months in advance, but consider another point - fashion has always been reactive. When forced to stay inside and only wear sweatpants for 6 months, people will rebel and start daydreaming and longing for the opposite. This pandemic was always going to inspire a sort of glam rock aesthetic, imo. BRING IT.

text:Future of fibers?	labels:Personally I don’t find it very difficult or expensive to shop for clothing made with natural fibers — if anything it’s gotten even easier to do so with online shopping and websites showing fiber content right in the product description. I don’t have to seek out brands that specialize in natural materials either — my clothing is mostly from Madewell, which doesn’t really market itself as being all that environmentally conscious or sustainable, and is definitely not a high end brand, but they have tons of options for clothing made of cotton, silk, etc.   I will say it’s gotten harder to find sweaters made of 100% wool over the years, however. I have several wool sweaters from mall brands that I bought just a few years ago. I gained some weight since then and have been looking for replacements from the same exact brands and it seems like they don’t even bother with 100% wool anymore, all of their sweaters are now made with acrylic, nylon, polyester, etc. That’s the only natural fiber that I feel has all but disappeared from the mainstream for some reason.   I will also add that I don’t think man made fibers are necessarily “cheap”, either. We’ve come a long way from man made materials of the 80s and 90s. When I think of man made fibers of today, I think of technical clothing and gear such as outdoor or sportswear. Patagonia for example is the poster child for environmentally friendly brands, but most of their clothing is made from man made materials, and their products are far from cheap. Partly because it performs better for its purpose, and partly because it’s supposed last a lifetime.  Which leads me to my last thought — IMO man made materials aren’t necessarily bad for the environment. It’s really our habits that are bad, and the industries that cater to these habits. If we all bought a few items of clothing that were all man made and lasted our lifetime, that is arguably *more* environmentally friendly than if we were constantly buying and throwing away natural fibered clothing.
text:While natural fibers are hard on the environment, man-made fibers release microfibers into our water ways, which are polluting the ocean. Fish have been caught that have balls of microfibers in their stomachs, and even people are thought to have microfibers circulating in our bodies. These microfibers are terrible for the oceans and may have an effect on our health. Scientists are trying to study whether microfibers cause inflammation, which could implicate these fibers in cancer. Man made fibers also often require toxic chemicals to be created, which harm the workers who make the fibers. There is no perfect solution, but I think figuring out how to filter out micro plastics or making synthetic fibers that don't harm the workers who create them and can properly decompose or be recycled easily would be sustainable solutions.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I guess I don't really follow them because as a pear shape the advice is usually to emphasize the other body parts to draw attention away from the hips. But I like my butt, so I don't feel like I need to specifically hide it.  Also I think bootcut or flare jeans that are usually recommended just make my legs look like columns, and slimmer pants actually show that  I have slim legs and ankles (which to me looks nicer). I think a lot of this advice was based on the idea that the goal is to look as skinny as possible, so if anything is sticking out it needs to be obscured. My mom said she never wore jeans in the 80s/90s because she thought her butt was too big for them, and it's not even a particularly huge butt. So at the time the hourglass ideal was just overshadowed by the need to not look "fat" it any way (especially in the 90s).
text:The 'make your legs look wider to counteract your hips' is indeed bullshit. All it accomplishes is....making my legs look wider. And yet it's parroted in every single advice for pears I've seen. If it is a holdover from the 90s like you said, that would make a lot more sense to me, as I'm always a little salty about the terminology that's involved that implies wide hips need to be hidden away and de-emphasized and are therefore ugly. When in reality, they're sexy and great.	labels:I have wide hips and if I do it right, emphasizing them makes my waist look smaller by comparison and I'm super into that lol.	episode_done:True

text:In my opinion, none of those brands are really worth the price. Salvatore Ferragamo definitely isn’t, most of their shoes aren’t welted, and their high end line is the same price as St. Crispins.   Brunello Cucinelli is nice, but you can get nicer for the same price. They don’t really have any handwork and their designs aren’t that interesting for the most part.

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:Most of my moves have been apartment-to-apartment in the same climate (four distinct seasons with extremes in temperatures in both directions), but I still like to use the time spent packing as an opportunity to reevaluate/purge. Generally I look at fit, condition/quality, and whether or not pieces fit with my lifestyle (e.g. if you work in a formal office you might need more formal clothes and less casual ones, and the reverse is also true).  It's also a good excuse to get rid of clothes you keep out of guilt (e.g. things you don't wear often but were a gift or that you feel bad getting rid of) so you only move things you love and are excited by.   When thinking about climate, you might not need a ton of warm sweaters, but you may still want to keep things like cardigans or lightweight sweaters for air-conditioned buildings. I live somewhere with hot summers, but I still always keep an "office sweater" at my desk because people can be a little overzealous with the AC. Yes, it might be 97 degrees F outside, but when you step inside to a 68 F building, it can be a bit of a shock. Bonus points if you own a top layer that's thin enough to ball up and put in your purse. I love breezy kimono-style layers as a hot weather third piece, but jewelry/accessories also gain more importance when trying to feel put together.  In general, try to think of your clothes in categories, and if there are categories you don't think you'll wear as often, keep fewer pieces in those categories. Also think about what things you may want to keep but store (maybe in an under-the-bed box?) for rare occasions. For example, I hate shorts and almost never wear them, but I do have a couple pairs that I keep for camping trips so that I don't need to rebuy on those occasions. Will you need warm clothes for visits to family/friends in colder climates, and if so, what quanitity?	episode_done:True

She says it doesn’t take her long because she’s so familiar with their stock, but it still seems exhausting to me.  (As opposed to spending three hours scrolling through Poshmark in bed every night…)

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:For the longest time (like 15 years), I hated all animal prints. I found them tacky, loud, cheap...the same connotations you had, basically. They had their moments in fashion now and then, but even when they were in fashion, I never came around to them. I think it may also partly be because someone I know growing up had a LOT of animal print in their wardrobe and house, and I became sick of it at a young age. Hatred of animal print was the one aesthetic feeling that stayed consistently with me for *years.* I was very accepting of most trends, but this is the one I could never bring myself to like – so I eventually shrugged and accepted the fact that I would always despise it.   AND THEN?????????? randomly a year ago, I suddenly found myself really liking leopard print, snakeskin, and croc skin (in small doses; I don't think I'll ever enjoy it on large pieces). They had come back into fashion, but unlike the previous times they'd cycled into fashion, this time I was suddenly feeling them? I really can't pinpoint why. It just happened. Maybe I saw some really cute outfits and ways to style it that I'd never really considered before. But either way, I bought pointy-toed leopard print pumps (with a really stunning dark golden velvet base!), leopard print slip-ons, croc skin slides, snakeskin sandals, and a snakeskin bucket bag. I thought these specific animal prints suddenly looked really cute as accessories!   So now I'm basically a-ok with leopard print, snakeskin, and croc skin. But I still really dislike zebra print for some strange reason. Not sure why this one still irritates me, and who knows, maybe one day I'll come to like this one too! But for now, zebra is a nope. And tiger print is horrendous and cheap to me.	episode_done:True

It’s too difficult to really nail the fit.... and if you do, there’s a good chance it’ll change as the jeans settle out or if your body changes. Plus, cutting around curves is super tough.   Raw denim is awesome in theory. It ages with you and confirms to your body. And the look of it over time is so cool. But I’ve almost never seen it work with women, especially in skinnier cuts. There’s just no give.   I would otherwise recommend vintage Levi’s or 100% cotton premium denim in a heartier weight for a more structured jean. The difference it that it’s been rinsed/washed so the fit is more predictable and longer lasting than raw denim.

text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:Other people have covered the main points- find fashion bloggers or icons that look like you; buy from companies where people post reviews with pictures, so you can see how it looks on someone with a similar body type; don't be intimidated to go to a tailor, or tailor your own clothes (youtube has plenty of tutorials on how to do basic alterations!).  Please don't take this as intending to trivialize your struggles, but rather an effort to offer some validation: off the rack clothes don't really fit *most* people well. I have friends of all different body types and sizes, and we *all* struggle to find clothes that work for us off the rack. So please know that you're not having trouble because your body is somehow uniquely unsuitable for clothes. It's because, quite frankly, *most* clothing is badly cut and designed. Most clothing sucks. Clothing manufacturers, especially since the 2008 recessions (i.e. most of your life), have been making clothing that just gets weirder and boxier and less flattering with every passing year. It's almost impossible to find things that fit anyone (in the sense of being flattering), because they are made to fit everyone (in the sense of doing the bare minimum of technically covering the body). Instead of manufacturing clothes to fit a human body, with all its curves and variations, it's *way* cheaper and easier to sew a couple rectangles together and call it a shirt. And we don't really have better options, so we buy it, so they keep making it. And it may feel like other people don't struggle with this, but you're not seeing them in the dressing rooms or looking through their closets in the morning. You're seeing them out and about, or on social media, where everything is carefully clipped and styled, staged to look perfect and effortless.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 10, 2021	labels:Out of curiosity what setups are you guys using to take and edit your fit pics? Phone in a mug? Professional camera? What focal length is your lens, are you using a tripod? Anything interesting you'd like to share?  I have a 23mm lens on a Fuji X-Pro1 (APS-C, so I believe 35mm equivalent) that I usually mount on a tripod with a 10sec timer & 6-frame burst-shot. It's time consuming to set up and get a good picture because the preview is tiny and there's no e.g. WiFi sharing so my alternative setup is a phone mount for the same tripod. Recently discovered I can get a live preview from my phone on my laptop so I've been using that to browse the pictures and check I've framed everything correctly etc.  I use the lightroom mobile app to crop and edit the photos. Basically every photo is cropped because I have to stand quite far back from the camera to get everything in without distortion.

I go through periods of realizing a 34 year old wearing thigh highs with maryjanes is confusing and periods of comforting myself that the lesbian in clarks and stripey socks look makes me happy and as an elder-millenenial I am basically a generation adrift.    Probably the hardest part is realizing I don't have to buy new clothing. Like, I have enough of most things and it doesn't wear out fast enough to justify replacing it, nor does it really no longer spark joy.    I have stuff that fits from college that still has *years* of wear left.

text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:I kind of ran into this problem since I purged most my summer wardrobe last year, and the core of the rest of my wardrobe is dresses, which I just don’t like as much in summer.  I do think that if you’re just not going to choose separates over single pieces, foregoing them entirely is completely valid, once you’re not handicapping yourself.  What worked for me, since I ended up with a ton of midi skirts I really liked, but felt apathetic towards tops, was to just go the solid colour, traditionally flattering route (which I think is the smartest way of tackling elements of clothing you don’t care that much for.)  If I’m wearing separates, I’m always going to choose my bottom first, so not having to think much about what to pair them with is nice.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 24, 2020	labels:I'm a longtime lurker and browse this subreddit periodically. Maybe this is just me, but I recently noticed that the subreddit is become more fashion oriented and it doesn't seem to cater towards the average male. A lot of the outfits/lookbooks that are posted give me "fashion week" vibes because it has something vintage, baggy pants, some obscure sweater, etc.  I'm not hating on the subreddit because I respect fashion but the subreddit doesn't seem to be what it was 5 years ago. Basically, I feel that the subreddit is less helpful to the average male.  Points of discussion: What do you all think about the subreddit?  Anyone have an recommendations to subreddits/resources with current fashion advice for the average male?  Some of the information on the side or in the wiki seem a bit outdates. How can we better help newcomers?
text:the capes thread really triggered the entirety of Reddit it seems.   I’m not sure why people get so worked up by inspo albums and runway articles. There is tons of content on MFA that is mainstream. The entire daily question thread is full of basic advice for newcomers. The sidebar is like terabytes of slim fits and OCBDs. Articles from non avant-garde blogs like Die Workwear and Put This On are linked to every week.   I am one of the most conservative guys here ( fashion wise, not political before anyone freaks) and there is tons of content I enjoy.

text:Is anyone into MBTI? Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels:At one point on the INTP subreddit everyone was talking about how they wish they could wear a cape without it being seen as weird. I would interpret the INTP relationship to fashion as a little bit more nuanced than "drab and careless". I think the common theme is that INTPs don't generally care what others think - and so that can manifest on a spectrum from "wears whatever because does not care about their appearance at all" to "wears completely outlandish things because they care about their appearance but do not care at all what others think of it".      As an INTP myself I fall somewhere between the two. Like... I *want* fashion to be a higher priority for me, but when it comes down to it my attitude is more often just "whatever" because social pressure to look good  doesn't register to me nearly as much as it could.

text:General Discussion - January 11, 2021	labels:2020 was probably the worst year of my life (most of the year was ok but nov/december was so awful it dragged it all the way down), but a serious silver lining was that i lost close to 35 lbs. i've been overweight pretty much all my life but not what most people would consider obese. still, it has always affected my self-esteem and confidence, and i was at my peak weight at the start of 2020, 235 lbs.  I cannot overstate how taxing it was to not see the scale budge downward for so long and always seemingly ticking up. a suit I had bought a year prior to fit comfortably after I gained weight was starting to not fit, real "ah shit here we go again" moment. at the start of the pandemic though, i lost 14 lbs in like two months and was ecstatic. i ticked another 10 or so lbs downward before I plateaued and you know, I was happy about it because I never felt hungry and I had a consistent lifestyle and it was good that I could live like that and not gain or lose weight at all. Then, I came down with food poisoning in december and barely ate for like a week and lost another 10 lbs (hardly healthy but in 2020 i'll take the good with the bad). Even after getting better and feeling good again I have kept that weight off and now weigh under 200 lbs for the first time in years. I'm ecstatic for more progress in 2021 and hopefully finally being confident enough to buy the dope clothes I want and not worrying that I look bad in them.  It's so interesting what relativity does to you. I'm 198 lbs rn, but I was last that weight when I was a senior heading off to college and felt awful about it. Now, I feel fucking great and way more confident than I was before. Funny things. The mission is 170 lbs but I'll be happy to be between that and 180. Sorry for the paragraphs but I know this forum more than almost anywhere will understand struggles like this, especially for guys.

text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I am a teacher that went back to working in the building at the beginning of September, so to be fair I was only wfh for several months in the spring, but it still drastically changed my style, or my perspective on my style.   Pre-Covid my work style (and general style) had morphed over the years to become very, very minimal and neutral. Lots of Everlane and Eileen Fisher. This was both because I wanted to be taken seriously at my job (I read very young) and because it also seemed like what was in style to me.   Returning to work in the fall, I realized I really f*cking hated all of my sensible, plain, go with everything black and grey clothes.   I still really prefer earth tones and blacks and greys, and I still wear some pretty simple outfits somedays, but I went on a small spree on The RealReal after I had my realization. I bought myself some louder statement pieces that feel more me, including an embroidered Happy Sheep sweater, a knit Missoni sheath dress, a multi-colored leather and fur purse, platform oxfords, and a couple of geometric patterned silk shirts and dresses.   For me life is too short to try so hard to be timeless and professional. I’m not knocking the look, it just isn’t ~me~ I want to love the clothes I wear and the clothes I love are fun knits and patterns.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 14, 2021	labels:I’ve been having some trouble lately trying to update my wardrobe. I am no fashionista but I know what looks bad and want to avoid it, hence coming to MFA maybe 6 years ago and developing a pretty solid BB wardrobe.   I’m trying to broaden my horizons now and get a more mature style, however I’m finding a slight mental stumbling block because looks now are the polar opposite of what was cool when I was 18.   Wearing doc martens with shorter cropped, loose fitting jeans and showing your socks would have been social suicide a decade ago when I came of age (skinny everything, trainers with everything). I like the look but I feel uncomfortable when I wear it - any advice on getting past this? My head knows it looks better than wearing them with my skinny jeans but my heart says “you will get bullied at school (work)”  TL;DR bought some docs, like them, but how do I stop feeling like a dork?

text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:I'm not a fan of linen or silk, so natural fiber wise I'm good with cotton and that's about it. I can't do animal hairs (severe allergy) so I guess if we're avoiding synthetics, I'll just freeze in the winter? On the positive side, I rarely wash my sweaters as I wear them over top of other things so there's no need to. I guess at least I'm not polluting the water supply as badly there.   I think polyester has a place, like in gym leggings or that kind of thing. I had a pair of cotton based gym leggings and they got disgusting real quick. I also like a little polyester in some styles of clothing because it provides structure and a certain look that can be desirable on particular items.  Natural fibers, due to this movement, have gotten a lot more expensive. So this is another one of those ethical issues where those that can afford to spend the money and hunt around for more natural fabrics can do so, and you have to be careful not to degrade someone who can't do the same.	episode_done:True

text:Become a Tailored Suit Pro - Guide	labels:Went to a tailor for the first time today. £25 to get some chinos shortened and tapered.      I walked in and said “I have some trousers that are too wide. I would like them to not be that way”.        He had me change, said “are we shortening or tapering” - which I took as a very polite way of saying “they’re far too long bro”, so I responded “both!”.      We chatted for a couple minutes while he folded, pinned and measured.       He was polite, respectful, and only scratched my ankle once with a needle - I figure that you accept a certain amount of risk when people put pins in a garment you’re wearing.          7/10, most anxiety inducing part was walking through the door. Will be getting my stuff back on Tuesday. If it goes well I will be throwing a lot of business at them, as I have a lot of clothes which would see more action if they were better fitted.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 11, 2021	labels:I've recently been given some of my uncles old shirts, about 6 or 7, casual and formal (he passed over the summer). He was about 6'1", slim, I'm 5'8ish, also slim, and I'm thinking about getting some of the shirts tailored, mainly bc I wanna wear them for sentimental value, and they're a bit long. I'm in the UK, anyone got any idea how/where I could get them tailored, or if it's worth it at all? I'd be willing to pay pretty much anything per shirt in a tailor's or alterations shop.	episode_done:True

text:Underwear review: Soma vs. Parade after 6 months	labels:I bought a pack of Parade recently and the high rise brief cut is one of my favorite pairs of underwear. They do give a bit of a wedgie, but the fabric is light and soft enough that I don’t feel it and it isn’t visible under clothes. I wish they were cotton, but the fabric hasn’t given me any problems yet. I’ve been considering Meundies for a similar high rise cheeky cut, but am not thrilled about the price point.  ETA: should have read through all the comments before posting. The Knickey high rise briefs seem to be exactly what I’m looking for.	episode_done:True
text:What's the greatest length you've gone to obtain a much coveted fashion item?	labels:When I was in middle school, I saw a sweater on a fashionable outfits Twitter page. I reverse googled the image to find it came from a shop in the UK (I’m in the US). Forgot about conversion and I ended up paying over $60 just for the sweater, not including shipping. My parents were so angry I spent all the money I had on one single clothing item but I still have the sweater about 10 years later and it continues to be a staple item

text:The Conscious and Somber Decision of Solid Jacketing	labels:I read a great portion of the essay, and what I felt was a great compliment to some of these outfits were 1) the green watch I think the OP wore, and 2) the orange watch worn by a red headed gentleman at Drake’s.  Very nice pieces indeed, and I really felt they complimented the solid colorways of the jackets, and the striped colorways of the shirts.	episode_done:True

Literally on the cusp of buying this belt lol :)	labels:If you wear it around your waist only, not the hips it would be ok. But I think the 90 would be better so you have both options. I have it in beige - I believe that’s the color name and find it versatile!	episode_done:True

Something cozy enough to set up shop on your couch in, that won't break on the first scoot, actually keep your arms warm.   In loungewear there's apparently four types with no middle ground: For mothers-formerly-known-as-women,  for girls, for seduction purposes only, and Jeff Lebowski.

Wear trendy items, don't wear them, just stop trying to make some women "other" than you due to some fashion superiority complex. Lord.
text:I needed this. I’m usually so confident in my outfits but there’s just something about turning 30 plus comments here and there from my older family members that make me second guess myself and make me wonder if I need to find a new style even though I love my clothes and style.	labels:Dude forget your family’s comments, they literally don’t know better. It’s your style and you wear what you want.   I’m 36 and wear anything from grandma sack tunics to glittery minidresses.	episode_done:True
text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:Thrift / consignment stores are fantastic for jewelry shopping! Thrift stores usually have cheaper stuff like you’d find at F21 or H&M, but consignment stores have authentic pieces for fairly reasonable prices. If you’re really feeling the fancy stuff, I bought my high school graduation ring (white gold, green sapphire and diamond) at an antique store for about 100$ USD.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 10, 2020	labels:It’s really fun to look at clothes objectively without pretext of it not being suitable for a man to wear. I’m slowly chipping away at my own mental barrier regarding this but I want to get to a point where all I have to consider is if it’s a sick piece or not.
text:It's really liberating to have that realization. Breaking gender norms won't always be appropriate and you have to accept that you'll get looks, but it's freeing to no longer be held by flawed ideas drilled into you from birth. And the majority of fashion is opened to you.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone take their “power color” really seriously? Basing a whole wardrobe around one color - not just choosing an accent color for a neutral capsule?	labels:I love dark red and I feel very cool when my outfit happens to be all red.    I love monochromatic looks in general.  Low effort but high impact! And when you love a colour you just naturally accumulate a lot of pieces in that colour.	episode_done:True
text:When did skinny jeans go out of fashion?	labels:Women in fashion have stated that skinny jeans have been out for years now. They at first were replaced with mom jeans, than wide leg coulotts, than the high rise straight leg and now I'm seeing a lot of low rise boot cut. That being said in everyday life I am still seeing a large majority of women still wearing skinny jeans
text:After reading this I realized I've been wearing bootcut jeans long enough to be back in style again. I started wearing bootcut and straight leg in the early 00s and kept it as a staple ever since because I liked the cut.  The real enemy is low rise and mid rise jeans.. I feel like a high rise makes most jean cuts look better to me.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How Much Clothing Should I Own?	labels:I don't think anyone is going to be able to tell you this as it's subjective and dependent on your job and lifestyle. It's going to come down to keeping stuff you actually wear on a weekly basis and throwing away stuff you don't wear. This will let you know where you stand with your wardrobe right now and you can build from there.     Personally, I just went though this and cleaned out my closet from all the all the old high school, college, and worn clothes I still had hanging around and my mind set was that ***it's better for me to throw away a little too much than too little***. Only do this if your in the financial situation where you know you can replace an article of clothing pretty easily though.
text:But dont throw the clothes away. Donate them	labels:Yeah, I found one of those donations bins and just threw everything in it (excluding some of the more well used clothes...). I wouldn't get too caught up in saying your going to sell clothes either. I think people just end up keeping clothes when they say they'll sell, that's what my wife does anyways...
text:I sell my old clothes all the time. If you are good at only buying decent brands that don't depreciate too much in value, you can often make back 50-80% of what you paid. Hell, I once bought a sick Norse Projects jacket from a person on Grailed, wore it for a couple seasons, and then turned around and sold it on Grailed for more than I paid for it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:MFA Theme WAYWT Challenge Announcement: Dress Like an Architect!	labels:I've done some looking for inspo that various architects actually wore, but I feel like that may be too literal. I have a few thoughts on how to participate in the "spirit" of this theme:  • Fits that demonstrate a heavy amount of structure and "solidity," (i.e. a minimum of flow) while suggesting internal human movement (your fit is a building, with a person or people in it); an example of this a loose sweater or shirt layered under a heavy coat  • Fits that include details that suggest buildings and architecture: thick materials like leather and wool, metal jewelry (silver, stainless steel, etc) or wood jewelry  • Large caps, boots, tightly-tied scarves  • literally tie bricks to your shoes lol	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Beauty is Pain	labels:I once had this gorgeous denim dress, smart and sharp, I looked totally hot in it. It was quite tight. One evening, due to my own poor judgment, I decided to wear this bloody amazing dress to a dinner. It was going great, we had an entree, then the main... until I reached the point where I had one tiny potato left on my plate and I knew all too well that if I eat this potato, either the dress will burst, exposing guests to an unsightly view of my semi-naked body, or the guests will be exposed to an unsightly view of everything I have eaten that day.   Since I am a person who got their life priorities straight, I elegantly excused my guests and I delighted their eyes with yet another gorgeous outfit. No potato was left behind.	episode_done:True

text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I have shopped the men's department before and never had issues with sales associates. The biggest thing was once, they wouldn't let me in the dressing room and I had to go to one on another floor, because there were already men in there (but everyone had their own room and the only communal space was the mirror area? Like, not sure why it mattered, I ended up making the purchase at the register near the other dressing room and the guy lost a sale, which may have been petty but...I'd used that dressing room before with zero issue, so 🤷‍♀️) But I have had issues with some cuts of men's clothes--they aren't really cut for boobs and hips, so I had to get them tailored. There are some companies that do masculine/androgynous looks for those bodies, like Kirrin Finch, that might be worth checking out!	episode_done:True
text:VF to Acquire Supreme, Valuing Brand at $2.1 Billion-plus	labels:They're laughing all the way to the bank. 😂	episode_done:True
text:Do you think that designer brands will no longer be as sought after in the future?	labels:I think that we all collectively live in a bubble, and that, what we see and experience is not indicative of the world we actually live in. It’s easy to say that designer brands will no longer be as sought after in the future because of the current trend of buying secondhand, but, there are millions out there who are not doing that, and who are buying firsthand. Even buying designer secondhand is still making it desirable, so, no, I don’t think it will. I think that the sought after designers may change, but, I think designer items are always going to be super desirable.  Edit: a word.	episode_done:True

text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:I feel the same, I love the comfort of trousers over skirts! Although skirts can look amazing, I can never relax while wearing them. They wrinkle, they bunch up, they slip or do all kinds of things when I want to tuck my legs under me or hang on the couch. I love a skirt to feel instantly dressed up, but immediately change into trousers when i get home	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:I just went through this - I held on to two beautiful gold Tiffany necklaces and a diamond solitaire bracelet from an ex of 6 years. I loved them but no matter how hard I tried I couldn't wear them and not think of that relationship (which didn't end on awful terms, I had just moved on). I sold them all recently on Poshmark.  It kind of stings and feels bittersweet because they were beautiful, but I used the money to invest in something new, to me from me. Now I can wear it without any weird memory strings attached. Feels kind of freeing honestly!	episode_done:True
text:How would you store sentimental clothing?	labels:There's a lot of good ideas put forward so far.

text:What are you looking forward to buying for "pandemic life" this summer?	labels:Bike shorts and baggy cropped tees! If this summer is anything like the last, I’ll spend the entire time biking around my city and drinking beers in parks or on my friends roofs. Bike shorts are cute but still bike friendly (ofc) and i love a plain cottony or loose fitting tee.
text:Depending on how your bike is setup, I find that pretty much any outfit is bike friendly if you have enough shoulder room - and nothing is loose enough to get caught in the chain!	labels:Love this energy, and yes i agree.

text:Runways have been sending out 2000s vibes. Anyone onboard?	labels:I'm just going to lay it out there: I hate it. I hate the return of the Mean Girls/bitchy rich white girl/fucking velour Juicy tracksuit look. Probably because I started high school in 2001 and it was like the hey day of bland tackiness and Paris Hilton and I'm too close to it, lived it a little too much, to find any novelty in it. SO vapid. I was slightly vapid and a little mean for a while around that time before I came into myself and I don't like the reminders.  What I do like about the looks above though, is that I see the 60s and 90s Spice Girls influences and I can get into that.  Edit: also, on occasion, I wear low rise pants, but I like looking at trends for inspiration and new ideas, not dictating what I can or can't wear. If you like low rise jeans and hipster minis, rock em. If not, fuck em forever, who cares.

text:Somebody else loosing so much time to choose the right item to buy when looking for something? I feel it cost me more in time when I try to buy responsibly.	labels:For me, it's not time-consuming. This might be because in a shopping year, I'm shopping at least one season ahead. I also pop into thrift shops regularly for 5-10 mins at a time with a strict list. The list doesn't just include clothes, so my successful trips tend to be high. I don't thrift shop online. The one time I took the risk, I regretted it. It's way more expensive and it's risky so I don't bother with it.	episode_done:True

text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:I don't know about the other ladies out there, but for me there's no magic formula. In my humble opinion, I look good because I take the time to really plan out my outfit, hair, shoes, etc. It really is just practice, repetition, and routine. If it seems daunting to you, here are some smaller steps you can take:  1. Use a website to organize your thoughts - like Pinterest.  2. A lot of department stores have looks and outfit ideas when you are looking for products! It's a great way to go from - 'oh that dress is cute' in a vacuum to figuring out an outfit around it.  3. Practice makes perfect.  4. Practice makes perfect.  5. Try to make one part of your outfit really satisfying to yourself if it seems to much to do the whole thing. For example pick a bag that goes well with your dress. That way, even if your makeup/shoes don't work as well with the outfit you don't get worried about not having the perfect look. You'll still be happy with part of it and you can build from there for next time!  Sometimes, I try to do the 'just woke up but looking fresh effortlessly' look but I don't know if it's actually successful, lol.
text:Yes to the "practice makes perfect". Try things on. Play dress up and experiment with silhouettes. Document what works and what doesn't. I've been documenting my outfits for nearly 10 years now and although I still have some questionable outfits, it's helped me develop an eye for proportions and colors. So there is no "effortless" look, not really. It takes work, and after a while it becomes instinctive.	labels:	episode_done:True

She is a late teen now, but this has been true since she has been old enough to put on her own clothing. In her middle school years she started altering her clothes, changing cuts and retailoring them to suit her taste.   I don’t make comments about her body or what I think she should do with it beyond staying safe and healthy.	episode_done:True

text:I’m the same way, weirdly, thought there’s a few of them in this album that toe the line into looking good in my opinion.   I quite like a nice parka, but the light down jackets just look odd to me. Part of it is the shine which I think looks awful, another is the prominenty puffy horizontal lines just look ugly to me. If they were filled with a different pattern maybe I’d like them more.	labels:	episode_done:True

If the pandemic taught me one thing, it's to wear things you like all the time--there's no real sense in differentiating between "home" and "going out" clothes.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 23, 2020	labels:Keep it on the low but I have been secretly going to the local sub shop that my s.o. hates because he thinks they are rude (they are). I take full advantage and put on a big trench coat, bucket hat, and sunglasses when I go because having an affair with a restaurant demands big fits.

text:Learning to dress better	labels:First, I'd like to echo other commenters sentiments and say that investing in a good hair cut is absolutely worth it. Finding a good barber, hairstyle that you feel compliments your hair type and face shape, and that you feel good about are all worth it. I've never regretted putting in the time to find a good barber. Also, don't be afraid to try things, it is just hair after all. I'd also like to say just be patient with yourself and give yourself time. I started figuring out I cared how I dressed when I was in university, but my sense of style is very different now from what it was then (a lot less band shirts). So don't be afraid to try things and explore different styles to figure out what you like. Thirdly, basics (as other people have mentioned) are worth investing in. You cannot go wrong with a clean t-shirt and a pair of well fitting jeans. Fourth, shoes are worth investing in. I wish I would have learned that earlier. You can get most basic wardrobe needs for relatively cheap through places like uniqlo and they'll hold up decently well. But a good pair of shoes will last you a long time. I bought my first pair of really nice, high quality boots last year and it's a totally different experience. It's awesome that you are realizing you want to dress better, just be patient.

text:I know “fashion” but people of minorities are always forced to try better. Some Insights	labels:As a black man I'm not surprised by this at all. I don't think I'm as affected as most because my clothes are overtly fashionable and often feminine, and that tends to disarm any preconceptions of "dangerous" and "violent". But I see it all the time, and I do notice a difference on the rare occasions I just dress plainly. Before Covid, if I walked home from the gym at night in sweats I wouldn't put my hood up or my hands in my pockets because I walked by one of campus police's favorite sitting spots. We only need to look at Trayvon Martin for confirmation. One note about the study:  > While it is tempting to tell individuals that how they dress can evoke negative biases, this avoids addressing a bigger issue … In fact, directing individuals to change what they wear places the burden of mitigating stereotypes and associated prejudices on the wearer. Instead, we need to consider how we can change the perceptions of those who hold and use such stereotypes in harmful ways.  I agree and I appreciate the sentiment, but I'll be dead before we change racists' perceptions on this. It's not a burden I or any other black man should have to carry, but realistically it's a lot easier for me to change my clothes than for a racist to change their thinking.  ETA: Black women have it way worse. They get to have racism **and** misogyny!
text:I'm a PoC in Canada and even up here I notice how clothing changes perceptions but I had to go beyond fashionable to conservative business suits to notice it. I wore expensive trendy minimalist streetwear and still got followed in stores and stopped by the police in my own neighbourhood. Now that I wear suits on the daily, I notice how different you can be treated. I get smiles in the streets and less suspicion.  I've personally been a believer in not judging people for what they wear but until societal perceptions change, you gotta play the game.  I still get asked if I speak English tho.	labels:	episode_done:True

They are kinda pricy but they have a lifetime warranty, although I’ve never had to use it. I have pairs that are a few years old that are holding up just fine.

But both are out of the woods! They seem to be doing so much better and it's a huge relief!   Got a bunch of Aime Leon dore stuff from various sales and I got to say I'm very impressed. Nothing too flashy, but the Woolrich collection goes so hard. Also have to say, as much as I love some of Howlin' designs,  compared to the ALDxWoolrich stuff,  Howlin' quality is just not there. Surprised at how itchy the wool is. My gf got them as a full price Christmas gift though so can never say that out loud lmao.

text:How do ya'll express your culture or traditional fashion in modern clothing?	labels:My ethnicity is...half white American, half white English. Everyone already wears my culture's traditional clothing.  The world gets so much more rich and interesting and dynamic when people can feel comfortable wearing more of the clothing from their cultural traditions. I love this movement. Just wish I could contribute more to it than compliments and supportive grins whenever I see non-western clothing being represented!
text:What is your culture’s traditional clothing ?	labels:Well I was being a bit tongue-in-cheek of course, but the basics...jeans. Shirts. Tees. Sneakers. Three-piece-suits. You know - "Generic westernized clothing." That's an interesting question to really think about though.  We've got to take the history WAAYYY back to find anything with a strong regional tradition that's anywhere comparable to, say, cheongsam or salwar kameez, if there even is any to be found. I can't think of much that has really truly stuck around and stayed unique or symbolic to either region.  The cultural symbolism and weight just isn't quite there with most of this stuff. Victorian ballgowns aren't exactly a "cultural tradition," for example, because they were symbolic not of an entire cultural history but of a place and time, though they are uniquely British creations. Not exactly ceremonial or something one would "put on to honor your culture." Flapper dresses, maybe? American Hippie attire? White wedding dresses? Graphic tees? Neckties? All may have started in the US/UK (or been appropriated by them!), but look at where they went. *Everywhere*. That's what happens when you're from a colonizing powerhouse.	episode_done:True

text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:I think start by looking at pictures online on Pinterest or Instagram of styles you find aesthetically pleasing and create a little dashboard with outfits that catch your eye. You can also think about some of your favourite actors or singers that wear outfits you like and try to save the pictures you find. After that i would go window-shopping online on websites that fit your budget and look around trying to find pieces similar to any outfits you saw. fyi; i would browse on a website first and then go to the actual store to try out what you saw online, it gives you an idea of what you’re looking for.  I think imitation is the easiest way to start finding your style. Once your comfortable in a type of style you can start experimenting with it and picking more personalized pieces. Good luck :)
text:I've tried that but feel like the outfits are too much for a casual stop at the grocery store. Any tips on that?	labels:My style aspiration has always been something analogous to let's say upper east side. Completely not practical for my budget or lifestyle. For awhile I avoided it, but honestly I didn't really feel like I came into my own style wise until I figured out how to adapt things to my own life.   What I liked was a put together look, polished accessories, and femme style.   For me that means combining dressy with casual. The skirt goes with sneakers. Instead of a blouse, I might wear a tee shirt. Instead of heels - fancy flats. And overall I found my own interpretation of things.	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:Make it the new normal. Dress up all the time and then you will set a new normal of always looking fabulous. Of course then you might have the opposite problem of “are you ok?” when you’re not dressed up lol	episode_done:True

text:“I'm all locked down with nowhere to go – but that hasn't killed my lust for fashion”	labels:I have one suggestion, get dressed and take pictures. It doesn't have to be for Instagram/facebook. It can be for just yourself. If you really like an outfit, remember it with a picture. You can take it in a park, or at a location that is memorable for you, with your SO, or with your cat. You should at least get a few good pictures with you pet in the 10+ years they reside with you.  It's actually a fun learning experience, on how to use the cameras. I am interested in photography and usually use a dslr, but for selfies, dslrs are not as good. With an iphone, I think it's an entirely different genre of photography. You have to use completely different lighting system, etc., to use it to its full potential.
text:Yes! I’ve been doing this since last summer and it has not only helped me envision a world beyond the virus but it has also helped me curb my clothing purchases a bit too. It’s so satisfying making new outfits and I just look at the pics when an urge to shop strikes.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:That’s fair, we are in a really cold snap where I live right now. I actually found that I used my outerwear more this year since I couldn’t do much else. This winter has had a lot of long walks with the dogs, ice skating, cross country skiing, and socially distanced walks and fire pits with friends.  I did find that my technical outerwear and layering pieces for more use this year, as opposed to my nicer cashmere sweaters and wool coats that I would usually wear for work or indoor activities in a non pandemic winter	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:This style isn’t really my style, but one thing I notice in these looks is that they look really well tailored despite being loose and drapey. In particular, the cuff of the sleeves in the first pic and the hem of the pants in the second hit in exactly the right places rather than bunching up. This makes the outfits look really intentional IMO.	episode_done:True
text:How many pairs of jeans and pairs of shoes should you own?	labels:Women can have things they enjoy having without being concern trolled about how much they really need it.   I don't see men getting hassled for the amount of electronic waste their hobbies produce.   I doubt every fifth post in the Funko Pop subreddit is about curbing consumption and how they should be rethinking their involvement in a plastics based interest.   Personally, I think they're wasteful as shit, but I'm not about to roll up into their space and shame them for it.  I'm so over the handwringing, guilt, and joylessness about fashion in this sub sometimes.

text:Tony Hsieh, Zappos Luminary Who Revolutionized the Shoe Business, Dies at 46	labels:I love that he was so big on culture. Companies rarely give a shit about employees and making them feel a part of something.  Tony called the company I first worked at (him, not an assistant or other person) and I actually picked up the call. He wanted to partner with our business to really bring a boom to DTLV. I remember how honest and enthusiastic he was. Sadly I couldn’t make the decision and had to transfer him to a coordinator who eventually brought the details to our VP, who declined (stupid reasons why). But I’ve heard so much about what he has done for Vegas. Absolute tragedy. Guy was very successful from a young age too and wasn’t so old either.	episode_done:True

text:What are your coziest winter finds/essentials?	labels:This year I've finally come to the realization that I can layer all the sweaters I want, I'm still going to feel cold if my legs are cold. So I got merino wool tights from Icebreaker (the 260 weight) to layer when I'm outdoors, as well as a couple of pairs of cheap "fur-lined" leggings for lounging at home (purchased from whatever Instagram brand advertised them to me first, I'm ashamed to admit). The wool tights are great of course, as expected, but the cheap leggings are a pleasant surprise! They fit decently although they're not as high-waisted as I would personally like, and they are definitely warm.	episode_done:True
text:Shopping my own closet for the perfect tee	labels:I'm a big fan af this. Every time I clean out my closet, I find hidden treasures, but I also discover how much of it I really hate, or how much of it seems tired to me and sort of depressing.   I tend to only have items that I love the most in my closet, (I ideally strive for 14 days worth of wear) and then put 7 days worth of clothes some other place, that I don't exactly love or hate. Stuff you'd move furniture or do spring cleaning in. Sometimes I look at these clothes and decide that I missed this or that, but most of the time, it gets cycled out after a while and donated somewhere.   I live in a very small apartment, though, and I dislike the extra work that comes with too much clutter. A lot of people like to hold onto their clothes, because trends cycle so quickly and unexpectedly
text:That makes sense for a small living space - I think I’d want to cut down my wardrobe a ton for that too! Since I have more space, I like having a bunch of tees so I don’t have to worry about them getting worn so quickly (although again, maybe that means they don’t ever wear out before I get tired of them, so I should reconsider that!)	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I needed this. I’m usually so confident in my outfits but there’s just something about turning 30 plus comments here and there from my older family members that make me second guess myself and make me wonder if I need to find a new style even though I love my clothes and style.	labels:For me I found after my 30th birthday the fucks I had available to give exponentially decreased. Wear what you like.
text:Me too! I'm 30. I honestly think they extracted my fuck giving bladder when they yanked my son out. Then at 3 months after birth, my hair fell out literally in clumps. I can't say I felt too bad about it, because I was kinda busy with a nursing 24/7 baby.  However, now that it's starting to grow back, I fit into my clothes better, and my son turned one and rejected them boobies all of a sudden in one day, haha!.. I feel inspired!   Fashion wise, somewhere in life when I focused my very least on fashion, is where I found my true joy for clothing. Not shopping, just.. Matching and organizing my closet and appreciating all that fancy stuff I hadn't used in years. I just feel more confident and better looking than ever before!  And yes, I have a pair of skinny high waisted jeans 🙄 They're not out of style, guys. At least not in Scandinavia.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:2020 Wardrobe Data Analysis	labels:I don't chart my clothing wears.  However, when purchasing something new, I make a mental calculation of the cost per wear.  It has to be $1 or less for me to buy it.  So if I buy a $10 shirt, I have to wear it (at least) 10 times.  I do make exceptions for special occasions, but it is 2020 so those are non-existent.  And with the exception of walking a red carpet or a black tie (or higher) level of formality, I have something in my closet that could work for the occasion (wedding, political fundraiser, etc).  If for some reason, I get invited to a black tie event, I'd rent my attire.  (And I'm never going to walk a red carpet.)	episode_done:True

text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:My 2021 resolution is to wear the clothes I bought in 2020 and not buy more, lol. Honestly I'm in the UK and it looks like we won't be coming out of frequent lockdowns until maybe June/July at earliest so that leaves less opportunities for going to places and serving snazzy outfits which is sad but hey, it is what it is.  I've been trying to wean myself off buying clothes, not because I hate fashion or something but to combat a shopping addiction I developed in 2017 (basically dealing with any negative emotion by buying clothes) and I've gradually gone down from 80 items a year to 40 and now 25. I've got a baller wardrobe with clothes I love so if I can manage to get my clothes shopping habit to what it used to be - a rare treat instead of a regular thing then I'll consider it a win for myself.	episode_done:True

text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:You know not everyone is privileged enough to have a work from home job right now right? And to pay for grocery delivery?

text:No no, fashion isn't for grocery store employees and Starbucks baristas come now /s  OP, I dont think you're coming from a bad place, but this post is really tone deaf	labels:I think I was misinterpreted. I'm not offended by the trends, I'm disappointed to see the same types of fall trends we've seen the last few years show up despite the desire from a large number of people to feel pretty and stay comfy. I know my personal disappoinment is not shared by most in this sub, and I've been rightfully reminded that collections take time to develop and release. But don't twist my words by implying that I said fashion should be gatekept. Like any other element of culture and art it does not exist in a vacuum. And I'm sure plenty of essential workers, friends and family of mine included, can desire comfort on the job as well.	episode_done:True
text:Your 2021 trend predictions?	labels:I think we'll see an adjustment on the enormous puffy sleeves and ruffles, and a trend towards fitted long-line pieces - still historically inspired but with more of an emphasis on ornamentation than on silhouette. Nods to the roaring 20s: gems, jewels, metallics continuing to be prominent; dramatic makeup; heels making a resurgence.
text:God I hope this comes to pass, I'm here for a 20's influence	labels:I hope the roaring 20s doesn’t lead into another Great Depression/WWII lol.

text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I really don't like uncomfortable clothes.  Sometimes I buy a few copies of my favorite pieces in different colors.  I search online for clothes with my favorite fabrics.  Modal cotton is one.  It's easier to be elegant and get away with repetitive clothing when you're wearing neutral colors and accenting with jewelery.
text:I'm really struggling because I find clothing at stores are getting more cheaply made, like tshirts with the seams all twisted after one wash. Some of the ethical brands don't really have the style or colours I like. I'm also hesitant about ordering online because I cannot look at the seams or test out the clothes. I live in Canada so I have a lot less options.	labels:I’m also in Canada and I have ordered from Uniqlo before. Shipping and returns are very easy and the fibers are identified on their website. Their cotton t-shirts are well constructed especially for the price point.  On Nordstrom’s website you can sometimes filter by fabric type which is useful. They also have some of the “better” brands like Eileen Fisher. I haven’t shopped online there, however.  I really notice fabric texture and I can’t stand to wear any scratchy fabric like polyester or mohair, or have tags on my clothes - it’s too “itchy”. My main priority when shopping is finding fabric I can deal with. I also don’t want poorly made clothes so I skip most of the fast fashion in Canada. (Aritzia, Club Monaco, J Crew, RW&Co, Zara, H&M, all the GAP family brands, the stuff at Winners, all the other mall stores... they aren’t worth the energy to sift through in my opinion.)	episode_done:True
text:How have you been doing your shopping since Covid?	labels:I’ve discovered therealreal, and have bought a couple things from there.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 09, 2021	labels:Hey so I almost constantly wear sweatpants purely because they're comfortable. I want to start actually dressing well.

text:Unless you have severe sensory issues a well fitting,  broken-in pair of jeans or chinos  should be comfortable enough for most people	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:The company already made money off of the original purchase of the shirt, so you buying second hand doesn’t really benefit them in any way. If you really want the item, buying it second hand is probably the most ethical choice you can make. If someone asks where the piece is from, just say you don’t know so they won’t be tempted to buy from the brand lol
text:I agree but this is also a slippery slope that I have personally succumbed to. If you can afford to spend a little more, Id say spend some time finding ethical brands that fit your style. They’re out there somewhere. The stuff I find on Poshmark usually is just okay fitting and i almost always find a good reason why the original owner wanted to sell it (e.g. slightly ill fitting.) instead of wasting money (and gas/materials because packages need to be packaged and shipped), take the time to research companies and KNOW YOUR MEASUREMENTS if you want to buy online.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 21, 2020	labels:Any suggestions on jogger pants?  I've been a longtime Levi's-jeans-only type of person but lately I've been liking joggers more and more. But everywhere I look for joggers it's mostly sweatpant-style joggers; I'm looking for a more durable material--maybe canvas or something, I don't work in an office but they don't need to be extremely heavy duty either--that I can wear every day as a jean replacement, hopefully even having belt loops. Preferably sub-$40 because I need multiple pairs of new pants after quarantine made my old ones not fit haha.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 22, 2020	labels:Does anybody know of good jacket brands that are somewhat affordable but stylish? I’m trying to branch out and try new brands and colors (like red, brown, green, white, etc.)
text:It depends on what you mean by affordable.  If you're just scraping by Uniqlo/HM/ASOS are all fast fashion brands (as much as Uniqlo hates to be called fast fashion) they will look alright but leave something to be desired construction wise. People will pretend like clothes from HM/ASOS will literally fall apart compared to Uniqlo but the truth is their both fast fashion brands and with the exception of sweaters and SOME jeans the construction is pretty comparable. You'll also find a lot more interesting options at HM/ASOS than you'll find at Uniqlo.  Zara is pretty affordable and has some interesting pieces/designer copy-cats but the quality is barely better than HM/ASOS and the prices are way higher.  AllSaints on sale is pretty good value preposition but they don't have very many colored garments. The pieces are interesting nonetheless however.  Like /u/TheVirt said J. Crew on sale is great too, albeit a bit lacking in the interesting piece department.  Some other individual brands around that price-point would be Carhartt WIP, Alpha Industries, and The North Face (if you don't mind the branding.)   Then moving up you could start looking at multi-brand clothiers like Mr. Porter, SSENSE, End Clothing, etc. for more options and brand ideas.  The secondhand market with Grailed, Poshmark (Full disclosure: I have no experience with Poshmark, only Grailed) etc. isn't bad either if you have the time to sort through and do your own research on brands.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I have a pretty extensive budget that I still have plenty of room for clothes shopping in! I have had a budget since I started working professionally 3 years ago.  I have three sections: Bills (phone, rent, student loans, power etc), Expenses (food, gas, “fun”) and Savings (anything I’m saving up for: laptop, trips, gifts, my niece’s college fund, hobbies, and clothes! As well as an emergency fund where everything else goes).  I generally consider the clothing fund to be a low priority so I set about $40 a paycheque to it, but I don’t necessarily spend that much every two weeks. I also usually cap it at $500, where if it’s grown to that amount then I take my $40 every two weeks and put it to something else.   Generally I don’t spend all of it before a new paycheque comes along but if I do, I will use some of my “fun” money in expenses to cover the rest.   I have gotten two pay increases in the last two years as well as moved houses twice + paid off my loan (different bill amounts) so whenever I readjust my budget I start with my bills, generally keep my fun + grocery amounts the same, and then increase my savings categories a bit while mostly prioritizing putting the excess into my emergency account. When I started working I think I was setting aside $20 or $25 for clothes, now up to $40.  Maybe more long-winded than you wanted but that’s the jist :)	episode_done:True

text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:Your wounds may still be fresh; even if it was a mutual breakup there are lingering emotions.   This is a different take, but why not put it in storage for a little while until you can heal?  If you really like the jewelry in an aesthetic sense there is no reason to get rid of it. When my first real boyfriend and I broke up (mutual but messy) I put some gifts he gave me in my memory box and didn't touch it for years. More than enough time has passed for those emotions to mellow and now I can look at those memories as something sweet and valuable in my past without any romantic connotations.
text:I actually have moved on quite fully, and am happily involved in a new relationship but do like that idea of putting it away for a while to see if it helps with the detachment!

Your outfits are a really good example of beautiful, grown-up outfits that don't need jewelry to feel complete.
text:Thank you! Textures is one of the things I struggled with for the longest time, I think the thing that helped me the most was jut going for the dumb statement pieces (velvet blazer, the skirt that has a ton of different textures in itself, lace) rather than buying the same mostly cotton/jersey basics.  Cozy fits are my favourites :)  I have a bunch of cool rings, so when I’m in the mood I’ll just put all of them on. But I don’t really see them as part of the outfit since I’m not picking them specifically based on what I’m wearing, if that makes sense? I wish I was more of a jewellery person, but the stuff I like is a bit expensive and I’d rather spend that money on clothes, and I’m also so lazy in putting it on. That’s an amazing compliment that you think my outfits work without, thank you!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls” catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your “fashion house designers” but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I’ve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.

text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:Am I the only one that doesn't see how the Teddy jacket would give off peaked in high school lettermen jacket vibes like all the lurkers that were clearly bullied by jocks are claiming?  Obviously it's inspired by letterman jackets, but removing the contrasting leather sleeves and not having a TGI Friday's wall's worth of shit stitched onto it completely changes the vibe. I don't know, maybe I just associate it more with rockstar because it's an SLP piece and Alex Turner was the first celebrity I saw a photo of wearing it.

text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession). I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession 🤣
text:I think that’s true, although I’ve noticed the beige color palette all over home decor too.  I associate it with a certain SoCal aesthetic.	labels:Complete the look with gold wire accessories and household objects made of gray concrete.

text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:I will pay more for 100% cotton, linen, wool, cashmere and silk.  I will not pay more for anything else in 100% material including denim (uncomfortable), modal, tencel etc. I pay less for mixes, especially if it’s natural mixed with artificial, that seems to lead to pilling.  As for quality, the best way to tell is to literally feel it. It’s hard to describe but if you go to the most expensive (especially men’s clothes and minimalism/ethical focused) boutiques you can find and feel their fabrics, you will develop a touch for it. The material is almost always denser, heavier, and thicker than you are used to. That’s not to say $$$$ equals quality - but IMO it’s the best way to “learn by feel” is to find a large concentration of it. Quality is sometimes super affordable but relatively rare - for example, Hanes “ultra weight” t-shirts are some of the best quality 100% cotton tees you can buy and is very cheap (but also no design/super basic).  When I go into a new store - I don’t even pull out items on “sight”, I pull them out by feel, remember the brands that feel good and then see what else they have.  For online shopping, I stick to the same brands over and over. My favorite t-shirts, tanks and other simple tops for example are from Hanes, Wol Hide, Le Bon Shoppe, The Great, Tela9, Lilla P, and Sunspel. How do I know? I’ve felt them in person, bought them, worn and washed them, and when I need a new item, I go there first.	episode_done:True

If we're talking effortless, I don't put on makeup either.

text:Just how revolutionary is Harry Styles’ Vogue cover?	labels:I like the gesture a lot and things like this make me as a queer person feel more safe...  *however*, that doesn't stop me from saying I think this shoot was poorly styled. The looks just don't do it for me and in some ways they look incomplete. It looks like he decided to wear a dress the day he showed up to the shoot. It just seems, for lack of a better term, lazy. Like they didn't really care what this meant. He needed more hair and makeup work in my opinion. Something to make people look at it and be like "wow, he looks really pretty and I bet he feels it”  or some eye color would've pulled the whole thing together. Or a pretty necklace! I think lacking these little details is why people will say he didn't pull it off and is sort of a let down considering what this symbolizes. Open to hearing from other people who support the look, tho
text:I like it precisely because it looks slightly unfinished or unconsidered. Harry Styles has a really intense stylist and it’s vogue, there is absolutely no chance that these outfits were not considered to death by a bunch of really knowledgeable people.   He is definitely not meant to look pretty, and to me that’s part of the point. He’s just ... wearing a dress. It doesn’t even really look feminine per se, which I guess is what you’re reacting too. I think the point was really to not associate the dress with femininity, but to just treat it as another piece of clothing. That’s kind of how he deals with his sexuality: he studiously avoids making any statements whatsoever.   I think the place that I see something historical is not in the dress but in the fact that it’s a vogue cover. I don’t know if this was a one time thing or if vogue is going to now be more gender diverse with their cover models. To me that’s the question: is the point that he is a feminine man or rather that Vogue can set these categories aside on one of their covers, which is a really culturally significant object.  This made waves precisely because it was a Vogue cover. He has worn dresses before without this reaction. But it doesn’t clarify vogue’s position on gender really. My sense is that to they will occasionally feature male-identified models on their cover, and just generally observe more fluid norms around gender. In a way Harry is just the tool for Vogue to make a big move within their own history, maybe...	labels:Thanks for that response. I can totally see how my angle was gendered. I was projecting my personal aesthetic and not considering the greater statement. I’m glad it resonates with you both symbolically and in the visual presentation. I love conversations like this.
text:Yeah I like conversations like this too. I can suddenly see how it would just like weird and uninteresting if you had pretty clear gender categories. I feel more in the mix like he seems to, so it definitely does resonate with me. I think the thread below is interesting too, that it’s because he was seen as a hot male celebrity in One Direction and has gradually wound up wearing a dress on the cover of Vogue. I am not actually a super radical gender person, but there is something about Harry Styles that resonates extremely strongly with me. I frankly can’t say why.  The ppl in the other thread are emphasizing how there’s nothing inherently new about what he is doing but I disagree. I think he represents a very widely-consumable version of a gender queering position. He is at once legible as a British rock star and something very contemporary. It comes back to the sense of insouciance. I know everything he is doing is deliberate, but his attitude is that none of it should matter. I think other instances of celebrity gender bending were framed as being subversive, whereas he is trying to treat us as precisely not subversive but nothing. It’s a complicated move, for his radical thing to be to pretend that what he is doing isn’t radical. But for me it works and is quite smart and meaningful (even if it is, as the ppl in the other thread are saying, a series of calculated decisions, I don’t think it’s only that. I think he is following something genuine and internal, even if he is a professional concerned with having a successful career. He does strike me as being actually genuine in a sort of rare way. Idk. This was a long response, which shows how intensely his dress thing is impacting me.	labels:I’m glad you feel safe to express yourself here. I like what you had to say. I work to live without gender categories and I definitely projected just some of my aesthetic choices. I go for polished looks that are “complete” from head to toe so my first reaction was “needs some makeup”. But you’ve pointed out it’s more of a dejection of all that instead of just putting together a feminine look.   I wanna pose a question to you. Do you like Harry as the subject for something like this over someone like Billy Porter? Why or why not?	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:I think the advice for "what to wear for job interviews" has changed a *lot* since the sub started. Increasingly suits aren't even a good idea in a lot of industries and you'll be over dressed.  Further, the advice from before was often to get "one good suit" and to spend a lot of money at Suit Supply or similar.   I think for a lot of people, suits will be so infrequently needed that spending $400 on a suit is most likely over kill. Especially if you're a student and on a budget.  Read the guides on how a suit should fit, a lot of that hasn't changed too much. Then go somewhere where you can try the garments on in person (writing this for if/when COVID ends) and go from there. I find it weird to recommend to beginners to try and order a suit online without seeing how the garment fits on you first or spending more than around $200 if it's something you'll need maybe twice a year for the career fairs.  Get something in a basic navy or charcoal, brown dress shoes, a white dress shirt, and a basic grenadine tie to go with it. Easy.
text:I was going to post something like this.  Very workplace/industry dependent.  If possible, reach out to someone at that company in that team or department.  When interviewing for my last position, I was instructed very plainly to NOT wear a tie.  Director doesn't want to see extremely formal interview attire.  If you wear a suit at all at my workplace, (when we actually went into the office), I would assume you are in sales or something that is customer facing.  Everyone else dresses extremely casually.  All that being said-buy a grey or navy pinstripe suit if you are not going to a funeral.	labels:> All that being said-buy a grey or navy pinstripe suit if you are not going to a funeral.  A pinstripe suit says to me you're either trying to be Mad Men, or you're an East Coast rich kid; even among suit occasions they're *extremely* rare in my experience in California (and also in movies, tv, etc) so I would definitely not recommend that as a general rule.
text:What are your thoughts on windowpane? Genuinely curious	labels:I also don't see it often, but don't have similar biases about it.

text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:No, no, no and no. I hate the aesthetic thing.

text:The Venn diagram of things I would actually buy has the following circles: fits my aesthetic, fits my budget, makes me excited at the outfit possibilities, will make me happy to put on in the morning, will fill in an empty space in my wardrobe, is eco-friendly. Last 2 somewhat optional, but I’m trying to make them as essential as the first 4.  My aesthetic is pretty broad (across several categories of garments and “styles” of dress), but having a more cohesive wardrobe means I have more opportunity to mix and match items and get more wear out of each, so there’s that as an advantage.  I don’t think anyone should force the aesthetic thing until and only if they feel naturally pulled towards that aesthetic specifically, and they know that the things that fall out of that aesthetic won’t bring them as much joy to put on as the things that fit in it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:Skiing is a strenuous sport, often done in a dangerous alpine climate. I wear technical gear: bright loose waterproof jacket and pants for visibility and mobility, wicking warm base layers, balaclavas and goggles to protect my eyes and skin, a helmet, and a backpack or fanny pack with an emergency kit.   After skiing, I strip off the outer layers and walk around in uggs, tights, and turtleneck.   You know what? I 100% blend in. I don't look better or worse than the hundreds of other people who have just come down from the mountain. This is why people specifically wear bright colors. Your party will be able to identify you at a distance from the specific colors you're wearing.   I think ski/apres ski style is to skiing what cottage core is to farming/homesteading. It's an aesthetic for people who don't actually do it.   If you like the look and aren't interested in skiing, then look into some New England heritage preppy looks. The bean boots, scandi wool sweaters, thick stretchy stirrup pants, fluffy trimmed accessories, and parkas may appeal to you. Uniqlo has some cute stuff in their recent collab that has that cozy lux vibe. Moncler and Gorsuch are some OG European ski fashion wear companies. You could look into those for inspiration.   But definitely don't try to go skiing without a waterproof pant and jacket combo. You will have a terrible time, given how much you will likely fall. (Assuming that you're a beginner.)
text:Seconding this from Colorado. My apres ski style is my Uniqlo Heattech shirt, Patagonia 1/4 zip, and some kind of wool leggings. And snowboots. I look just as shabby and sweaty as everyone else in the brewery/lodge!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I see business casual as an opportunity to express yourself a bit more. My casual Friday go-to is jeans (because I don't normally wear those M-TH) and a trendy sweater or blazer w/ men's type shirt under-- coordinating belt and accessories are a must for me no matter what day. Pair this with casual flats or boots. My Friday looks are less stuffy than my M-TH attire. I work in higher ed; it's not suits level attire M-TH, but managers on up shouldn't be wearing jeans during the week at my place of work. Friday is where I show a bit more of my personality. I never knew I had so much to say about casual Friday attire. lol	episode_done:True

OTOH, maybe there is a giant international shadow market that is trying to corner the nylons market.  Who knows.  I hope whoever swiped my package is happy, though.

Would a seersucker shirt or heavy irish linen shirt look bad with flannel trouses since they are usualy asociated with different seasons?  Any recommended shirting for flannel trousers?
text:That would probably be a bad match. Oxford and flannel are good heavier textures. If the pants are dressy, you can't go wrong with broadcloth or twill. Herringbone can make for a nice, soft, in-between shirt. Denim is less summery than chambray.	labels:	episode_done:True

The angora industry turned into a depraved mess, and a surprising amount of people don’t seem aware that silk worms are often killed during production. Peace silk does try to avoid this.
text:I though this when reading, but then you could have an 'ethics' (for want of a better word) section for each fabric. Maybe a note at the top that all industries have issues when it comes to production standards, and to research the company you're buying from to ensure they are sourcing their textiles responsibly.	labels:	episode_done:True

Everyone keeps saying that clothing companies should make MIUSA products because they'll pay more for them but it's all talk. People don't care. People just want cheap clothing.
text:to be fair, made in (own country) isn't a very big draw card. why would you care that much? if you want it to be of higher quality, sure go with countries that have higher manufacturing standards. that's a generalization though. the fact is that many Asian manufacturers are quite good these days.	labels:	episode_done:True

I'll be wearing a single breasted medium-dark blue flannel suit with a double breasted waistcoat of the same material. Bridesmaids will be in a hunter green.  I was thinking a silk grenadine in a silver or gray for myself and I was looking at Chipp Neckwear.  For my groomsmen I was thinking a slightly darker gray, maybe in a wool or something with a bit of texture.  Would love any feedback or suggestions. My budget is flexible around $80.	episode_done:True
text:Effortless style - let's exchange tips and tricks	labels:Gonna weigh in for the fatties, nothing looks effortless, just sloppy and like you haven’t showered in 3 weeks unless you’ve put in a maximum amount of effort into well fitting clothes, hair , nails, makeup , shoes and accessories. Every. Single. Day.  But I don’t have time for that BS.
text:Maybe because my feed is a lot of plus size/fat bodies, but I find this type of thinking terribly depressing. I won't pretend that terms like "effortless" are meant for us, but it also can feel even more exclusionary in a way when I see other fat people being like "never will I be considered to look this good!! no matter the effort I put in!!!".	labels:That’s not what I’m saying. Plus size can be beautiful, but never effortless. I don’t wear makeup, mostly wear sneakers because good luck finding feminine shoes in 11.5 women’s, and I alternate between jeans + T-shirt and dresses. I still look like a hobo, with expensive taste.	episode_done:True
text:How would you style or rebuild your wardrobe around your holy grail fashion piece?	labels:Pear shape with a big arse - I want Lauren Bacall style wool trousers. Fluid, full, and fitting just so on the waist. Styled classic for work with an equally full and fluid washed silk shirt, rolled up sleeves and tucked in with a patent waist belt. For brunch dates with a bateau neck tee that fits like a second skin, and for evenings with a low backed long sleeved version of the same. A chunky, cropped length fisherman’s jumper if theres a chill on casual strolls

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.

text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:You gotta take your measurements. Sizing can change even within a brand.

text:Wardrobe not updated	labels:What makes sense for you, your life, your budget, your mental health, your storage space etc? These are questions I consider for myself.   Following fashion trends can be fun to engage in, but I'd recommend asking yourself whether you follow the trend because you like it or you feel societal pressure. Are you doing it for yourself? If so, is there something else you could be doing to substitute that would cost less money, use up less space, last longer, etc?   I've acquired a few things since Covid, and the later purchases have been way more mindful than what I bought initially. I've been investing more time into hobbies I've been meaning to get back into in lieu of online window shopping mindlessly. You see more things to buy, you'll likely have more urges to shop.   It does feel like my wardrobe is in a time capsule-- more so the idea of "these are clothes I wore pre-Covid" and now "these are the clothes I currently wear." In a way, things feel dated because they are no longer in active rotation. But I don't feel the need to get rid of things I like. If I no longer like them, then there's no reason to hold onto them.  I bought warm clothes for the winter and I've been very grateful. I don't pay a lot of attention to trends as an indicator for what I should buy, but rather if I like something then I might invest time into finding the right version of x piece. But lately... I can't justify too many purchases and that's okay! Enjoying trends vicariously is just as good as owning something.	episode_done:True

I'm a simple gal. 🤷‍♀️  Side note, I wear orthodics so my shoe choices are based on whether I can rip out the insole and fit my orthodics. Unfortunately this means no sandals during the summer unless I really think it's worth it to sacrifice cuteness for knee pain!

text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:I think just occasionally you find something that fits perfectly and you just know! Sometimes it depends on the garment as some have more leeway than others. Giveaways for a bad fit are as already mentioned with shoulder seams etc. Buttons pulling, waistbands not being flat to the waist at the back etc	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 02, 2020	labels:I've never really been able to figure out how pants should fit at the waist. I'm a relatively slim guy looking guy but I carry a lot of my weight right in my waist. Thus makes it hard for me to find pants that "fit", I feel like most things that I feel okay about around my skinny ass legs give me a bit of a muffin top, although I can usually for a finger between the waistband and my visceral fat without too much effort. I guess the question is: how should pants fit at the waist? Is *any* fat squishing a bad fit?	episode_done:True
text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:Athleta’s Salutation legging in 7/8 length! I don’t like any more compressive feeling leggings, but lululemon Aligns are also a bit too soft and non-supportive feeling; the Powervita fabric on these is soft but also hugs so better for the ass lol. Also, I don’t like leggings that cover my ankles, and the 7/8 length is just right, though they also have full length. Also good if you want mid and high rise and pocket/no pocket options.   Someone else commented about Athleta’s Elation legging, and I’m not sure what the difference is between these two styles, but they’re both made out of Powervita fabric.	episode_done:True

text:I Dyed My Jeans With $6 Dye and Here Are The Results	labels:Just going to put it out there, as a costumer who spends a lot of time dying fabric... RIT dyes   almost never take entirely, and tend to produce spotty results. You can use them in a \*very loose\* dyebath to produce a wash, but for anything else, you're taking the risk of producing a patchy result.     If a garment is truly precious to you, I would definitely recommend hitting up the internet (or a specialist's crafts/fabric store--not just the big chains) for Jacquard or Dharma dyes. They're more expensive, but we're talking about the difference between spending $10 to restore your favorite shirt or $6 to destroy it; I imagine for most folks it'll be worthwhile.	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel the black Friday sales better or worse than usually this year?

We have core items on sale that have never traditionally been able to be less than 10% off.  It’s only for 2 days but we think our main customer base is going to be thrilled.

I’ve been using some of this for a while, and have been looking for ways to go from smart casual to a more business casual, and found a new person who tends to dress in a way which fits with my established comfort zone but with more of a leaning towards where I need to go (workplace with strict dress codes for professional and hygiene reasons). I know virtually nothing about this figure as a person or platform and don’t want to name them as I don’t know how I’d feel about them if I did. But their style? Perfect for my needs, and something I likely wouldn’t have come across otherwise.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 16, 2020	labels:Wow these fits are hard to take seriously. Oh, what’s that? What do *I* wear? I dress in color with modern cuts. What are modern cuts, you ask? How do you not know? You fool. They have good colors. They have *modern* cuts. What are you not getting? They’re unlike the shit colored trash bag silhouettes you all wear. And by all, I mean *ALL*. There’s no variance, no personality in any of your echo chamber outfits. My friends and I used to dress like this 10 years ago anyways. Not only are these cuts not modern, but, even worse, they’re unoriginal.   ^ an aggregate of my favorite lurker takes in the fit battle thread. Can we get a lurkerbot made?

Wear trendy items, don't wear them, just stop trying to make some women "other" than you due to some fashion superiority complex. Lord.
text:I needed this. I’m usually so confident in my outfits but there’s just something about turning 30 plus comments here and there from my older family members that make me second guess myself and make me wonder if I need to find a new style even though I love my clothes and style.	labels:If your clothes and style works for you and your lifestyle, why change it? I think it would be wasteful and shallow to toss it all and buy a whole new wardrobe if the only reason is "I turned 30"   I'm speaking a 30+ woman. One of my favorite things about this decade is for the first time in my life I know what I like and other people can like what they like and we don't have to cater to each other to get along, I can just make choices I want to make and take responsibility for them myself, no need to let others dictate even minute things like the clothes i wear!	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:Buy something from Uniqlo—they are cheap, decent quality, and all of their items have detailed measurements—and just compare other retailer’s sizing info to ‘qlo stuff you already own.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:To answer the question as simply as possible, I would say that in my option the following items have the highest price point in which diminishing returns set in:  - Footwear (shoes / boots) - Jackets (as in coats not blazers)  Once again to keep it simple I would say the reason for this is as follows:  - The amount and size of different (often expensive) materials that make up these products - The amount your likely to wear them - How visible they are as part of your outfit (what I mean by this is if your wearing shoes or a jacket it’s usually the outermost layer and completely visible, a shirt or jumper can be concealed, your jacket can’t be) - The importance of comfort from these items (uncomfortable shoes are torture and a jacket that doesn’t keep you warm / dry is pointless and will make you cold and miserable	episode_done:True

Imo full Yohji fits are some of the coolest and most comfortable looking out there; plus there’s Y-3 for athleisure.

text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I'm a fashion graduate and have worked in fashion in some way since college, I found while I tended to make my own clothing or shop in thrift stores I was still hoarding clothing constantly (mainly with a "oh that fabric might come in handy even if I don't wear that!").   I moved to the UK from the States and realised my South Coast wardrobe wouldn't really work in London. I brought a few staples such as dungarees and jeans that fit like a glove with me and then just rebuilt when I moved.   I tend to ask myself   * Will I wear this in five years time?  * Is this well made? * Does it match at least three other things I own? * Does it make me feel good?   I found that I stayed away from things that were just a 'good deal' and fads. I don't have a Pinterest but I definitely know that I prefer earth tones and tend to stick to those :)	episode_done:True
text:Favorite everyday-fashion magazines	labels:Instyle is probably the best fashion magazine that features a good mix of styles and price points (some stuff is definitely expensive still, but they have lower priced items too). O, the Oprah magazine, isn't just fashion, but there are usually quite a few fashion article, again with varying price points. Both also seem to include items of extended size ranges, which is also nice!
text:I too am a fan of InStyle magazine.   O, the Oprah magazine has gone digital and will only issue print magazines quarterly as of January 2021.  Personally I find this to be a PITA since I prefer a print edition to a digital format for magazines.	labels:Wow, I hadn't heard that about O! I am in charge of my library's magazine subscriptions, so I'm definitely going to have to investigate that!! (It's not unusual for us to not find out about changes in subscriptions, lol. Usually we realize we haven't gotten something in awhile but something random has started to come...)	episode_done:True

text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:Accessories are just as subject to cycles in fashion as anything else, but I always save mine even when I throw out tops and pants. Partly that is because my body won’t outgrow a necklace.   For some reason every woman around me was wearing stars the last two years, and I never saw it outside of this town. But because I had kept some old star earrings I had stopped wearing, I was already set to be on-trend. I think super thin necklaces are on the way out. But if you already have one you really like and don’t mind putting it away for several years, chances are it will be fashionable again.  And since you’re going for adult fashion, don’t forget black leather (or glittery plastic) business card cases. Even if your field doesn’t use business cards, you can put credit cards in them. I like the Francesca’s chain for those.	episode_done:True

text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:Definitely misogynistic and sexist, but it’s also the 1950s so that makes sense. I’m sure Marilyn herself didn’t realize that she was unconsciously being sexist and contributing to the problems that she (and other women) were facing. It’s kind of sad in a way when you think about it.
text:I think Marilyn was very conscious of what she was doing here. She carried a folksy persona, deliberately catering to working men and women, and had that "What do you mean by suspecting I'm dressing sexy by wearing dresses so tight they have to be sewn on, I can't help that I'm CURVY! It is those who think it's on purpose that are truly lewd!!"-vibe all the way through.   Basically, she tried to be as sexy as possible, but because that wasn't really allowed due to misogyny, she tried and mostly succeeded to pass it off as pure innocence. Here she is saying "I just want to please you guys, it's only natural - why do you judge me for being feminine? Men like feminine women bla bla" in an attempt to make the media be less judgmental about her livelihood.   She wasn't treated respectfully even though she was a huge star, because even though Holywood wanted a woman who was first and foremost sexy, they also judged and shamed the stars for trying to be exactly that. No wonder she was defensive about it - she lived up to the ideal the most, so she also had to be the spokesperson and defender of it. She was very much aware of her image.	labels:I think I didn’t properly explain what I meant. Her saying that “only women criticize what I wear” is very similar to the things that “oh I’m not like other women”  or “I only hang out with the guys” type of women say. Women like this tend to have internalized misogyny that they are not conscious of, and they continue to contribute to this societal problem by trying to put down other women while elevating themselves.   It’s sad because she suffers from exactly the problem that she is contributing to. I don’t think she had some “evil” thoughts or “connived” behind the scenes - in fact I believe from her personal life (and from people that knew her), she was a very sweet girl who was quite naive (which you can kind of tell based on how her relationships often went).   Also I don’t believe she had control over what she could wear while on set or that very famous JFK dress. Her stylist probably styled her and she had little to no input into her outfits.
text:That's funny, I have also read an absurd amount of litterate on MM, and I have the exact opposite thoughts of her. I think she was a very smart business woman, who knew how to play the game - I don't think being sweet and naive would carry you to the top in 1950's Hollywood. Especially not when she started off as an orphan with nothing to her name.    That being said, I don't think being conniving when you work in the entertainment industry, is evil or anything. I think it's really hard (actually impossible) to project an image as consistently as she did, without being incredibly self aware. She could have internalized misogyny, but she could have also played the "cool girl" in order to win approval.	labels:But see, don’t most women who do “cool girl” have internalized misogyny though?   Also wasn’t MM pretty much abused by her studio? It doesn’t seem very astute or a smart business decision of MM to not have changed studios or given them a side eye. So why didn’t she?  It doesn’t take a lot of brains to make it to the top like MM did, plenty of other pretty girls have done it before and after her. What takes brains is staying at the top and still staying relevant.
text:I think we'll have to agree to disagree. My memory is hazy on this, but I think she did try to start a company of her own or something, because she was so spiteful of how the studio controlled her. She tried to get better deals, because she was at times the actress who made the studio the most money, but was paid very little in relation to that. And she was incredibly passive-aggressive in meeting the studio's demands. You may be right that she handled it in a very naive and not very business-savvy way - but I definitely remember that she did fight for her rights a lot, but was met with resistance time and time again, from people who were more powerful than her. So maybe you're right that she was dumb, but she wasn't passive or unaware.   I think most women who do "cool girl" in real life are definitely very often misgoynist in some way. However, actresses today have to play the same game, and I think they do know. Like how almost every single actress who is interviewed on the matter of body image and dieting, claims to eat fries and pizza and stuff and is just so Naturally Skinny, and therefore not like those Other Girls.   Famous women have to meet strict standards, but they have to pretend that they do so completely by accident. Otherwise, they are punished for being attention seeking or self absorbed. Women should be admired as beautiful objects, but they can't ever try to achieve that on their own - that would be too active, direct, greedy. They have to be completely passive. Approval is something to be granted by others, though no effort of their own.	labels:	episode_done:True

I would wear it with the tailored jeans I'm yet to buy and anyone of my dresses or skirts. The wardrobe is already there- I just need the jacket.	episode_done:True

text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:A huge chunk of my wardrobe is built out from Amazon. I add everything to a list, and wait until Amazon's algorithms decide they need to sell it for $6. They also offer Tall sizes on quite a lot of items, which is great for having sleeves that fit.  Uniqlo for jeans, Amazon's Peak Velocity brand for Tshirts, and Goodthreads for everything else is what I would do if I had to start from Scratch.  If there's a certain type of item your looking for, feel free to ask for recommendations and I can send you a link to what I'd look at.
text:Thanks for sharing!   Items I'm looking for:  \- White sneakers - preferably leather   \- Jeans - Slim/skinny light blue, navy, black   \- Jackets - from bomber jackets to other non-bomber kinds  \- Sweaters or sweatshirts I can layer under my jacket  \- Long sleeve shirts/henleys  \- boots   If you've come across any of these on amazon that you think may be decent purchase I'd love to check it out	labels:Amazon has pretty decent t-shirts and sweatshirts (not knit sweaters!) that you can get for a good price. You can also buy some decent quality sneakers from Amazon too, just make sure it's from a reputable seller and from a recognized shoe brand (Adidas/New Balance/etc.).  &#x200B;  However, for stuff like jeans, jackets, boots, and knitwear, I'd look elsewhere. I've bought jeans from Amazon in the past that came with low-quality buttons and ripped after 2 months of wear, so I don't think the quality is quite there. My recommendation would be to search on places like Uniqlo/Carhartt/Champion or even thrift stores to get better quality jeans/jackets/knitwear that can last you a lot longer than whatever you'd find on Amazon for a comparable price.
text:Yeah - I wouldn't skimp on denim and footwear. A nice pair of boots that will last years and grow patina, same with denim fades. You can skimp a bit on the rest -    for example today I'm wearing: $300 Samurai Jeans, $x00 boots, $x00 vintage watch - but paired with an $8 Hanes cotton/poly sweatshirt from amazon and $5 generic khaki hat from walmart.	labels:Just seconding what others have said about denim, while I love good denim and definitely see the value of a $300 pair, it's definitely possible to skimp on denim and still have it last for years. Of course it won't look as nice as a more expensive pair, but if your goal is just to look presentable then cheaper denim can do the trick imo!	episode_done:True

text:How would you store sentimental clothing?	labels:Safest way is to wrap in acid free paper, store in an acid free box (available at joanns and on line stores).  If you can’t do that, fold it and wrap it in washed, unbleached muslin fabric.   Make sure it is clean before you store it.  Perspiration and food spills can attract pests. If you hang it for display, do not place it in direct sunlight.  Also away from any source of moisture.

text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:I think part of it is just being able to push through that feeling of embarrassment. One of the ways I've got over that in past is to wear something truly ridiculous out and about. It's embarrassing, but it's also very freeing. When I was in high school I wore my mom's wedding dress to class one day - and I think after handling a situation like that I realized that being a big weirdo is very freeing. After doing that, I'd be hard pressed to feel self-conscious about just wearing a regular dress, or heels, or whatever. In comparison those sorts of things become quite tame.   It is empowering to detach from that feeling of self-consciousness and recognize that everyone feels that way. And if you are able to relinquish yourself from that self-consciousness, you have a certain type of power and courage that a lot of people around you do not have. It's empowering to make choices that satisfy yourself, and then to stand up for those choices in front of other people.   You can be in charge of your own narrative. Maybe you're not over-dressed, maybe everyone else is under-dressed. Maybe people make comments - but at least that means that you are interesting enough to notice. Or it gives you a chance to be honest, and really connect with people - there's nothing stopping you from saying, "Yeah, I really want to have a different style and I'm trying to get over the hurdle of changing it!" Because that's something that a lot of people would understand and find relatable.   Convincing yourself is just a matter of internalizing these things.	episode_done:True
text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:I might suggest checking out the book “A Guide to Elegance” by Genevieve Antoine Dariaux. It was written in a different time, but it has a lot of great advice when it comes to “elegance” and how to achieve it. It’s also quite funny!  For example: “To be elegant is first of all to know oneself, and to know oneself well requires a certain amount of reflection and intelligence. Consequently, a woman who is utterly stupid will always find it extremely difficult to become truly elegant.”

text:Exactly my thoughts.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:Honestly I think you have to give way more detail on your old pair and what you’re looking for.  In my mind the biggest hurdle to perfect jeans is the fit, and since every body is different this is highly individual. Some people might prefer stretchier denim for a more forgiving fit, while others look for stiffer fabric, and have less leeway.   Personally I still struggle to find a high rise, non cropped, fits my thighs and waist, plain dark wash, straight/skinny, 90% or more cotton, pair of jeans. But hopefully I’ll find it eventually!
text:My jeans criteria are similar. I wear men's APCs.	labels:I would also consider Naked and Famous if you like that classic menswear style look. They carry some women’s styles as well.

text:Grad/Masters Fashion Program Reality?	labels:Are you actually getting two bachelors by double majoring?  If so then stay the course and finish your degrees. Two bachelors will give you options in both fields and certainly make you a better candidate for a job. If not, then I’d consider taking the two year hit to do what you really want, I didn’t do that and spent my 20s flopping around in different fields.  Best of luck to you!
text:Yes, I’d be getting 2 bachelors!  it’d be a lot of work, but I would have both marketing and fashion design. I think it’s a smart move to get both.  It was Covid at the time when I had to make a transfer decision and it just felt weird starting 4 years all over again. especially while being online. I only have 3 semesters left and thought double majoring then going to grad would be a good compromise.   But I don’t know if it’d just be too late by then.	labels:I would stay the course and get two. I’m in my masters now for a field I should’ve been in a decade ago
text:So you think putting my head down for 1.5 years and getting the Marketing and Fashion Bachelors. Then move onto a grad/MA in fashion design would be more with it?	labels:Oh yes certainly, although I would talk to your advisors and see if grad school is even necessary. I worked in digital marketing (not fashion) with a BS in Psychology and no one cared about masters at my agency.  I started my masters this summer and in two weeks I’ll be over the halfway mark to graduation. A year is nothing and a year and a half is a little more than nothing ;) You’re still so young, I really wouldn’t worry about it!
text:Interesting, I’m just worried that my current school won’t give me enough to go right in to fashion being that they’re a California State school.   I was hoping a masters or even associates from a my focused fashion college could really solidify my skills.	labels:Oh I see, well definitely talk to your academic advisor before deciding on your own to invest in another degree, they can help you make an informed decision. It might just be a matter of taking a few extra courses instead of a whole degree.	episode_done:True

It is our first Christmas in a new home, and our first Christmas not traveling in something like 20 years, so while we will miss seeing friends and family, we are looking forward to just being together and doing the stuff we like to do.   Also I bought three pairs of fleece-lined holiday leggings for $2.99 each at the hardware store a few weeks ago. They probably won't last past New Year's, but they are cozy and festive, and they go with my wardrobe of flannels, sweatshirts, and wool socks, so I am enjoying them.	episode_done:True

But it was time to face the facts that even though its cute on the hanger, doesn’t mean it’ll flatter me. I also got rid of this shirt that was tailored pretty poorly in my opinion.

They’re super flattering, they hold in my belly, and they don’t get baggy in the waist even after multiple wears. To extend the life of your jeans, try to wash them as little as possible and keep them out of the dryer! If your jeans have any kind of elastic in them, the heat of the dryer basically melts it over time so your jeans don’t look as good or last as long.	episode_done:True

For Zappos returns, you print a label, tape it up and take to any UPS place. I have a very difficult time buying shoes, so I might order a dozen pair and sometimes return them all. If the business wants to do this, I am cooperative.  You have to check on Amazon before you purchase and make certain it's returnable. UPS will box it up for you, it's amazing.  I hear Kohl's does also, but I never go there. You can print your own label and return it to an Amazon locker, that's even easier than a UPS store.  I check my measurements carefully and read a lot of reviews. I don't actually return much that I buy except for shoes.  I buy everything online, but bras?

text:Hiking Aesthetic - Functionality vs. Fashion	labels:I wear my yoga clothes with hiking boots and a Patagonia fleece in the summer and fall, Patagonia Radalie jacket in the winter. My friend has a UV protection shirt (REI house brand) which she wears due to the intense UV rays in Colorado. It doesn’t make her feel hot most days. I mostly thrift my yoga/hiking clothes, and really like thrifted Lululemon. Although I hike and do yoga frequently, I won’t buy Lululemon full price when there are so many used gear stores near me. I buy Zella leggings also for both activities. My hiking boots are currently Oboz, my trail running shoes are Asics, and I have heard good things about Salomon hiking boots. Fjallraven has very nice beanies for colder weather.  I definitely say fashion takes a backseat to function for hiking, as you primarily want to be comfortable, however, living in the mountain west, I want to look nice during an activity I do about once weekly, so fashion is at least a consideration for me.  (Edit) You can absolutely hike in your everyday clothing, and I have seen people hike 14,000 foot mountains in gym shorts and a T shirt. As long as your boots and socks are solid and the rest is easy to move in, you’re honestly good to go.

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:Many store-bought knits are made from cheap, synthetic blends that tend to pill faster. Manufacturers sometimes take short cuts and will simply cut pieces from knitted fabric whereas a handknitted item is knit to a particular shape with increases and decreases worked into the design. With mass production, knitted pieces that are sewn together will be more likely to have imperfections, like the arm seam and side seam not meeting up. There are details in hand knits that are too expensive to replicate on a mass-produced scale so you're probably less likely to see knits with intricate details.  For sewing, I tend to choose quality fabrics because I hate cheap synthetics and like my points for knitting, they can age poorly. I've seen RTW items with crooked stripes, missed stitching on binding, inconsistent sizing, etc. These are things that a sewist will likely take the time to avoid or correct.   Finer details are disappearing from a lot of RTW we see because it's too expensive or time-consuming, like blind hems, lining, etc. We're seeing more elastic waists, offset sleeves, stretchy fabrics, S/M/L sizes instead of numbered sizes and other details that make the fit more forgiving so it fits more customers. Something like those retro dresses with fitted bodices made from a woven fabric are rare for RTW because the fit would be so finicky. The majority of wedding dresses are strapless because it's a pain to have fitted sleeves, especially in a non-stretch fabric. You're able to satisfy a much wider customer base by eliminating details like those. If you sew your clothes, you can choose to do something with a more particular fit.	episode_done:True

text:A Basic Guide to Useful Knitwear	labels:I’m going to disagree that no seams is a rule of thumb for better construction—sometimes those seams help give you more structure and a better tailored look. It depends on the type of sweater you’re aiming for, of course, but something like a shawl collared cardigan in a heavy knit would benefit from a size seam to help keep it from ending up around your knees by the end of the day.   If you’re a trans man like myself, the side seam will help give you a line for the eye to follow along the sides of your body, too.   I only add these as considerations because I knit and design my own garments and while the rule of thumb isn’t necessarily entirely wrong, it’s really more nuanced than “avoid side seams because it’s better constructed”	episode_done:True

text:How do you guys who like a formal/business look manage to not look the same all the time?	labels:Accessories?  I guess switching it up with statement necklaces or earrings.  And shoes, having some really powerful statement shoes can go a long way to draw attention away from the fact that it's the same blouse you always wear.  But I also subscribe to the capsule wardrobe theory, so in general I'm not particularly bothered about wearing the same 10 outfits because I set myself up for that on purpose.
text:Ah man that’s such a good idea! I just wish I knew how to accessorize. I really want to get more into jewellery but don’t know where to start!!

text:Are jean shorts on men really that bad?	labels:I don't think they look bad, I just find the concept weird.  It's summer, it's hot so you're wearing shorts, but the shorts are made from denim which is a hot and sweaty material. It's an oxymoron to me, like have you got your legs out to stay cool or have you got the denim on to stay warm? What's going on here?
text:I wear them almost exclusively in the summer. Cut off jorts and bands shirts. I just think shorts made from other material just aren’t my style or something... when I wear them they just look like I’m trying to look “preppy” or something. I wear chinos to work. I wear skinny clothes always. I wear beat up Vans and cut off jean shorts at home. I just can’t do fabric shorts.	labels:Have you tried baggies from Patagonia?	episode_done:True
text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I actually started working from home June '19, so I've been trying to hone in my look from "working retail in a major city, commuting on public transit and being gone for 14-16 hours a day, to living on an isolated mountain and only leave the house like every 10 days and being in my home studio.   I started an Ootd instagram I've hidden from all my family and friends to kind of... Keep track of what I'm actually wearing? Also my weight fluctuates A LOT. (Summer hiking and lots of walks, winter were snowed in....) So picking clothing now that changes with my weight and still feels... Pretty. (Wrap skirts, tshirt dresses, leggings, eleatic and tie waist bottoms are all life savers!!)   Get dressed every day, really. Even if it's just different sweats, the routine is good for the human brain.	episode_done:True
text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:I'm hoping those "Is it Wine o'clock?" shirts (or anything involving  women drinking wine to deal with life) you find at any mall store/Target directed towards adults.   Perhaps it's because I can no longer pass as a youth and will no doubt get thrown into the demographic these companies sell to, but it's always painful when you start to see a trend in clothes and you hate it, and it lasts YEARS.
text:All of these things. Not just about wine, but every pity, stupid, sarcastic shit ever. It's not cute, it's not funny, and I would be embarrassed to wear that. Also, wine is hella overrated and I would rather drink anything else.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:It’s 2021. A vaccine for the virus has been made widely available and businesses may operate at full capacity, including bars, clubs, salons, etc. How will this influence fashion?	labels:Fashion is going to be bling bling style again. Just loud and sparkly to make up for the sadness of this year. Those horrible velour tracksuits will be back, hopefully not in pastel colours because deeper colours will be more modern.   Same goes for makeup. Unlike the ashy pastel makeup from the bling bling era, I'm thinking deeper shades and shimmers, multichromes for eyeshadows. Glossy lips too since masks are gone and liquid lipsticks have been around for a long time, but with colours not clear like old times.	episode_done:True
text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:You see this a ton in the world of lingerie, maybe even more so than clothing.  I think it’s impossible for a designer to truly say they own a design element, so dupes and items that have been inspired by other designs are fine by me. If design houses are often ‘inspired’ by smaller indie labels anyway. They bring to trend to mainstream, and it filters down.   I don’t think the example you mentioned would hurt Sezane. The knockoffs allow more people to wear the trend who couldn’t afford ‘the original’ and seeing the design become really popular and trendy would probably make more people want to purchase it. The people who tend to shop from sezane or other higher priced retailers aren’t likely to buy knockoffs because they want higher quality.   The one thing I think is wrong is people selling fakes, trying to pass it off as a genuine designer item. This could either be a high quality dupe of a high end designer, or cheap amazon listings using a photo of the garment they’re copying, when the reality is they’re selling you something much worse. Unfortunately this kind of thing is becoming rampant as if you can shut down one retailer, they just make a new amazon/Ali express store and start again.	episode_done:True
text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:If you’re gonna be moving a lot an outdoor brand will probably be your best bet, and Patagonia has never failed me before. If you have a retail store available and municipal rules allow you to visit I would pop in and chat with a salesperson who could better dial in your needs with the right jacket. I’ve only had good experiences at the stores I’ve gone to when I was actively looking to buy. Good luck!  I don’t ski but it doesn’t look like the Isthmus is for high output? You might get uncomfortable/clammy in that parka  if you’re gonna be active.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 10, 2020	labels:The right fit is so difficult. I have been looking for selvedge denim that has the silhouette of joggers or skinny jeans (slim thru the thigh, hugs the knee and smaller ankle opening) with the comfort of more baggy jeans(doesn't restrict your crotch). Tapered fits are still a bit baggy in the ankle area for my taste.  Haven't found one that can do both. I ordered some Uniqlo jeans and I'll have the tailored, which still turns out to be a pretty good deal.  Any suggestions out there that can help me out. I'm debating whether to buy skinny jeans with a mid rise and 2" larger waist. Looking at the Gustin mystery grab deal, could lean toward a Skinny 35" since I've heard their fits are looser than most.  For reference : im 5'9 173lbs. my waist is about 34" and inseam around 31".

text:Revisiting Tim Gunn's List of 10 Style Must-haves	labels:To me, this is “wardrobe staples if you have a traditional office job with a business dress code” tbh. I do, so I own a version of most of these, but that kind of work environment is less and less common, and I think a lot of women no longer have much use for blazers, trench coats, dress pants, etc.
text:It's a dated list that only worked for a specific kind of person/lifestyle in a very specific kind of climate/weather. Even thinking of my most successful friends, none of these are relevant to my life or that of my peers, except for jeans lol. It's funny how alien it actually is, when they're supposedly "must haves".	labels:Weirdly, I’m very much a person to whom the list is totally applicable, since I wear suiting to work so I own and wear multiples of almost everything on the list.   But because of that I know exactly how unusual that is, I think, since literally no one in my social circle has the same kind of work wardrobe I have and I’ve seen so much here about what most people consider “work appropriate” but would *never* be acceptable for me. I feel like I work in the world’s last (not business formal) office where jeans are not even a possibility and suit jackets (even ties for men) are the norm, not unusually formal.   I hope that once covid is over and I go back to the office, things will relax a little since we’ve been seeing each other in tees and sweaters over Zoom for so long, but I have a feeling I’m still gonna have to yank on some hosiery and a blazer and toddle on back in my pumps like no one ever saw me wearing a pair of purple floral leggings chasing my dog out of a room on a videoconference.	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Main tip would be to try not to care too much about what others think and do what makes you feel good. I started gaining more confidence when I actually started wearing the clothes I found cute. It was gradual of course and I felt a little self conscious at first but as time went on I felt so much better about myself until I became completely confident in everything I wore. It sucks that your mom discouraged you but I would just say not to mind it and do what you feel like doing. At the end of the day it’s you wearing the clothing- not your mom, and you should feel great wearing whatever you’re wearing! Good luck	episode_done:True

It was some comment about how people who basically wear cowboy shit are “attention seekers.” This was very clearly framed as a bad thing. Western wear aside, I feel like the subtext of the comment was basically “if you’re not wearing something to fit in, you’re seeking attention.” Isn’t the pursuit of dressing better/more fashionably inherently attention seeking? And why is that a bad thing? I don’t understand what seems to be the lurker notion of “wanting to dress better to blend in better.” If wearing the shit I wear labels me as an “attention seeker,” then I’ll wear that badge proudly.

text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:My situation was the opposite as far as I know me and my sister were allowed to choose to wear what we wanted from as early as I remember. I also had a job as a teen so I could afford my fashion design hobby. I'm in my early 30s now and I think I finally found my style, but I'm struggling to feel amazing about it as I'm a bit overweight and I think things that I like simply look better on slimmer women.  Anyhow: I experimented loads as a teen and ever since, really. Buying things, wearing them or not, making things. It takes time to figure out which of the things you own get a lot of wear and which don't. You could go to second hand shops as it's cheaper to buy more here to experiment with. A lot also depends on any demands from your job, if you currently work. If you can freely wear whatever, you can go nuts. Some things that are great staples irrespective of style are some quality black leggings, nice trainers, good tops or bras for support, a nice handbag, backpack, and a few nice coats.  You could flip through magazines or websites and save any photos of style that appeals to you or simply individual pieces you like. Look at people in the street and take notes of any insights you gain from that.  I was very into goth stuff for daily wear until I went to art school and didn't want to get nice clothes dirty so I ended up wearing sports/athleisure gear. Now that I have a working from home office job I'm just wearing athleisure)chill stuff too but when I go out I try to dress in my style, which I've accepted is boho/eclectic/a mix. I've stopped trying to find a style and I'll just wear individual things I like, so I end up with a lot going on at times (big coat, patterned leggings, coloured trainers, hippie jewellery, an army style cross body bag etc. That's just me. I'm happy to look a bit strange and not according to one style.  You'll get there :).	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: Why/ when/ how do you cuff jeans?	labels:**Why:** to make the hemline higher, to provide a visual break between your pants and your shoes (useful if they're a similar colour), or because they are raw denim that will bleed on your shoes excessively if you don't. I suppose some people also cuff in order to flex the selvedge ID, but why condemn yourself to a life of fruitlessly hoping that somebody will notice your selvedge ID?  **How:** idk, you just kind of roll them up. Usually a width of about an inch looks good, but experiment with wider or narrower cuffs as well as with the height of the hem and see what looks good.
text:Mine are selvedge and I cuff them as the jeans only came in one length and I can't be bothered to hem them.   The contrast provided by the selvedge is also pretty nice.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:I grew up in a larger family without a lot of money, so I got really good at maximizing the number of pieces that I could buy on a tiny budget. The down side of that was that I got into a bad habit of buying pieces that weren't quite me because my selection was limited to what I could find in my size on sale racks. And then with limited access to laundry in college/early career, I'd prioritize quantity over quality so that I could make fewer laundry trips.  Now that I'm more financially secure and have a washer-dryer in my apartment, I am a lot more picky about what pieces I buy. I want the fits, styles, fabrics, and colors to be things that I truly love, rather than what's good enough and cheap. I can wait longer to find a piece that I truly love, and spend a little more on that piece, rather than buying the cheapest thing that I can find that will serve a particular need. I also don't feel the need to buy things just in case I need them, because if a need does pop up, I can afford to buy something to fill that need. And that's something that I think a lot of people who grow up with money don't realize--when you don't have a lot, any unplanned expense can be an emergency, and so you end up keeping a lot of things you don't use often because you know you can't afford to replace them. Downsizing the amount you own is much easier mentally when you know you can afford to replace a stained sweater, so you don't need to keep that one that doesn't quite fit right but is presentable enough.	episode_done:True

text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I think the size of your wardrobe is going to depend on your climate, job, hobbies, and general lifestyle. I have a lot more clothing than that. I also live in a place with four seasons. I have outdoorsy hobbies that require some tougher clothes. I can‘t wear my casual clothing to work (and I’m also holding onto some more professional clothing from a past job in case I return to that field). I don’t have a lot of disposable income either, so I always keep things like dress pants even though I never wear them in my everyday, because I can’t afford to go shopping when interviews and funerals come up.  For instance, I probably have at least 15 dresses alone, once you count all the strappy sundresses, nice work dresses, wool sweater dresses, the cocktail dresses, and the evening gown that’s in the back of my closet - and everything in between.  I swap out my clothing with the seasons and have one closet that I share with my husband, so I try to be judicious about what I keep, while giving myself grace that I don’t need to get rid of something just because I don’t wear it regularly.
text:I mostly try to use the same clothes across hobbies, though maybe I can get away with this because I don't need specific clothes for hobbies.   For me summer is super thin wool. Fall and spring I add on a lightweight wool or puffer jacket. Winter I wear both the puffer and wool jacket and a rain coat to block the wind. Though I am worried about having too many clothes, so I was very careful about being able to layer across seasons. Having one coat for each season would be the problem for me. Having multiple that I can layer and get use throughout the year is fine.   I have a little linen that can be added in here and there for purely aesthetical reasons, worn between the lightweight wool and warmth layers.  I also work in tech, so it is all t-shirts and jeans, so I'm usually the one who is "over" dressed. I pretty much only work, hike and lounge at home. So everything I do is "casual." I haven't been to even a business casual event in over 6 years. So yes, lifestyle definitely means I just don't need many clothes.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:“Sadd” Colors: 1620s Puritans to 2021	labels:Any idea what colors the Puritan colonies would have even had access to make locally?   I'm wondering if the association with more garish colors related in their minds to foreign trade and is maybe more about how they feel towards external cultures.
text:I think their dislike for garish colors began in England, before they began building a colony in MA Bay. Most of their dyes would have been vegetable and plant dyes.  They definitely had an air of superiority and settler colonialism to the way they dressed, and they even disliked the fancy colors preferred by the more Anglican Virginia elite.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are you hoping to buy on Black Friday?	labels:I haven’t planned yet but I’m glad of a few weeks to prep.  Most importantly, I need new running and hiking shoes (different ones) and would love to nab them on sale.  I’d also love to grab new socks and tights and replace some worn out pairs in my drawer, and maybe score one great underwire bra to complement my bralettes. Optionally, id also love a new swimsuit, but it’s very easy to pick the wrong size online.   In sartorial matters, I have been doing luxury minimalism for a long time and would love to score some loud accessories - a new everyday handbag in warm brown/ taupe tones (I have several in black but none in brown), some statement jewelry or scarves. I am also in the market for really adventurous, ethereal pieces, like big dresses, loud coats, colorful blouses, and structured pants.	episode_done:True

The pink suit can act as an almost neutral.    I do not love light pink paired with dark colors - so I’d pick something leading with a light color. Or a graphic pattern that is bright or light.   If your suit is hot pink or darker - I love mustard and bright pink. It is a really fun combo. Green is pretty classic. As is grey. Cobalt blue can be nice with a saturated pink. You could do tone on tone with another pink top.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 24, 2020	labels:Hey hey—I bought two pairs of Uniqlo slim fit jeans, waist 35"—and they've both failed by fabric separation in the crotch. They were on sale, they used Kaihara denim, and were made in Bangladesh. My first thought is that fit is the probable culprit, because two pairs in a row is a lot. I've bulked up in the past few years and decided to fit waist to hips rather than actual waist, which probably explains the failure right there—although 35" jeans in other brands didn't have the same failure point, and took much longer to fail. (When I was thinner, I got a lot longer than 10 weeks out of a pair of Uniqlo jeans.)  (Disclosure: My hips are 34"; my waist is currently a mighty 42", 39" at full intake. I'm open to sizing there if anyone thinks it's possible for a denim waist not to migrate downward.)  What's my best option? Should I:  a.) size up 2-3 inches (to hips) to get a more accommodating fit, but still get slim-fit jeans  b.) size up 2-3 inches and abandon slim-fit jeans  c.) size up 2-3 inches and switch to jeans made in Japan, whether slim-fit or not, or  d.) size up to my full waist size and wear my jeans higher?  Losing weight isn't a bad option, either…but I'm not going to lose it overnight, and I'm fresh out of jeans without holes! (I'm going to have to re-stitch an old pair for now. 😅)	episode_done:True

text:I needed this.

For when I'm at a new job that involves being in an office all day, travelling through snow and sleet and rain and sunshine 😄 Right now I'm working from home and my outfits are pajamas and slippers.  Also, there was a lot of comfort shopping too, this year has been brutal and painful. If some new boots can make me smile for a week, it's worth it.

I only look at my CC statement to make sure I am not getting rooked on double charges and the like....but the total is hard to look at....and a lot of that is on things like shorts and shirts and things and I rode through the desert on a horse with no name...it felt good to be out of the rain.

text:Revisiting Tim Gunn's List of 10 Style Must-haves	labels:*  little black dress     * I think any solid color dress for semi-formal occasions that can be dressed down to casual or dressed up to business casual are good to keep on hand for emergencies when you don't have time to find anything in particular for an event if you don't typically have events to go to. Patterns can make a dress over casual and sometimes date it, and black can wash a lot of people out. I have a jeweltone purple dress than compliments my red hair and it's my staple dress.  * trench coat    * Have one, love one, makes me feel put together in the fall and spring when I'm wearing my lovely frumpy sweaters and my only pair of waterproof boots.  * classic dress pants    * Personally, no - my office is more good jeans with a top than dress pants, and there's no scenario outside my office in which I'd wear a pair.  * versatile skirt    * I have a black circle skirt and a black mini skirt that goes with all of my sweaters and all of my tank tops. When you want to feel dressy but not too dressy, it's a good go-to, otherwise replace with dress pants if that's your vibe.  * fitted blazer    * I never remember that I own one, but wouldn't invest unless you're a blazer person or you meet clients in a professional setting.  * classic white shirt    * For the longest time, I didn't think these were necessary, but they so are. I have a plain white tee, a ruffled sleeve tee, and a white button up shirt because in a pinch I can wear them with everything.  * day dress    * No? replace with anything that's throw on comfort but looks chic with a good pair of shoes. Feel like nowadays it's more romper, jumpsuit, etc than just a standard wrap dress.  * cashmere sweater    * Literally cannot think of when I'd want a cashmere sweater, the care for these is annoying.  * well fitting jeans    * A game changer * sweatsuit alternative    * fight me in my joggers * a wildcard item    * I don't drop cash on things that go out of style as a temporary trend.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 14, 2021	labels:I’ve been having some trouble lately trying to update my wardrobe. I am no fashionista but I know what looks bad and want to avoid it, hence coming to MFA maybe 6 years ago and developing a pretty solid BB wardrobe.   I’m trying to broaden my horizons now and get a more mature style, however I’m finding a slight mental stumbling block because looks now are the polar opposite of what was cool when I was 18.   Wearing doc martens with shorter cropped, loose fitting jeans and showing your socks would have been social suicide a decade ago when I came of age (skinny everything, trainers with everything). I like the look but I feel uncomfortable when I wear it - any advice on getting past this? My head knows it looks better than wearing them with my skinny jeans but my heart says “you will get bullied at school (work)”  TL;DR bought some docs, like them, but how do I stop feeling like a dork?

text:Married dad-of-three wears skirts and heels to work ‘because he can’	labels:I mean good for him he's got the legs for it, but I almost wish this wasn't so newsworthy. Tons of people do this every day and it feels like the way this article was written still inappropriately enforces a gender binary.  > This very straight and married father man who is an engineer and loves cars totally breaks the rules by wearing clothes made for women and nobody else  Rather we could say  > Person puts on clothes that fit them, looks good  But that isn't such a gripping headline
text:I know what you mean and I agree. I don't particularly like the tone of the article, and the man himself is defensive in his instagram bio:   > I am just a straight, happily married guy that loves Porsches, beautiful women and incorporating high heels and skirts into my daily wardrobe.   In other words, "I like cars and hot women, so I'm manly. I just happen to like women's clothes too. But really, I'm manly." It reads like a masc gay guy trying to distance himself from "the fems".   Despite all of that, considering where most of the western world is regarding gender roles and expression, I think highlighting something like this is important because you don't typically see successful corporate boomer men in very obvious womenswear, especially at work. So even though there are plenty of issues here I think the visibility is important.	labels:I absolutely agree. And yet, I kind of get it.   As a guy who likes high heeled boots and silky shirts and racing/motorsports, makeup, musicals and woodworking and design and shooting... it’s almost like I’m two completely different people based on which of my hobbies/pastimes/etc. I’m currently engaged in. but I’m not. I can be selfish and like all these things. they can all inform part of my identity. The me thats wearing a track hoodie and a helmet and going sideways on the autocross course is the same me that’s wearing flowers and done up and belting the lyrics to frozen (frozen 2 because it’s better than the first and y’all can fight me) in the kitchen  (The fact that I only recently discovered I’m bi only adds to the contrast. oh hey look another thing I can’t choose)  But it’s a good reminder to be careful about *how* I remind people that I’m “not just X”, because it can come off exactly like you described.

Or should I just drop it all and go to great fashion program at a fashion school.	labels:As I said, only worth it if you want a job where you have to have a graduate degree. Honing skills isn’t a good reason. You can get paid to do that
text:You don’t need an advanced degree to work in Fashion, but you definitely need a degree. Nobody in NY at least is going to look twice at you unless you come from Parsons, FIT, RISD or Pratt ideally, or a well-regarded program within another school.   I’d say finish your current degree and then maybe take some classes to be sure that actual fashion design is something you want to do. Design is a lot more than making clothes. It’s insanely hard work as a career. That said, there are a lot of great opportunities in fashion, especially in New York, where I’ve spent my 20+ year career.   FIT has great post-grad classes and associates programs too. Maybe you could work in fashion marketing while studying design? The combination of some design classes and solid marketing experience could very well lead to something interesting. Good luck!	labels:I’m actually currently differed from FIT, so I could just go there and do that.   Is that what your implying?
text:Yeah, or take classes while you’re working. I’ve taken several continuing ed classes there and it’s always been great. I’m saying take a little time before you enroll in another full time program.   Also, it quite normal for students at Pratt/RISD/Parsons to attend and get another bachelor’s.

Instead, I adorn my lower half with the most unyielding, unforgiving denim they make. I don’t “break it in” or other such nonsense as that could potentially soften my rigid mom jeans into pants that I don’t grimace while wearing. If your bottoms aren’t leaving crease marks on your hips and thighs, then I don’t think they even count as pants.	episode_done:True

text:Those of you who, like me, don't have a closet (sob).. how do you organize your clothing/shoes/accessories/jewelry?	labels:I do have a closet, but I don't keep everything in it because I prefer to be able to see my clothes, so it mainly holds outerwear, dresses, skirts, and off season clothing.  My denim/stiffer fabric pants do get their own tiny set of drawers since I don't have a ton, but the rest of my clothes get organized in open shelving (IKEA Kallax.)  Shoes are in a shoe rack that I keep behind my closet door.  I have a ton of jewelry, so I have one of those over the door jewelry organizers, a bracelet holder, and I made myself a necklace holder out of wood, paint, and command hooks, since it was significantly cheaper than the one I liked.	episode_done:True
text:“I'm all locked down with nowhere to go – but that hasn't killed my lust for fashion”	labels:I'm still lusting over pretty fit and flare dresses even though I already purchased a couple of them online during the height of the lockdown last year. It's not like I'm going to be attending any events anytime soon. But I miss getting dressed up for stuff. It's too cold to wear dresses just for grocery shopping. I can't wear them around the house with a rambunctious nine month old kitten running around getting into constant mischief. But that doesn't stop from me from wanting to buy a couple more of them.	episode_done:True
text:Brands Want In on the Vintage Fashion Boom	labels:At least to me, the thing I love so much about shopping around at  vintage and thrift stores is that it feels so much less "corporate" than just going to a mall or ordering something off the internet. The more companies dip their hands into this area of fashion for profit's sake, the more life will be sucked out of it
text:I don't know, I know a lot of people who enjoy the process of going to vintage stores and never knowing what you're going to find. The clothing is also frequently significantly cheaper than it would be for you to purchase something of comparable quality new, and there's also the warm moral assurance that you are not contributing to the growing problem of fashion's unsustainable ecologic impact.	labels:	episode_done:True

I stopped following him when he posted (and quickly took down without apology) an editorial photo featuring a white model being arrested on the ground by a police officer, at the height of the George Floyd protests.

text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:Don’t forget to check out thrift stores. This is where I stock up on cashmere sweaters for a few dollars a piece, wool skirts, kilts, sweaters, vests, and cardigans, and amazing wool blazers and coats. I’ve found mint condition mohair and camel hair 3/4 coats for as low as $10, black cashmere sweaters for $2-3 and up, and cable knit pullovers for as low as $4. It’s amazing what people get rid of, not realizing how expensive it all is new. I also loooove wool in the fall and winter, and so this has been a super affordable way to build a dream cold-weather wardrobe.   The only thing wool I buy new are socks for the most part, everything else I’ve found at estate sales, garage sales, and thrift shops. When/if you go, definitely go through the boys and men’s departments, too. A bit of tailoring can make anything look custom like some of the pieces on Walker Slater maybe.

text:From 'Doctor Who' to 'Outlander': How Fans Craft Reverse Engineer Knits	labels:Thanks for sharing this article! I've been knitting for over 20 years, and I would love to try my hand at some replica design, I just have to get through more of my queue and stash first.   I'm always excited when pop culture knits inspire more people to get into knitting. I've found taking this step to make my own socks and accessories to be eye opening about the value of garments and clothing. And as one of the interviewed knitters said, it is very fun to chose different fibers and yarn weights to make exactly what you want in the project.
text:> just gotta get through more of my stash and queue first.  Narrator: "They were never able to do so."  But forreal, I just cast on my first self designed sweater. I've been knitting for a year, but crocheting and sewing for a decade. Slow fashion is such a rabbit hole because before you know it you're trying to talk yourself out of learning to spin, cause maybe when you buy a house you could get a sheep? Maybe some angora rabbits?! But it's such a cool interest. As a young person I'm really happy that it's becoming a mainstream thing!  It gives me hope.	labels:Yep...very accurate.  I have successfully not purchased yarn for myself for 458 days now (not like I'm counting), so I might be able to reduce the stash a bit. But more than likely I'll cave here in the next six months while I still have 40k yards to work through.   The rabbit hole of slow, self-made fashion goes deep. The yarn, the yarn dyeing, the desire for an angora rabbit, the realization that you dont like drop spinning, but thinking maybe you'd like it on a spinning wheel...	episode_done:True

text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I'm just... still getting dressed up. This has actually given me a nice opportunity to try new combinations of outfits and pull out pieces that I wasn't sure about before. The routine of getting dressed and feeling put together is really important for me with regards to getting into the work mindset.
text:Agreed.   Definitely was starting to feel some depression/Groundhog Day while not getting dressed every day.   Picking out an outfit and doing makeup really help.   I’m also doing “date night” with my husband where we both get dressed up and put shoes on and have dinner at a real table and use our serving dishes.   Making more elaborate dishes and getting into the presentation has also helped me. I’m not feeling the need for time savers/convenience since I don’t ever leave the house.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:I've done so twice and the first time was a disaster.   I was trying to combine advice about "classic and timeless" pieces with a look based around an entirely different aesthetic, and it turned into a mess. I was still holding onto outdated assumptions about what was fashionable. I was trying to do too much at once. I have almost no pieces left from that year.  I am convinced that for 99% of people, "classic and timeless" is a scam. If you sew your own Victorian-style pieces, that's awesome. If you have a lot of time and money to spend a lot of time looking for the perfect 100% silk and cashmere pieces from different decades, that's awesome too. Otherwise, there's a good chance that you're in denial about a dated wardrobe. A better goal for most people is to get to a place where you can update with new pieces slowly - maybe 2-3 per year. I will be buying one new wool sweater this winter.  A good place to start is with what you already gravitate to in your daily life and your own closet. Imagine that you really want to go to work (or your favorite restaurant or to do something fun on the weekend, whatever you do often) tomorrow wearing something that makes you feel special and look your best, but you're going to be wearing it all day, so it needs to be pretty comfortable. Which outfit do you pull out?   In my own wardrobe, I can look through the outfits I passed by and say why - too casual (although sometimes those are perfect for another activity), I just don't love it and it would never be my first pick, too tight, too cheap-looking, not my style, too boring. It's easier to build around what you already like than to throw everything away and try to buy things based on an imaginary person that you've never actually been. Get rid of the things that you never gravitate toward, and see what's left. From there, you might need just a few more wish-list pieces to get that smaller wardrobe you love.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 08, 2020	labels:A random thought about clothes..  I normally wear an airism undershirt (the seemless ones that are mostly Nylon not Polyester) and a merino wool sweater also from Uniqlo  Yesterday I decided to wear my airism with an OCBD (cotton) instead, and noticed a sharp increase in static electricity. like touching door knobs, etc.  Which is par the course in winter, until this year I started wearing merino almost exclusively.  I wonder why.. I thought cotton is neutral.. or is the interaction between cotton and nylon causing it?  i also thought Merino also causes static, but is the interaction between merino and nylon balancing each other out?  i'm using it in the same exact locations and environment.	episode_done:True
text:What pieces would you love "backups" of?	labels:This is pretty uninspired, but I have a lot of basics that I wish I had bought in duplicates, but didn't buy in duplicates, because I figured they were basics and I could always just get more.   Alas. The styles changed just a bit, and now I can't find the plain white tanks and tees I want because the sleeves and the neckline and the length are all just a tiny bit off. Thank you for reading along, this not-a-real-problem is very frustrating at times.
text:I just bought duplicates of plain white and black tshirts and felt a bit lame but it’s totally worth it when you find the right ones!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Also, this is a common rule, but no clothing that requires anything special to wear it - eg a shirt that only works when you switch around the bra straps of your convertible bra, a dress that requires shapewear to look how you want it to look, a wrap blouse that has to be pinned into place after you put it on, a shirt that requires another shirt underneath because it’s see-through - all of those are a no for me. If it doesn’t work with just my regular underclothing (except for choosing nude underclothing for light pieces) I won’t buy it - I just know by now I’m not going to make the effort to wear it when I could just put on something easier that I like just as much.
text:Yes! I agree. Especially on the see through shirts. It is such a pain.  I don’t have time for that.  The only tiny exception I have is a crew neck sweater that needs a layer underneath. Because you can throw anything under there and it helps with temperature regulation. :D	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 18, 2021	labels:For context, I'm 19 and I recently bought around $500 worth of clothes for black friday and this is the first time I've ever gone shopping for clothes for myself on a large scale.  Instead of looking for fashion trends I just looked for clothes that I thought would look good on me.  As my clothes got delivered, I tried them all on and was really happy with the way I looked.   But, recently something happened that made me very self-conscious about what I wear in public.  I was at a kickback with a couple of my friends, and a girl I didn't know walked up to me after I was done playing chess with my friend.  The first thing she said to me was "is that your boyfriend?"  This was a very weird situation for me because the first interaction I have with this person is already bad.  I say "No, I'm straight," and she replies "Oh, I thought you were gay."  I asked her why she thought I was gay and she told me it was because of my outfit.  Then she asks to play a game of chess against me and I didn't want to be unpleasant so I accepted.  The entire 15 minutes of that chess game I wanted it to be over because of how fucked the situation was. I was wearing jeans, a striped shirt, and a tan blazer.  I also frequently wear silver stud earrings, nothing too blingy.  This experience really hurt me because I'm a very self-conscious person.  I really enjoy being comfortable in what I'm wearing, and this has made me reconsider what to wear in public.   Are there any fashion styles I should enjoy if I want to avoid being titled as gay?  Or should I just keep wearing what I want to wear? I'd say that my personality and the way that I speak is a clear indication that I am straight, I'm just worried about people judging me before they meet me (because clearly that happens).
text:For a second lets remove the problematic conversation of looking "gay" or acting "straight", we can circle back to that in a moment.  Lets talk about context and clothes and bad habits we all have. When we start to do something new, we often over correct and this can be problematic in our personal lives. A lot of people will start their style journey and go a bit too fast and a bit too hard, styling themselves for an aspirational goal or lifestyle and ignoring where they are and what they're doing. Obviously you should dress how yourself however you feel, but then you've got to be willing to deal with people's reactions to your choices. So what do you do? Making sure your clothes aren't sending a message that doesn't vibe with the rest of your situation. You're 19 and wearing a tan blazer for a kickback with your friends, that's a bold look. In fact wearing a sports coat is super hard to do nowadays in a casual setting, it's almost immediately assumed to be "dressed up". Your peer group might not understand your new interest, but keep at it and being a little bit more stylish will become your thing. I still get teased for how much I like clothing, the number of shoes in the shoe rack, knits in the drawers - wearing chinos when everyone else is wearing sweatpants - that's life.  Now...I want to be really clear about this: There's no correct way to be Gay or Straight, a person's mannerisms, voice, personality, clothing is not dictated by their sexuality. The sooner you come to accept and understand that, the easier ride you're going to have in life and you'll be a better person. Neither is there anything wrong with being assumed to be gay, straight, bisexual, trans, queer, etc. it speaks to the other person more than it speaks to you. Be an Ally.   Finally, I understand that the world isn't awesome and that in some situations it can be dangerous for someone to think you're anything other than Straight. If you're in that situation, or around those people...stop, find new people, find new situations.	labels:	episode_done:True

They are fairly inexpensive for the quality of leather (compared to a chanel/gucci). I was in store a while back and they are seriously even more beautiful in person. They had a bubblegum pink one with the serpent on it and I want it so badly! I highly recommend everyone google their bags as I think they are less popular than they should be. I also like that they are less popular because they look like a super good quality bag but only those “in the know” so to speak, will know where it is from!   I am also curious about hunting season bags. They have piqued my interest a bit as well.
text:Gosh, that Serpenti bag is gorgeous. If I could afford it right now I'd be agonizing over whether to get the black or that gorgeous green! Some day...  (I see we have similar tastes in general. I've been wanting a Wandler bag for years!)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I usually wear one statement piece with more basic items, but if I want to combine more dramatic items, I try to pick items that stand out for different reasons (unless I'm going for full on maximalist).   So like with the pink suit, it's 100% the colour that makes it stand out. So I would pair it with a top with a bold pattern, or a dramatic scarf that creates an interesting silhouette, or a belt or necklace that has a lot of interesting detail.

I feel fancy in it with an off the shoulder cashmere sweater, or comfy if I tuck a t-shirt into it. I also love Oxford heels in place of booties for a daintier look. Black tights, especially ones with subtle polka dot or other whimsical patterns, bring rompers and shorter skirts into the season.

I wear fleece leggings under everything; other leggings, jeans, skirts, bodysuit, doesn't matter.	episode_done:True

text:Well it varies! For a simple, basic cotton t shirt that is decent quality I’m willing to spend about $30 or so. For jeans, between $100-$150 (although cheaper would be great!), etc.   This is for every day clothing of course. For an evening dress I’ll spend $$$ for good quality, design, etc.   I just bought a $400 leather jacket.   So I guess the answer is it just depends! My main focus is decent quality, better than forever 21, SHEIN, etc. But not necessarily $50-$60 for a single shirt.   Sorry my answer isn’t more concise 😭	labels:	episode_done:True

We all love Georgia!" just absolute sycophantic shit  At least Abrams has had the integrity to rep all the orgs and activists that have been working for years on voter registration and fighting voter suppression but I'm still seeing plenty of braindead "Abrams *singlehandedly* won us Georgia!" takes

text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:I think a lot of people here that say their clothing falls apart quickly aren't properly caring for their clothes. Growing up I learned to wash everything together on cold. As an adult I had to read articles and watch YouTube videos on how to care for my clothing. I recommend everyone learn how to properly launder their clothing.
text:I may be totally wrong, but I bet at least some of those "my clothes fall apart after first wash" may just be people laundering their own clothes for the first time and not really knowing that figuring out your washing machine and its settings is quite significant to how your clothes will come out.  My clothes looked rough when I used to just dump them all in a big ball into a laundrette washing machine and tumble dry them. Now that I have my own washing machine, use custom settings and and air dry the clothes (or hand wash in the sink if needed), they stay looking new way longer.	labels:I also think it has to do with the quality of the clothes and isn't always the washers fault. When a shirt is super cheap and mostly polyester or theres issues in the sewing it will fall apart pretty quickly	episode_done:True

text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:Big plus one on filtering! I have a saved search of my favorite brands in my sizes in new or like new condition that I check periodically and more targeted searches like “wool and cashmere sweaters from 3 brands I like” that I use more often. Size filtering and material filtering can be the most helpful, as can brand filtering. Setting up a brand filter can take the longest but a big saved search of brands you like can help a lot in browsing.  Also plus one on payout—payout percentage increases with the dollar value of the item, and it’s so much lower effort for me to sell through them than through Poshmark. Poshmark takes forever and you have to spend so much time putting together good photos, detailed descriptions, and offers to potential buyers (plus then there’s the whole expectation of making you package cute with tissue papers and whatever to get good reviews). My time is just worth more than the additional payout I get from them. Thredup also will donate and recycle items they can’t sell, which turns it into a one stop thing for me. I will take my higher end items elsewhere for a first look, but if my local high end consignment shop won’t take it, I’ll let Thredup have a pass at it. Love the convenience factor.	episode_done:True

When I started a new job, I got three pairs of AE shoes in my size for about the cost of one new pair and they all came in pretty good shape.
text:I am not opposed. But the cost isn’t really an issue either. I just never got the point of expensive shoes before. I tried on expensive ones and they hurt just as much as the cheap ones. So why bother... I feel like a whole new world just opened up.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:When I had to buy business/work clothes, I invested in a really nice, fitted black suit, a couple of collared shirts, and a pair of flats. Those were my basic essentials that I knew I could mix and match with a lot of stuff. Everything else I picked up at Goodwill.   My coworkers commented on my cute clothes so I think it was a great strategy. I collected a pretty huge work closet for practically pennies.  After that, I've never had a clothing budget. My closet is a pretty good deterrent of overspending because I hate clutter and I hate having a crammed closet so if I think I dont have room and an item I'm looking at isn't worth creating room in my closet, I dont buy it.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:Pre-Covid, I went to several clothing swaps hosted by a friend of a friend. The clothing swap would be at a bar in the area, you could get drinks (friend of friend is a bar tender) and go through the clothing on the tables. You could choose to drop off clothes and take nothing, you could choose to give away nothing and take stuff and anything else in-between. Most people came with stuff and left with different items. Everything left over at the end of the night was donated.   I LOVED going to these swaps. I got so many awesome things and it was a great way to give away things that I was no longer interested in wearing.
text:I've been to usually smaller swaps where everyone had to bring something to take, and bigger swaps where you you didnt have to.  I'm usually almost more grateful for the opportunity to get rid of stuff constructively than I am for taking stuff, though the taking is the fun part.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:The key is actually just learning how to create FABULOUS casual outfits rather than tryin to dull down a dressy outfit. Instead of starting from a place of Dressiness, start with Casual then work on making it the NICEST version of casual possible.    I like to wear jeans and loafers and then some gold earrings, a small scarf, a blazer and maybe a necklace. Where I live even that can be too fancy. So if I see its over the top, I just whip off the scarf and blazer, wipe the lipstick off a little and then I'm looking really cute casual in a t-shirt and jeans.     Overly styled hair and makeup is one thing I notice older women do that "ruins" a casual outfit. The hair is often too stiff and done and the makeup too "nice". So I think having a really pretty, casual go-to hair and makeup routine is important.	episode_done:True

text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Poshmark might work well for you once you find your ideal clothing measurements. Good sellers will either list measurements in the listing, or will gladly measure the clothing for you if you ask. This is awesome because you are getting the measurements of the EXACT item of clothing.   If you find a piece of clothing that fits well, you can use that as a baseline measurement for similar styles. For example, if I have some dresses that are a perfect length, or shorts that fit perfect in the hips, etc, I’ll search for similar brands or shapes and try to match the size and measurements of the item I have at home.	episode_done:True

text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:I wouldn't say I inherently hate the brand but I think Champion is an example of a brand that exploded a few years back/to now basically all because some celebrities or whoever wore it- and everyone who wears it now is most likely a ding dong hypebeast type or the VSCO type girl or whatever. Like I'm old enough to remember it being bottom tier Wal Mart level shit you'd get borderline made fun of for wearing- but now all of the sudden it's enjoying this moment. So it's just that perceived inauthenticity and collective pivot in peoples' minds to a fashion name to people rather than just athletic apparel that irks me somehow.  However though, the Todd Snyder Champion stuff is PHENOMENAL- it's not the mainline stuff. You don't see any of those assholes rocking that.

text:What clothing items have you reverted back to since WFH/quarantine?	labels:I've really been embracing dressing more youthful.

I also started caring about what I wear and planning my outfits. Velvet shoes, corduroy overalls, rainbow prints, sequins, bold colors. Who cares? I've been called out for dressing "fancy" before, but I've stopped giving a shit in correlation with my confidence in my abilities. I'm a teacher...if anything, I'm showing the students it's okay to be yourself and take risks.

text:The "radical" part of the knitwear makes sense when...you actually read the article. So what's the point of this comment?	labels:... that his article titles are always an amusing puzzle to decipher by reading the story and seeing the connection to menswear, and that this is humorous?
text:Sounds like a take to me.	labels:I mean, it's not a take on the article, I'm just joking about Derek Guy's writing style. And... Idk, am I wrong? Is this pattern not humorous?
text:I guess I didn't get the joke. And I have to say: I didn't mean to troll you. I think I've stumbled into a conversation with the simple goal of defending Derek without understanding the context of this sub and your role within it. In any case, it's a *great* read. Cheers!	labels:Oh, I'm a fan of Derek's, and do intend to read this one eventually (especially since I have a simple ribbed knit that seems to fit whatever he's talking about). I'm just saying it's a funny pattern.  Some people just like to hate on me here.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 24	labels:can someone elaborate on the difference between the following 5 types of coats?: peacoat, duffle coat, trench coat, top coat, and overcoat?
text:A peacoat is a specific type of wool coat. It is derived from the military pea coat and will be double-breasted, if navy or charcoal wool (usually thick wool-nylon or pure wool), be thigh length,  tonal buttons, slightly curved collar iirc.   A duffle cost I can’t remember the specifics but I think has a good and toggle buttons? Could be wrong.  A trench is a raincoat, generally cotton or at least not wool, usually tan, doubtle breasted, belted, mid thigh or knee length.  Top coat and overcoat are generally pretty interchangeable iirc longer wool coats , single breasted, wool. A lot of variety under those terms but usually a top coat is intended to be worn over a suit iirc.   Different manufacturers will use a lot of these terms interchangeably which can be confusing.	labels:thank you for the detailed response!	episode_done:True

text:LEZE the Label (Canadian)   Current deal: $150 mystery boxes they say have 3 items in them and are a total value of $350. Style-wise, you can pick between a work from home box or a work from office box, and you set separate top and bottom sizes. The items are non-returnable. (Can you tell I’m tempted? just wary of duplicates of what I already have, plus just bought some things elsewhere.) If anyone gets one please post - interested to know what you get. Not sure if this deal is just for the holiday season or what...  Old deal (ended Mon.

Edit: Updated with new deal, kept note for old deal	labels:	episode_done:True
text:WEEKLY DEALZ	labels:Re: Black Friday, I personally like having as much time as possible so I can research the item and sit on it before deciding to buy. It’s easy to make impulse purchases when the deals are hot.   The discounts will be big this year due to the decrease of retail sales and the increase of online shopping. I think it would be helpful to post the deals as soon as they’re announced by the retailers, which could be as early as next week.
text:I also think the discounts will be big this year but don't retailers often sell lower quality products for Black Friday?	labels:Sometimes, but only for certain items and merchants (e.g., Levi’s sold at Walmart vs. Levi’s.com). It’s more common to see inflated MSRPs to think you’re getting a good deal. If everyone knew retailers sold inferior products during BF, no one would shop then. That said, outlets and factory stores do sell lower quality items year round that were made specifically for them.   Stock photos that change right before sales can be another indicator that they’re selling a different version of the same item. All the more reason to have extra time to research your purchases.
text:I did not know this, so this is great advice. Are there more examples of retailers who do this?	labels:Electronics like TVs, computers, and appliances are known to have inferior BF counterparts. Cosmetics too, especially if they're sold in holiday kits. Not sure about clothing though; the Levi's were just an example I made up. I think it's more common among mass market/fast fashion retailers who have high turnover and can push out tons of product in a short amount of time. Think H&M, Forever 21, etc.  A good rule of thumb is that if it's too good to be true, it probably is. If you have to shop at all, go with stores that have generous return policies so you're not stuck with unwearable crap. A quick Google search pulls up lots of guides about what to avoid on BF, so that's a good place to start.
text:Nordstrom's anniversary sale is notorious for this - most of the clothes and shoes they sell special for the sale are lower quality than they would be otherwise.	labels:That’s a bummer, seeing as I purchased quite a few things during this year’s sale. Is it just their in-house brands or does it extend to other name brands too?   I bought some Nike tights that were discounted more than I’ve ever seen anywhere (including Nike’s website) so I suspect it’s the latter. They don’t feel too different than the ones I already own in other colors, but perhaps longevity will tell a different story.
text:I think most of the lower quality items are the items made for Nordstrom, like their Madewell items made exclusively for Nordstrom. If your Nike leggings are the same leggings sold by Nike on their website and feel similar to the ones you own then they're probably fine.	labels:Cool, thanks for the heads up. I try to buy directly from the brand whenever possible, but it’s easy to miss when a good deal is distracting.	episode_done:True

text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I'm doing a no-buy year (exception being things like sports bras or replacements for things that are no longer wearable), and the biggest help to me was unsubscribing from ALL marketing emails. Removing those updates from brands and sales and such was helpful, especially since we're so inundated with online marketing nowadays.
text:I’ve read this tip somewhere: if you still want the marketing mails sometimes (e.g., to check whether there’s a discount code when you were going to buy something anyways), create a mail folder and a filter that automatically puts anything containing the word “unsubscribe” in there. That should catch all the newsletters and you still have them without being tempted to buy all the time	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Winter staples?	labels:Depends how cold it gets, and how much time you plan to spend outside! I'm a city girl and a bit of an "indoor cat," so my main winter activities involve navigating public transit, dealing with puddles of slush, and an occasional walk on icy sidewalks. We don't plan to drive or live in a detached house any time soon, which cuts out a whole category of winter chores.  So for me, staples are long wool coats, wool turtlenecks, wool socks and shiny black rain boots or sturdy shearling lined Timberland boots. For extra warmth, I wrap a wool pashmina around my head and layer silk thermals under my clothes. Mittens annoy me so I usually just wear leather gloves or keep my hands in my pockets. I find this is the best compromise to stay warm without too much bulk or any technical garments. If the pavements are dry, I'll even switch to heeled leather boots.  I've walked up to 30 minutes at a time in weather around 10° Fahrenheit in an outfit like this, with the scarf pulled up over my nose and mouth. (The normalisation of face masks will make this even easier now.) But it would *absolutely not* be sufficient for extended time in temperatures below 0° Fahrenheit, winter sports, or even for things like shoveling snow or scraping a windshield. For that you'd want taller insulated boots and a proper down jacket.	episode_done:True

text:Favorite brands to thrift?	labels:Honestly I don't have any. What I love about thrifting is seeing pieces removed from the context of their stores, marketing, and other items from the same brand, so I can judge them on their own merits.   I'm not trying to be condescending or corrective at all, though: If you find a brand whose clothes you tend to enjoy at a price point that works for you, more power to you!
text:You didn’t sound condescending at all! My question was less about brands that you actively seek out and more about brands you kind of just find yourself enjoying over and over. I’m def in the same school of letting the item speak to me and not searching for brands. When I see that I’m attracted to certain brands more often, I just think it’s cool!	labels:	episode_done:True

I also wrote out which physical attributes I want to highlight (and which ones I didn't), as well as listed wardrobe things I wanted and outlined a shopping strategy.

text:Demna Gvasalia’s pens an essay on appropriation and luxury fashion for Re-Edition Magazine’s upcoming Issue 14	labels:Tbh I think he makes a good point but the corporateness of fashion makes appropriation worth talking about.

Can you describe how the hoodie feels when you wore it? The only garment I associate with elbow holes is dress shirts - typical problem finance guys have when a shirt is pushed to its limit because you have your elbows on your desk all day. How often were you wearing the hoodie? 2-3 weeks between washes if you're wearing it everyday seems a little wrong to me even for a raw denim guy myself.	episode_done:True

text:Are jean shorts on men really that bad?	labels:Listen, there are very few things, if any, in menswear that are always wrong.  But as far as single items go, jorts are very, very, very rarely right.  Denim is a generally a heavy, workwearish fabric designed to protect your legs. Shorts are generally worn for comfort -- they should be lighter, or softer, or both. And there are a few more reasons that jorts are... unnatural, but... They are, don't wear them unless you *really* know your shit. Like, "studies runway shows like an academic" level of knowing your shit.

Mostly everything is black, gray, white, light blue, navy, with some camel and tomato red.  Only dresses really deviate here.    I play with shoes, makeup, and sunglasses to mix up my basic wardrobe.  And my bikini collection is relatively extensive, I have more bikinis than pairs of pants.	episode_done:True

text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:Do you know Daria Andronescu? She has a youtube channel and a blog that deals with what you are experiencing. A while ago she published a template that allows you to calculate how many outifts you need based on what you do every week. Say you work from home, exercise at home and you only go out twice per week - this means you need much more comfortable clothes than "going out clothes". Based on that, and seeing what your life looks like for an entire season you can adjust your wardrobe accordingly. If you like a romantic/feminine style, you can still have it by picking loungewear that suits that style, that way you are more truthful to yourself and don't have to only wear hoodies. I think if you don't experiment with it you will never now.  I have a very feminine style I hated wearing hoodies around the house because they are not very fitted and make me feel sloppy and unproductive. I now wear tight but comfortable loungewear that is similar to what I would go for in my pre-covid life and I feel much more like myself.	episode_done:True

So, I’m looking to find out the men’s equivalent to yoga pants... that is, active wear that I can chase after the kiddo, and/or run to the store and not look like a total schlub... and maybe get my ass checked out periodically, lol.  If it helps, most weekends, I’m in jeans and a button down, maybe hiking pants and a technical shirt.  Thanks!

text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:My perspective is from someone who got interested in wearing sport coats, ties, and “professional” clothing at 17. I just turned 24 and only now do I feel like I have a solid grasp of fundamentals to try new stuff after 8 years of taking clothing seriously.   To me, it all depends on what you want to communicate to others. If you’re only dressing for yourself, you can wear whatever. If you’re more conscious about what others will think too, then there’s an element of “dressing your age” for societal acceptance.   The reason why people shit on 50 year olds wearing hollister is because it’s so apparent that they’re trying so hard to recapture their youth rather than accepting their age and what positives come with it. In the same vein, 17-year-old me wearing ties and sport coats was me trying to shed my youth and move too quickly into professional adulthood. Both have to do with fighting against what we’ve been given rather than working with what we’ve got in a natural way.   The issue may be one of standing out from the crowd being frowned upon, but I think it has more to do with the underlying mentality and reasons why people chose that look.	episode_done:True

I’m teaching college now, so I really need to change my style so the students stop mistaking me for a student.   I took advantage of Zara’s big end of year sale online and got three amazing new coats that needed replacement in my wardrobe to begin with. I can risk buying tops online because the sizing is usually correct, but for pants, dresses, skirts I’ll have to wait for the case count to go down. I’m in AZ, so like, they don’t really have precautions right now, but I’m limiting my going out to just selling stuff and leaving. Built up some huge store credits!  Edit: right, I’ve been trolling style blogs, insta, and pinterest for months to decide on my new style.	episode_done:True

text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:I moved back home earlier this year and as a result had a much reduced storage situation. I sorted my clothes into three categories,wear,don’t wear often (or at all) and doesn’t fit.  I donated the truly ill fitting items and my sister picked out some items she liked.  The last category I put in a drawer and wore each one throughout a month and noted what I was drawn to and what I liked especially the items I had purchased for ‘fantasy me’.   Mixing them with familiar clothing helped make them more accessible and actually a usable part of my wardrobe.   Essentially I now feel like I have a new wardrobe. Plus the notes I made meant I know what I actually like to wear more and therefore purchase in the future and what should definitely stay a fantasy item that I only like on IG or something.	episode_done:True

This read like a Margaret Atwood book, I really agree with and think about this sentiment a lot. The idea that every decision a woman or someone who appears feminine on the gender binary makes, in this case outwardly with appearance, is scrutinized and considered daily. I just started a grad program and when looking at the girls I thought “preppy and rich, alternative, athletic” but for the guys it’s just “they dress like boys”. It feels inescapable.	episode_done:True
text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I’m Op but I’ll share mine -  At around 14 I had a quick phase of really liking the very early sort of e- kid bright and trendy fashion. Hot topic forever 21 sort of edgy stuff. Skinny jeans only. Small wardrobe. Didn’t look great and got bullied a little for my new look. Lowkey wanted to look like a gorillaz character. Still kinda do though lol.  Then there was a transitional trendy masculine street wear phase from when I was late 14 to late 15 . I only really wore ripped jeans, graphic tees , always a belt , with vans or converse that matched the shirt. I started getting of compliments on my style from peers.  I then had an art kid style phase late 15 - 16 years old . Very similar to before but I started adding different style jackets and pants. This was an important phase because I started adding different accessories like print socks and hair stuff.   Really quick 90’s inspired phase. I tried dressing like 90’s Britpop singers lol. A small step back I’d say.   Late 16 to current ( I’m seventeen ) changed my style over quarantaine . Asking questions here changed everything. I realized how much I loved my more dressy clothes and fell in love with the l’ecole des femmes clothes. I stopped following trends and went for mature more romantic and currently Victorian styles. Man repeller slightly masculine inspiration too. I wear skirts, tights , blazers, dresses, hats, neck scarves and blouses now. I also sold my years worth of converse and vans to buy oxfords and heeled dress shoes. Though my peers understand it a little less I have never been happier. Very confident in my style currently.    [Quick note - It may seem crazy to change my style so quickly but when your young you tend to go through clothes more quickly as you grow and teens tend to be more rough on clothes ]   Thank you for reading : )
text:I love this because I had almost the complete opposite transition. I went from aspiring to have a slightly dressy, classic style 14-16, and then in the past year and a half (17 now too lol), I had a drastic shift towards recognizing that as put together as dressier styles look, it’s not for me.   Luckily, I barely had any clothes anyway, so heading off to college soon, I decided to focus on what I actually value (comfort above all, feeling like myself in clothes, and replacing things I currently wear a ton) and now find myself in a much more colorful (unless i’m feeling all black), streetwear-esque look. Yesterday, I wore an outfit that I can’t stop grinning about today, and that never used to happen before. Absolutely ecstatic getting to play with clothes in a way that isn’t 100% “trendy” and is just more *me*.	labels:	episode_done:True

I have absolutely fallen in love with a pair of black flowy wide leg crop pants I bought a few years ago and they really helped me get out of the jeans rut. I can pair them with a tshirt for a very casual chill vibe, or something more fitted for instantly work appropriate. They were very much my “gateway pant” into the world of bottom-halves, and mixing up styles that have a more flowy or dressy feel to them - particularly as I’m not big on skirts and prefer to have that “always ready for action” feel about my outfits that pants seem to give	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:> should I try to incorporate things one at a time or just muddle though the vaguely uncomfortable period of time until I feel comfortable?  Yes. Fake it till you make it. Wear one nice, "dressy" thing at a time until you feel comfortable enough to dress up in an entire outfit. Wear it around the house until you feel comfortable enough to wear it outside. I used to be a tomboy who lived in baggy t-shirts and jeans, and I remembered being so self-conscious the first time I wore a skirt and flats, but I just kept wearing them, and soon the feeling wore off - I got used to being dressed up, and people got used to seeing me dressed up, so nobody commented on it anymore.  &#x200B;  > what to say when people make the, "why are you all dressed up" comment  because, "I just felt like it" never seems to be good enough.

text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?'

For upper classes it served as a nightgown, and for lower classes it was something they could do house work in. It has nothing to do with nursery rhymes or even women’s appearances, its construction was simple because it wasn’t meant to be seen.	episode_done:True

Unless we’re talking about crippling debt or something you can’t pay off within 9-12 months while still living comfortably, there’s no reason to cut all spending. Just scale it back and make a small shopping budget for yourself.   Consistency pays off debt better and faster than trying to bite off more than you can chew.

text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:When I did a shopping detox a few years ago, I found that using shopping to fill time was as big an issue for me as wanting new things. Yes, the fun of the purchase and desire to wear something new contributed to shopping. But the bigger issue for me was that I used shopping to fill downtime. It was an issue at in-person stores, e.g. in between a fitness class and work, and at home when I had plenty of time for online shopping. I had to find other ways to fill my time. I took walks between errands and tasks. I did some errands and maintenance work that I'd been putting off. I read and exercised more. It helped me see how much time I was dedicating to shopping and how much time I had available for other things if I shifted priorities a bit.	episode_done:True
text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:For trousers/ pants I'd go with 2-pleat or ghurka trousers, both are high-waisted and look similar to what are featured in your general fashion board, actually I can see there are definitely Ghurka trousers in there. Same with Herringbone wool vests. Just by learning the names of the garments you'll have an easier time finding good brands.   The flecked suit you linked with the filson looking bag looks like Our Legacy's Midnight Sheep Jacket/Trousers from 2012. Good luck finding the exact thing, if you want to try grailed, Marrkt or ebay depending on where you live. Otherwise just include search times like "flecked" or "nep".  A lot of the clothing in the general fashion board looks to me like vintage workwear. I don't know what your budget is like but if you want to put a lot of money into it then brands like Belafonte, RRL and Pherrows might be quite good.   For the avant garde "Unique" stuff you have going on, try Rick Owens, Damir Doma, Julius, Number (N)ine, ann demeulemeester, and spend enough time in that circle and you'll figure out what you like

text:Actually Sustainable: How Brands Are Going Vintage	labels:I really feel like for most people finding the people and skills that can do "after market" stuff is the way to go. A good tailor, a good cobbler (even for non-stitched footwear), and creativity to upcycle, repair, etc. is important.   While I think the blame for sustainability falls squarely on the duty of brands and governments to enforce it's not something that's economically sustainable under capitalism. Something something no ethical consumption something something.
text:Big problem is sourcing stuff. I mostly buy used on ebay, but if I wanna shop used in person my choices are:  1. Company that hates the lgbt community  2. Company that pays people with disabilities $0.05 an hour to sort clothes  3. Two tiny Plato’s Closets that have been picked dry. I never find anything there.

On one hand, I've gotten too old to really follow trends closely, but on the other hand, I don't want to be one of those people who wears what was popular when he was 26 forever.  I'd feel goofy in a pair of wide-leg ankle-cut pants and a Carhartt jacket, but I also realize that black skinny jeans and plaid button-ups are past their prime.  So what's a man my age to do?  I've been working on finding a balance lately, but it's not as clear-cut as I'd hoped.
text:I'm also in my 30ies. Not getting stuck in one particular style is not about making radical changes every few years, it's just incrementally growing your wardrobe with you.

See what of the stuff that you have already works with that, see what doesn't, take it from there etc.  But really, the best advice I have is just to wear what you like and own it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else have “irony pieces”?	labels:A long time ago, a friend at work told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheapo pantyhose.  I looked down at my crappy nylons and actually felt cheap. I went to Nordtroms that night and bought presentable nylons and wore them to work the next day. She nodded in approvement and then told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheap sweaters. I then bought a wildly pretty ivory cable knit sweater and wore it to work and feeling quite exactly like 1000000 bucks AND i had fancy nylons too. She told me no one would take me seriously with my unkempt shoes and that's when I learned the power of a shoe shining kit.  The next day I wore crappy slacks...and, well you know how the story goes.  To this very day I wear natty clothes and shoes so shiney they can blind fleet of Greek warriors.  The only real irony is no one gave a tootie about nylons and yet I still wear them despite all evidence to the contrary....and she threw al hers away after our company got bought out by another and they were no longer required. (I point at my perfectly appointed knees).
text:I had this coworker. She was Ukrainian and looked amazing every day. Told me I was so pretty but why were my nails bare? Hair not done? Clothes all black? You are a WOMAN, she said.   She always seemed so impressed by each individual change that I kept going. Weekly manicures, nonblack clothing (I discovered that I look great in red!), tasteful makeup. People around the office were gossiping that I was trying to find a man. "No, a man is looking for HER!", she told them.   Then suddenly she disappeared. Quit over the phone and changed her number. I like to think she was an angel in a very impressionable time for me, but I think she might have just had issues with her work visa.	labels:I definitely used to work with a very opinionated korean woman who had a similar role in my life. "Your skirt is a size to big." "Why aren't you doing in your eyebrows?" "Paint your toenails is you're gonna wear an open toed shoes." I was new to fashion and fashion retail. At the time her remarks kinda stung, but I would make the fix and always felt more confident once I did	episode_done:True

text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:Most of the fashions we see today I feel like doesn’t celebrate the style, but the very specific tall thin model body that wears it.  I’m tall-ish but also apple shaped and broad shouldered with narrow hips and no waist. (Also officially overweight, thanks quarantine)   I think what helped is that i started following a lot of OOTD accounts from people here on ffa from waywt and the midsize and plus-size style hashtags on Instagram. These helped me normalize seeing confident, stylish people in different sizes and now if/when I try to emulate their style, I’m less disappointed. If you look at @timorous.me on Instagram she has a style blogger index where you can search for people of similar measurements to you. It’s helped me a lot.	episode_done:True

text:Solid.  j crew for 2021. Good place to get basics + extra pieces. Seems a bit expensive to me (but I mostly shop online and a lot of my basics are covered).   As far as design: softer, lighter, casual take on prep and workwear. Trendy, but inoffensively so. Brunch boyfriend core. Doesn’t have as strong brand identity as polo or j crew, but way more flavor than say gap. More expensive than mall tier but not being into by the lux prep basics like saturdays or Todd Snyder.	labels:LOL Brunch boyfriend core is the perfect way to describe it	episode_done:True
text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:Go on Pinterest and pin things that catch your eye. Once you have a board try and find similarities between the pins (for example ruffles, silk, strappy backs etc) and start searching up those things at stores that are within your price range.  In terms of comfort, look for materials you like and what silhouettes you’re into. If you tend to do tighter tops with more volume at the bottom then look for dresses that match that for example. If you know you like cotton blends look for those.    Also look for stores that carry petite sections or find a tailor in your area  Don’t go crazy trying to push yourself too far out of your comfort zone. Look for things that are your style but that you’ve never worn before.
text:Start with shoes and bags/accessories! This is what I did when I started growing out of my younger fashion. It makes it easy to update an outfit and eventually led me to wanting to update to nicer things as I went along. I feel like clothing is a slow collection, don't buy everything at once. Find a couple things you like and that you wear consistently and start to add as you go. So many times I convinced myself that I would wear something and it wound up in the back of my closet so just make sure you take your time!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Uniqlo U 2021 SS Lookbook	labels:Time to begin the bi-yearly cycle of me shitting on the new Uniqlo U collection, popping into their store in person “for a quick look”, seeing the Uniqlo U stuff and liking it more than I thought I would, not buying any of it after talking myself out of it, regretting it, and coming back two weeks later only for it all to be sold out in my size!

text:How would you store sentimental clothing?	labels:I have a fabric storage box that I got from Michaels (probably readily available at any craft/fabric store). The only issue is its kind of odd shaped so finding storage wasn't as easy as just sticking it on a shelf (according to at lrast some sites...when long-term storing clothes, its.better to have fewer folds, so the box is kind of long and skinny? I am not a fabric expert so I'm not sure how true that is).   For random sentimental pieces, I did things like make pillows. I wanted to be reminded of them, but I didn't need it to stay clothing, if that makes sense!	episode_done:True
text:Knit Tie Inspo / Lookbook	labels:I picked up a black knit tie and a navy knit tie at the same time. While for normal woven ties, I'd usually reach for a navy over a black, with the texture of a silk knit, somehow the black knit tie just looks better than the navy knit in so many outfits.   This might be a function of bias because I've read articles extolling the virtues of the black knit tie, but I think the texture of the knit helps to offset the starkness of the colour
text:That's very interesting. I find black (and actually yellow too) to be very difficult colours to try and work with. Black especially just seems very stark, as you rightly said, but it's interesting that you mention it working better than navy as I have found my navy one very versatile.  I'd be very interested to see some fits with them in your own distinct style and see what you do with them.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What would you wear to elope during a pandemic?	labels:I wore a red ribbed/crushed velvet jumpsuit with long flowy sleeves and hoop charm earrings. It was cold when I eloped so I wore velvet to keep me warm! This was pre covid but I’d wear the same thing today.  My backup would be a jumpsuit or dress from electric feathers. They had a white jumpsuit and a metallic jumpsuit last time I looked. I think it’s sold out now :/	episode_done:True

text:How do I feel sexy at home in winter?	labels:matching bra and panties. it works wonders. I do this in the summer too (on summer bra days, which with boob sweat there are not many). when I buy a new bra, I typically get 2-3 coordinating panties in different styles so I have some options, and then put them together under all my clothes. I swear there's a posture change when I'm wearing ratty underclothes vs nice ones. even if no one sees it, I know it's there.
text:Second this. Pretty sleep clothes also. I've been wearing ripped leggings, non matching underwear, an old shirt, and not shaving for months now and I feel terrible lol. I got a silky cami set earlier in the year and a chiffon one with long pants and felt so nice. Could get a little chilly, but a nice blanket helped. Even just taking care of yourself(hygiene,skin,keeping up old routines, exercise, etc) helps me during winter. Treat yourself like you're sexy and you'll feel it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:not sure if this helps contribute to the conversation, but i gained a little weight during covid, which isnt the problem, the problem is that i was eating shitty food all the time. i went up in bra size and pants about 1-2 sizes.  &#x200B;  so i made a point to go through my pants/shirts (i wear alot of crop tops in warmer months) and put them into a bag and they go in the back of the closet until i want to try them on again. I was spending so much time trying to fit into my old clothes and just having anxiety attacks. i bought a few pairs of pants that fit and am just trying to roll with that and not keep trying on clothes that dont fit and punishing myself.	episode_done:True

text:Get Out The Vote Inspo Album	labels:Why is my country (united kingdom) so interested in who becomes president in America and not about any other country, we’re in the middle on our country collapsing in on our selves and yet we rather concentrate on someone else’s leader rather than who’s our next leader
text:Serious answer...  Geo-politically, in the rundown of the British Empire to the setting up of the modern United Kingdom, British politicians have consciously latched themselves onto the USA due to shared history, languages, similar culture and values.   American culture has had a massive influence on British due to shared language historically. Even in the so-called Golden Age of Cinema most movies shown in Britain were produced in the USA. This carried on by large with new forms of communication and entertainment like TV and social media. Most Western social media is by default American social media even in a globalised world.  Furthermore in the run-up to Brexit and during it currently a lot of political weight has been thrown to a US-UK trade deal. A change in President, or keeping the current, would mean a change in the trade negotiation and political policymaking process. The recent trade deals with Japan and Kenya a tiny in levels of importance. A trade deal with the USA is not.  Finally, we're not due another UK General Election according to the Fixed Term Parliament Act for a while, and I doubt we'd call one during a pandemic with a majority of MPs voting for it. Sometimes the media just want to focus on something else for a time. If you're upset enough you can always complain to the BBC or Ofcom via email.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:it depends on the item of clothing? like I do laundry weekly, but I wash things separately. sheets and towels etc are washed with an unscented soap in one load, certain clothes are hand washed and line dried, some clothes are run in a cold cycle, some clothes are worn multiple times before washing. so it varies widely but laundry every 1-2 weeks makes sense for me when I’m only doing my own laundry
text:Wow that sounds so COMPLICATED!!  I throw everything in together, always at 30 synthetic.  I sometimes do more than one load, but only divided to make two loads of similar weight.  I don't have a dryer, line dry when possible.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:A simple solid 2-button suit (a darker shade of grey or navy), simple shirt (white or blue), a simple tie (no in your face colors or patterns), and a simple pair of shoes (black or brown) will cover 99% of formal events. Most people won't notice the fit of a suit so long as it's not overly large/slim, but people notice wrinkles so make sure to press your shirt. A well tied tie (tight knot and dimple) also go a long way.	episode_done:True

text:Feminist clothing	labels:I’m confused, what do you mean by “feminist clothing”? Do you just mean stuff with slogans on it?
text:Yah, thank you for voicing this. This question is problematic. I just wrote a reply about how actual feminism is an intersectional issue, and true feminist practices (like paying a living wage) can be practiced by non-female peeps, too.   the h&m shirt that says "girl power" is, in fact, the product of slavery and exploitation, and the opposite of feminist anything.	labels:Can I ask what you find problematic about OP's post?    I think there are perfectly valid conversations to have about all the issues and considerations behind feminism, intersectionality, and how it relates to clothing.  At the same time, I'm seeing so many comments on this thread that assume the worst of OP's motives.  OP literally asked about alternatives to a company that she had found to be problematic.  Where did she say anything about "the h&m shirt that says 'girl power'"?

Lots of great outfits.   Out of the posted list, I’d like to see more of the themes where the poster has more control — like items under $50, or most expensive outfit. I also like the madras pattern one (/r/NavyBlazer on suicide watch).
text:I like these themes a lot too, but I'm going to try to keep the schedule alternating because themes like these can be a little too open ended for newer users.	labels:This one also involved quite a bit of work from a new user.

text:Awwwww. You do you, girl!!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:I think it's basically woven or high end knit items that are tailored and polished. So chinos, a button down, a merino sweater, skirts, dresses, etc.   I think jersey knits, tees, jeans, sneakers---those can squeak in on a casual day and if styled impeccably, but I lean towards woven in general.   Coverage wise, it's usually from the neck to the knees continuously or more (meaning no belly shirts, no cut outs, and if it's sleeveless, it's not a tank top or camisole alone).   Tightness wise I think it's "skimming" the body. It's not tight, snug, or showing off curves, but it's not baggy in a casual way. I do think biz caz can be oversized, but that's like...advanced biz caz, like a loose linen dress with a loose linen blazer and simple flats on a hot day type deal.   Generally patterns and prints are small and discreet, no slogans, and no "novelty" items or promotional wear.   No workout items, no sleepwear or lingerie.   In your case, I think the events are indicating "smart casual" meaning no open toes/flip flops, no jeans, shorts, tees, or other overly-casual items.	episode_done:True

I’m in eastern WA, so my trenches are used for about one month in fall, and then a month or so in spring, with true winter coats being used from October-April or so. I have several wool/fur dress coats and a couple parkas. I’ve over indulged in coats the last several years so my carts are empty, though I’ve been eying a dark green wool coat for over a year...
text:I'm debating getting a dark green coat as well! I've wanted one already years ago, but was convinced by others to choose a dark red instead...  Still lusting over a dark green, but now I'm not sure whether I should get a wool coat (cheaper but only 1-1.5 months a year they are warm enough but not too warm) or down coat (hardly any dark green ones available 🙄).  Which one are you eyeing? 😊	labels:The ones I’ve been looking at are vintage or used. If anyone sees a new one with a flared skirt and a hood, please share!	episode_done:True
text:Winston & Co. Shawl Collar Cardigan Review (But mostly preamble)	labels:Came across this post and many of your posts when I went to research about shawl collar cardigans and knitwear in general. Thanks for the review and introducing the brand. Winston & co seem to have launched some time this year? How has the cardigan been since you've had for a month or so. If it's made by S&C, I presume it's still immaculate as it can be.   It's unlikely that I'll pick up any cardigans or knitwear this year, but I like to compile a list and plan for future years. I have a SNS Herning Stark, Inverallan 6a, and a few Inis Meain sweaters.  Shawl Collar: Winston | S&C | Drake's | Colhay's  Knitwear:  O'Connell's | Johnstons of Elgin | William Lockie |  Andersen-Andersen | John Smedley | SEH Kelly | Loro Piana   "Afforable options" : Harley's | Bosie | Howlin' | Outdoor Knitwear   Guersney: Le Tricoteur (another brand found out from you. Do you still have a fit pic?)    Vintage: Drumohr | Ballatyne | Pringle of Scotland | Alan Paine  Any names that you would also recommend?

I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

And then the rest of my stuff gets worn way less frequently. That stuff kind of fits into two categories in my mind: 1. Items that fill the same niche in my wardrobe as another item which I prefer either due to fit, style or details.  2. Items that are unique in style, color, or fit and thus only work in a narrow range of situations / outfits.   For me, the difficulty is avoiding items that fall into that first category and instead looking for more interesting stuff that would fall into the second	episode_done:True

text:Does your language affect how you wear colors?	labels:I don’t understand how this translates to fashion really. Just because you don’t have the word to distinguish a color, does not mean you cannot visually appreciate the difference or incorporate it into your outfits?  Most men I know have a very limited color vocabulary - pretty much the basic colors of the rainbow (and honestly you may get some blank stares if you say “indigo” and “violet” outside of the rainbow context instead of “blue” and “purple.”) But my husband can see colors and visually distinguish between my coral top and my blush blouse even though both he would describe as “pink.” He even owns shirts that incorporate salmon pink and lavender and turquoise although he has no idea what they are called. I also doubt that he knows his sports gear feature “chartreuse” and “teal.” His clothing color limitations are more gender-limited than word-limited.	episode_done:True

I'm wondering what articles I can wear over my button-ups that'll keep me warm indoors where I'm expected to take any coats/jackets off. What comes to mind first are cardigans, solid-color sweaters, quarter-zips. Anything else that comes to mind?
text:Use wool items instead of cotton or synthetics. They’ll keep you warmer.	labels:I never quite realized how amazing wool  was before coming to MFA. I’m a fucking evangelist now. I wear merino wool socks,  wool trousers,  wool sweaters, wool peacoat. I do wear modal underwear.	episode_done:True
text:There is no unmarked woman	labels:Thanks for posting this, it’s given me some gender presentation things to think about.   Like, I am a trans man on r/femalefashionadvice and not on r/malefashionadvice specifically because I prefer “marked” fashion choices. The mfa subreddit is all so safe and subtle. Fashion from that approach seems to be more about price and posturing than the sort of things that interest me—cut, color, silhouette, textures, prints, all these aesthetic considerations are largely absent from male fashion.  I agree with u/sunmoonnife that class definitely plays a role here, and with OP that queer identity definitely changes one’s ability to go unmarked and adds some nuance on how marked clothing will be interpreted.	episode_done:True
text:The inspiration of vintage leisure and sportswear	labels:wow its almost like Simon reads Street x Sprezza lol, its almost like his take on that tailoring-adjacent essay I wrote 2 years ago!   This is great! Hopefully more people understand that these ideas are cohesive and can be applied liberally to classic clothing of all formality types. Though I will say that it's important to remember era: Scott Fraser definitely takes inspiration from 50s-60s leisure wear whereas most of the ideas here are taken from 30s-40s photographs. There are small nuances to pay attention to, but overall its cool to take vintage inspo.	episode_done:True
text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:I despise high waisted jeans because they dig into my skin and create rolls where I didn't have any before. I can never understand why everyone says they're more comfortable than mid-rise jeans. And because it's in fashion, it's difficult for me to find a jean that looks good but isn't high waisted. Maybe it's because I was a teen in the 90s. I'm glad I'm not the only one!  And amen to the bra situation! I don't want to have to buy a new type of bra just so I can wear a certain type of shirt or dress.	episode_done:True

text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:Okay so one thing I like to do is wear my new clothes around in the house, so I can get used to the feel of wearing it, even if it’s still in private. Also helps to listen to some of your favourite upbeat songs so you start associating the clothes with positive emotions!   In the past, I’ll sometimes tell one friend that I’m testing out a new item, and go out with that friend. That way, they can a) hype me up and b ) act as a buffer between questions. (Ex: “Oh why are you dressed so fancy today?” “Idk, but I’m loving this new look on you buttermybackside!”)
text:My styles always been a bit bland so I can’t say much but when I try new outfits or something out of the/my ordinary. I’ll ask friends first because they will criticise or compliment me, and tell me what to adjust or change, how I look etc. Unlike my family who has absolutely no filter and blurts the first thing that comes to mind.  I recommend you try it too, get comfortable with yourself first and wearing it, even just around the house, and then slowly expose your new style to everyone around you and wearing it in the different environments (?) like wearing jeans and heels to the pub or out shopping/running errands	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 17, 2021	labels:Hey all. I'm a young resident physician looking for comfy business casual clothes for clinic. I'm tall and do a lot of running so I'm pretty slim. About 6'1 and 155 lbs. Haven't purchased any business casual clothes in a couple years. Been mostly wearing scrubs for work due to COVID, but soon I'll be back in business casual most days of the week. Used to buy exclusively from Banana Republic Factory as they have sales quite often and their slim fit/tailored selection fit me very well. Looking to expand my horizons a bit now. Ties aren't required and business casual where I'm at is very casual. Where should I start my search?	episode_done:True
text:Do you think fashion or style has age restrictions?	labels:I'm 35 and wear crop tops and high waisted jeans. Why do so many people on this sub care so much about what others think about them? Wear trendy items, don't wear them, just stop trying to make some women "other" than you due to some fashion superiority complex. Lord.
text:I needed this. I’m usually so confident in my outfits but there’s just something about turning 30 plus comments here and there from my older family members that make me second guess myself and make me wonder if I need to find a new style even though I love my clothes and style.	labels:You do you! I went through a phase at like 28 where I felt like I had to have this "timeless capsule adult lady wardrobe" and changed my whole style to fit into a societal expectation of what a 30 year olds style should be. I was BORED, uninspired, and honestly spent money on stuff I hated. Now I just wear whatever I think looks fun and inspires me and yes that includes gen Z jeans lol. Fashion isn't supposed to make you feel sad and life is short. Wear the damn crop top.
text:Ugh, I did the same thing in my mid 20s. I had a closet full of classic, timeless, structured neutrals that so many books and blogs promised would carry me through my life...it was awful and I was miserable.

text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I have been working from home in sweatpants and leggings since March and will WFH until at least summer 2021.   I miss going to the office and feeling cute, and being seen by others. A woman I work with told me ‘you always have the cutest dresses’ about a year ago and I absolutely loved hearing that. I’ve learned in quarantine that I don’t dress for myself, I dress for other people.   I’ll probably dress up a bit more when I can go back and wear more lipstick, since I’ve been in comfy slouch mode for so long.
text:This so much!  I love getting compliments, and it's easier to complement "fun" things. If I show up in a blue dress with little birds on it, It will get compliments.   A much more stylish blouse and pants with killer heels? It will look great, but no one compliment the perfect black pants.  At home with a dark office and shitty camera, I wear knitted joggers and cardigans with tight tops, like heattech. I'm really happy about trading most sweatpants for knitted versions, even though it's mostly synthetics. I find my legs are sensitive to wool.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 16, 2020	labels:I'm trying to find a nice warm jacket/coat to wear that will keep me comfortable below freezing and the wind doesn't cut through. It gets below 32F here (US South East) often, even down into the 20s & teens.  My clothing currently consists of blue jeans, chinos, and some high top black & white converses. Would love something I could wear with both. I've looked into bomber jackets and pea coats. Not sure what all else I should look into. I know I like fitted clothing rather than bulky. My family keeps suggesting the big canvas carhartt jackets, but they are a bit big and bulky to be wearing with chinos on my way to work.  As far as price goes, I'm not sure what decent jackets/coats (or any clothing for that matter) go for. I'd like to stay under $100 though, but would go a little more for the perfect jacket that would last me a long time.  Any advice would be very appreciated!	episode_done:True

text:Thanks for this. I’ll wear a couple of those items because work says I MUST, but I don’t want or need the rest.

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:The best response I’ve ever heard for this question was comparing runway high fashion to the concept cars you’ll see at auto shows. Those cars will often never make it into production but that’s not the point. The point is to show off new materials, technologies, design philosophies or to generally stir up interest in a brand. Same for fashion.
text:But I feel like unlike runway fashion, concept cars are more appealing to the masses, even if they ultimately can't afford them.	labels:That’s why I like the comparison.   Clothes have a practical use. They keep you warm and dry and protect you from the elements. They also have a social use. The way you dress tells other people how you want to be interacted with. They also have an expressive use. Your orange jacket is your favorite color, the Metallica patch on your vest is there to remind you of the concert where you met your wife.  In the same way cars have a practical use. They are a conveyance to move people and things. They have a social use. A fancy new Mercedes or a well maintained classic jaguar e type tells others where you are in the hierarchy. They also have an expressive quality. Color, form, decals, tinted windows, spinner donk rims, etc.   And in both cases you’ll see where there the style portion of the item needs to be balanced against the practical and social portions. A Lamborghini Aventador is dripping in style but you can’t move furniture with it. But it still functions as a car. You can still drive it on a public highway. It still has airbags and an engine and runs on pump gas.   High fashion, like concept cars, can be completely devoid of practicality. You can see clothes warped to the point where you question how the person even walks upright wearing their outfit. Sometimes they can’t. Concept cars can be so oddly proportioned that they cant fit an engine or drivetrain. Sometimes they don’t even have working doors on hinges. But that’s the point. It’s to turn the expression and social interaction values to maximum without having to compromise with practicality.	episode_done:True
text:How do you tell when discounted items were never full price?	labels:It doesn't matter if they were sold at a higher price, plenty of crap is marked up regardless of quality. What matters is if they are a price you're willing to pay.  Also try checking other websites good the same item to see price variances.
text:I think it might matter a lot. Especially when buying online. The people setting the price knew what the item was worth approximately. If the item is crap you can only inflate the price so much. Even when you get into the whole brand markup.  There is a massive difference in quality for example in Nordstrom rack items that were made for the rack with a fake mark down vs the flagship store sale items. You can feel the difference in person but online how can you tell except a real mark-down?  I’m super interested in this topic OP. This is a good one.	labels:I think this is spot on, that there will be a difference in quality depending if it was made for outlets or boutiques. For stuff like leather goods (shoes and bags) and coats, there's a stark difference even if they're the same designer (ex: coach outlet vs coach, kate spade). I've been facing this same problem when trying to buy a purse myself and it's tough.	episode_done:True

text:Arc'teryx Radsten Parka (2020) Review	labels:For what it's worth, I have the camosun, one level up in warmth from the radsten. Uses a slightly thicker synthetic insulation and also adds some down, and it keeps me comfortable down to -20C easily, no matter how much wind there is.  Otherwise a lot of what you mention here is valid in terms of construction between the two coats.
text:yeah the camosun might have been a slightly better fit for me. I am pretty happy with my radsten anyway, but wouldn't go any colder with it then the weather in vienna rn. When ordering I was afraid that the camosun would be too warm, which I think it could also very well be. So I chose the one where I thought that it would maybe be a bit too cold instead of too warm and having to sweat. I think that I might pick up a good fleece or thermal underlayer and that should do the trick for the cold days. :)	labels:That's a really good point!  I only start to wear the camosun around 0 degrees and have other lighter coats for above that. Really depends on what your needs are, since winter in Canada can get a bit more extreme than austria.
text:yeah the only other jackets I have (besides the UNiqlo one that I hate) is just a very light nike acg jacket with primaloft insulation and an old lightly insulated barbour coat which I had to wear together at about 5C.   I remember when first checking out this sub not realising how fcking cold canada can be and thinking that I'd need a therme with a down jacket and fleece underneath haha	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:I have a really hard time shopping on poshmark. I find I have to be super specific and it's not great for browsing. For instance "j crew tan cashmere cardigan" gets a manageable result but "flowy top" does not. I also uncheck boutique as that's all cheap stuff from china and search by brand when I have one in mind.   Ebay is has more filters which helps to narrow items down. I usually filter by material and country (only shop within the us since that's where I am, this gets rid of all the new stuff from china).  Also, I would definitely recommend thredup because you can return things. I recently placed my first order from them and ended up returning about half of it. They charge $2 per return and for free shipping you have to take store credit, which I think is fair and way better than just being stuck with something that doesn't fit. You can set up saved searches to make it easy to check for new items and also filter by brand/material/size/condition and sort by newest first.   Depop is also worth checking out, I find it to be a bit more curated and trendy than poshmark but often overpriced. There are less items so searching is more manageable, and search results are based on an algorithm (poshmark is just newest first). Also shipping is cheaper for small/light things.  Another one people are into is the real real, I haven't ordered from them myself but have seen it recommended. I think it's pretty much a higher end thredup.	episode_done:True

When I was riding my bike to school one morning I rode past a yard sale that an old woman was having at her HUGE ocean front home. I spied a Fendi shoulder bag with the signature interlocking F’s and bought it for $20. She told me she paid “hundreds” for it, but could never fit all of her stuff in it. I was visibly thrilled and she patted my hand and said she was happy someone who loved it would give it a good home. So sweet.

Perhaps try taking a little break/limit time from exposure to social media? It might change the way you dress. Also, I find that educating myself about the world of fashion has really opened my eyes to all the possible things that one can wear, so maybe try reading up on some fashion history/watching educational videos to hopefully gain a deeper appreciation for garments? But honestly, the "real you" should be the you that you feel most comfortable and happiest in. Good luck!	episode_done:True

text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Great advice so far, another thing to take into consideration is fabric type. For example pants in a cotton and spandex blend are going to be more forgiving, fit-wise, than 100% cotton. So for example I could wear skinny jeans in size 30 if they had spandex/elastene in the fabric, where the same brand and size in 100% cotton denim might not get past my hips.	episode_done:True

I now get most of my clothes from brands that have XXS. Uniqlo has been one of my go to brands, the sleeves are a bit long (maybe by 1") but that I get it tailored so that the fit is perfect even if it costs me an extra $15. Banana Republic's XXS size also fits nicely. That should get you through all tops, dressy and classy. Get the slim fit if it fits you better.  Outerwear like jackets I get from Uniqlo. JCrew XS back in the day was pretty good.  As for suits, I have so far gotten them custom made in India. Let me know if you find something that works for you and I might check it out.

text:How do you guys who like a formal/business look manage to not look the same all the time?	labels:Is this an pressure that is coming internally from you being bored or more externally from perceived social pressure or media pressure around you? It sounds like you know what you like and that you’ve already come up with outfits you love but feel pressure to be “new”. Reading about capsule wardrobes and minimalism may give you more justifications for repeating outfits that you love. If you are bored with your look, you could also try changing up your hair, make up, accessories and keep the outfits that make you feel powerful.
text:Wow that just made me think like actually. Just sat silently for a minute there. I’ve kind of always been a serial outfit repeater my whole life and it’s always been pointed out to me, and now that i have no one looking at me to point it out, I feel that bore. Super weird to think about but so interesting! It’s like I internalized it all those years. Thanks for pointing this out!	labels:Think of it this way.... some of the most powerful people in the world subscribe to a “uniform” so you are in good company. You have invested in good, tailored pieces. Wear them knowing they fit you well. You aren’t the person who has multiple outfits that don’t suit your body and or look sloppy.	episode_done:True

text:My Wardrobe Post: Based on what I currently have, what should I wear with what? And an essay reflecting on learning to dress better.	labels:Christ you’re gorgeous and you’ve really put a lot of thought into this.  I looked at your albums (HS til work, and the wardrobe) and perhaps I might’ve missed it but I think you’d look great with a plain tee + button up (tucked in, unbuttoned 1/3 ~ halfway). Maybe roll your sleeves up too?  I also really liked the sweater + collared (I assume a button up) outfit, but I guess the Texas weather ain’t great for that—but I’d love to see you in smart casual. I’m curious how’d you look like with glasses in these types of outfit—it’ll lean towards the nerdy side if that’s your thing. I also think a plain white button up for work would be nice—although it’s common and boring if you wear it right it’ll look great.  Try cardigans? I only skimmed through your future purchase so if you were planning on getting it, oops.  And the Adam Driver resemblance is uncanny—I can’t tell if I prefer you with long hair. You look great in both the work/WAYWT length hairs.  Korean men fashion is somewhat similar to the Japanese fashion style but I think there’s more so if you wanna look into that too.   I know very little about men’s shoes but I think finding more (semi) formal (?) options (leather... etc;) would benefit your outfit in the long run.  I can’t wait to see where you go with all of this!	episode_done:True

text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:I think start by looking at pictures online on Pinterest or Instagram of styles you find aesthetically pleasing and create a little dashboard with outfits that catch your eye. You can also think about some of your favourite actors or singers that wear outfits you like and try to save the pictures you find. After that i would go window-shopping online on websites that fit your budget and look around trying to find pieces similar to any outfits you saw. fyi; i would browse on a website first and then go to the actual store to try out what you saw online, it gives you an idea of what you’re looking for.  I think imitation is the easiest way to start finding your style. Once your comfortable in a type of style you can start experimenting with it and picking more personalized pieces. Good luck :)
text:I've tried that but feel like the outfits are too much for a casual stop at the grocery store. Any tips on that?	labels:Part of it is accepting that it's okay to dress up for the everyday. You do everyday stuff every day so why would you exclude those things from opportunities to feel like your best self?   Now is, I think, a perfect time to play around with atypical/"special"/non-casual pieces in every day wear. There's been a great blurring of lines between occaisions and I'm seeing lots of real business wear matched with casual items, like pencil skirts with chuck taylors or dress pants and denim jackets. Ultimately, it is the full package more so than indivdiual pieces that make an outfit appropriate for a situation. That isn't to say that there aren't specific items that are inherently inappropriate for some settings, but that at least some of the partitions we've placed between items of clothing are unnecessary and arbitrary, and they prevent creative engagement with your closet.	episode_done:True
text:Does your language affect how you wear colors?	labels:Interesting question, but it further begs the question: what about bilingual or polyglots? Does language truly affect anyone in terms of color preferences?  And I don’t necessarily think language is a good measure for color because someone in SoCal will wear brighter colors than someone in Minnesota despite having the same language.  I think climate and culture play a bigger role because even countries with similar or the same languages don’t necessarily view color in a similar manner.  Edited to add: a better example of this would be French speaking countries (France vs Burkina Faso vs Haiti etc) or other countries that share a language
text:Language actually plays a huge roll in your development, but so do culture and climate.	labels:I never stated language doesn’t play a role in development. I simply stated that language doesn’t play as large a role in color preferences as OP thinks. There may be some, but I chalk it down to climate, culture, and, quite frankly, personal preferences.	episode_done:True

I appreciated that their menswear (sweaters in particular) came in small sizes that I could wear. One of my favourite sweaters is a thin wool men's from Le Chateau, purchased 2009, still looks and feels like new. My most complimented blazer is from their 'Made in Canada' line. Aw.  They've been on the chopping block for years, though. Not at all surprising they've collapsed now.  The number of different pieces they produced always seemed crazy to me. The outlet stores were enormous and I could go back year after year and see a lot of the same clothes from my last visit. Why bother purchasing anything full-price from their main stores when the outlets were bursting with the same stuff but half the price?	episode_done:True

text:Whats with all the "stretchy mens pants" startups I am seeing all of a sudden?	labels:This is only me personally, and disagrees with the current vibe on this sub, but here goes.  I think people want the look of well-fitted, tailored, bordering on skinny pants.  I think the majority of the (western) world sees these tighter fitting clothes as more attractive.  However, they're not the most comfortable in many cases.  They restrict movement.  Reddit's answer and even to a degree forward-ish fashion has been to get loose fitting things and create a vibe around that look.  Big silhouettes and wide lines.  It's super comfortable.  The middle ground is to get tighter fitting clothes that still move with you - you have the look of the skinny clothes with the freedom of the loose clothes.	episode_done:True

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I see people wear black tights with light colored or even spring dresses and I can’t stand it! Black tights don’t go with everything! Personally, in winter it’s all about fabrics. Heavy fabrics will look better with your boots and tights. I have a pair of black suede thigh high boots that keep my legs warm and go with pretty much everything in my closet. If I think black is too harsh, I have brown heeled booties that I wear with various patterned nude tights. Also sweater dresses are amazing because you can wear them with actual leggings and any boot! I also have a coat that’s nearly floor length to keep my legs warm if need be.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:I think once you have your basics down, pay attention to the kinds of things that you find yourself wishing you had when you're getting dressed or when you're out.

It also helps if you get super specific about what you want and don't pick up things that kinda work, since you'll just end up buying a ton of similar things.	episode_done:True
text:Wolf vs Goat Fonzie Goes to India t-shirt Review and Fit	labels:I’ve been looking for the perfect white T-shirt for a while. It’s almost an obsession at this time.  Right now the only T-shirt that checks all the marks, except for price, is Velva Sheen.  Wolf vs Goat seems too gimmicky to enter the list as of yet I tried these brands:  Velva Sheen — perfect but too expensive. Not very soft but I don’t really mind it since it holds its shape/fit is the perfect thickness.  Everlane heavyweight cotton — good but too long.  Naked and famous — too long and expensive ($50)  Uniqlo Supima cotton — too thin, shows my nipples  Taylor stitch heavy weight — too thick for the summer  Taylor stitch hemp cotton blend — too thin, shows my nipples. Nice fit though   Random Amazon heavy weight cotton — too long and loose  Next one one on my list is Kuwalla because they have the same barrel stitching construction as Velva Sheen but much cheaper at roughly $25/tshirt, and it will likely be the last one before I bite the bullet and go full Velva sheen for my tshirts.  Edit:  Just noticed WvG is based in DC. Going to give them a try.

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:Short of getting a bit of insider info, I think the only way to really have success at those stores is to browse them at least once a week (probably twice).  My aunt tends to go every other day and finds some amazing stuff…because she goes *every other day*.  She says it doesn’t take her long because she’s so familiar with their stock, but it still seems exhausting to me.  (As opposed to spending three hours scrolling through Poshmark in bed every night…)

text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:I still buy from the junior's section and I'm 31. A) I'm only 5'2" and B) it's sometimes cheaper. I just try to make sure that I don't wear something to work that my students would wear. Beyond that, the sky's the limit. I'm known for dressing up anyway.  Look for sturdier materials rather than "slub" ones, and pay close attention to fit. I look better in form-fitting clothes or items with a defined waist, and avoid the long and loose T-shirt dresses. If material and fit are good, I find that nobody can really tell that it's a dress designed for twelve year-olds.	episode_done:True

text:> on the flip side, why do bowls of pho or hand-pulled noodles cost severely less?  Same reason why, in popular culture, food from France, Italy, etc. continue to be considered atop the hierarchy of global food while food from India, China, Thailand, African countries, etc. are not.   Not that that's the only reason, but it is one of them.  >why does a plate of carbonara cost $20 in LA and NY?  You'll also have to consider that restaurant pricing in places like LA and NYC will just be higher on average, in addition to the dumb prestige-premium associated with ordering "French food" and "Italian food."	labels:	episode_done:True

But everything I bought was bought for "next year me". For when I'm at a new job that involves being in an office all day, travelling through snow and sleet and rain and sunshine 😄 Right now I'm working from home and my outfits are pajamas and slippers.  Also, there was a lot of comfort shopping too, this year has been brutal and painful. If some new boots can make me smile for a week, it's worth it.
text:Goodness yes. This year has been horrible and fashion shopping as a hobby was one of a few nice things left to cheer me up. I think I may have doubled my wardrobe by now.

text:We’re in a post fashion world everything is in, looser fits have been very popular the last several years, you don’t have to wear them just to be on trend.  General advice is balancing out proportions, instead of wear one oversized item with a bunch of skinny stuff try to pair oversized tops to with looser pants and chunky footwear, I think layering helps to make the width look more intentional as well, and make sure things still fit you correctly(ie, don’t just buy things too large for you) you can expect stuff like slightly dropped shoulders or longer hemlines are oversized clothing but make sure it still falls relatively close to what you want, and have pants that are hemmed to not be pooling around your shoes, most people here prefer cropped cuts for looser pants but a half break or so is fine as well.	labels:that’s really helpful thank you	episode_done:True

text:I really question why I frequent that sub sometimes. Too many absolute pieces of shit people on there. I suppose that's why the negative connotations with the style exist. We need more dress trad; be rad enthusiasts.	labels:In my native culture this kind of style is *very* frowned upon (which of course doesn't stop a very obnoxious minority to dress like this anyway), so I'm biased to begin with. I realise this isn't internationally true, so present company very much excluded.  "Prep" brings together a couple of things about fashion I don't really like. The whole "dressing with the (only) goal of elevating one's social status" thing and *then* going for "looking like old money" to achieve that. Just horrible to me. Who decides that they *want* to look like their father bought them a spot at Harvard? Doesn't reflect well on one's character imho.  I really like nautical references and turn of the century styles, so it's a shame.
text:All good points, but I think that’s why we can’t always look at just clothing. We need to look at how someone carries themselves.  To use myself as an example, I think on paper i might sound like I dress like a rich American WASP heir, but if you look further, I think I make many choices that. WASP wouldn’t do. The same goes for the other dressers in the article who wear brass button jackets- none of them *overtly* looks like a college Republican	labels:I think you're right that on paper you fit into this, but really looking at your fits you don't dress at all in the way that I think is bad. I was talking more about (what I imagine to be) the typical r/navyblazer user, not you specifically. You dress very "trad" but not at all like "I (want people to believe that I) come from old money", which is what I find icky.  I really like your navy blazer too.

Then I came here and apparently you need to have a name for your ~*aesthetic*~ with at least 4 adjectives "preppy witchy nonsensical space librarian" and I learned that some people seem to buy clothes they don't like because they're "trendy"? And they think that everyone who's "trendy" just buys the latest clothes because they're in fashion and not because they like them?   IDK, the FFA mentality and shopping habits are super confusing to me.

text:but I didn't pay it when I bought it. Maybe it's factored in into the price of the goods. But it's still way cheaper	labels:You wouldn't pay it then, because you're not paying the company you buy it from. If there are import taxes, the government/courier will charge you (you'll get an email, most likely) and will keep the item/s until you pay it. At least, that's what happened to me.

text:Inspo Album: Vintage Wool Sweaters Need Good, Loving Homes	labels:As a born and raised Norwegian, now living in the UK, my love for wool jumpers is endless and my sadness is twofold. 1) I might be Norwegian, but I've also got extremely sensitive skin. Thus my heart may be set on wool, but my skin is absolutely not, unless it's very fine cashmere or particular blends. 2) When autumn comes my immediate reaction is "WEAR ALL THE WOOL JUMPERS", and then I remember I live in the south of England and it doesn't actually get that cold here, plus it always rains.   Neither of those points are going to keep me from now spending several hours looking at vintage wool jumpers online though.

text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:Don’t forget to check out thrift stores. This is where I stock up on cashmere sweaters for a few dollars a piece, wool skirts, kilts, sweaters, vests, and cardigans, and amazing wool blazers and coats. I’ve found mint condition mohair and camel hair 3/4 coats for as low as $10, black cashmere sweaters for $2-3 and up, and cable knit pullovers for as low as $4. It’s amazing what people get rid of, not realizing how expensive it all is new. I also loooove wool in the fall and winter, and so this has been a super affordable way to build a dream cold-weather wardrobe.   The only thing wool I buy new are socks for the most part, everything else I’ve found at estate sales, garage sales, and thrift shops. When/if you go, definitely go through the boys and men’s departments, too. A bit of tailoring can make anything look custom like some of the pieces on Walker Slater maybe.
text:I feel like other people near me know the thrift store magic because I haven't found cashmere there in like 2 years. However, thredup can be good. I despise cotton sweaters because they're not warm enough and wool sweaters are super itchy unless they're merino or cashmere so basically I'm screwed.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Is anyone dressing up this year for Halloween?	labels:I am ashamed to admit that I forgot it was halloween today. We were invited to a Halloween party a few weeks ago and we declined and I haven’t thought of it much since. The local stores and boutiques near me haven’t done anything special for Halloween this year, just the fall display dragged on. I just got a coffee this morning and am sitting outside to read and just now realized that local coffee shop had no seasonal decor at all whatsoever! So unusual!  I’d best remember to put out a bowl of candy, but many of the places around here canceled trick or treating outright so I don’t have any prepared. You’ve inspired me to take a drive around today and look at some halloween decorations. I miss it! I think I will splurge for the full sized candy bars this afternoon and leave them outside. Give anyone here who IS trick or treating an extra treat!  Thank you ❤️
text:Hahahah I don't blame you. It feels like March 2092nd LOL     You are so right! I haven't seen many stores pushing Halloween stuff like they normally do. I put out some lights, in hopes of bringing some normalcy. Hopefully I will get some kiddos.     Hope you have a blast. I do that exact thing for Christmas.

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Addressing the body change: I too gained a decent amount of weight in my mid twenties due to getting an office job. One of the biggest breakthroughs I had in terms of my style was accepting my new body/silhouette and figuring out what cuts work for my new body. With that extra weight, I ended up loving the way I looked in long, dark pencil skirts paired with a tucked in top. Additionally, I stopped caring about the number or the size of the garment. Sometimes I needed a size M, sometimes I needed a size XL. Once I got over that mental hurdle, shopping was so much easier.   &#x200B;  Addressing the lifestyle change: Not sure if this is the advice you wanted to hear, but this is what worked for me. My younger self's style was not office appropriate at all. I was into short sundresses and plunging necklines. My big "ah-hah" moment was realizing that I can have two styles. At work, I'm a walking advertisement for J.Crew and I feel so confident. Outside of work, I'm in a short dress and high heels. The trick for me was realizing that my body can pull off different silhouettes depending on the style. I enjoy form fitting outfits in my office wardrobe. Conversely, I enjoy flowy outfits in my non-office wardrobe.

text:General Discussion - November 27, 2020	labels:Hot take: speaking from experience, fetishistically optimizing the most basic of basics (e.g. "the best plain white t-shirt") for maximum imagined value is not a meaningful nor worthwhile exercise. Your wardrobe is not more interesting because your white tee is better than another white tee, and by the time you've found the 'perfect' piece either the prevailing trend or your own preferences will probably have changed.  'Perfect tee' threads are usually highly-upvoted, but the answers have drawn from the same pool for the last goddamn decade:  - *Vintage/workwear (generally heavier, boxier, shorter):* 3sixteen, Buzz Rickson's, Lady White Co. - *Streetwear (generally lighter, slimmer, longer):* Reigning Champ, wings + horns, John Elliott - *"Normal" (somewhere in the middle)*: Naked & Famous, Arket, American Apparel when they still existed - *Edgy goth shit:* Rick Owens mainline for lighter and DRKSHDW for heavier, Kazuyuki Kumagai Attachment, Voidthebrand when they still existed - *Budget*: Muji, Uniqlo, Everlane, Bella+Canvas, etc., but no one really cares  It's functionally a solved question. You can pick one from the applicable list for your style, and it'll be *fine.*

text:Noel Fielding X Fendi menswear colab	labels:I think Noel Fielding's art work is fun, and he is a very fun, odd dude. I loved him in IT Crowd, and he's weird as ever in the B. Baking series.   His Fendi graphics are arguably the better items in the fashion show, but wouldn't it be just as good if they used another contemporary artist? I feel that this type of graphics can be interchangeable. Any local graffiti artist could do something interesting. Noel is just famous.
text:You definitely have a point. While this collection leans more graffiti, I think the rest of his art is a bit more abstract than a lot of graffiti art I’ve seen (though in fairness I don’t follow the graffiti scene closely), and the sweater vests and puffy coat showcase that for me. Maybe I’m just excited because I’ve been eyeing some of his art prints and now his art is available in the form of fashion. I’m also very curious to see how they will translate the colab to RTW and if there will be additional prints that pop up there.	labels:	episode_done:True

High school- I geared more toward my current look. Jeans and t shirts, or dresses and leggings/tights if the weather allowed. I was very much an Ann Taylor/Loft fan because of their petite sizing. Sometimes I wore slacks and t shirts because slacks are more comfortable than jeans imo.  College (right now.)- I wear a lot of things similar to what you described as your current style! Not nearly as often as I’d like due to weather and dresses aren’t always practical. I did just get a bunch of new stuff from Collectif if 40s/50s vintage inspired clothes are up your alley.

text:Not sure where in Europe you live but they’re not popular in the UK ...as another poster mentioned, if it’s hot enough to need to wear shorts there are many better alternatives than the jeans variety.

When I'm older and have more money and reasons to wear a bag, maybe I'll own one.
text:My biggest problem with Telfar is that there isn’t a size between the small and medium bags. The size difference is massive.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 04, 2021	labels:   Hey guys, first of all i respect all the work you invest to help people.  I am 17 years old, 6'7 and around 210 pounds, I play basketball so I am somewhat athletic-skinny?  Quarantine in Greece ends in a week so I want to come back and look better than ever so styling I can use in school.  I am asking for an a advice on how to dress-style, what looks good and what not. I am kinda into sport style but I wouldn't mind trying different things. Every little help-advice would be greatly appreciated!
text:Definitely recommend you checking out the sidebar along with inspiration albums to see what type of style you like best.   As for getting new pieces, don’t buy too much at once, and really spend some time researching fit and quality, especially with your build!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Schott 538 Nubuck Cowhide Mechanic Jacket	labels:I’ve been looking for a suede or nubuck jacket forever. Love this one besides for the contrast collar. Closest I’m leaning towards now is Todd Snyder’s suede chore coat but I’m not in love with the green color. Thanks for the review tho bud, wouldn’t have any doubt that Schott wouldn’t deliver a quality product  also Orvis had a couple decent looking suede jackets on their website but when I went to the store they’re only carried online, kinda skeptical about their quality of leather
text:It's pretty hard to find a good one! I like the nubuck material as it is stronger than suede and gives a bit more structure. Good call about Orvis, also unsure of leather quality. Overland is another shop that has good leather jackets but didn't have anything in stock with this design. The contrast collar definitely is the most controversial part about this jacket, maybe they'll make one without it!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:It's not fashion limbo as much as with the internet, fashion is becoming less cyclical and more of certain things staying popular in certain circles. Things selling out and not coming back in stock could just be that it's this time of year, when FW stocks are getting low and SS collections have yet to be released.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:“I'm all locked down with nowhere to go – but that hasn't killed my lust for fashion”	labels:The past 10 months I've only been going outside of my lil apartment for my daily dog walks, and I think it's really helped me find my style that is 100% for me, and 0% what other people will think about what I'm wearing. I've essentially created a small capsule wardrobe of all new clothes in the past year that I love and I'm so excited to pick out my outfits every day. The few blocks around my place have become my runway, and I have come to love the passing comments from the fellow dog walking neighbors about how they feel underdressed when they see me!	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:Short of getting a bit of insider info, I think the only way to really have success at those stores is to browse them at least once a week (probably twice).  My aunt tends to go every other day and finds some amazing stuff…because she goes *every other day*.  She says it doesn’t take her long because she’s so familiar with their stock, but it still seems exhausting to me.  (As opposed to spending three hours scrolling through Poshmark in bed every night…)
text:I worked at TJ Maxx over the summer and can attest to this. The people who found the best deals were regulars. Also, you just have to take the time to go through pretty much every item.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:This is why streetwear has been my favorite trend. Now I, a 29 year old woman, can dress like I’ve given up and still be fashionable.  Sweat pants? Yes please! Tall socks folded over soft leggings? Of course! Sweaters all year round? Don’t mind if I do! Comfy shoes on all but the most special occasions? Yay!	episode_done:True
text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I'm just... still getting dressed up. This has actually given me a nice opportunity to try new combinations of outfits and pull out pieces that I wasn't sure about before. The routine of getting dressed and feeling put together is really important for me with regards to getting into the work mindset.
text:Same.  When I worked in Antarctica, there obviously was no reason for me to put on makeup, do my hair, and put on nice clothes.  One season I worked in a lab and the other I was a contractor at the South Pole.  I still did it anyway.  I like how I look with makeup and my hair done so who cares if there's nobody there to appreciate it.   Now I'm back working a "regular" job in the lower 48.  I'm a pharmacist so I still have to go into work.  The only thing that's really changed is that I wear a headband with buttons on the side to save my ears.  I'm not a fan of wearing the same headband every day, but it does help with the pain immensely.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I've taken 566 outfit photos over 4 years (my style from mid-20s to 30)	labels:Thank you for making so much effort to document your relations to fashion. The mark that you have left for others will ripple into the way all of your readers will spend time with their own style. It means a lot to me to see someone who cares about where there clothing is sourced and that their habits related to shopping were not always perfect. This was relatable. Inspiring.  Also, your messy hair is always so chic. Your outfits seem to tell a composed and thoughtfulness that you don't see on fashion models or bloggers. This was truly great. Bravo.  Also, if I may ask where your black jeans are from in the second photo of 2020 going left to right. I saw you linked a boot cut pair from NA-KD. Are these the same?	episode_done:True
text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I bought/sold on Poshmark when it was starting to get popular, and found great deals and sold pretty easily on it. I stopped a year later - by that time, I had started seeing wholesale distributers flooding the site and making it alot harder for me to find actual used clothing for decent prices. I'd agree that there are likely too many sellers now compared to buyers - or at least too much merchandise compared to buyers. To me, that makes Poshmark too much like Ebay, and is no longer as distinct a platform as it used to be.  Edit: typos
text:I mean tbh I have a harder time with random people wondering why something they bought at target two years ago isn't worth retail price or above now and arguing that its out of production so it's worth more (girl it's our of production because they don't keep producing the same things season to season oh my God).   I think some of this comes down to the encouragement of bargaining on the platform. People will say they anticipate being offered a lower number so they'll overprice something, but if you're a buyer that's just an additional layer of hassle that would stop impulsive purchases which isn't great for getting things sold.	labels:	episode_done:True

I'm working as an eCommerce Specialist with \~3 years of experience.  I genuinely don't know how to dress. For anyone who has spare time and any interest, I would really appreciate your insight.

text:Scene / Emo / Goth fashion in 2020	labels:Aside from graphic tees (which I've learned to make on my own now, but its a money sink unless you can find buyers to supplment it) almost everything I and my friends did in our youths were DIY. We added our own studs, spikes, zippers, straps, belts, etc. Obviously adding a pocket would require a little extra but it was possible and within a few tries you'd be golden. Adding patches, fabric strips and other misc. items and using fabric inks went a long way. One of our friends even started fabricating her own jeans.  We were into punk fashion though, so not sure how much of this advice applies to what you're looking for.  The best way to get what you want is to make it. Though there are some elaborate apparel items (like a victorian-inspired goth coat) that would be better off buying... but DIY will be a LOT cheaper and produce exactly what you want if you're capable.
text:Thank you, i actually need to do some DIY but vie been a little lazy and with the holidays i don't think ill be doing it any time soon.. I haven't found a good place to buy cool patches yet other than Esty, do you know any good places to find them?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:I would maybe get a dress for each season. You don’t want to go to a winter wedding in a summer dress and with so many weddings coming up there’s bound to be one in each season.
text:That’s a really good point, but could you elaborate on what makes a dress appropriate for certain seasons, other than temperature considerations? I wear jeans and t-shirts all year long, so I’m very ignorant in this whole area.	labels:Mainly the temperature aspect but there are definitely some preferable color pallets for different seasons. Specifically the temperature one though.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: What is the difference between off the rack (OTR), made to measure (MTM) and Bespoke?	labels:OTR - clothing is made according to an existing pattern for different sizes.  MTM - clothing is made from a pattern that exists but may be modified for size or some details Bespoke - clothing is made from a custom pattern	episode_done:True
text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:Why would it be tonedeaf? This is kind of a U.S.-centric view. Not everyone in the world is still struggling with COVID, and a lot of the rest of the world isn't nearly as casual as America is, fashion-wise.   Call me crazy, but I'm tired of shapeless billowy clothing in earth tones, and I am READY for some structure and interesting textures. All summer has been about beige and washed out green and brown linen, let's see something else.   Plus, it's a weird take anyway, because high fashion doesn't really target loungewear, either way. Do we really expect major fashion houses to all abandon blazers and leather pants and start showing PJs and sweatpants on the runway?   Others have already pointed out that these collections have been designed months in advance, but consider another point - fashion has always been reactive. When forced to stay inside and only wear sweatpants for 6 months, people will rebel and start daydreaming and longing for the opposite. This pandemic was always going to inspire a sort of glam rock aesthetic, imo. BRING IT.
text:> All summer has been about beige and washed out green and brown linen, let's see something else.   I just bought a shapeless army green linen jacket last month, no lie. :D  I would love to see something else even if I'm in linen lounge mode personally.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:Both my mother and I grew up in relative scarcity. My mom’s way of dealing with that is to hoard clothes. If she seems something cheap that can be gifted later to someone or worn for herself or her family she will buy it, because it’s always better to have too much than too little.   My way of dealing with scarcity was to learn to sew. I purchase clothes that are good quality wherever I can find them for a decent price and I fix them to last longer and/or fit me. So whereas when I was little and would shop with my mom she would buy however much she could, I don’t think I’ve ever bought more than 3 pieces at a time since I started shopping alone.	episode_done:True

text:Three brands only for the rest of your life.

I could get trackpants, derbies, sneaks, sweaters or suits.       Our Legacy - Same thing as with Acne        And then use the extra slot for Monitaly, Fjällräven, Lemaire, Kapital, Maharishi, Nigel Cabourn, Engineered Garments, Margiela or Visvim to get some extra flavour.	episode_done:True
text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:My personal two cents:   I don’t think I could ‘enjoy’ wearing my purchases if I bought them with the intent to resell, I’d feel like I had to be careful and baby them to preserve their value and that outweighs the potential recoup in money. Even worse, what if I babied them and stressed about keeping them pristine and STILL couldn’t sell them later on?  In the past when I’ve gotten lucky with recouping costs on items sold, it’s always been an unexpected surprise and on random contemporary brands like Aritzia and LL Bean (??). Meanwhile my HE stuff seems to park forever.
text:Are you consigning HE stuff? I don’t trust it on resale sites (looking at you Poshmark) because so many have trash authentication services.  But Aritzia wouldn’t be a resale price point I care that much about if it somehow ended up fake. And I’d probably be looking for a very specific item then anyway.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Influencers with Jobs: A Brief Collection	labels:Style Apotheca on Youtube is a pharmacist!   I definitely prefer to keep up with influencers who have real jobs for a few reasons.   Firstly, I don’t love when every other post or video is an ad. It makes it difficult to differentiate between actual personal style content and what’s just an ad for a company I’m not interested in shopping at. I don’t like being Sold something every time I watch a style video, and I find you get that less from influencers who get income from day jobs.  Secondly, as you say, there is a bit more realism in what they’re posting. Style doesn’t happen in a void, it has to happen in our daily lives. I don’t wear four-inch heeled boots to work, and I don’t like watching a college-age girl try and make Work Relatable content by making “Work Outfits” with four inch heeled boots. Influencers who have day jobs understand what it is boring office employees like me are looking for in a work outfit 😊 sure, maybe because of their “influencing” work they spend more money buying high-end clothing items that I’m simply never going to justify buying, but I don’t tend to follow people like that for very long.

text:Share what are your quick tips to always look polished !	labels:I have 2 pups and have accepted that I will always have dog hair on me.   Back when I wore more business clothes, I would have separate at home and work clothes. Changed out of my work clothes as soon as I got home and into sturdier/less expensive outfits.   Also recommend keeping a lint roller in the car.   To generally look polished: add an accessory like a scarf, earrings or a necklace.   I’m also a fan of tucking shirts/sweaters.

If you have a MasterClass pass anyway I’d say watch it, but I don’t know if it’s worth it for more experienced folks. He talks about building a capsule wardrobe and drives home what basics you need, but I was not impressed with his demonstrations of styling a dress. Perhaps if he had shown a more advanced view of styling with accessories and creating a look, but it was very entry level. There’s also a bit about building your confidence and believing in yourself.	episode_done:True

I'd love to see some recommendations in the comment section.	labels:In addition to the usual apps I've found that some mid-tier brands are waaaay cheaper second hand on designer consignment sites like TheRealReal and VestaireCollective than on ebay and Poshmark. Like Alice + Olivia or RED Valentino. Maybe because they're not luxury enough for the target audience on those sites, whereas on Poshmark/ebay they're considered higher value and therefore get marked up more.	episode_done:True

The judgements of people that think you look 'too old, cute, cool' etc are, fundamentally, a trap to be stepped over and disregarded.  Those people are a roadblock to true happiness and self-actualization, every single time you see one of them their only function is to stand between you and a good time, telling you about their compiled list of reasons for why this or that thing shouldn't be how *YOU* want it but how *THEY* want it.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 22, 2020	labels:I want to incorporate a flannel jacket into my rotation of fits.

So I was hoping the experts here could tell me which kind of flannel would go best.   And it's winter so I'd want a jacket (ish) to be able to wear it during 3/4 seasons.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 20, 2021	labels:I was recently awarded a 40 Under 40 award by a regional magazine. Part of the award includes a photoshoot to be printed in said magazine.   I'm a creative director for a living, I work in an environment that prides itself on comfortable dress. I have tailored suits, I know how to put together a nice outfit. However, I'd like to do something a bit different for this shoot. The suit is obvious, it's expected. How can I switch it up? Show off some more creativity in patterns, materials, or unexpected pieces.
text:I’d probably do   - unstructured sport coat with pattern or texture in something like dark burgundy or deeper green as an alternative to blue - shirt, pick what color you want - wool pants with some more texture or pattern, eg. a chalk stripe flannel or something. I think a medium gray would be the move here and would pair well with just about any jacket.  - tie and pocket square optional, I probably wouldn’t as it could come across as stuffy. Could do a square with no tie. - shoes id keep *slightly* more casual; maybe a chelsea boot or a penny loafer or something. You’re a creative director so show some creativity.  If you want some inspiration look at stuff like Drake’s, Boglioli, or Eleventy.  It would not hurt to bring two jackets, or if you decide to wear a tie, two ties, to the shoot in case one photographs drastically better.   Look a little creative but don’t add a bunch of accessories so it doesn’t look like you’re trying too hard.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I have similar connotations as you about them being kind of cheap or tacky looking, but would add one other angle to it. While I'm 100% against the use of real fur/exotic hides, I think part of the cheapness animal prints comes from taking something that in its natural state exists on fur and copy-pasting it onto all different kinds of fabrics. Real cheetahs look beautiful and elegant. A poorly rendered cheetah print on thin polyester leggings just looks like a terrible imitation. There isn't this mental comparison going on with other patterns, like stripes or polka dots, because there's no "real" standard to compare to. They're just decorative patterns.  Even if you attempt to create a faux fur that more closely imitates a real animal hide, it's going to look cheap and fake (to me) unless it is really well done.
text:I really like this point. I don't like cheap imitations in general and this applies directly to my distaste for animal prints. Great post!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Also, this is a common rule, but no clothing that requires anything special to wear it - eg a shirt that only works when you switch around the bra straps of your convertible bra, a dress that requires shapewear to look how you want it to look, a wrap blouse that has to be pinned into place after you put it on, a shirt that requires another shirt underneath because it’s see-through - all of those are a no for me. If it doesn’t work with just my regular underclothing (except for choosing nude underclothing for light pieces) I won’t buy it - I just know by now I’m not going to make the effort to wear it when I could just put on something easier that I like just as much.
text:Yes! Nothing that has "rules". I got rid of mostly everything that had a special requirement and I'm so much more comfortable in my clothing.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Handbag conundrum: lesser know (and lesser seen all over the place) or standard luxury designer bags (think the usual Gucci, YSL, LV, etc.)	labels:Definitely buy what makes you happy. The fact that you have looked at the high end, well known brands and came away disappointed indicates that (this season at least), they aren't for you.   To answer your question directly: for me, personally, showing my own style is 1000% more important than showing the status of a luxury brand. Do the two sometimes overlap? Yes, and that's fine. But I don't personally get buying something *just* because it is a certain brand. Who are you trying to impress? What are you conveying with that logo (wow, you're well off? What kind of message is that, on its own?) I just feel like people who are super into labels, not the design or the style or anything else, just come across as kind of immature? The truth is, anyone worth spending much time with isn't overly concerned with what logo your bag has. (Now! I will concede there is a difference between showing off luxury brands and having higher end items, in some circles. Like, there could be some tension if you're hanging out with super millionaire socialites and everything you wear is from TJ Maxx...but in that case, I'd still say its important to focus on personal style first. And knowing about smaller higher end designers, rather than designers you can buy at a mall, is a whole different thing too...)
text:I feel like showing off the logo is more of a poor person trying to look rich thing. Truly wealthy people don't try to show off like that. Also, a lot of the purses with very prominent logos are fugly.	labels:Truly wealthy people wear whatever they want because they don't have anything to prove or disprove. The Kardashians are very rich yet they have no problem wearing leggings and a t-shirt or being all decked out in Balmain, Gucci, LV.
text:100% this. This whole "truly wealthy people are classy" narrative that's so popular here is so incorrect.	labels:It might be tied in with old money/new money. New money might (like the kardashians) dress more loud, old money might dress more subtle. But even then, it's still a matter of personal taste. The Kardashians and other non rich people enjoy the loud look, that's fine, other rich and regular people don't, that's also fine.
text:Exactly, a matter of personal taste. I grew up with two billionaire's daughters (both going back at least three generations of extreme wealth), one would never wear (and still doesn't) any obvious logos or luxury designer items, the other would wear head-to-toe Chanel on the regular- she was gifted her first Chanel bag at age ten. She didn't care that "classy" people aren't supposed to wear one designer head-to-toe. When your inheritance is in hundreds of millions, you don't give a fuck what "classy" is supposed to be.

text:Villanelle's Killer Wardrobe, Once Again	labels:I'm usually paying attention to her face because she's such a great actress but I had a lot of fun looking at these outfits and paying some more attention to them. I find it interesting trying to break out what she wears when she's not playing a character and what she wears when she's trying play a character or when she's not trying but still is being manipulative. (**POSSIBLE SPOILERS UP TO END OF S3: DON'T READ AHEAD IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED AND DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED ALSO IF SOMEONE KNOWS HOW TO BLOCK THEM OUT AND CAN LET ME KNOW THAT'D BE AWESOME)**  &#x200B;  The little girlish dress with the cut out heart when she's pleading with her mom to form some kind of relationship with her and the pink dress when she's trying to trick Konstantin into thinking she's worried about him so she can steal the card with the next job on it.  When she's feeling herself and doesn't have to play a character she's usually wearing a patterned suit or some comfy black pants and a cool top. When she was playing Billie she wore two kimono-inspired jackets, which is pretty interesting and I just noticed the continuity for that character. When she was starting over after she thought Eve was dead she's wearing stylish romantic dresses which match her new villa in a way.    &#x200B;  **END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS**  &#x200B;  Anyway I enjoyed the album, she has a really interesting style and wears everything so well.	episode_done:True

A woman I knew from my school days has a lot of spotted dogs. When I commented that they would make a beautiful coat, she became offended! AITA?   Edit to add: My husband is a furrier, if that helps your decision.  Edit again to add: I may also be a lot older than the woman with the spotted dogs and have a red and black roadster and no husband, depending.
text:NTA! If that woman doesn’t want people commenting on how good of a coat her dogs would make she shouldn’t have them! It sounds like she might be abusing them by her reaction. That was way out of line for what you said. Maybe look into calling animal control to protect them. Or even better take them yourself!

Shopping in a store was a hassle cause only a certain amount of people can go and if you try on clothes they can’t put it back to the floor so I felt bad about that. I only returned an item once and it was pretty easy but sadly not free so I’m most likely not going to buy from that store online again.	episode_done:True
text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I work in an office and am supposed to dress business casual.   My entire closet is work clothes and while some of it is cute it’s mostly boring and safe.   I feel like my personal style is edgy and fun. I’m working on curating a weekend wardrobe and not focusing on work outfits until I have just as much weekend  and after work clothes. I’m thinking fun  Art teacher and also colorful mom clothes but we will see I also like basics a lot like jeans and a black top .
text:I love the idea of a weekend wardrobe! I work in an office where everybody is super casual (jeans and T-shirts) that whenever I dress up (wear a cute dress or even mini skirt + stockings in the winter), I get asked if I have plans after work or I end up feeling overdressed. So even if I do feel good when I leave the house, I feel super conscious by the time I get to the office. A weekend wardrobe sounds like a good plan!	labels:The best reply to those comments is "this is what I wear now" and then ignore them. They will stop asking if you're consistent for a couple weeks.   I'm in a super male dominated environment for both my jobs and my style is very Ms. Frizzle-esque.   One of my jobs is uniformed, other isn't. The former, I go absolutely nuts and colourful on my makeup (legit will wear glitter and draw designs with eyeliner if I'm feeling in the mood for it) and the latter meant I was more dressed up than about 98% of the staff (there was one cashier who was like me, she DGAF what people thought and would wear jewel tone velvet shirts and leather pants and studded boots when everyone else was in jeans and t shirts. She looked awesome. )     After about a week, people stopped asking questions.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 20	labels:Can anyone recommend a good brand of tank top to use as an undershirt that meets the following criteria?  - Long enough to be tucked into the pants without coming untucked throughout the day by doing things like raising my arms, bending over, etc  - Armholes and necklines aren't massive on larger sizes.   The few brands I've tried, I had to go for larger sizes to meet first criteria, but then I ended up with tanks with armholes and necklines so massive that it looked like one of those goofy wrestling leotards. It looked stupid, and it was also very uncomfortable because I often had the hems rubbing on my nipples. Ideally, the neckline should be low enough that I could wear a v-neck without it being visible, but not so low that it sits below my nipple line. And the armholes shouldn't go lower than a few inches below my armpits. And again, needs to be long enough that I can tuck it into my pants without it coming untucked (I'm 6ft and 220lbs, so I do have a bit of a gut).  Bonus points if it's incredibly comfortable.	episode_done:True

Today I ruined my last good pair of chinos. Anyone know a brand that could work for me without the need for fitting? I like chinos and a slim, fitted look. Many ”athletic fit” pants look like shit since there is to much fabric around the calfs and foot.	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:i would say to just experiment with pieces. when it’s covid safe, go to the mall and try on some stuff in changing rooms. see what “feels like you” and looks right on your body and run with that. style is dynamic, and sometimes you just stop liking things. it happens! i also recommend pinterest, go on there and look at outfits, and pin all the ones you like, then go back and try to notice similarities, either in aesthetic or specific looks. good luck on your style journey!

Note, this is my second pair, and this time I decided to go with the all whites instead of re-upping on the gum sole. It's not that I don't like this, it's a combination of not a lot of clothes purchases this year (which has been great) while also not loving them as much as the gum soles. I still have my gum soles and I almost pulled the trigger on another pair this week since they had seconds on sale for $89.	episode_done:True

text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:I wouldn't say I inherently hate the brand but I think Champion is an example of a brand that exploded a few years back/to now basically all because some celebrities or whoever wore it- and everyone who wears it now is most likely a ding dong hypebeast type or the VSCO type girl or whatever. Like I'm old enough to remember it being bottom tier Wal Mart level shit you'd get borderline made fun of for wearing- but now all of the sudden it's enjoying this moment. So it's just that perceived inauthenticity and collective pivot in peoples' minds to a fashion name to people rather than just athletic apparel that irks me somehow.  However though, the Todd Snyder Champion stuff is PHENOMENAL- it's not the mainline stuff. You don't see any of those assholes rocking that.

I only had to shop for the last two, buying a white necktie for Old Gregg and yellow shorts and shirt for Jake (because yellow is the ONE color I never wear).   I was looking forward to this Halloween for the last few years because it would finally be on a Saturday... I was thinking of going as Dorothy, as a German girl (I have a few dirndls), or as Cinderella and Belle with a friend (I have gowns and long gloves for both).

text:Ellen McArthur Circular Economy Report: by 2029 Resale is expected to be bigger than Fast Fashion	labels:I'm all about this right now in an effort to be more environmentally conscious. I've been finding amazing 2nd hand pieces from luxury brands like Max Mara, Akris, eileen fisher and Marni on poshmark and therealreal. My wardrobe is slowly turning to all silk, wool, cotton and other high quality fabrics. I just picked up a Burberry trench for 100$ that just needs the belt buckle replaced.	episode_done:True
text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:Some good recommendations, not sure where you are but there's a Canadian company called Dynamite that is priced like H&M/Zara and has really nice clothes including office wear and comfy clothes.

text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:I typically just start by wearing them to places like the grocery store first. By my logic, there have been several times where I have worn a cocktail dress and heels there just to pick something up and have not given myself a second thought about doing so, so why should a bright shoe, or another item of clothing I am self conscious about be any different? Likewise, I have also seen many people at the grocery store in some cool items, and will not be thinking about it for more than 5 seconds.   After that if I still wasn’t completely confident I would probably try to wear it to a small gathering with family or close friends.   I also just try to keep in mind that nobody cares about what I am wearing as much as I do. Honestly, most people are too obsessed with thinking about themselves and if others are noticing their insecurities to spend more than a few seconds, if that, on a stranger. As long as you like your item, be confident in it and others will notice your confidence much more than the item.	episode_done:True
text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:I was just thinking about this the other day because i feel like I have cracked the code! Maybe I'll do a whole post sometime. I'm also in the cusp/extended sizing realm of things.  Caveat - i only buy second hand, generally from ThredUp.   Favorite brands:  J.Jill and PureJill. I hear they have good sales if you prefer to buy new. Most items dont have tags at all, a LOT of 100% cotton items, and things are soft and loose in the best way. Partly because all sizes run half to a full size large.    Max Studio runs smaller, but they also have some extremely soft fabrics, and they have really good options for those tight skirts that you can wear with leggings and loose tops.    Eddie Bauer runs fairly large, very few synthetic blends, easy to find super duper cheap second hand.    More generally, I look at fabric content. Usually with my trusted brands and ALWAYS with anywhere new.  I find that the closer I get to 100% cotton or cashmere for things that Im wearing next to my skin (tops and dresses and sleep clothes) the more I go to that item over the long term.    I also like Aerie for underwear and leggings. A lot of seamless options and breathable fabrics.    And finally - sending so much love to my sensory sensitive ladies! I'm really glad this got posted and has had so much engagement.	episode_done:True

text:Of course.  But saying that here will get you downvoted into oblivion because gender norms that have evolved over millions of years did so for apparently no reason at all.	labels:Modern humans are like ~200k years young so "millions of years" is a a bit of a stretch.	episode_done:True

text:Is black tie comfort fashion a thing?	labels:I'm not super experienced in vintage fashion, but something that is overlooked in modern fashion is the use of undergarments. In the case of black tie formal dresses, I'm sure there is a way to get a tailor to put in a cotton lining or perhaps find a slip that could fit underneath? Someone please correct me if this is not an option, but I don't see why you can't have the best of both worlds!	episode_done:True
text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:There's only one person who wears a perfume I don't mind, and that's a woman in my office who makes her own perfume. The first version was giving one of the people in our office headaches, so she changed up the components and that solved that problem. For me, most perfumes trigger headaches at best, and migraines at worst, so I avoid people who wear perfume. It seems like perfume has become less prevalent in recent years, and as far as I'm concerned I'm thrilled about that since it's difficult to avoid scents as a health trigger.	episode_done:True

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:Give shoes a day break between wearings.  A shoe repair guy said that even with socks, shoes absorb a lot of moisture from our feet. He suggested going  at least day on day off with shoes to give them time to dry and regain their shape. Otherwise he said they stay in that moist, malleable state and get out of shape more quickly.  Anecdotally I’ve seen a major difference in the lifespan of my shoes.
text:This. I really need to do this. I bought nice quality leather ankle boots but I keep wearing them every single day. So much so that I don’t get around getting the vibram soles and heel tips when I need to. I think I need to invest in two pairs of similar shoes that I love and can alternate between. Both pairs will probably last a lot longer if I do this.	labels:I've given up on fixing shoes.

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.

text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:I was into fashion from the age of 11 — back then it was mostly just looking at magazines and doodling my own designs in the margins of my notebooks at school.  For me a big thing is definitely being able to highlight the things about myself I like, and — as cliche as it sounds — to express myself. I was never confident before I started dressing the way i LIKED (not the way everyone else did).  I’m a very short and petite girl and in my teens I struggled with not feeling feminine. Fashion was kind of an outlet, like roleplay! The first time I wore heels to school was transformational. I also enjoyed putting together outfits that are more ”masculine”, and juxtaposing feminine with masculine. I get kicks from matching little details, like lipstick and a purse. Fashion is just something that seems really trivial in the grand scheme of things but that actually has a bigger impact than we realize!	episode_done:True
text:Anyone here has the habit of needing to buy a new clothing/set of clothings when attending an occasion/going somewhere?	labels:Yes! I am so guilty of this.  But then I started to invest in quality blank canvas outfits and use accessories to change them up. So I have a great black cocktail dress that I wear all the time. But I might wear long strings of pearls and gold heels to one event and then the next event swap in red heels and a big gold statement necklace with a red lip. I have cocktail dresses in dark gray, navy, wine and gold and just layer in accessories, shoes and bags to change the look. And if I REALLY want something new, I buy some inexpensive accessory instead of an entire new outfit.  My exceptions are my birthday and our annual family Christmas party. Those are the two times I treat myself. But for all those other weddings, cocktail parties and work events, I stick to my tried and true.	episode_done:True

text:Tucking in shirts	labels:i tuck everything in. literally everything. shirts, blouses, sweatshirts, sweaters.. even my kimonos. it’s fun to me to play around with what works and what doesn’t work.   as someone said, chuck on a cardigan and see how you feel with your shirt tucked in. it can be weird at first, especially if you‘ve never done it before	episode_done:True
text:Goals and Resolutions Check in: February	labels:My goals are going well! A couple of ours are essentially the same. Good luck, we got this!  1) Wardrobe Overhaul  At the beginning of the year, all I owned was athleisure. I was a very cozy, but very bored, person. So I’m working on filling my wardrobe with clothes that really make me happy, and it’s working! I’m in a fortunate position right now, so I’ve been spending the last stimulus check on ThredUp and Poshmark. I gotta say I am loving online thrifting.  2) Dress for my emotions rather than comfort.  Part of moving away from athleisure. My clothes really influence how I feel, so dressing up to look like a badass bitch makes me feel like a badass bitch. Even on days I work at home, I wear outfits to emotionally prep myself to enjoy being productive. I change into pjs when my work is done for the day, so I actually get to look forward to my comfy clothes rather than feel like it’s just another lazy day in leggings.  3) Focus on fit and proportions.  This one is harder but is making me feel the most ~fashionable~. I’m trying to identify how/why certain pieces work on me while others look slightly off. I take videos of myself where I make a bunch of tiny adjustments to my outfits to identify the little details I do or don’t like. This is definitely the biggest of my goals, and will take a long time to really figure out. I can often tell when something isn’t right about an outfit, but identifying that element is tricky.
text:Yessssss to all of your goals! Your reasoning definitely resonates with me... I feel so much better and more confident the days I put in effort as opposed to jeans a company polo or leggings and a shirt.   You’ve totally got this :) cant wait to see the end of year progress.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 30, 2020	labels:Looking for suggestions!  I’ve had the hardest time with jeans my whole life, 6’2”, 180lbs. I’ve found Volcom Volta Slim jeans to be the best I’ve found. What are others that you have found that would be along the same line? I’m really seeking out some pastel colors and tan! The	episode_done:True
text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:Nope, they are completely separate. When I wear makeup, it’s always minimal and designed around hiding my flaws and making me look healthier.  Maybe if I’m wearing black near my face, I’ll use a bit more blush and maybe a lip tint, but I simply don’t wear enough visible makeup for it to be a consideration.	episode_done:True
text:Runways have been sending out 2000s vibes. Anyone onboard?	labels:I thought we all agreed that we can't wear low waisted jeans because we're all too fat 😫😭
text:I thought that was the reasoning we can't wear bell-bottoms, high-waisted and mom jeans.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:All things K-Fashion!	labels:It's OK to not be OK!!! I legit paused and watched every outfit that ko mun yeong was wearing!   Unfortunately I am short and wide. Those styles will never work on me :'(	episode_done:True
text:Store closings at malls	labels:There’s been closings of things due to the pandemic but like Sears & JCPenney’s. Also on the food side there’s been restaurant closures.  As far as returns go, the place might be lenient with you on the return window and accept a return, worth a shot if you do find yourself going back to those malls.
text:I'd expect closings from Sears and JC Penny's...  I'm wondering how bad the carnage will be when this is over. I have not gone in person, just googled and found out they are closed.  Early in the pandemic, they were lenient. I wanted to return an item and at the time, the store was still in the mall but they were not open so I couldn't return. I returned by mail and they refunded me the shipping costs.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 15, 2020	labels:Man, wine is delicious but such a pain in the ass thing to be into. My partner isn't into it, I can't kill a whole bottle by myself, and it doesn't keep. Guess I need to throw more dinner parties once lockdown lifts.
text:If you're too lazy to cook, you can just do a "wine and cheese tasting".	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Sewing your own clothes	labels:Having basic sewing skills to repair or slightly modify existing clothes is a fundamental skill most people should have and is absolutely worth the time. Novice tailoring is a great skill to have too and can save you some money. Beyond that, sewing clothes from scratch is more of a hobby than a necessity for most people, due to the widely available nature of inexpensive and functional clothing. So like most hobbies, whether or not it is "worth the time" (and cost! Sewing is expensive and it's frequently cheaper to just buy an item unless you're looking for a custom fit or something super unique) is more dependent on your enjoyment of the activity than it is on more "functional" motivators like cost-savings.
text:I'm kind of at this level already. This is what saves you money. You can simply buy hand sewing needles and thread for simple repairs.   I'm also learning to make my own clothes, but that is definitely much more expensive than buying them. Your materials are generally of much higher quality and will probably last longer though.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 18, 2020	labels:Anyone else feel like they just throw money at clothes but don’t ever look any better? Is there a trick into nailing the look you’re going for? Should I hire a style coach? Lol
text:First you gotta ask yourself what do you mean looking better? Like what are your goals? Expressing yourself, having fun, looking more conventionally attractive etc...   I also think part of It's the fit of everything and understanding/reconciling  how something looks on you in real life vs the model vs the ideal you had in your head. And compare all three to find differences that being said sometimes the difference isn't fixable. I have triple E wide feet I'll never have a slim narrow foot and I just gotta accept that	labels:	episode_done:True

text:You can do it, we all believe in you.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:I need to stop shopping - full-stop. I did way too much "fill the hole in your soul with stuff" this year, for obvious reasons, but I feel overburdened with the amount of clothing in my life now and I need to make a conscious effort to pare things down. If I run into a genuine need, I'll continue checking secondhand options first before buying new. I'll also continue logging outfits daily with Stylebook, because it helps me be honest with myself about what is and isn't getting worn in my closet (both for getting-rid-of purposes AND for informing-future-purchases purposes), *and* it'll help me focus in on what I gravitate toward in my day-to-day life rather than continually shopping for some nebulously just-out-of-reach fantasy self.   Summed up:  * Buy less, buy secondhand, buy practical, buy for TODAY (not a dream and a half from now), and buy only what is genuinely needed (very likely *nothing* for quite a while).  * Continue evaluating what I really need in my life, and how much, and adjust accordingly as time goes on with the goal of seriously paring down my closet to a manageable size.
text:I feel like this will be a popular resolution for 2021 considering all the retail therapy that happen this year with covid and all.. I’d love to see those FFA Low/No Buy Weekly threads come back! (I think it was done in 2019)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:JW Anderson Fall 2021 Menswear	labels:Some of it looks nice, some of it looks like it belongs in the 1st year fashion students end of term show.
text:Which ones do you think look like fashion student items?  A common complaint with Jonathan Anderson's designs is that they often look fashion student-ey	labels:Look 4, 7 and expecially 8, actually just to focus on 8 for a min, that image just screams 'art student' at me.	episode_done:True
text:Alternative to bras?	labels:I exclusively wear Calvin Klein cotton bralettes! The skinny strap ones.	episode_done:True
text:Mario Valentino is not Valentino Garavani	labels:I've seen these at C21 and thought they were a diffusion line or something. I've never wanted to buy one, but this is interesting.	episode_done:True
text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:Honestly I think you have to give way more detail on your old pair and what you’re looking for.  In my mind the biggest hurdle to perfect jeans is the fit, and since every body is different this is highly individual. Some people might prefer stretchier denim for a more forgiving fit, while others look for stiffer fabric, and have less leeway.   Personally I still struggle to find a high rise, non cropped, fits my thighs and waist, plain dark wash, straight/skinny, 90% or more cotton, pair of jeans. But hopefully I’ll find it eventually!
text:My jeans criteria are similar. I wear men's APCs.	labels:Thanks for the tip! I’m a little skeptical of men’s jeans though because I have 24” thighs, 39” hips and 29” waist. I’m trying to find a tailor I like to see if I can get my newest pair altered, b cause it fits the rest of my standards.
text:Also I don’t know about the APC jeans, but most men’s jeans that I find are 9” rose or lower. I’m into selvedge jeans and the most selection can be found in men’s styles, but very seldom do I find any jeans with 10”+ rise in men’s. 10” is my bare minimum...and those are mid-rise on me. 11” is a minimum for high-rise.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - October 26	labels:Made some bomb pizza yesterday. My favorite is salami and olive and it was the best version I've ever done, perfectly thin chewy crust with bubbly cheese. Man. Good stuff.
text:What recipe are you using? I've got a sourdough pizza dough I love but it's a lot of effort and very stressful, and the dough is very delicate	labels:My wife actually makes the dough - she’s far better at it from me.  From memory - bloom 2-1/2 tsp yeast in a cup of lukewarm water for 15minutes. Add a cup of flour, a Tbsp of olive oil, and a Tbsp salt (maybe less?). Add up to two more cups of flour, a half cup at a time, until no more is easily absorbed. Knead briefly. Proof in an oiled bowl for about 1-1/2 hours. We proof in our oven with a large bowl of hot water. Turn out, cut into portions, and roll out.	episode_done:True
text:Stay In-Vested	labels:These fits are on point	episode_done:True
text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.
text:Evidently, I present as “an upper middle class lesbian” (quote stolen from a FFAer). I’m not but whatever. Assume away. Clothing style is a combo of conservative/traditional New England/androgynous except for shoes ;-)  Pros: Was never sexually harassed at work. Also, lesbians were treated very well *in my division* of the aerospace corporation I worked at (more than a few in mgmt). Suspect there was some “honorary man” caca going on but it certainly benefited other women that did not behave/present traditionally.   Cons: None that I noticed but I’m pretty clueless. Took me until my late 40s to figure out I present this way.  ETA - I have discovered that now that I’m technically “old” dressing better is to my advantage. See invisibility & condescension.	labels:That’s how I present I’m 100% stealing that upper middle class lesbian label	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:I’d agree that personal comfort is the big thing.    I’d also pay attention to the content of the compliment. “That’s a cool sweater” is NOT the same thing as “you look great in that sweater”, KWIM?   Sometimes people are appreciating the design or color or novelty of an item and not the big picture of how it works for you.
text:Agree - the majority of compliments I receive are on items/outfits that are a bit on the "out there" side. I can always tell when I push the envelop into kooky when someone decides to comment on my outfit, ha!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:"Which Sports Jacket Office Are You?" – Permanent Style	labels:Definitely tweed. I love tweed jackets! that and those light weight Kando ones (tech ones) are what I wear most these days.  Also suits are in decline in a lot of places, mostly being limited to interviews, funerals and weddings. But even then, at least in interviews, a sports jacket or blazer, with a tie and slacks or chinos is now acceptable too.  in my experience I haven't seen strict demand for suits at funerals and weddings as well.	episode_done:True
text:What is your go-to favourite dress to wear in the cooler months?	labels:Definitely any kind of long-sleeved mini dress with fleece-lined tights underneath!   Right now I'm wearing a thick, black bodycon sweater dress (just... entirely in black, lol) and tomorrow for my birthday "party" I'm wearing a warm brown dress with white tights and brown booties underneath. My birthday can't get too depressing!  Long dresses and skirts definitely read super summery to me though, as they typically have that breezy look that makes it seem like they could trap air pretty easily.	episode_done:True
text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I've purchased several pieces of secondhand jewelry, both from physical thrift shops and one big mixed lot on Ebay. With the work from home/daily video calls life, where nobody sees me for more than an hour at a time and from the collarbone up, lasting until who knows when, I've had the desire to change up my jewelry from simple and delicate, with a lot of long necklaces, to something more colorful, bold, and closer to the face.  It's all cheap costume jewelry that I wouldn't buy new, but with the environmental impact already made it's a fun addition. Everything has been cool toned (green and blue) to go with the color palette I've been feeling lately. It doesn't need to be comfortable all day, just show up on camera until I take it off. Some of it even has visible wear that would be too much for wearing in public, but it doesn't show up on camera, so video calls are a perfect way to expand its usable lifespan.
text:Oooh I like this. Finally a reason to look at those seemingly impractical statement pieces at thrift store or antique mall jewelry counters!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Happy 11/11 - the day that most resembles corduroy	labels:The Uniqlo U and collaboration with JW Anderson cords are very good this season.	episode_done:True
text:What’s a fashion rule you defy (dressing for your shape, weird color combos, interesting silhouettes etc) that you just love?	labels:I wear navy with black, it's one of my favorite color combinations.

text:Your favorite ___ for $___: Henleys	labels:# Above $100	episode_done:True
text:Favorite outfit?	labels:I love wearing clothes that make me look like a classy but edgy but cute schoolgirl. Like a white sheer blouse with a nice collar + a little satin band that almost looks like a tie, black cardigan, short black skirt and knee high suede boots and wavy hair. Makes me feel very powerful when I’m strutting down the corridors at uni.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - October 19	labels:My country went back into lockdown and so I have finally conceded to the new way of life.  Realistically, I'll be wearing homewear most days, but most of my other clothes just *feel nicer* than the cheapass sweatpants I own. So I got a new pair of sweatpants + a sweatshirt from Sunspel.  I really wish It hadn't had to come to this. I promise I won't leave the house in them.
text:You'll go full athleisure and you'll like it!	labels:>  Sweatpants are a sign of defeat. You lost control of your life so you bought some sweatpants.
text:I mean losing control of your life is literally why covid is so difficult for so many people.	labels:The quote is really befitting the current situation.	episode_done:True
text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:This subreddit has a serious hate boner for synthetics and I will never understand why. It seriously depends on the fabric and the purpose of the garment. Not all rayon or viscose or polyester or nylon is the same. It's like you said, the Uniqlo heattech or their amazing wrinkle-free perfectly drapey rayon blouses are so good. Is all rayon wrinkle free or behave like that? lol no... Which is why you need to look at reviews or touch the material yourself. When you touch it, you can just tell it's good...  Not all "natural" materials are elegant or good either. Sometimes stuff like linen is so trash-bag wrinkly. Sometimes cotton/linen/silk really holds in the sweat and makes you stink, or forms sweat stains on your pits, whereas there's loads of moisture wicking poly athletic clothing or super expensive technical gear for hiking or professional sports which is designed for a specific purpose from synthetic material that keeps you ultra dry, ultra cool, whatever it may be. Poly is also good UPF protection from the sun. Some of my most expensive hiking gear is made from polyester. There is some clothing I own, which I can toss in the washing machine, and after the spin cycle, it's completely dry, without the dry rack.   Acrylics can be super itchy and pilly, or be super tightly woven, soft, and incredibly durable. It really depends. You can't just look at the label and put it away because "omg ew polyester 100%" you need to touch it, stretch it, scrape your nail against it to see how the fabric performs.   tl;dr There's loads of great high quality fabrics in all materials whether it's natural fiber or man-made and I don't really have any negative opinion of anything until I see it in person, and touch it and wear it and I don't think it should matter at all, so long as you personally like it
text:I totally agree, but to be honest one caveat I find when shopping online is that if it's multiple materials that's usually (but not always) a sign of it being higher quality. 100% polyester is sketch unless it's like intended to be shiny sports-clothes material, but 99% polyester 1% something else is more likely to be a bit better for some reason	labels:Agree! I try to avoid 100% polyester because even if it’s high quality it stinks like no other. :(	episode_done:True
text:4SDesigns FW21	labels:Is it just me or is their photography way better than most of what I see on Vouge runway pieces?   The ankle wraps in 10 and 11 are really intriguing and some of the fabrics look really incredible.

text:Sweats and Hoodies	labels:In defence of sweatpants (the comment I was responding to got deleted but I spent a few minutes typing a response on my phone so didn’t want to just delete what I typed):  I can certainly see where you are coming from in regards to sweatpants. I can’t (or haven’t yet at least) worn them outside because I’m too concerned about what other people think and self-conscious (which is ridiculous in the grand scheme of things). I think part of the draw for me is how unbelievably effortless and confident some of these fits are. The impossibly laid back styling that Japanese magazines like popeye, cluel and fudge for some reason really interests me. To me these fits aren’t all exactly what I’d like to replicate, but I think they give me some useful tips in dressing down some coats and jackets which can often come across as too formal.	episode_done:True
text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:Women will pay more for their clothes, and pay more for nicer clothes than men will. Supply and demand, baby.
text:I disagree - I think men will pay more. They do not get as many! I know a lot of men who invest in things, whereas more women will get lots of cheap stuff.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:Former professional fashion model here. After years of suffering from the discomfort of female fashion, I now say ‘fuck it’. If men won’t wear it, I won’t either.	episode_done:True
text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:My local Goodwill, is... adequate.  I've found some decent things, there but nothing amazing; it's overshopped, but one could find good things if one went regularly. There's a spot on the far side of town that's a great for, like, furniture and winter coats, but I don't hit it often.  We had a Salvation Army but it was, like all the other Salvation Armies in the area, incredibly terrible and I'm not sad it's gone.  The best spot in my town is the Hospital Thrift store.  It gives serious 'little old lady' vibes, but also consistently has very wearable, quality items as well as cool, funky stuff that's nice to look at.  Bonus is that it's tiny  (Covfefe restrictions have pushed the store limit to 10,) so digging around doesn't take long and is well worth the effort.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - October 25	labels:On my bi-annual Bollywood film kick. Watched *Dear Zindagi* last night, watched *Kal Ho Naa Ho* today.  One thing I've noticed is how heavily Bollywood costume designers/stylists leaned heavily on trends at the time of shooting. So much so that the clothes add an extra layer of dated-ness when you watch these movies 5, 10, 20+ years later.	episode_done:True

text:What clothing items have you reverted back to since WFH/quarantine?	labels:Sweatshirts that are 2 sizes too big and yoga/workout pants. Essentially, it’s my college wardrobe which works since I’m only 3 years out of college.
text:This is the direction I've veered as well, but its really new for me. I like dressing up and never owned any lounge clothes that I wore outside of bedtime, and when quarantine hit I had a mini identity crisis wondering "where the fuck do I wear all these nice clothes??? I don't fit in anywhere now!"  Started buying leggings and hoodies and felt really weird and intimidated. I realized I have no idea how to do casual dress. I never even wore t shirts. But OH MAN this is the most comfy my wardrobe will ever be! I know the time will come for my nice, lovely clothes to come back out but Im so glad I entered the world of loungewear!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:Raising awareness of what I actually use.   Complimenting people's insistence that you budget, you also need to know where YOU will find the best VALUE of your wardrobe spending. What do you use? What are statement pieces of your fashion? What brings you the most joy?   * I have been using a closet inventory app. Stylebook tracks the costs and number of times I actually wear my clothes with which outfits too.   Although some styling habits might seem like common sense (like basic quality t-shirts and winter coating pay off), I learnt about other neat tendencies:  Scarves vs Sweaters. Scarves might seem more versatile and can pair with so many outfits for other people. But honestly, I live in sweaters.. maybe because it's cold... or maybe because I want to be cozy. If I didn't have the style app, I would probably think about 'investing' in a cashmere scarf. Now, I'm so much happier to budget for vintage pre-loved cashmere sweaters.   Do I even put on my accessories? Bracelets? Necklaces? Nope. Apparently throwing on colourful clothes is my go-to. I save so much money, not buying any jewelry - no bracelets, no necklaces, no earrings. (It makes my savings happier)  * I prioritize my next purchases from there.   The other thing I've invested in: **10x spending more in proper clothing care.** Proper laundry detergent, keeping old toothbrushes to scrub stains, a foldable drying rack, a sweater comb, and leather conditioners.   * Clothing care, only way to keep clothes looking professional and last.
text:Thanks for posting this! I’ve had the Stylebook app forever now but haven’t put in the work to enter all the necessary info. It’s great to read such detailed, practical feedback on it and makes me want to start using it more intentionally.   And you’re SO right about clothing care.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I bought these very popular aritzia melina leather pants..an inspo album and fit pictures	labels:For all the curvier/midsize girls that don’t find these fit well try the Levi’s ribcage straight faux leather! I am a true size 10/30 and the size 12 of the melinas were too tight on me. I saw great reviews on the Levi’s and I’m so glad I got them. They fit so amazing I even bought another denim pair. I love aritzia as much as any other basic bitch but I find most of their stuff is way too expensive for the ill fit of a lot of their stuff (particularly Wilfred). Doesn’t mean I’ll stop shopping there but definitely something to consider before shelling out your dollars	episode_done:True
text:Yearly Aesthetic Goal Setting	labels:Omg I feel inspired now!	episode_done:True
text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Had something similar happen, and let me just say - the first step is to find two or three good pants that you feel good in. For me, it was to leave behind shops like forever21 or New Look, and I started shopping at shops like Torrid. I know some people hate torrid, and some of their clothes are cheesey. But let me just say - they do the BEST jeans. I have bought them in size 10, 12, 14, and 16, and they fit and grow with me as my body changed and fluctuated, and then when I lost some weight, the smaller pairs still fit.      Just remember, you have to ignore the size on the rack, and instead go based on what feels good. Good, buttery jeans that make your butt look rocking are a huge confidence booster for me. Tops that hid the ladies which grew sort of uncontrollable after changing the pill also helped. Structured blazers with t-shirts and dark jeans = perfect office look for any size. Statement necklace or simple earrings always a bonus. However you are, as you said, you deserve clothes that fit, so get em, girl!	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 08, 2021	labels:Man, I’m pumped at how much my summer wardrobe has improved over the past 12 months.    In past years I always felt that during spring, winter and autumn I could dress to my true aesthetic while in summer I just dressed to deal with intense humidity which meant almost always meant outfits I wasn’t fully happy with.
text:I was this way for a long time. This past summer I really hit a groove and thrifted a ton of really fun shirts and linen pants. Now I'm looking forward to summer for the first time ever.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: what does your shopping process look like?	labels:I have two processes  A 1. I decide I need a thing. For example, flared pants. 2. Narrow it down: pick  a color/ wash, rise ect. 3. I have a go- to shop for that where the sizing is consistent. I go there and get said item. that's it.  Scenario B is where I can't find the item I want easily. I browse the website/ wander aimlessly at the mall, than I get something completly unrelated. Sometimes these items turn out to be favorites, but more often than not I end up not wearing them. Cherry on top, sometimes I feel bad about having unworn clothing. I proceed and attempt to DIy them, destroying them completly in the process. I should really quit doing that.	episode_done:True
text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:I'm in a ambivalent state of mind right now. For a like over a year now I have been into streetwear. Baggy, oversized clothes with lots of prints and branding. This was my first period of taking clothing serious and feeling "fashionable". But one can only see so many of the "same" outfits.  I grew really tired of streetwear in the last couple of weeks but I'm scared to leave my comfort zone. I'm 20 years old but feel like dressing like a teenager. I really really like graphic tees if the prints are well done and If I would imagine dressing like lets say Tim Dessaint for example, who is not into graphics/"crazyness" at all, It would feel too "mature" for my age if that makes sense.  But at the very same time, I feel like im dressing too childish when wearing cargo pants + graphic tee.  Am I overthinking this?

Now all I do is roll out of bed about 10 minutes before I start, make coffee and sit my ass on the chair and work the whole day.   Even my clothing purchases have all been tshirts and sweatshirts.

I don't see men getting hassled for the amount of electronic waste their hobbies produce.   I doubt every fifth post in the Funko Pop subreddit is about curbing consumption and how they should be rethinking their involvement in a plastics based interest.   Personally, I think they're wasteful as shit, but I'm not about to roll up into their space and shame them for it.  I'm so over the handwringing, guilt, and joylessness about fashion in this sub sometimes.

But as far as i’ve seen it irl and in social media, most men don’t tend to rock it as much. Why is that? Because they’re feminine? Or is there some other reason i’m not aware of?

text:My thoughts of the Cote&Ciel Isar L after a year	labels:Just want to chime in as another C&C Isar (I think mine is M, not L) user. Eco-yarn construction. Context: I'm in a doctoral program, live in another city, commute to campus when necessary. Pre-COVID, that was 2-3x/week. East Coast/New England, so a good amount of exposure to rain, snow, etc.   I bought mine circa 2014/15 in Copenhagen. It's been my go-to for pretty much everything since then. Everyday commute stuff fits very easily. As OP describes, space is massive, yet the construction of the backpack allows you to cinch everything down to a pretty small (if tall) package. I've used it for 2-3 day conference trips. The open duffel compartment really fits a lot. The more structured "backpack" compartment has cushioned dividers, pockets, etc. for flatter or more delicate/smaller objects.  Frankly, I love it and its one of the most interesting and functional backpacks I've ever come across. And the design, which variously recalls elements of modernist architecture, is pretty distinctive. My best experience with it was when I fit an absolutely massive doorstopper of an exhibition catalogue (600+pgs, oversized art book, hardcover) into the duffel compartment and it just...swallowed it up.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else wear one brand only?	labels:God, no. I enjoy shopping and the thrill of finding something new. I enjoy shopping from brands that have different aesthetics. I also switch around based on quality, fit, and price.   I have a question, though... Your username is BlueWaistcoat. Do you actually have a blue waist coat? Is it a blazer or like a track jacket? How do you manage workwear? No job I've ever had would have allowed me to go to work in Adidas every day. Well, maybe one employer, but I don't think it would have conveyed the right level of professionalism. And what do you wear for special occasions, like weddings and funerals?  Is there a line of Adidas that I am overlooking? I am only familiar with their athletic and athleisure clothing.
text:Hahaha so many questions 🤣 such few answers haha   I don't own a blue waistcoat but I have a tattoo of my cat wearing a blue waistcoat riding a bicycle like an English gentleman... So that's where my username comes from.  I did get in trouble with work when I first started wearing tracksuits to work... So I dug deeper into the employee handbook and found that they have a stupid policy whereby joggers aren't allowed but leggings are 🙄 so I just wear Adidas leggings with an Adidas hoodie/sweatshirt/t-shirt to work.  Although I've been working from home since March, and hopefully I'll never have to go back into the office and I can comfortably live the rest of my days wearing joggers.  I hate social gatherings, and have only ever attended one wedding in my entire life. I even missed my brother's wedding earlier this year. I've never attended a funeral, but if it comes to it then I have an all black Adidas tracksuit ready to go.  So yeah... I don't think wearing all Adidas would work for everyone. But if you live a sad existence like me, then Adidas is the way to go 😌	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 14, 2020	labels:Finally getting a pair of high top chucks.  Decided (after researching here and elsewhere) that the 70s would be best; I plan on using them as my daily beaters at college and would like the support for days that I'm walking/biking around a ton.    My issue is color.  If I were getting the "classic" chucks, I would be going with the all-white version.  I plan on wearing them with shorts and crew socks for the most part.  But the 70s don't come in all white - they have an all cream version and then a version with a white upper and off-white/cream sole+toe cap.   Does anyone have any suggestions or experiences with either color.  White would match my socks a bit better (though the AT retro stripe ones that I usually wear are getting faded) but the different colored sole seems a bit funky in the website's pictures.

text:Looking for aesthetically pleasing pajamas	labels:I will put in a rave review for Recliner pajamas. I now own way too many sets to mention, as I've been slowly replacing all my pj's with this brand.   I have the second skin nightgown which is a midi length nightdress that is super flattering, yes you could call it sexy (my husband does). I also love the PJ set long sleeve version.   Not silk, not gauze, but infinitely washable -- my very first purchase is 4 or 5 years old now and I've washed it every week and it still looks brand new, no piling, no stretching, no fading. It holds up to its claim and you can wear over and over again without getting stanky. I say this as someone who's been wearing this brand since I was perimenopausal and had hot flashes.   The second skin nightie is cut in a way that is super flattering--- but so are the Pj's which i am basically living in since COVID. I just sleep too hot so the PJ's are for day and the nightie is for night.  I did give the Lilly Silk Pj's a try but they don't stretch at all and just weren't as flattering or as comfortable.  I tried Lunya as well but I'm 5'0 and they were designed for very slim and tall people.	episode_done:True

text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:I’m an inch shorter than you and weight the exact same and I’d also describe myself as pear shaped so I’m guessing we look similar. My main problems have always been pants due to my height and shape: they’re too tight in the thigh, too short, or if they are a good length and fit my thighs, the waist is baggy. A few tips I’ve picked up at 24: You are now an adult, with an adults body so clothes from shops geared towards teens are going to fit weird. This is because they weren’t designed for your body not because your body is weird. (Young teens who shop there are often still in children’s sizes or are just barely out of them so the sizing is going to skew really small), if you are shopping there, don’t panic if you can’t fit into the size you think you are. The clothes are essentially made for kids.  At stores geared towards young adult women its easier to find pants that are labeled “curvy” which are not the same as “plus-sized.” it usually means the waist is cut smaller proportionally to the hip/thigh area, which is what you’re going to want to look for.  Look for pants that have longer inseams. Sometimes this will be labeled as “tall” I did not think i was tall enough to buy “tall” pants but pants that are meant to hit at the ankle always hit at my mid calf. Sometimes they are a little long but i think cuffed pants are cute so idc.	episode_done:True

text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I'd get a really nice piece of outerwear, either a coat in a quality material like wool or a leather or shearling jacket. If you live somewhere with colder weather during part of the year, outerwear is something you'll be wearing all the time so it's worth investing in a piece that's great quality, keeps you warm and makes a statement. I think an amazing jacket or coat will elevate even the most basic outfit, whether it's a more classic piece, something utilitarian like a puffer jacket or something more extravagant. Personally I think Acne, Chloe and Tibi are brands that make great high-end outerwear in a variety of styles.

text:Oxford cloth button downs: a short historical inspo album	labels:A legitimate part of adulthood is recognizing that you will never be a Paul Newman level of cool.    He wasn't just an actor. He was legitimately that guy.   I've talked to people who've met him in person and they've said, what you see is who he was. A genuinely likable guy with an insane level of down-to-earth rugged charisma.    And all kinds of successful... The fantasy kind of successes you have before you hit puberty. Race car driver. Famous actor. Successful businessman.   But, his greatest success of all was his enduring style. The man could wear clothes and somehow make them look even better than how the designer had intended.    That goes for the Cosmograph Daytona too. Like, how much cool do you need to emit to make a Rolex even more sought after than it already is?  We kick around the word legend a lot in contemporary speech, but Newman truly was a legend.

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:I can only wear new balance ugly sneakers with custom orthotics or boots.

Wearing heels one night distroys my feet for weeks. It’s not worth the pain.  I started out specifically buying clothing that would look good with cowboy boots (skinny jeans). Now I rock them with any and everything. Just tucked them into a pair of blue plaid trousers and they looked awesome.

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:It's interesting for me to read other people's dislike of thrift clothes, and based on their stories I can see why. For me, thrift has been a different experience. When I was in middle school I hated it and unless it was Gap or something like that and you could not tell it was thrift AT ALL I'd refuse to wear what my mom got from a thrift store. I didn't really fit in with most of my peers. Not necessarily because of money, but mostly because I grew up kind of sheltered and then we moved to the DC area. I was suddenly teased because I liked to read and didn't wear Adidas or whatever. So for a long time I tried to fit in through clothes but it still never worked. I still didn't fit in. And I could never quite get the clothes right.  But as I got older I started wanting to differentiate myself from the other upper middle class kids I lived with (we weren't rich by any means but the DC area is an expensive place to live so I was privileged, even if it didn't feel like we had a lot). Thrift clothes were a way to do that that I could afford. Instead of wearing Abercrombie like all the other kids, which we couldn't really afford anyway, I chose to wear old men trousers and sweaters and weird T shirts from thrift shops. So thrift shopping became part of the control I had over my clothes in ways I didn't otherwise have. My "weird" choices were now *my* choice, rather than something I did because I couldn't afford anything else. And even if people thought it was weird that I wore ballet slippers and long wool skirts, it was a style I chose and honestly, I still am impressed by my teen style... sometimes. I like that I went for it and didn't care about how others perceived it.  I still think of thrift that way. And I've found stuff there that is unique and higher quality than I'd feel comfortable spending otherwise. I can experiment without feeling anxiety about how much I spend. And I really can't stand fast fashion, so there's that too.	episode_done:True

I went through a phase where I threw a blazer over *everything* so I still have a bunch, including one that lived in my office if I had to go into a client meeting on short notice.	episode_done:True
text:Dress Sneakers Are Alarmingly Popular	labels:Dress sneakers never look good for the intent that the wearer is going for and this is the hill I'm willing to die on.

text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:omg! a couple months ago i bought a pair of jeans from revice denim, which is popular i guess w the influencer crowd? anyways, a lot of people had bad reviews about never getting their jeans but some people got theirs quickly so i thought it was worth a gamble.  But its been over 2 months and i still havent gotten anything and i was never able to reach customer service!! when i finally did they said “no need for condescending messages we’re just trying to assist you” all i did was say “thanks again! babe!” 😩😩😩	episode_done:True

text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:I think I figured out how to ditch that pressure after I realized that I didn't like most items in all those "10 things every girl should have in her closet" listicles. I know that's less about trendiness, but it is about realizing that "classic" pieces really aren't for everyone.  It sank in even more when I got older and truly experienced how today's "classic" is tomorrow's "dated": Trust me, in 20 years no one's going to think those silk blouses, ankle-length pants, and button-down dresses really were the end all be all of timeless fashion, no matter how plain and minimalist they look to young eyes today.   That doesn't mean fast fashion is great, if only because the business model is unsustainable in a plethora of ways. But that's not something wrong with your preference for novelty! People have always liked novelty in their clothes, it just wasn't doable to buy tons of completely new garments so they made smaller changes. Buying less really is a good thing for the world, but "buy it for life" is a nonstarter for women's fashion unless you're a true ascetic.	episode_done:True
text:Best White T-Shirts for Men 2021 - Wirecutter	labels:The Eastman t shirt rocks. I love the boat neck and the seamless body. Mine held up for two years before getting belt buckle holes. Expensive but worth it IMO	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:Without knowing what your pants/skirts look like, it’s hard to say exactly. But what I would do is stock up on some tshirts/long sleeve tshirts/vest in colours you have in your bottoms. Or even blouses in solid colours, whichever shape you normally like. That way it’s an easy mix match. (I do the opposite, love tops but only get basic bottoms that match most things.)	episode_done:True

text:Can You Wear a T-Shirt Under a Blazer and Not Look Like an 1980s Leftover?	labels:The only time it's worked to me was seeing someone in a very casual suit and a Breton
text:This would certainly work – wearing the most casual suit with the most purposeful tee. I have a navy Drake’s games blazer and matching trousers that is basically the least amount of suit that a suit can be while still remaining a suit. The hard part is finding an occasion that is both dressy and casual, and warm and cool. Would have to be dinner at the beach or something.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Brooks Brothers's Future Looks a Lot Like Menswear’s Past	labels:* Less SKUs. The amount of stuff BB sells is overwhelming.  * Do away with there weirdly named fit system. Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.

text:Bags that are actually beautiful - what are you loving?	labels:I'm definitely not a bag person either, I'm either out with my fanny pack worn cross-body or wear a small (or big) backpack. But, Telfar bags just do something to me. I love their sleek yet interesting design, the fact that they have many sizes, and they seem pretty practical if you're a bag person.

text:Does anyone else wear one brand only?	labels:I'm tall, so the only brands that fit me properly for my job are Eddie Bauer and Athleta.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I definitely feel this. I have a large butt/hips and do often find that they impact the shape of silhouettes that I'm trying to wear. I'm very inspired by menswear as well and dress fairly androgynously. I tend to modify menswear silhouettes slightly so that I can achieve something similar. I personally feel much better in high waisted pants with a tucked in shirt/sweater - somehow I feel like it emphasizes my lower body less and gives me a sleeker line from top to bottom, so when I'm drawing influence from menswear I tend to modify it with a higher waistline. I also make sure that I'm defining my upper body with tops that are more structured around the shoulder. Drop shoulders don't play well with me.  I find with these tweaks I'm able to both find a nice balance where I don't feel like I'm fighting against my body and I'm also able to invoke more masculine references and play with most silhouettes I like. Although it did take me a lot of trial and error to figure out it out.	episode_done:True
text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:I have moved to different climates many times. My recommendation would to not purge or change anything until your move is complete. The reason is, you definitely get climatized, where what would consider "warm" in the winter to you now will feel chilly enough to wear heavyweight items you hadn't expected would work once you are climatized. A lot of items that you think will/won't work end up being the opposite, etc. You mentioned having less storage, so it sounds like you will need to offload/purge at some point, but I'd wait to do it once you get there and put it off for as long as you can to truly see what items work. I'll never move to a cold climate again but even moving to different warmer climates, I will wait to do any paring down/purging until I can get a little climatized and adapt.
text:I hadn’t considered climatization! that’s a really helpful tip.	labels:Yay! Glad to be of help	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: What is the environmental impact of different fabrics?	labels:This subject has been well researched and published. If you’re genuinely interested in diving into this topic I’d recommend looking into any of the online resources
text:I feel Reddit wouldn't exist if everyone already knew where to look online for academic articles.	labels:I feel everyone that is capable of using Reddit is capable of googling where to look if they really wanted to.
text:But not how to sift through the information to find trusted sources or are trained to read scientific articles.  As an example everyone here is talking about how much worse synthetic is to natural, I litterally googled the question and the first results is "natural fabrics have the highest environmental impact". That headline comes from a dense and detailed report which does go into more detail about the impact of all fabrics but it's in a very dry 16 page report and I wouldn't expect someone to read all of that or to take it all in.  It's also good to hear opinions that may be outside of your echo chamber which affects the search results you will see. There are many advantages to seeing the opions of people you semi trust to be knowledgeable who can explain things in plain english rather then relying on google searches.	labels:As much as I'd like to continue drifting off-topic I simply suggested taking advantage of free student access to academic journal databases to supplement all this secondhand knowledge if he happened to have it available. I also think people should turn to libraries more to explore interested topics, but I guess these kinds of suggestions are outside of the echo chamber of Reddit	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Zara | January 30, 2021	labels:2012 through about 2014 I was out of college, unemployed for stretches, underemployed for others, and underpaid for the rest. After being unemployed post-college in 2012 and living with my parents, and then my entire annual income in 2013 was about $13,000 while I was living on my own, and somewhere around $20,000 in 2014. I had some freelance gigs here and there where I could pull in $500 or $1000 bucks outside my reported income, but I was ostensibly "living in poverty" for a few years.  Zara was honestly kind of a godsend in that period, I needed somewhat fashionable clothing but had basically no money to spend on it. I work in the contemporary art world and dressing well is literally part of my job. While Zara isn't exactly highly respected, I was able to get some decent looking clothing on the cheap.  Today I find it easy to criticize Zara, whether it's the stolen designs, or the fast fashion model, or the inconsistent sizing, the sweatshop labor, and so on, but I admit that for a moment in my life they were a really useful utility. When I didn't have money for clothes but I needed decent looking clothes, Zara was one of the best options available to me. There's a lot of better options in the world if you have time and money, as I do now, but I'd be a hypocrite to ignore the benefit they provided me when I had neither time nor money.  Also while they're not exactly a "buy it for life" brand, their clothes didn't fall apart on me either, so, I'll give them props for that. Everything lasted an appropriate amount of time for the price.
text:Bruh wut ? Nothing against Zara not coming to complain but I always found Zara to be expensive side and lesser quality ? For the same amount of money I'll spend it at Uniqlo lol. Basically I was doing the same thing as you bit with uniqlo haha	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Gorp/Hikingcore	labels:i love the vibes of images 11 and 26. however some of this would look absolutely ridiculous outside the context of a fashion magazine, but i guess that's kind of the point.
text:I guess I'm not entirely sure what you mean. Nothing in any of those images stands out to me as particularly egregious. Sure, you might not see many of them out on the Appalachian Trail or Pacific Crest (though I could arguably see many of those pieces being perfectly functional for actual hiking), but you also aren't likely to see anybody wearing shipster/nautical workwear out on a trawler in the North Atlantic. That's not really the point. I think most everything in this album would be acceptable "outside the context of a fashion magazine" for people who are into the aesthetic.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:I once got the tip to put everything in your closet with the open part of your hanger hook facing out. Then, when you wear something, turn that hanger the right side out (i.e. round side of the hook facing out). Set a time period that you want to revisit cleaning your closet (i.e. a season/year etc) and after that time period donate or throw out everything that still has the hook turned in. Similarly, pack all the things you aren't sure if you want to keep into a box and set a time frame. If you find yourself wanting to wear something in that box, take it out. At the end of the time-frame, donate what's still there (especially if you forgot that item existed).  Recently due to COVID, I moved across back the country so I had to fit my closet into suitcases. That involved donating a lot of things that are perfectly nice and wearable but what I had to admit to myself that 1)I actually never wore in the 3 years I lived there and 2) didn't miss in the few months that I was living without them (I was living out of a carry on when I got unexpectedly stuck back home).  In terms of the never throw anything out, perhaps donate it to  a charity that's helps dress the less fortunate for work? They're definitely pieces that others will love.

text:Share the outfits you would wear if the world was normal!	labels:I just want a good excuse to wear my rigid jeans again. They’re kinda terrible for lounging in so I never find myself reaching for them anymore, and that makes me sad. I never thought I would say this, but I’m tired of wearing leggings 24/7. I was firmly in camp “leggings are pants” back in the day, but I’ll be happy to go back to only wearing them on the weekends.   I know I could go ahead and wear denim if I wanted, but it feels pointless changing into jeans just to drive to the post office or grocery pickup.   I don’t really miss dressy outfits, since those occasions were rare to begin with, so I’m used to “waiting” for a reason to dress up. But I do miss my less-comfy casual outfits.	episode_done:True

text:What was the last addition to your wardrobe in 2020 and what was / is going to be the first addition to your wardrobe in 2021?	labels:The last item of 2020 was a camel colored Sherpa sweater from Aerie.   My first purchases in 2021 were leggings, joggers, new sports bras/bralettes, and soft t-shirts. We were unsure for a while at my office how long we'd be working from home, but it looks like it's going to be through at least early summer, so I wanted to beef up my lounge wardrobe since I've basically been rotating through 2 pairs of pj pants and a bunch of ratty 10-year-old t-shirts.	episode_done:True

Doesn't necessarily have to be florsheim shoes, but any derby shoe in shell cordovan.
text:If I was gonna get a pair of derbies I’d go for any color other than black, especially if it’s in shell. Save black for more formal shoes like oxfords. Not saying that derbies are strictly casual or that they don’t look good in black, because they do, but if I was gonna get a black shoe it’d be an oxford.

The top two are an Alexander McQueen silk skull print scarf and a Mulberry Alexa bag. Certainly not the trendiest of items nowadays but I am thrilled with them and younger me is so happy I finally own them after all these years of wanting them.
text:I’m in the same boat! The Alexa was THE bag back in the days (along with the Balenciaga moto bags)! They’ve both been reissued - the Alexa in new mini sizes, and the Balenciaga has a new “neo” model!

text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:I’m also 5’8” and pear shaped! Old navy tall sizes are cheap and decent for the price. I’m the same height so it’s that awkward “not quite tall enough to justify going to specialty online only sizes” but it really helps with finding shirts that cover your torso easily or jeans that fit better. You need more material to cover longer limbs. And don’t be afraid to get a tape measure and figure out inches to buy the right size in a particular brand. A bruised ego is better than a lifetime of ill fitting clothes.  Also learn to accept wide shoulders and other large frame bone structure things. I lost a lot of weight recently and just for fun tried to fit into a size six blazer. Nope felt like Chris Farley “fat man in a little coat.” Even at a thinner weight, gotta wear a size ten blazer at least to cover my shoulders. My feet are size ten at my thinnest. Accepting that has made life easier  and honestly height has a lot of advantages like being able to gain ten pounds without a big difference in appearance  or eat more calories from day to day.  Try to dress around the parts you like the most, show some skin or neckline a bit (even a v neck is more flattering), show arms, dress in dark colors on the bottom. Dresses look good on most body types even if it’s out of your comfort zone, I actually recommend Jersey or sweater dresses or something that stretches. Might be the easiest way to get a good fit without shelling out money on a tailor.	episode_done:True

If I wanted a luxury bag like Chanel, I would either have to dip into savings for it or put it on credit (which is a no-no for me).

It's great!  Another thing I do is, when I see an item I like, I mentally run through my closet and see if it will mesh with what I already own. If it works, I get it. If I'd have to buy several new items to make it work, I don't. For this reason, I don't own many t-shirts, but I do own lots of sweaters and dresses.

I’ve had great luck with finding multiples of things I love even years later with enough searching, and usually at that point for a fraction of the price.	episode_done:True

text:[Inspiration] Sculptural Jewelry	labels:This is so cool. Love the first ring and the floral stuff.   I love jewelry (and have some wacky pieces) but man I wish it wasn’t so fucking expensive for cool shit. An eyeball ring from The Great Frog has been on my grail list for like 4 years but I can’t bring myself to drop a stack on a ring, ya know?
text:I know exactly you how feel. If I have that much money for fashion I immediately think I could buy shoes or a coat and get more use out of it. But I know I'd love the jewelry so at some point I should just suck it up and buy it.  Those eyeball rings are really cool.	labels:Haha it’s not like I wouldn’t get much use out of it either! Coats and boots/shoes are seasonal and I wear my jewelry every day, not sure why I’m so weird about it!  They’re so freaky deaky, I love it. Maybe my goal for this year will be to buy one :)	episode_done:True

text:Yeah totally agree. Recently I got one from a friend's closet cleanout that actually flatters my body, and I think it's because it's very flowy and loose so the size difference isn't an issue. Regardless I would never buy one without trying it on first because that's literally the only jumpsuit I've ever tried on that didn't awkwardly ride up my crotch and make me look like a toddler...	labels:I’m smaller on top and my favorite thing in the world right now are drop crotch jumpsuits, totally solves that problem.

text:Craig Green Spring 2021 Menswear Collection	labels:Call me crazy, but Craig Green has never done anything for me.  Sure, stuff like 1, 4, 6, 11 looks good, but is ultimately fairly ordinary (and I just don't think making stuff padded is all that innovative).  Fashion-as-art-onto-itself stuff like 10, 17, 22 also looks good (and I guess it earns him his avantgarde cred), but doesn't filter down to the stores.  So there is this gap between fairly ordinary stuff and out-there artworks that he can't seem to fill. But in that gap lives the stuff I'd like to wear.
text:Green has always been one of those designers that I vastly prefer seeing styled by people with other brands than seeing his collections on their own, he’s got some really cool individual pieces that work well with outfits but I feel you, I don’t think I’d call myself a fan of the CG aesthetic overall.  That said I think this is my favorite collection from him I’ve seen, most of the outerwear and fabrics are cool and I really love the colors they used	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Natural Fibres	labels:Surprisingly (for Americans) Gap has great cableknits in 100% cotton. As someone who is allergic to synthetics its a life saver in the winter. If anyone has recommendations for USA stuff i'd love you for forever

text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:Everything eventually comes back in fashion.  Personally I would love for 2000s jeans to come back - not super low rise or the ones that were bedazzled or laced up but just normal rise bootcut and flare jeans. I have a few from that era that I still wear all the time and a couple more that I had to replace with similar ones from poshmark because I couldn't find them in shops.  I also miss 2000s makeup. Sure, there was too much body glitter and candy colors but there was also the fresh dewy look of blush and a light lip gloss - think Britney Spears in her Oops I Did It Again video, or Mandy Moore's makeup in her video for Candy. Not everything in the 2000s was horrible lol.
text:It’s also worth discussing that a lot of the popular elements of the Y2K era have elements of 1960s and 1980s style as well, so Y2K style 20 years later includes those echoes as well.	labels:Yep, I remember when feathered hair made a comeback in the 2000s because of the 70s. Same with bootcut jeans, peasant blouses, and fringed accessories.	episode_done:True

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:I spent like two months investing in a bunch of nice wool sweaters that I could wear through the winter, put them in a separate laundry bin after wearing so I could launder them myself, but my ex washed and dried them on high heat and they all shrunk so badly that I couldn't even fit them on my dog. About $1500 gone.

Didn't get through to the interview stage of making my current job a permanent position due to what HR calls a "technical error".

I hope another vacancy pops up before my contract ends and I am going to make sure I really big up that I'm now training people.

text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:I conceptually understand that I probably don't need to wash my clothes as often as I do as someone who lives in a temperate-cold climate, and studies from home, but I can't get over my childhood conditioning to wash clothes after almost every wear. My parents grew up in South East Asia, where you practically have to shower and change clothes twice a day, and that training runs deep. I probably wash T-shirts after 1 wear, gym clothes after 1 wear, bras every 1-2 wears, jeans/pants every 2-4 wears, and outerwear/sweaters less frequently (when I spill something, or every 3-4 weeks for my indoor home sweaters that get frequent wear). I am however very careful with how I wash clothes- always on cold, use appropriate detergents (euclean for wool/cashmere, soak for silk/other delicates, and unscented tide for everything else), and I try to air dry everything that I can. Clothing care is a big part of how I approach sustainability; my purchasing habits might not always be the most sustainable, but I try to take care of the items that I own well so that they last for me (and maybe even for a second owner). I also would prefer to wash clothes a touch too often than not often enough and end up smelling; I spent a year studying in Germany, and my host family was great, but I kind of felt like they didn't wash clothes as often as I would to prevent smells; natural fibers are not = deodorant, they still need to be washed. Now if I could only kick my dry shampoo habit....washing my hair is so much more work than laundry.	episode_done:True
text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I have SPD (sensory processing disorder) and I have some serious issues. If it’s itchy, stiff, makes swishy noises as I walk, weirdly textured, I won’t wear it. For sweaters I stick with cotton only or if it’s a blend, it better be silky smooth. No wool, alpaca, cashmere or acrylic.   For tops I stick to cotton, silk or flannel. Madewell, LL Bean and Jcrew make tops that I can wear comfortably.   I wear modal long underwear in the winter if I will be cold. I also wear modal pajamas because it’s soft and washes well.   I don’t have a ton of issues with pants. I can’t do paper bag or flares as it’s swishy. And I can’t do super high rise (10in or higher) because it pushes on my stomach and I can’t handle that lol.
text:What brand of underwear do you get? I also struggle with underwear. But no try ons at the store. Sometimes they cut into my pubic bone/thigh area a little or rub my butt the wrong way.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Fashion "fantasies" coming true years later?	labels:A little bit different, but I remember as a kid being like "man, wish I had the confidence to wear belly shirts, they look so cool" or whatever we called them back in the 00s, and now that they're being styled with high waisted pants and skirts it's like, the best of both worlds, in that I don't have to have my full stomach out and it's way cuter this way anyways. AND the nigh waisted/crop solved the issue I had with clothes and my wide hips: low-rise pants would slide down and shirts would always ride up unless they were loose enough, so I would have to CONSTANTLY adjust.  And on the reverse note, any shirt I have that isn't cropped gets tucked in, which is funny considering how ridiculous it always seemed to me to tuck in shirts back then too.	episode_done:True

text:I’d suggest you post regardless, the only thing holding you back is the physical act of posting. That way you can be a regular too, and your opinion may hold some more weight	labels:Im sure this was meant as a nice comment, but honestly I just wanna make a small comment about my thoughts once in a blue moon, I barely browse mfa these days.

text:Brands can hire their agents and thus have some say in the source of their labor though...  I tend to disagree that "it's business" is a reasonable response to unjust labor practices.	labels:The brand buyers and sourcing officers negotiate price, delivery, quality etc etc with the factory boss/owner.

After that, I noticed how it was promoted everywhere by everyone. And Jennifer Lopez's makeup always looked amazing. She hasn't aged physically since the late 90's.  I still think the best makeup I've ever seen was in Mean Girls. Everything from the color choices to the application. Everyone just looked more alive lol. The baked face/matte colors/highlight and contouring that eventually became popular was pretty in it's own way but I felt like it made everyone look like plastic barbie dolls. I'm glad that trend is slowly dying out and I'm finally seeing more lipglosses and rosy shades being sold again.	episode_done:True

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.
text:I feel this in my soul.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:It’s less about the value of the item and more about the stars aligning perfectly.  I wear a size 12-13W shoe, plus other things that make my feet really hard to fit, so I am used to buying formalwear to match the one maybe two pairs of formal shoes I own at any given time.  So when I was 17 and going to prom in 2006, my mom tried really hard to help me find shoes, any shoes, that were suitable. But we could only find casual flats or runners, and I realllly wanted to dress up nicely for the first real time in my life. So she said “you know what, let’s buy a dress and then we will just have to find a way.”  So I picked out a black and pale pink dress that just made me swoon, and I figured black heels would be easiest to find. Lol I was so young and stupid.  Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn’t find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I’d just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.
text:I can somewhat relate. My mom wears an 11W. I grew up watching her struggle endlessly to find shoes. She’s also an avid thrifter. For some reason I’ve long been better than her at spotting the one random pair of 11Ws in sight, whether thrift shop or regular store. Even since I moved out I find things for her regularly and mail them. (And send the bill.) I’ll usually text her, but I know her style well enough that I’m comfortable buying stuff without her approval. I know I’ve found several pairs she wears almost daily.	labels:Aww, you're a good daughter!	episode_done:True

text:Winston & Co. Shawl Collar Cardigan Review (But mostly preamble)	labels:Nice review :)  How do you deal with scratchy wool? Do you seek another cardigan or try other methods to mitigate the problem?
text:Thank you.  I used Eucalan wool wash on the Richmond Knitwear cardigan, it's a no-rinse wash with added Lanolin. I found the itchiness was somewhat mitigated after adding back some of those natural oils. The cardigan took 4 days to dry, but it was worth it. I'm a lot less sensitive to itchy wool than most people I know, so I'm already at an advantage though.  There's no point in having a garment you don't like wearing, so if the itchiness is such that you can't abide it...keep looking. As I said the Winston & Co. is very soft, but the quality of the wool is excellent and the final wash contributes to the soft handle.  Scottish waters are renowned for being balanced, so when rinsed they allow for a nice finish without damaging the fibres. Often times wool can be treated as part of its finishing process to soften it, but this treatment will degrade and shorten the lifespan of the yarn.	labels:	episode_done:True

(I can't get much information from jeans and basic t-shirt)   Do you have a small waist? (this question goes towards if pants/jeans that fit you in the butt and thighs have a wide gap at the waist)   Are your legs "too long" for normal-sized bottoms? (regarding if you need tall sizes for jeans)   With your chest and shoulders, do you often have the issue that you need to size up to have correct shoulder hems but then the clothing item will be too wide in the chest/belly area?

text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:The present always feels “neutral”. I think if you watch any reality show from the early 2010s, even as late as 2014-15, you’ll see a big difference from what was considered “no defining silhouette” then. things like just a tshirt change slightly in cut and shape over time.

text:What is your favorite clothing/accessories subscription box?	labels:Subscriptions are great to save wardrobe space but cost more in the long run. They can't always get it right and may not have the inventory you desire.  Shop around for a style that suits you that is durable and will last longer and it will save money in the long run.	episode_done:True

text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:Go thrift shopping and try on whatever strikes your fancy. I like thrifting for this because just about every cut, color, fabric and style are available and you can get an idea of things you like that are not in new retail stores at the moment. And everything is much cheaper, of course.   All the secondhand stores in my area have closed their dressing rooms, so this isn't as doable right now, but it is still fun to cruise the racks and get an idea for the range of clothing that is out there.   Have fun!	episode_done:True

text:Using Pinterest to Help Find Your Style (or: how to tell Pinterest it is no longer 2012)	labels:Great tips, I definitely have not been using the "More Ideas" button to its full potential.    I've been trying to pin fashion and style again, and I find I really miss the website Polyvore.  I never used it, but the ease with which other people made outfits and shared them meant that there was always something new to pin.    I follow a few fashion bloggers who seem to be popular, but I sometimes forget the work that goes into doing a blog post, styling things just right, taking the photos, etc.  Not to mention buying the clothes!  With that old Polyvore website, users were pushing out complete outfits everyday.  I hope something like that comes back around again soon, because I found the flat lay design of the pins easy to identify with.  With real people or models, I start to worry about whether something would work with my proportions, what kind of style tips they're using, etc	episode_done:True

text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Love your post.  I recently-ish got a sewing machine and am making myself only wear stuff I make.  Sewing can be an expensive hobby, however, I feel the clothes I do make would be less expensive than what I'd buy because I tended to go for nicer brands or linen sellers on Etsy (which can cost a pretty penny).  So, overall, I'm spending less money, have a new fun hobby, and it also makes me be more intentional with what I make since I'm not the fastest sewist.  Edit: also, in addition to unsubscribing to sale emails like you mentioned, I also moved all my shopping favorites in my browser to another folder that was annoying to get to.  I didn't want to delete it in case I do need a new winter coat or something (and can't remember brands). But this has really helped my window-not-really-shopping.	episode_done:True

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:Having a heavier coat on hand isn’t a bad idea, especially if it’s already available - but for context I grew up in Austin, TX and the *only* winter coat I ever had I purchased specifically for a vacation. There’s an odd day every couple of years where you might want to use it... but for the most part people just stay inside and the weather warms up.  Things like a lighter fleece will take care of you pretty well on the coldest typical winter days.   A big thing I would recommend is a lot of light layers that are easily removed - cardigans, button ups, jean jackets, whatever. They served me well year round, even on the hottest days. I’m not sure specifically about New Orleans, but it’s pretty common to run the air conditioning really intensely in that part of the country (I swear my high school was kept at 50 degrees year round) and being able to cover my arms indoors was important to my comfort. Basically just something that’s light and easy to store away when you’re in the heat.	episode_done:True

text:I was walking behind someone on a city street last year who had her iPhone and her debit card (loose, not even in a wallet) in the outermost pocket of her plastic backpack, visible for the whole world to see lol.

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.

text:Fall Fashion Inspo!	labels:I plan on dressing in a lot of wool, plaid, tweed, and leather. I definitely play it safe as I live in a pretty rural area in a conservative part of the country, but I am envisioning lots of plaid, wool shackets, chunky boots, mom jeans, long, wool coats, chunky knit sweaters in neutral/autumnal tones, gold jewelry, leather jackets & pants, etc. I typically wear a lot of earthy tones as well, but I love a pop of red here and there. I'll try to get a board together to put a picture with what I'm describing, but any Youtube video titled Fall 2020 clothing haul will probably give you an idea of what I'll be wearing as I'm not much of a fashion risktaker lol.  I have been searching all the resale sites for vintage wool shackets, as the Zara one I'm interested in keeps selling out and its like 90% polyester anyway. I plan on buying a few vintage pendleton/ll bean/eddie bauer oversized wool flannels to wear as jackets instead.

text:How do men's outerwear differ from women's? I found a really good deal on a 100% wool coat, but in men's...	labels:I would check out Aritzia for wool coats. I think right now they're on sale for more or less 200 dollars and they're made from Italian wool.   Otherwise, I would highly suggest getting the size as close to you as possible and consider getting it tailored--especially if you intend to get a nice coat that lasts a long time. I think it's definitely worth the money tailoring nice clothes to your body!
text:A word of caution about tailoring - it’s the shoulders that will most likely need tailoring, but it is very difficult and very expensive to alter shoulders on a coat, and may not be physically possible depending on how much you need them taken in.   I tried it once with a men’s peacoat and brought it to the best, most experienced tailor in town, and even he really struggled with it. In the end, he could not take the shoulders in far enough without ruining the structure of the coat. He did the best possible job he could, it was not at all his fault, but it cost a lot and I didn’t really like the result.	labels:Oohh boy... yeah the shoulders seem really exaggerated. I do have broad shoulders though, so I def avoid any type of detailing/padding in the upper body lol	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)?

At other times when I am going out to see friends - I wear what I wear at work. I have no other varieties.	episode_done:True
text:A warning for H&M Online Purchases	labels:Same experience but for my newborn son. H&M has good looking kids clothes and we needed some pants since it was getting colder where I'm at.  Took over a month and by the time the pants arrived they no longer fit. We risked the instore return just to be over with the situation.

For sample I don't remember ever having a shirt that didn't pull tight on my back when doing a hugging motion with my arms. Even with made to measure shirts. Is this just a given and part of the experience with dress shirts?

text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:* H&M mini-length black pencil skirt with floral embroidery. I almost bought the dress version of this as well since I love the embroidery so much. The first time I wore it was to the mall and the sales assistant of a different store asked me if it was a Dior piece, I was super stoked.  * Zara kids olive drape-y trench. I'm petit enough to fit into Zara's kids stuff and this trench was like half the price of a very similar looking women's trench (also Zara). It's very versatile, my cost per wear is \~$1.50  I have some pieces that I bought off Taobao (black pleated mini skirt, my only pair of denim shorts, a white short sleeve blouse, and a lavender knit top) that's also around the $1.00 per wear.	episode_done:True

text:Does Anyone Ever Feel Like It’s Hard to Find Basic Clothing Items That Were Plentiful in the Past?	labels:When I was younger it was a lot easier to get basics in neutrals and a variety of colors from brands with “better” quality. This was common at every price point from discount to mid-range.   Now the mid-range is terrible quality. And the brands know for basics focus on neutrals and 1-2 seasonal colors.   As for your comment on Velvet dresses? Those tend to be pretty seasonal - for holiday parties. And this year there won’t be many holiday parties so brands likely scaled back their social occasion collections this year.	episode_done:True

text:Ok but queer women love that queer woman at the bar	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:When I was a student, I did buy quite a lot of fast fashion (e.g. Primark) and high street items, particularly when there was a good sale on. I enjoyed it and was exploring my style, and it was all balanced by not spending as much on nights out, drinking and takeaways.  Once I started working, I divided up my money into buckets: monthly fun money (£100) that can roll up, monthly luxury savings money (£100) that would accumulate until I could afford the £££ item I wanted, monthly travel/experience money budget that would also accumulate, general bills and the rest into savings. Ultimately these numbers are arbitrary and was the way that allowed me to splurge sensibly whilst saving, guilt free.   Remember that you can always earn more money so don't be too hard on yourself, but also learn how to be fiscally responsible! It's a balance and learning experience for sure, and will change as life happens (*cough* Covid *cough*).	episode_done:True

text:What are your tips for being stylish when your weight fluctuates like crazy?	labels:Wrap dresses and wrap skirts tend to be flexible with size fluctuations. I don’t know if the same wrap skirt can take you from a size 4 to 14 but they’ll fit longer than other styles do.

text:What is your favourite item from a discount brand?	labels:I used to work at a local boutique whose markup was unreasonably high but managed to be mostly fairly priced, only because of how ridiculously cheap the clothes came from the vendors and the store’s overall fast fashion policies.  Anywho, after a few weeks/few months on the rack, any piece selling significantly less than its peers was marked for clearance and shoved in a messy stack of racks and buckets at the back of the store. I have a pair of soft purple shorts and two perfectly shade/texture matching crop tops that have survived a considerable 3 years or so now, all of it definitely cost me less than $20 before my employee discount, I think it ended up being like $11 once all was said and done. I love them, but they’ve definitely outlasted most of the other items from the same boutique 😂

text:Fellow clothing trackers, what coveted items are you tracking now?	labels:I thrifted the PERFECT jeans 8 years ago... American eagle “super stretch” high waisted jeans. They are from the era just before Jeggings. Still enough denim to be warm, thick and resilient. Well I wore them so freaking much I wore them out. Holes and stains the works. They have now become my house project jeans. And every time I put them on I actually sigh they are so comfortable! Just enough give to just move with me. So long story short I have them on poshmark notifications, every time I go into a thrift store I look for them in my size. They aren’t super hard to find but I’m a 0 long and that’s not a size I see often. It’s to the point I know what they feel like compared to other jeans and can spot them really fast. THREE DAYS AGO I FOUND THEM IN MY SIZE AGAIN. I practically ran to the check out. When I pulled them out of the dryer and put them on I actually danced. They are so perfect! Don’t give up on your hunt it might be out there! I’ve decided to start looking for a replacement pair now so I never have to go with out them again.	episode_done:True

text:Work From Home Outfits I Should Wear More Often	labels:Very good video and I very much enjoyed the ending.   I completely agree with your sentiment of still making the effort to dress well during prolonged time spent at home. It helps me feel like being productive on a given day and allows me to experiment with lots of different combinations that I normally may not get to.	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:A loose-fitting garment with the perfect drape does a lot of the same things a well-fitted garment does; it conceals what you don't want to see, enhances what you do want people to see, and leads their imagination to fill in the gaps with the best possible things.     My personal problem is that I've got a small, tidy waist paired with bulldozer hips and a substantial hip dip.  I find that wearing skirts that gain fullness just a few inches below the waist will help smooth out that hip dip so that all people see is that va-*voom* created by my waist-to-hip ratio.       I'm also a huge fan of knitted tops with batwing sleeves, since they almost never have any of the sleeve fitting problems that you often get in made-to-wear clothing, and that batwing... if it's  a cropped shirt, or it's tucked into a high-waisted skirt, trousers, or belt, creates a line pointing straight to my waist that I'm probably emphasizing anyway because it's my only good feature.     Also, gigantic, hideous sweaters.  Like just a huge pile of ugly with legs and a head poking out.  That is some real luxury right there.	episode_done:True

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:It sounds like you're having trouble staying motivated so maybe you need to remember why you wanted to change your habits in the first place - you mentioned that you wanted to reinvent yourself.  For me, it took years and it's an ongoing process to change the way I think/buy, as well as to save up ad afford the nicer things I wanted. I would say that some main factors for me to change were that I became dissatisfied with the quality I saw (once you learn to sew, you can't unsee it), and I had a friend who was starting to buy nicer things. She made more money than I did, so it took more effort for me when I wanted to buy some, too.  I had to learn to do my research - follow the brands/makers, see what sales and discounts they offered, if any. It might take a season or easily longer to learn about their habits before I made my move. I also had to learn about when to just buy something full-price - if I thought I would be so disappointed to miss out, I'd consider buying the piece sooner. I wear a XS-S most of the time, so these sizes tend to sell out faster. Most of the time though, I had to learn to be patient, be honest with my style/needs, and shop smarter.	episode_done:True

text:What's the greatest length you've gone to obtain a much coveted fashion item?	labels:When I was in middle school, I saw a sweater on a fashionable outfits Twitter page. I reverse googled the image to find it came from a shop in the UK (I’m in the US). Forgot about conversion and I ended up paying over $60 just for the sweater, not including shipping. My parents were so angry I spent all the money I had on one single clothing item but I still have the sweater about 10 years later and it continues to be a staple item
text:I just did the same thing for a shirt I got lmao. It’s a cool as hell shirt though and I *love* it . Definitely will wear it until it’s worn as hell.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What age do you think you're too old to follow teenage-type style trends (ie e-girl style etc)? Or are you ever, why/why not?	labels:I can't speak for everyone, but I knew my time had passed when I popped into a "teen style" store and went "EW YUCK They brought THAT back? Why would they bring that back? It was terrible the first time around!" and *realized I sounded like my mother*.
text:HAHAHA when I first saw belt bags back again, it sent me back immediately to my dad in family vacations in the 90s and it gave me a visceral like "WTF YUCK" reaction. And then I realized I was old and there are many beautiful and vibrant young women out there who have never had the misfortune of seeing the utter-suburban-dad-core-fanny-pack look in its full glory	labels:	episode_done:True
text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I'd get a really nice piece of outerwear, either a coat in a quality material like wool or a leather or shearling jacket. If you live somewhere with colder weather during part of the year, outerwear is something you'll be wearing all the time so it's worth investing in a piece that's great quality, keeps you warm and makes a statement. I think an amazing jacket or coat will elevate even the most basic outfit, whether it's a more classic piece, something utilitarian like a puffer jacket or something more extravagant. Personally I think Acne, Chloe and Tibi are brands that make great high-end outerwear in a variety of styles.

text:Stockings vs Tights vs Leggings	labels:no contribution here but I personally hate most tights because the inseams tend to be too short for me and tall tights are often more expensive and harder to find (sheertex doesn't make them anymore....why???)

Feed it into my veins and I hope to see the tamed down version of these things on the L train next fall.

text:Anyone here has the habit of needing to buy a new clothing/set of clothings when attending an occasion/going somewhere?	labels:This happens when I don’t prepare and don’t take the time to slowly buy things for certain occasions over time.

text:Sharing the Pants: Androgyn-ish trends album	labels:I was going to have to ask for a translation on "shacket", but got it right away when I looked at the album.  It's an updated take on the old time men's hunting jacket, which was really a slightly oversized plaid shirt made of fairly heavy wool.  You can probably still buy them from LL Bean, like my Dad used to.  I'm enjoying the mixture of traditionally somewhat formal pieces mixed with the casual here,  ie tweed jacket with a hoodie.  Hadn't heard of Margaret Howell before.  She's definitely the queen of balancing the top piece with the bottom piece in unconventional ways. And her footwear styling really makes the whole look.  I'm eyeing the light gray chunky boots I just wore to the supermarket (company shipped me the wrong color) with purple velvet jeans and contemplating getting some suede dye, lol.	episode_done:True

text:Has consulting a stylist really been a revelation to you?	labels:A few years ago i was feeling badly about myself following the end of a 4 year relationship. I decided to find a local personal shopper to go through my closet and help me decide what to keep/donate. She also provided me with ways to wear what i already had. From that, she created a list of things she thought i would need to add to my wardrobe according to my lifestyle and wants/needs. We then went to the mall a few days later and she brought in tons of things to try. The rule was that i had to show her everything, but i had the final say as to what i wanted to get. This was great because it also provided me with an opportunity to get more styling tips on items i don’t currently own but might consider moving forward.  Since then, i have felt so much more confident in how i dress and i constantly receive tons on compliments. I would 10/10 recommend this to anyone who wants to change their style or learn more about what looks best on them. I figured the $400 i spent on her was equivalent to how much money I’d spend on items i would never actually wear, and in the long run became an investment :).
text:That's a one time investment. Spread that over 10 years and that's $3 a month to get insight into one's own style and to organize ones closet.  Sounds like a good deal to me!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Cristophe Loiron of Mister Freedom - Inspiration Album	labels:Crisophe Loiron was born in France and moved to California in 1990. Beginning as a curated vintage thrift store, Mister Freedom partnered with manufacturer SUGAR CANE Co to develop their own original clothing brand. Their clothing collections are based on an “original script that we come up with, playing with fictitious characters in a historical background.” Some of their inspirations include Naval tailoring, American frontier settlers, and the fashion movement of the 50s and 60s  Cristophe Loiron has a contagiously upbeat personality, and an awesome style that incorporates the pieces he designs. Highly recommend visiting the LA store if you’re ever in town, it’s quite a site and has lots of great pieces.	episode_done:True

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:I associate Gen Z fashion with crop tops and sweatpants, so yeah it makes sense that people in their 30's buying expensive ethical clothes aren't going for the sporty spice look.
text:Totally.  To me, Gen Z is a lot of clothing that isn’t work appropriate but super fun. A lot of crop tops, bra tops, spaghetti straps, usually some tummy showing, and then some baggy pants. Lots of thrifting and also cheap fast fashion. Doc Martens and other platform shoes. Very 90s/early 2000s. Long acrylic nails, false lashes. Really fun and can be a really “hot but trashy” style   Millennial fashion is more professional/better quality/structured. Linens, trousers, heels, sandals, etc. Frankly I think it has to do with millennials having more money. Low key hair, nails and makeup. Neutral colours and patterns. It’s a more mature style   I’m 25 so I get to do both 😎 woohoo	labels:I'm 27 and on TikTok and I feel like lightly dragging Millennials is sort of in-joke at this point, even if for the most part we're on the same side and they know it.  It's a mix of brutally accurate (like making fun of us for using 😂 unironically) and just normal adult behavior (like making fun of us for drinking wine in our pajamas).	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:Some really great tips here! Here's my two cents:  1) If the seller doesn't respond to your questions, RESIST the urge to buy anyway. This seems really obvious, but I've made the mistake many times of panic-buying b/c I was afraid I'd miss out on the item, against my better judgment. Someone else may snap it up, but you've saved yourself the headache of wasting money on something that doesn't fit/is damaged/itchy/smells like cigarette smoke/etc.   2) Poshmark and eBay work better when you are familiar with the exact brand and model of clothing. They're not great for browsing due to just too much crap and too much inconsistency in the listings. If you don't really know what you want, I'd suggest browsing TheRealReal. They skew higher-end, but have a quite a lot of choice and have filtered out the trash and no-name brands already. Often you can find really rock-bottom prices for what you're getting (like Rag & Bone jeans for $30). You can search for something like "women's wool trousers" and then filter by size and color and sometimes style (cropped, wide-leg, etc). You'll be exposed to a lot of brands and styles you may not otherwise have thought of. Another pro (or con, depending on how you look at it), is that the clothing sizes are broken down into XS/S/M/L/XL categories, rather than numerical. So if you filter by "S" it will include 26-27 jeans, 34-36 Euro sizing, 40-42 IT size, etc., which is good when you're dealing with international brands. Even better is when the item includes measurements, which they often do, which are always more helpful than a number on a tag. Finally, on full-priced items (except for the really high end stuff), you can automatically get 20% by using their REAL code.	episode_done:True
text:How to find non-custom tailored clothing for short men (under 5')	labels:When I was a yout. Haha. I always wanted to use that line. Anyway... I would occasionally have to dress up for church, bar mitzvahs, weddings etc. I’d have to wear the whole blue suit tie etc. My mother would drag me into a 1. department store “young man” section. 2. Get your measurements taken; shoulders chest sleeve etc. go on line to resellers. As an example say you’re a men’s 34 suit coat. You can filter the search. I can only imagine how many fantastic coats and suits worn one or twice are available for you. Good luck!

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:When I worked in a bank (the most formal setting I've worked in), New York and Company was my staple (their quality has since gone way downhill sadly).  Their dress pants were machine washable and I would typically wear a shirt/cardigan combo.  Their dresses and skirts are also machine washable.    Now I WFH and I could wear PJ pants (or no pants) as long as I look okay on Zoom.  With a few exceptions, my industry is super casual.	episode_done:True

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items are my Native American Turquoise jewelry and my cowboy boots. Just purchased a huge $900 squash blossom necklace and have worn it constantly. My boots range from $30 for a secondhand pair to $750 for custom made and none are worn more or less than the others.  When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was “saving for good”. Ironically, “good” apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I’m just out running errands.
text:So jealous! I want a squash blossom badly, I love a big statement necklace worn with all black.	labels:Meeee toooooo! Almost everything else I wear is thrifted, so I save a ton of money on clothes every year. This allows me to put aside $100-$150 a month to save up for these types of purchases. My husband is all for it because we share some of the larger cuffs and certain necklaces/bolos, so he paws through the collection too when we get dressed to go out.

text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:My usual office wear is midi circle skirt and blouse, sheer black tights, pointy flat shoes, cardigan or blazer.  Or a midi or knee length dress, cardigan or blazer.  In some offices I've worked in, solid coloured jeans with no rips count as business casual.  I would wear them with solid coloured tshirts or knitwear and boots or shoes but not sports shoes.	episode_done:True
text:Favorite designer if price we’re not a factor?	labels:For every day: Chanel, Max Mara, Acne, Mansur Gavriel, some relatively lower-key premium designers like Theory, Eileen Fischer, Staud; a bunch of athleisure from Carbon38 (retailer)’s high end yoga, sports, and lounge brands. For special occasions some Chanel, Gucci, Galia Lahav, Marchesa, many, many indie Etsy brands and custom “art pieces”; and honestly a lot of Hermès scarves.   I “can afford” some of this but I’m too responsible about retirement and other costs in my life to really go all-out on them. Perhaps one day I may drop five figures on a designer capsule wardrobe, but that’s not today.	episode_done:True

No glitter, no metallic thread. I like it on other people, but on me it makes me feel like I’m wearing a costume. Sequins and paillettes only on formal evening wear (for me).  No dolman sleeves (for me). I don’t like how they look on my busty inverted triangle shape.

text:Walmart fashion a “new” thing as seen on IG bloggers?	labels:Are they marked as sponsored posts? A couple of fashion influencers I follow are showing a lot of Wal-Mart clothes these days and the posts are always marked as sponsored. Any time an influencer is getting paid to wear something I assume they're wearing it for that reason and not because they genuinely like the clothes. I'm always way more interested in what they're wearing when they're not getting paid by some megacorp.  I will say I have weird love for some of the older George (edit: from Wal-Mart) stuff (like from years ago) that I can find on ThredUp periodically, some of the dresses from 10 or so years ago are actually pretty great and wear well. Anything else I've ever seen or purchased is very meh.
text:The person I follow on IG (cheapchicfinds) is posting daily Walmart or target outfits and tagging them but it doesn’t say sponsored. I’m sure she’s gotta be getting something though.  When I check a bachelor celebrity’s page for example, I clearly see the “sponsored by.”   I’ve seen some great vintage George stuff on Poshmark and thredUP too!	labels:In the early 2000s there was a show called "Look for Less" that was basically recreate this celebrity outfit with clothing from Walmart/Target/TJ Maxx/Burlington Coat Factory.

text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:How to mix and match pieces. My mom finds a combination that works (often because it is the store display) and just does that. She'll "mix it up" by buying the exact same thing in several different colors, but she will still pair them with the same item. So, like red shirt and blue pants and the same shirt and pant but in green and brown, but wearing the blue pants and green top would probably not occur to her. Which is very uniform and fine, but she was complaining about how she has two closets of clothes and looks the same all the time...the first time I took a skirt and paired it with a different shirt than the one she always pairs it with, it was like she thought I was a magician. She also still has some matching-print tops and bottoms from the late 80s/early 90s and breaking the pair up (like, wearing the patterned skirt with a solid top) made them look fresh and new...But she is also the type of person who doesn't ever rearrange furniture on her own and rarely tries new recipes either. She just is good with sticking with things that she knows will do well enough.    But yeah. Shopping her own closet for new combinations was a lightbulb moment for her. (My grandmother is the same way. She literally hangs her outfits on the same hanger, so *those* pants go with *that* sweater, which is how she ended up with, no joke, 47 pairs of white pants at one point 😬)	episode_done:True
text:Thanksgiving Outfits	labels:Generally on Thanksgiving I go for something comfortable (tight waistbands are a big no no when you're feasting, you want something loose or flowy that can accommodate a food baby) and machine washable (in case of spills and splatters while cooking). Sleeves that can be rolled up and won't get in the way. Can't go wrong with leggings and a lightweight sweater, or a casual dress.	episode_done:True
text:How to combine colors	labels:The #1 rule in fashion is to always wear a print with a complementary or neutral (i.e. black, gray, white, etc.) solid.	episode_done:True
text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:I also feel like this holds true. I also don’t see a lot of effort from luxury brands as well to counter the fast fashion feel and perception. Less craftsmanship and no real effort concerning environmental effects or lowering their carbon footprint.   It’s a shame and I think the whole industry needs big change.
text:I also think that luxury brands have lost the experience they used to sell. What happened to the dream or storytelling?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:Take a similar shirt of different fabric in to get tailored and see how your like the experience and their workmanship. Then bring silk shirts in to ask if they think they can improve the fit neatly.  Honestly anytime someone says silk is hard to work with, I roll my eyes. Maybe it is for people with less experience with it the first time they sew it. But I am not by any stretch of the imagination a skilled seamstress (I would say I am an intermediate hobby sewist), and I love silk of all kinds.  My sister (who is actually a pro) says the same thing about stretch. Even very experienced sewists sometimes avoid stretch out of fear or describe it as very difficult, but she laughs because she taught herself to sew by fitting her jersey t shirts in high school to be tighter. It just takes a little experience and the right tools.   If it’s all chiffon, or any other very gauzy loose weave, THAT can be a bitch, because it just morphs into a different shape before your eyes, but even then, a few darts or tucks or a hem should be no big deal for a tailor even on chiffon. And that’s more about how the weave behaves, not the fiber, so it also applies to polyester chiffon, cotton gauze, power mesh, etc. Plus, the garment is already cut and constructed, so it’s not going to move around much if you don’t take it apart and rebuild it.	episode_done:True
text:What is your favorite clothing/accessories subscription box?	labels:I've tried Stitchfix, Nordstrom Trunk Club and MM Lafleur.   Stitchfix was just laughable, in one box I got a pair of skinny black jeans and a note from the "stylist" saying that since I lived in NYC I should own a pair. All the clothes were items you could get cheaper at Nordstrom Rack (really, I checked a few).   MM Lafleur was overpriced for the quality and I felt the clothes lacked personality, though I could see this being helpful to someone who doesn't know where to start with office wear.   Nordstrom was ok but they couldn't nail my style and what would work on my body. I ended up keeping a  couple of items though, I tend to shop in a specific brand segment and price range and they sent me items  from brands I would normally dismiss as "too basic" that turned out to be good. They were also more tuned into mainstream trends (I'm sure they have research on this). With a slightly higher hit rate I might have tried this one longer.  I've been offered personal shopping a few times but that was out of my spending comfort zone in the end.  I subscribe to Scentbox (fragrance subscription). You can get more bang for your buck with decant stores, I guess, but I think their packaging is really nice and it's a fun way to try new things.

text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I unrepentantly have four distinct styles: renfest/earthy boho chic (linens, lace, fancy sleeves, flowy skirts, harem pants, tunic tops, earthy tones, etc.), grandma incarnate (chunky knitted sweaters and dowdy but comfortable and sensible), cryptid/alien/paranormal theme (mostly tees/long sleeve tees with The Theme, bold bright colors and graphics), and artsy college girl (leggings and oversized shirts/sweatshirts, sometimes funky). There is no way to marry most of these styles and in fact they clash horribly but some days I feel like my Mothman tee and some days I feel like a forest fairy, and I will not be denied these benign little pleasures that make me smile.	episode_done:True
text:What shoes besides boots are you looking forward to wearing this fall?	labels:My feet are mangled (I’m 33) so I pretty much wear Alegria shoes exclusively (also Birks).

text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:I’ve never really enjoyed shopping that much but now that I’m older and much heavier I have a really hard time with the limited options that come with being a size 18.   My style is way less trendy these days and now that I’m almost 30 I don’t really care about staying on top of all of that. I like more classic designs that don’t go out of style. I work a business casual desk job full time so I usually stick to skinny black pants, cute black flats/boots/loafers and a fun blouse or sweater. I’ve come to really appreciate a good statement earring so I have a nice little collection going now.	episode_done:True
text:Sweatshirt: I'm shocked by my purchasing decision from yesterday and needed to share	labels:A&F is still reeling from some of the negative feedback of its CEO and 2000's image and branding  which is too bad because A&F has for the last 3 or 5 years, made some significant changes to their image. I think when on sale (and they have a ton of sales, for example 50% everything during the off xmas season, 40% off black friday), they offer a very good price to quality ratio.  I highly recommend them for their henleys and button down shirts, especially the oxfords. they can be found with out logo too.	episode_done:True

Refer to the magazines Ranzuki, Popteen, CanCam and AneCam, and Farfa if you're on the plus size side. Good luck!	episode_done:True
text:NYT: The Very Right-Now Allure of Going to Extremes – Reviews of Rick Owens, Loewe, and Dries' SS21 Presentations	labels:I love this! Especially this quote from Dries van Noten  >“I think we need beauty, but not beauty that is nostalgic, that says the past was a better place. Beauty that gives you energy.”   That speaks pretty directly to how I’m trying to navigate fashion right now. I’m not exactly going out anywhere, but I try to wear clothes that make me really happy to be awake and doing things. And I’ve been consuming a lot of fashion media, history, shows, etc because some clothes—including a lot of these!—are so engaging even just over the screen.
text:i agree! i work from home right now, and while it's not a super formal industry, i'm finding i feel better and more functional if i put on something that vaguely resembles what i would wear to an office. that said, i'm definitely a notch more casual and comfy (more jeans, more plain tees) than i might be otherwise. some people can work in sweatpants, and good for them, but i feel like i'm ready to take a nap all day if i do that.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:I associate Gen Z fashion with crop tops and sweatpants, so yeah it makes sense that people in their 30's buying expensive ethical clothes aren't going for the sporty spice look.
text:Totally.  To me, Gen Z is a lot of clothing that isn’t work appropriate but super fun. A lot of crop tops, bra tops, spaghetti straps, usually some tummy showing, and then some baggy pants. Lots of thrifting and also cheap fast fashion. Doc Martens and other platform shoes. Very 90s/early 2000s. Long acrylic nails, false lashes. Really fun and can be a really “hot but trashy” style   Millennial fashion is more professional/better quality/structured. Linens, trousers, heels, sandals, etc. Frankly I think it has to do with millennials having more money. Low key hair, nails and makeup. Neutral colours and patterns. It’s a more mature style   I’m 25 so I get to do both 😎 woohoo	labels:Millennials have jobs and have moved up, gen z are still finishing college or are at school. At 15, I wouldn't have worn something a 30 year old wore.	episode_done:True

I have so much clothing, usually outerwear like a hoodie or sweater but jeans too that I only wear for a few hours at a time and always non-intensive activities. Some of these things just don't do well in the laundry. I mean they don't smell at all but I've probably worn some of them at least a dozen times lol. What do you guys typically do with this stuff?
text:If it doesn’t smell and it’s not dirty, it probably doesn’t need to be washed. Anything that touches my skin directly and gets sweaty will get washed after wearing, but I can go a month without washing a hoodie if I’m really not doing anything in it.	labels:	episode_done:True

Only criteria is that I would prefer it to be less than $40. Thanks!
text:Unfortunately that's a very tight budget for outerwear. You won't find a lot at that price point at retail.	labels:Yeah definitely. Thanks for the response.

text:DAE feel they made incredibly ODD fashion purchases, this year in 2020?	labels:I bought a bunch of bold printed and patterned shirts for work Zoom meetings!

I tried to be cautious with my lounge wear purchases because that’s not really me, but I was tempted from working from home.   I definitely just spent less overall. No dresses or skirts.

text:London street style Inspo (circa 1985-1990s)	labels:Hi all! This album is just a collection of street styles taken from London circa 1985-1990s by Mr. Shoichi Aoki.      I was very much surprised when going through the photos today because of how good the fits are considering they're mostly from the mid 80s. These looked like styles from the streets of Tokyo & Seoul but they turned out to from the UK instead. I know in terms of fashion many countries draw inspiration from each other but I never expected the folks in London to be so in command and stylish from such an early period!      Another pleasant surprise was how similar these fits look to the current trend of streetwear, high fashion / avantgarde style in the recent 2-3 years. If I had no clue of the year these photos were taken from, I wouldn't have a problem believing that they were from recent years.

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:The company already made money off of the original purchase of the shirt, so you buying second hand doesn’t really benefit them in any way. If you really want the item, buying it second hand is probably the most ethical choice you can make. If someone asks where the piece is from, just say you don’t know so they won’t be tempted to buy from the brand lol
text:yes BUT if the original buyers see the ability to sell on as one of the reasons why they buy from the brand (eg chanel). By buying it secondhand aren't you perpetuating that?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:Can I just ask why “as few pieces as possible” is the goal and not, say, “every piece in my wardrobe has a clear function or two, and sometimes that function is ‘because I feel like it’ or ‘because sequins make me happy?’”  A wardrobe you like is one that lets you be properly equipped for everything in your life and gives you a nice little aesthetic pick-me-up while you do it.   Before even shopping, I’d say: Look at your life. What do you do at work? What do you do in the community for volunteer work? How’s your social life? Are you outdoorsy? Do you have messy hobbies? Do your hobbies include going out to clubs and live shows and festivals? How often are you running meetings, speaking with elected officials, serving on committees? How often are you attending religious services, religious rites of passage, or big-deal family events like weddings?  Start with taking an inventory of your time and what you need your closet to do to help you be as prepared as possible for how you spend that time. Identify the holes in your working wardrobe, like “I need a good outfit for going to funerals” or “I need a warm weather first-day-at-the-new-job look.” Then you can settle questions of personal style, budget and what items fit more than one situation in your life.
text:TBH I feel as if there’s this underlying feeling of moral superiority that’s rooted in the minimalistic wardrobe (for some people). I’ll keep myself from getting too bashed by saying, yes for some people it’s an economic or environmental choice but for a lot it seems like... Ascetic nomad seeking moral high ground.  It’s similar to the painting community where there’s a fetish for having a minimal paint palette. Wow! You were able to paint that using only four colors?!? Who cares so long as the final product looks good??	labels:speaking as an artist: for me personally a limited colour palette is sometimes easier to work with because it eliminates choices. it’s wild to me that people see it as the hard option.	episode_done:True

I’ve often felt like this while scrolling through Pinterest and wondered the same.
text:Yeah that's what I took out of this as well.  A lot of those inspo posts on Pinterest are Pepe at fashion weeks and they're notoriously under or overdressed for the weather because they want to have the look. I have so many saved of cold NY fashion weeks and people in mini dresses and open toed shoes.

I'm really excited to see what he has in store for the women's line as I found the output at Dior really great.	episode_done:True
text:Where do you get good quality, legit wool sweaters that won't rip/shrink after washing?	labels:Do you use mesh bags? These make a huge difference! They are easy to find on amazon and such. But I think Ross/TJ Maxx are the real winners for these, they always have random ones on clearance. Pick up a few in various sizes, and this will protect your delicates more than throwing them in the regular wash.

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:Any time you're paying more than a few thousand dollars for a basic article of clothing, you're paying for the brand; because you could have that same blazer or pair of trousers custom made by a tailor/dressmaker in the same or better quality, for a lower price.  This was the case in the 50s and 60s as well, but at the time, high quality clothing was more common, sewing skills were more common, clothes were expected to last longer, and the general public had a better understanding of what good-quality clothing looks like; people bought Chanel expecting quality construction, of course, but the main appeal of buying from a prominent Parisian fashion house was knowing that anything Chanel made would be in fashion for the upcoming years.  Now that we are immersed in fast fashion, nobody has the knowledge to hold luxury brands accountable, and fashions change so quickly that a well-made 'up-to-date' jacket from a reliably fashionable brand would be a pointless investment.  It just doesn't make sense anymore for luxury brands to invest too much on quality if there is no longer any demand for quality.  This is not *only* a recent thing: I've seen gowns from the court of Marie Antoinette made of materials costing 30+ years of a working man's wages, yet were hastily thrown together with big, sloppy stitches and tacks.  That's just what happens when your client wants their garment *right now* and will only wear it once or twice.  If you want something that's really well-made and is going to last a long time, there is certainly a market niche for that, but it's become more of a middle-class niche for people who *specifically* care about quality and durability.

text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:<rant>  If I said "Wear cropped jackets so you look taller" I'd be laughed out of the room but somehow "Short people shouldn't wear long coats" is a valid thing?   Also what's defined as short? If someone is 5'7" do they get to wear long coats? What if they're 5'7.5"??  It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering". If you care so much about these gender norms, masculinity and being ~ flattering ~ then sack up and wear the clothes you like.   That whole thread is just people saying that someone else told them they couldn't *wear a coat* so what should they do? Oh idk. How about tell them to fuck off and wear the damn coat.  </rant>

"No because those are all things I can control. I'm too lazy to make an effort to improve myself so it's better that I blame the one thing I can't change."
text:yeah it's weird. in my experience with talking to people about this specific thing i feel like it's really clear that the reason they have trouble dating isn't really the height, it's usually bc of *at least* one pretty evident character flaw that overshadows their height. they might be really insecure (either about their height or something else), poorly groomed or dressed, or honestly just kind of disagreeable lol. the list goes on but you get it  from talking with my friends who date men i really don't think people care that much and it's not a problem for most people unless you make it one	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Gorp/Hikingcore	labels:Excellent album! Thanks for assembling. I live in a mountainous area where everyone is outdoors all the time, so I’m super biased, but this type of fashionable technical wear is just the most intelligent way to dress for whatever the day may throw your way.   Can I get a couple IDs?   - jacket in #4 (Visvim maybe?) - jacket in #7 - jacket in #10 - pants and shoes in #23 (these are so bomb)  At this point, it’s mandatory I buy those Aimé pants in every color. Every time I see a photo, I instantly gravitate.
text:Jacket in #4 is the River Trek Jacket from a Japanese brand called South 2 West 8. I believe it's from the FW17 collection.

It's just a matter of using techniques and good quality materials. If I sew something quickly and don't finish my seams, it might not hold out as long as if I take my time and am careful and thorough with the finishing methods on the inside, then it will almost certainly be better quality and more sturdy than something from H&M, for example.	episode_done:True

text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:I just want to throw out a couple of points for anyone considering the ethical standpoint of the two. The best thing you can do for the environment is always, always, *always*: buy fewer things, buy less often, buy secondhand if you can. To that end, real leather is generally better- it lasts so much longer, and will only look better with age. Even if a good fake leather bag lasts 10 years, it will start to crack and look a bit ratty after a while, while real lather can last easily five times as long without turning nasty (provided it's well cared-for).      Obviously if you draw a hard line about owning animal skin then that's a point worth bearing in mind too. And of course, both real and fake leather can be problematic in terms of exploited labourers and use of harmful materials in the production process. There are a lot of factors to consider.	episode_done:True
text:Tips for feeling confident when wearing stylish clothes around family?	labels:Ease into it slowly. Start with a few blouses that are more your new style preference, and wear them with jeans/leggings. It'll instantly add a bit of polish without looking too different. In the cool weather now, sweater dresses are sexy and stylish but also not too far off from a hoodie. long sweeping cardigans over sleeveless blouses/tops and leggings means that you can probably wear that same top when it gets warmer without the outer layer and people will already be used to it.     Also, Chances are there will still be days you want to wear that super comfy soft hoodie so keep some of your favs (take it from someone who found themselves owning zero sweat pants at the beginning of quarantine and had to walk live around in "dressy" pants for a few weeks).

It was definitively challenging at first to guess my size and learn to interpret my measurements (def measure yourself, there’s guides online) and the stores’, but it gets better with time!   It is easiest to stick to brands you already have clothes from, or alternatively use online stores that calculate your size for you based on other clothes you have (Saks, Bloomingdales and other large department stores offer this feature). The next part is to shop only on sites that allow returns (original payment, not store credit), preferably for free. Many big retailers do this already - with the final sale caveat. My favorites that I shop at most are Shopbop.com, Reformation, Saks, Aritzia (careful, they only refund to original payment non sale items), Bloomingdales, Lululemon, Farfetch, Banana Republic, J Crew, Abercrombie and Fitch. In general though, I won’t buy anything without checking out the site’s return policy first, and I usually don’t shop at places that don’t accept returns.  I acknowledge that some of these may have allegedly unethical practices, but I can’t afford (time, effort, health, money, etc.) finding alternatives at this time. I kindly ask that we don’t focus on that aspect sub the op didn’t specify they wanted ethic retailers only.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 29, 2020	labels:**Brooks Brothers suit jacket tailoring**  Hello! I’ve also reached out to Brooks Brothers support, but it’s a 4 week response time to questions... thought you fine folks might know.   Due to long arms I typically have to get (in other, cheaper brands) a 40L and *still* let the sleeves out an additional inch or so. The problem is the 40R is the right body length for my height and looks better.   Any idea how much fabric is available in the BB jackets to let the sleeves out?

Can confirm that the neck lanyard is extremely handy, as you can take off the mask while it still hangs around your neck. The adjustable ear loops are also super handy and comfortable. If I had to find a fault, it's that the mask material is quite thick and muffles your voice significantly, so be prepared to shout at cashiers who are also behind a plastic protection barrier.	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:Personally, I try to avoid the thinking of what I'm going to wear when I'm going somewhere, other than for functionality of course.  I feel like we expect our personalities and our lives to suddenly become glamorous and completely different once we get there, but that rarely happens in reality.  Same with vacation to a tropical paradise. Or a new job. Or a move unto the city. If I'm not a person that's likely to look glam, polished and picture perfect in everyday life, I won't have the energy to do so on vacation either. Plus, it's vacation, a time for me to feel relaxed and do fun stuff, not a time to focus on changing oneself to someone I'm not!  That's my thoughts! I feel like social media, selling and marketing is especially targeting in this way. When we see a product we want it, not just because it's appealing for the eye but also because we expect these things to change what we don't like about ourselves. Things we don't really want or have the energy to change ourselves, so we expect stuff to do it for us if we just buy them.
text:This 100%. I packed so many cozy apres outfits when I last went skiiing and then never at any point wanted to get into real clothes after shower. So my real apres style was just the leggings I wore skiing with technical underlayers and a big unzipped ski parka.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:I'm going to try and do a clothing no buy in 2021 (I can only replace athletic shoes) so take what I say with a grain of salt.  For me, it is a matter of knowing myself.  The current trends (the boxy, oversized, neutral aesthetic) do not work for my body type (pear).  The other trend that does not work for me is the cropped/ankle pants trend.  I look like a small child who just outgrew their clothes.  I also know what I do not wear (black or khaki pants--- reminds me of retail work uniforms of years past).  When I purchase something, (in my mind) it has to "pay for itself."  Meaning I have to think of at least x times that I will wear the item before I will buy it (special occasions are the rare exception).  X means the dollar amount.  So I have to wear a $30 sweater at least 30 times to make it worthwhile.	episode_done:True

text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:I'll add my 2 cents as someone that went through a big weight change about 4 years ago and how I've accepted/adjusted to it.  Until about 35, I weighed 110 and my concerns were always about trying to add curves with clothes since I had no butt and a flat chest.    A few lifestyle changes...I quit smoking!  I started working from home (so similar to what people are experiencing now) and I went on birth control.  All those factors together lead to a 50lb weight gain in about 6-8 months.    At first I didn't believe what my clothes were telling me.  I thought oh these jeans must have shrunk or those always ran small.  I was still cramming myself into size small or extra small tops because it was all I had ever worn.  Then one day I saw my own reflection in a window and thought "that poor girl needs to just go up a size or two" and then I realized it was me.  I used to love body hugging clothes like close fitting turtlenecks but now they just accentuate the parts of me I don't like.  I've switched to flowy tops and sweaters.  I used to avoid maxi dresses if I couldn't wear a push up bra because they made me look sooo flat chested.  Now I love them and its so nice not worrying about bra straps or a strapless constantly sliding down.    The biggest obstacle for me has been to stop fixating on the size on the label and just get the size that looks and fits the best.  I also was really motivated to lose weight for a little while and still bought the smaller sizes even if I could barely get in to them.  I lost a little of what I gained but I think my body is just happier at the heavier weight.  I think I look better too but it was hard giving up the "I'm the skinny girl" identity I had for so long.	episode_done:True
text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:There are a few brands that do this (Vince and Theory are the ones I've encountered...). Back when I worked in a more formal industry I was shopping for a Theory suit. At Nordstrom Rack the suit was unlined and a wool/poly blend. At Nordstrom the suit was wool with a poly half-lining. And at the Theory flagship in NYC the suit was pure wool with some natural or cellulose full lining (it's been a few years... but it definitely wasn't poly). This was ostensibly the same suit - similar silhouette and the same name, just a few numbers on the product ID differed. And of course the fit when I tried them on was noticeably different, from the Rack one being like a very cheap imitation, the Nordstrom one being pretty good, and the flagship one fitting like a glove.   Similarly, I recently bought some AllSaints moto boots from 6pm fully expecting them to be a diluted version. Instead they were the same cow leather lined with goat leather I tried in store. Considering how these things usually go, a happy surprise (no way in hell are they worth the $450 at full price). Side note: 6pm secretly lists most of their stock on Amazon with Prime fulfillment, which is great because their return policy sucks.
text:I’ve definitely learned to check material content on the designer/non-house brands. Occasionally Nordstrom returns end up at the Rack outside of the normal sales cycle for the item and are a good deal. But you’re right- a lot more polyester than silk, etc for most of the items there	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:I think that this really depends on what type of washing machine you have access to. If you have a modern, front loading machine, with multiple wash settings, you can relatively easily machine wash many “hand wash only” items. I’ve had varying results with top loaders or old front loading washers-I find them more rough on clothes. Most items do ok on a delicates cycle with cold water for both stages. I often wash sweaters on the wool setting (cold water, low spin) or soak my sweaters with euclean and spin dry-er in the machine before laying flat to dry. Most of the damage to clothes happens in the dryer IMO. Also, brands often put dry clean only or hand wash only because they haven’t tested the fabric for machine wash and want plausible deniability-thus many things can survive with machine wash cold and air dry. But your results may naturally vary based on the piece of clothing. I personally only buy stuff that I feel is very special that is not machine wash air dry safe. Otherwise I feel like laundry ends up taking too much of my life, and it isn’t worth it to me.
text:Yeah I live in an apartment with a laundry room (top loading) and I think the machines are a little hard on my clothes	labels:I have a top loader and throw my items in mesh delicates bags to keep them from getting stretched out too much during the delicate cycle.  No problems with anything except silk.  The spin dry cycle is too harsh for silk, IME.	episode_done:True
text:Bruce Boyer on Finding Your Wardrobe and Sustainability in Fashion – Put This On (Derek Guy )	labels:i wish articles like this avoided the "expensive clothes sustainability" trope. the systems that lead to people being able to drop several thousand on a suit are inherently not sustainable, and i would love to see more discussion like that in the last question where consumption itself is addressed. imo the answer will involve more people taking responsibility for the origin of their own clothing with a focus on local labor and materials
text:Could you say more about why those systems are unsubstainablr?   I'm not very rich, I would struggle to afford a house in my expensive city, but I have dropped a few thousand on a suit - made with good materials by a local bespoke maker.  I think extreme wealth gaps are unsustainable, for sure, but dropping a few thousand on a suit every couple of years isn't much more than people spend on a computer, out drinking, or on games and gaming systems. For me, it's a hobby I get to wear.	labels:One decent suit in any closet is always a must, a couple of times I got the job I was interviewing for simply because I wore a suit and tie to the interview.   Sustainability and changing trends are another can of worms which depend on the individual. Contemporary vs Classic, $300 suit which can be altered by a tailor vs $4,000.00 fitted suit. Like he said “buy the best you can afford and take care of your purchases”
text:> is always a must  It's not anymore though. For so many people wearing a suit just isn't needed outside of maybe a handful of events a year and at that point why bother spending anything more than a couple hundred?   You don't need a full canvas suit that's been made out of a fabric you picked for your measurements. Just like buy a navy worsted wool suit from J Crew on steep discount or any of the other many budget brands for suiting out there now.  You can vary easily do more than just get by with a suit that many people who browse here wouldn't even bother calling "decent". Many might not even need a suit at all. I can't remember the last time I needed to wear one.	labels:	episode_done:True

I was heartbroken, she was so good to me, always covering my pasty white skin while keeping me cool, hiding my belly on fatter days and tucking beautifully into some jeans on less fat days.  I wasn't even really aware of resale sites until last year because I hadn't really gotten into secondhand shopping yet.

It was beautiful and I feel whole again.	episode_done:True
text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:I don't like wearing synthetic fabrics for the most part and try to avoid them, but I am vegan and that leaves out wool and silk, so almost everything I own is cotton or linen. I find I sweat too much in most synthetic fabrics or they just cause weird sensory issues for me, but not all synthetic and blends are bad or cause me issues. It's hard because I generally need to feel the fabric to see if it'll cause me a problem and when ordering online, it's not possible.   I do think fleece is particularly problematic because of the plastic fibers that get into the water when washed, but there are bags to wash them in to trap it. I don't think all synthetics shed plastic like that but I'm not sure.	episode_done:True

I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

Then you avoid the weird men’s fitting and bulge.

text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I used to wear small diamond earrings every day, and would put them in my wallet when I went to the gym after work. I got to work the next day and realized I forgot to put them back in after the gym, so I opened up my wallet and they were gone. I had made my usual morning stop for breakfast on the way to work, so I rushed to the food cart and looked all over the sidewalk but I couldn’t find them.  At least 1-2 weeks later I went to the same food cart for breakfast, looked down, and saw one diamond earring in the crack in the sidewalk. I looked more closely and there was the other one! The metal was chewed up (they were bezel set) so I had to get them repaired, but it was a lot cheaper than a new pair!   Definitely my #1 fashion (jewelry?) miracle.
text:I'm glad you found them! This reminds me of my mother's similar miracle with her wedding ring! Her ring is not fancy, it has a single, small round diamond in a gold 6-prong setting.   Well, the stone fell out at some point, and my mother didn't know exactly where or when. We all looked everywhere, but how do you even start to look for something that's only a few mm? We scoured the house with flashlights looking for any sparkle. We even cut open the vacuum bag and sifted through everything, same everytime someone swept or dusted. Replacing it was not an expense my parents could really afford.   A few weeks later she'd given up and had decided it would have to be replaced somehow...until she noticed a small sparkle on the [very narrow] back rim of the top loading washer by the hinge of the lid. No clue how it didn't just fall into the washer when she put the clothes in! My best guess is it fell out of a pocket and that's where it landed.	labels:	episode_done:True

Also, as someone who adores eBay shopping and Posh, it’s more of a “buyer’s market” - I just scored new-in-box Aquatalia and La Canedienne boots, each for less than 1/4 of original price, and these are styles that are still being sold full-price online.   The only area I really see this working out is luxury bags - bags get less wear and tear, and Chanel will always have great resale value. But for an entire wardrobe, it just doesn’t seem viable (or worth the time).	episode_done:True

I see a lot of knock offs on places like Poshmark and Depop unfortunately	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:I had to revamp my wardrobe over the last two years as I changed jobs and sizes.   I had just finished a no-buy year, while I lost weight so was starting with nothing at all.   1. Buy decent undergarments. As a large busted woman, I can’t tell how anything fits without a good fitting bra. There’s r/abrathatfits to get a good measurement as many women are wearing the wrong bras. I got a size and sister size from this, went to a bra shop with a good range of bras and tried a few on to find one everyday one that fitted perfectly. Get a decent sports bra while you are there if you exercise at any speed above a gentle stroll.   2. Know what you need for where. Having items for work, weekend and exercise is important. Some people don’t separate work and weekend wear that much and others have wardrobes that look like they belong to different people.   3. Start with one or two items/outfits (especially if trying a new look) before committing. There’s no point in buying a whole wardrobe that later doesn’t feel right. I had a strong sense of what I liked and still bought a couple of oopsies.   4. A classic/go-to item might not be a classic for you. I love the look of skirts but never ever wear them. I only wear trousers and/or dresses so wasted my money on a couple of classic black skirts for work. I have worn them exactly 0 times.   5. Take risks in the dressing room. Try different colours and silhouettes on in actual shops and think about what you like/don’t like about each piece. I have changed my style a bit as it is free to try it on!   5. A decent blazer that fits well makes any outfit more formal when you need it- even us more casual people.	episode_done:True

In more conventional times I’d also sometimes have concealer or lipstick with me for touch ups but now what I carry is pretty minimal. I sometimes have a few other things thrown in there depending on the circumstances but these are my every day items. I carry a specific bag for work since I need to carry my laptop and files for work.   Edit to add: hair ties!	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 23, 2020	labels:i go on walks around the neighbourhood sometimes and my grandma always asks me, “isn't it kind of cold out?” (she's 90, anemic, and hates putting on layers – she's almost always cold) and i tell her no it's fine i have a jacket and a sweater. she'll ask me, “is that warm?” and so i'll give the sweater or jacket to her to hold and she'll smile and say, “… oh. yeah, this is good, you're going to be really nice and warm.” but that never stops her from asking me if i'm going to be cold the next day  so i don't know how, but we've gotten to a point where i give her a full breakdown of what i'm wearing just so she knows i'm not cold. it's really funny. so i'll tell her, “okay, feel this. this is like wool and mohair. it's warm, right? i didn't even know what mohair was until i got this.” or “look at this! a nice pair of jeans. it's a really heavyweight denim. you know i'm not going to be cold in this.”  and she'll laugh and say, “alright, i get it. that's good, this is really good.” and idk how but it just occurred to me that i ask my grandma for a fit check every day

The full body pieces in the latter half of the album.  Except, I've actually worn those before, and having to basically undress yourself to take a crap is the most obnoxious thing ever.  It's like the opposite of functional style unless you're *actually* doing the sort of work that benefits from it, in which case you probably wouldn't use such a nice looking one for painting your house or whatever.  Some really nice coats/jackets here though, and I laughed out loud on second look when I realized the dude's sporting a "fanny pack" or belly bag or whatever you call it in number 4.  Number 9 looks a bit samey to me... I can see what it's going for, but running basically identical colors from top to bottom just looks weak to me.  I'd steal the hat though, it shows up in a few others.  Number 12 kind of gets to me, because I think it's what my dad would have looked like in his later years if he had a sense of style and some money.  The overall aesthetic reminds me of him a *lot* just better done.	episode_done:True

text:Runways have been sending out 2000s vibes. Anyone onboard?	labels:I'm just going to lay it out there: I hate it. I hate the return of the Mean Girls/bitchy rich white girl/fucking velour Juicy tracksuit look. Probably because I started high school in 2001 and it was like the hey day of bland tackiness and Paris Hilton and I'm too close to it, lived it a little too much, to find any novelty in it. SO vapid. I was slightly vapid and a little mean for a while around that time before I came into myself and I don't like the reminders.  What I do like about the looks above though, is that I see the 60s and 90s Spice Girls influences and I can get into that.  Edit: also, on occasion, I wear low rise pants, but I like looking at trends for inspiration and new ideas, not dictating what I can or can't wear. If you like low rise jeans and hipster minis, rock em. If not, fuck em forever, who cares.
text:The tackiness of it is a FINE LINE. Your point about seeing 60s and 90s influence in this looks is important. I  love 60s and 70s fashion. I feel some of it was a bit mix matchy and almost tacky but way more sleek that early 2000s. I've been buying vintage 60s and 70s stuff and love it. I want bell sleeves and groovy patterns to have a bigger comeback than 2000s stuff.	labels:	episode_done:True

Also what's defined as short? If someone is 5'7" do they get to wear long coats? What if they're 5'7.5"??  It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering". If you care so much about these gender norms, masculinity and being ~ flattering ~ then sack up and wear the clothes you like.

text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:Going through a place like TRR to resell a luxury item will likely yield a smaller return than expected. From what I call tell their commission rate is 30-50% and unless the garment is in near pristine condition after a few years it will likely retain less of the value than anticipated. Maybe TRR would try selling it for $300 then, but you would probably net half. Most items I see going for a premium are either very desirable brands or items that are virtually unworn.   Beyond all of that it’s difficult to predict where things would end up in a few years - what’s a desirable brand on the resale market now may not be in 3-5 years. Some designers will lose value more quickly.   It’s just really not a strategy I would account for when planning a clothing budget in the long run. You can readjust as you go based on money than comes in from returning items to the resale market - but I would fully expect that in all cases you will likely loose over half the original purchase price (especially if you are not selling it directly to another consumer).
text:The only way to make it work is to sell items directly, preferably ones you’ve bought at bargain basement prices. eBay, Grailed, Vestiaire etc will absolutely destroy your margin with their cut. This means building an Instagram following, finding your way into niche communities, and spending hours photographing, pricing, and listing items. If having thirsty dudes slide into your DMs is worth an extra $100 to you, it can go a long way towards making you profitable.   Even then, if you’re not buying things with an eye towards flipping, it’s going to be slow and potentially not worth the time investment. I’m a big Rick collector, and what I buy for myself has little overlap with what has significant resale value. I make most of my extra money on arbitrage between markets and reselling unisex pieces to the significantly larger male audience. If I wanted to make a significant dent in my clothing budget with resale, it’d turn into a 15-20hr/wk endeavour. Spending that same effort on my actual job would generate a much larger return, and compound over time to boot🤷‍♀️	labels:The point about ROI on time spent doing this vs working is well made. I have a hunch that I would enjoy the process, but if not, it is certainly not worth it.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: How do I know my clothes weren't made with slave labour?	labels:Make em yourself. But then what if the textiles were produced using slave labor?   Buy the fibers and a loom.  But what if the processing facility that produces the fiber uses slave labor to harvest?   Honestly, unless youre willing to grow your own cotton, and raise your own silkworms, and process the raw materials into a finished product...shop thrift. Give that money to your local owner instead of into the hands of a bunch of companies that make you worry about whether theyre using slave labor.  The clothes at thrift might have been produced unethically, but the local owner profits 100% from the sale of the clothing, and it doesnt support the evils.  But you can definitely produce your own silk, your own cotton, all of it. Lots of people do it, its just super fringe and takes a lot of time and patience.

Like, I’ve been basically living in a pair of Black Milk toasties leggings this entire fall (since I want to be both warm and colourful and that’s hard when it’s cold haha).

text:General Discussion - November 27, 2020	labels:Hot take: speaking from experience, fetishistically optimizing the most basic of basics (e.g. "the best plain white t-shirt") for maximum imagined value is not a meaningful nor worthwhile exercise. Your wardrobe is not more interesting because your white tee is better than another white tee, and by the time you've found the 'perfect' piece either the prevailing trend or your own preferences will probably have changed.  'Perfect tee' threads are usually highly-upvoted, but the answers have drawn from the same pool for the last goddamn decade:  - *Vintage/workwear (generally heavier, boxier, shorter):* 3sixteen, Buzz Rickson's, Lady White Co. - *Streetwear (generally lighter, slimmer, longer):* Reigning Champ, wings + horns, John Elliott - *"Normal" (somewhere in the middle)*: Naked & Famous, Arket, American Apparel when they still existed - *Edgy goth shit:* Rick Owens mainline for lighter and DRKSHDW for heavier, Kazuyuki Kumagai Attachment, Voidthebrand when they still existed - *Budget*: Muji, Uniqlo, Everlane, Bella+Canvas, etc., but no one really cares  It's functionally a solved question. You can pick one from the applicable list for your style, and it'll be *fine.*

text:Fashion Favorites	labels:I absolutely love funky button down shirts! The sillier the print probably the better. It's a new love from last year that I now have flamingos, lobsters in sunglasses, dinosaurs, and plant shirts among others already that I wear all the time to work and I just would love more.. I was just daydreaming of where to find more options on another tab actually.. I'm really short though so I've been shopping in the little boys section. Tuck one of those bad boys into a nice pair of pants or longer skirt and I'm living my modern Mrs. Frizzle dream.   Also love bell bottoms! Those are hard to find though for people under 5ft. lol

text:Does anyone else always hesitate to buy what they truly love because they don't have a social life?	labels:Outside of Covid,  I am perfectly happy to wear fancier than necessary clothes to work out while running errands.    What I really want and can't justify is a floor length formal gown. I don't think I have ever gone to a black tie event.  Why don't people have fancy parties anymore????? I just want to wear a ball gown once a year,  is that too much to ask?

text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:I feel the same way, I'm bewildered at so many people finding ALL pants uncomfortable.   The only thing I can think of is that they're either wearing the wrong style (I vastly prefer super high rise. midrise and lowrise cut me across the stomach in an uncomfortable way, unless they're a size too big), the wrong size (too small jeans WILL be terrible, especially 100% cotton), or they have sensory or digestive issues/stomach sensitivity.	labels:SQUEEGEE!!! -Tookie Clothespin	episode_done:True

text:Aimé Leon Dore for Drake's F/W 2020 Lookbook	labels:So I totally understand that this is a lookbook and highly stylized, but is it actually possible to pull off the sweats + tailored clothing look?  I think it looks sick, but my gut reaction is that while it looks cool in a vacuum, it might look kind of silly in real life.  Has anyone here rocked a similar look/style?
text:I think it is a little easier to go the other way in real life i.e. tailored trousers with a t-shirt top.   Somehow, it never feels right going the other way.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Matching shoes & purse	labels:I don’t think fashion has any rules anymore unless you’re royalty or it’s cultural.   I personally don’t like matchy matchy bag and shoes unless I’m going for a monochrome look. I tend to match tones rather than colours. I like a patterned bag (say Gucci dionysus or Fendi zucca or LV canvas) as opposed to patterned clothes because I find they blend in well with a variety of outfit choices.   If I do colour, I will make sure the tone matches. I can’t stand mixing warm times with cool tones. Eg I have a cool tone lilac paid of heels that I love wearing with my cool tone magenta bag.   You can also do opposite sides of the colour wheel with shoes and bags like a green bag and a purple/magenta pair of shoes. But again keep to the same tones. The key with fashion is the tone of colours, and that includes neutral colours too. I would always suggest everyone does a colour/tone analysis and then stick to buying items in that range. It makes mixing and matching easier.
text:Love the idea of matching from opposite sides of the color wheel. I do definitely try to stick to my season as well. Thanks for these awesome tips!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:I love that lots of vintage eras hearken back to others, so you’ll find lots of 1930s inspirations in the 70s etc. You could start with prairie dresses, Gunnesax style and play with adding details. Right now massive puffy sleeves are everywhere! I love a good edwardian style blouse with jeans,and you can find real ones at reasonable prices if you’re willing to learn some simple repairs. Edwardian cottons are super durable! I also love a tweedy street urchin lad look with knickerbockers and vests. I’m dying for my city to host a tweed ride!	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Confidence usually comes as a result of doing things. Part of this is trying new things and facing the fact that you might make mistakes; and that's okay, because it's a learning experience. It is not a crime to buy something and realise later it's not for you. Everyone does it.   Some people don't like the idea of making mistakes, so they try and protect themselves and the people they love from them. Sounds like your mother is like that. But at the end of the day, your clothes are for you to wear and wash. Her opinion is just an opinion. The only way you'll know is by wearing the clothes, washing the clothes and seeing how YOU feel about it.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 25, 2020	labels:$28 for shipping domestically if you don't spend $250, Rowing Blazers? Oof.  Edit: Apparently they don't have flat rate shipping. Just a rugby by itself was only $9 to ship. But when you tack on a terry cloth polo and the patchwork madras cap like I did, it jumps to $28. Since it would only cost $14 to get another $48 worth of stuff with that shipping charge, I tacked on another terry polo and a facemask. I seriously considered the patchwork tweed cap, but I can't think of when I'd wear it... obviously it's a F/W hat, but I lean heavy into watch caps because my ears get cold really easily.	episode_done:True
text:Shopping my own closet for the perfect tee	labels:Glad to know I'm not the only one who still owns that grey Americana Danger Days tee!   I have a specific style and cut of t-shirt that I prefer, and I just stick to buying that. I gave up on the "every _____ under ____ should own ______" lists and just bought some slim-cut v-necks in colors that jive with my wardrobe. Instant layering capsule. I keep my graphic/memorabilia tees and my "nice" tees very separate, though; they're even stored in separate places in my closet because they fill such different functions for me. I'm not sure if I would take such a conscientious look at my t-shirt collection as you have here because  I mostly regard tees as either pajamas (graphic) or more akin to underwear (layering) than anything else. They're just functional - not something I love or cherish or feel the draw to be more intentionally mindful about. I just Respect the Stack.
text:Yessss! Shirt twins!  Tbh most of my tees are pajamas or layering tees as well (under hoodies/sweaters). But in the summer they’re a huge component of my outfit since I don’t have another layer usually, so I thought it was worth taking a look. (Also for some reason my brain keeps going ITS ALMOST SUMMER GET READY even though... it’s not...)  It used to be my goal to find an amazing tee and just buy like 7 of them, but based on this I feel like I can’t trust myself to pick one that I wouldn’t be mad about in a year or two haha.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:No, no, no and no. I hate the aesthetic thing. Buying things bc 'they fit in with my aesthetic' and not bc you like them is weird to me. You can be all of those styles all at once. I love having a grungy girl moment, a colourful LOOKATMENOW moment, a classy neutral I'm a big girl moment and a floaty yes I am a fairy and I just tiptoe about in pretty midi dresses moment.
text:However, some guide in the side bar helped me realise, that I also don't need to love every piece I own. Some basics help to bring attention to my favourites. So for me it is about balance, I guess? Wouldn't buy anything I can't personally tolerate tho.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Review - The Custom Russian Automatic Dive Watch (for less than 100 Dollars)	labels:Vostoks do have some questionable quality though from what I understand. Would depend on the reason you want one, but I would go for one of the quality Chinese clones for this price range unless you have an aversion to those. QC is hit or miss on them too, but it's usually minor cosmetics or slightly sharper edges.   Pagani Design makes some really decent ones and uses Seiko NH35 movements, ceramic bezel, and sapphire crystals on most. They have some quartz that use Seiko mechaquartz movements as well. I have two of them and both track within +/- 10 seconds per day accuracy.	episode_done:True

text:Summer outfit inspiration: An inspo album and 6 lessons on how to make complete outfits even when you are dying of heat stroke	labels:Used to live in US Southwest, temps 100+F in summer.    Clothing depends on what your activity is. If you're just going to the office, layers are key. Pants, short sleeve shirt, blazer/cardigan. Air conditioning can be brutal.   Day to day errands, dresses can be super nice (with safety shorts). DO pick ones that cover your shoulders/back/neck if you can, those areas sunburn very easily!   After the sun goes down, dark colors are fine and will make lighter clothing look more formal.   As someone else mentioned, moisture wicking athleisure can be nice (think tennis/golf polo).  Sneakers work surprisingly well. Sandals are nice, but make sure you don't get sunburn on the tops of your feet. Also don't ever go barefoot, pavement gets hot enough to give you 2nd degree burns in seconds.      Notice how many times I say "after dark" here, there's a reason many cultures with hot summers have a culture of socializing/doing errands in the evening!	episode_done:True

Now I can look at Zalando (major online distributor) and the cheapest low quality fast fashion brand has t-shirt with sustainable tag for 10€ more than regular one. Like do you think I'm stupid, I'm not gonna buy sustainable t-shirt from fast fashion brand that clearly doesn't care one bit for sustainable quality clothing and only uses it as marketing word/tag making it totally worthless.

text:What work for my boyfriends taste and body type?	labels:My husband has a very similar body type. When he got a new job recently in a larger city after working from home for years we basically went out and got him a whole new but fairly minimal wardrobe that’s worked out really well for him.  We picked out a color palette for him which is mostly blues/navy, gray and olive green. He had a couple of basic button downs like a plain white and a crosshatch pattern in various shades of blue. We picked him up a few more button downs in various classic colors like white, light blue, white with a simple pattern of any of those colors. We also got him a couple of more casual button downs, either because of fabric or a louder pattern for fridays or casual wear. J Crew button downs ended up fitting him well. I agree with other recommendations for slim fit jeans and chinos; we replaced his light wash Levi’s 501s with dark wash slim fit Levi’s 511s and those look great. Banana Republic’s traveler pants are also a favorite for him, fit and good stretch but look sharp.   For outer wear we got a couple of basics: a grey fleece vest like from Patagonia for the “midtown uniform” look; it’s more comfortable than wearing a blazer but still looks more formal than a button down on its own. I also got him a quarter zip navy merino wool sweater to layer over his dress shirts on colder days. More casually he has a lined flannel “coat” that he wears over a basic white tee, a more tech jacket, and formally I found him a basic black wool overcoat for work.   For shoes we got him one pair of nice oxfords, one pair of oxford looking tennis shoes from Cole Haan, a pair of off-white leather shoes as his dressier items.   He also has hiking pants and brown hiking shoes that he wears as casual clothing with sweatshirt tees or flannel.	episode_done:True

I only kept and subscribed to channels that tend to do their research or seem pretty down to earth. Honestly a pretty good rule of thumb is, does watching this person make me feel good and fulfilled afterwards? Inspired even? If not then, i just don't watch their videos anymore. YT is suppose to entertain you, not make yourself feel bad.  Someone mentioned Justine Leconte in the comments and for ex, after her videos, i just feel so much more knowledgeable, like i actually got something out of it. I like watching bestdressed because her personality is relatable and she knows she has imperfections but still posts anyway. Jessica Neistadt is one that hasn't been mentioned yet, but i watch her cause she has a good energy. Most of her hauls are thrifts so they're affordable, with a few expensive pieces here and there. Also, she has a quote of the day at the end of her videos. Obviously, what makes me happy isn't an answer for everyone.  I tend to mix up my feed as well so I don't get tired of one topic too quickly (food, social experiments, science, video games)

I imagine watches are actually probably one of the more common sentimental items.  Also used to have a hoodie that I'd had since 7th grade (so \~18 years), that got lost while moving just this year. It was from being on the swimming team and it was perfect. It also had the extra sentimental value of being a time in my life that I ended up meeting my, too this day, best friends. It still fit because it had most likely stretched out with me over the years and was fairly sheer in comparison to most sweatshirts. I run hot so it was great when a t-shirt was a little too chilly, but a sweatshirt was too hot. .  I also used to have another zip-up hoodie years ago that was a similar story that had just been one of my go-to items for like a decade . So more like a safety blanket than any particularly sentimental memories.	episode_done:True

text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:Skiing is a strenuous sport, often done in a dangerous alpine climate. I wear technical gear: bright loose waterproof jacket and pants for visibility and mobility, wicking warm base layers, balaclavas and goggles to protect my eyes and skin, a helmet, and a backpack or fanny pack with an emergency kit.   After skiing, I strip off the outer layers and walk around in uggs, tights, and turtleneck.   You know what? I 100% blend in. I don't look better or worse than the hundreds of other people who have just come down from the mountain. This is why people specifically wear bright colors. Your party will be able to identify you at a distance from the specific colors you're wearing.   I think ski/apres ski style is to skiing what cottage core is to farming/homesteading. It's an aesthetic for people who don't actually do it.   If you like the look and aren't interested in skiing, then look into some New England heritage preppy looks. The bean boots, scandi wool sweaters, thick stretchy stirrup pants, fluffy trimmed accessories, and parkas may appeal to you. Uniqlo has some cute stuff in their recent collab that has that cozy lux vibe. Moncler and Gorsuch are some OG European ski fashion wear companies. You could look into those for inspiration.   But definitely don't try to go skiing without a waterproof pant and jacket combo. You will have a terrible time, given how much you will likely fall. (Assuming that you're a beginner.)
text:Even as a fairly advanced skier I would still not go out without waterproof gear. Unless you’re close enough to the hills to only ski perfect weather, there’s a pretty good chance it will be snowing for at least some of your trips. I would hate to be shivering on a lift with wet gear!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Naked and Famous Raw Denim Review/Fit/Experience	labels:I’m a personal stylist who focuses JUST on women’s jeans and in all my years of experience I’ve only put raw denim on 2 of my clients for this exact reason. It’s too difficult to really nail the fit.... and if you do, there’s a good chance it’ll change as the jeans settle out or if your body changes. Plus, cutting around curves is super tough.   Raw denim is awesome in theory. It ages with you and confirms to your body. And the look of it over time is so cool. But I’ve almost never seen it work with women, especially in skinnier cuts. There’s just no give.   I would otherwise recommend vintage Levi’s or 100% cotton premium denim in a heartier weight for a more structured jean. The difference it that it’s been rinsed/washed so the fit is more predictable and longer lasting than raw denim.

text:What are your fashion tips for looking good on Zoom?	labels:I think it's all in camera placement and lighting.  Have the camera at eye level or slightly above it. My laptop webcam was at a seriously unflattering angle, even when propped up. I just got a webcam that I put on my main monitor and the angle alone makes me look 10x better.   Get a light source behind your camera that's pointed at your face. Get a ring light if you can. Play around with desk lamps. If you have 2 lamps, try placing them behind the camera, one on each side of you. If you have 1, try placing it behind the camera pointed directly at you, try to bounce the light off the wall, etc. If you're sitting with your back to a window, close your blinds.  What color is your desk chair? Don't wear a shirt that's the same color. Other than that, I think anything goes with respect to fashion. You only really see like 10% of the person's top on videos.  Makeup wise, I like to wipe my face with an oil-blotting sheet to make sure I'm not shiny, lots of blush and bronzer, and  a YLBB shiny lip balm.	episode_done:True

text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Many years ago I moved from Hawaii to college in the Northeast. I would recommend 1) Buying it all there, because they'll have what's good for their climate and 2) starting out with cheaper options (thrifted, Old Navy, Target range) even if it's not quite your style. Don't spend much time, effort, and money until you see how you really feel after at least a year of seasons. Maybe you want warmer stuff than you thought you would, or realize you should invest in nicer socks, or discover you don't actually like turtlenecks, or shift to a different style when you're surrounded by a new area's vibe. Let yourself experience it for a bit without pressuring yourself to do it all right.

text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:Skiing is a strenuous sport, often done in a dangerous alpine climate. I wear technical gear: bright loose waterproof jacket and pants for visibility and mobility, wicking warm base layers, balaclavas and goggles to protect my eyes and skin, a helmet, and a backpack or fanny pack with an emergency kit.   After skiing, I strip off the outer layers and walk around in uggs, tights, and turtleneck.   You know what? I 100% blend in. I don't look better or worse than the hundreds of other people who have just come down from the mountain. This is why people specifically wear bright colors. Your party will be able to identify you at a distance from the specific colors you're wearing.   I think ski/apres ski style is to skiing what cottage core is to farming/homesteading. It's an aesthetic for people who don't actually do it.   If you like the look and aren't interested in skiing, then look into some New England heritage preppy looks. The bean boots, scandi wool sweaters, thick stretchy stirrup pants, fluffy trimmed accessories, and parkas may appeal to you. Uniqlo has some cute stuff in their recent collab that has that cozy lux vibe. Moncler and Gorsuch are some OG European ski fashion wear companies. You could look into those for inspiration.   But definitely don't try to go skiing without a waterproof pant and jacket combo. You will have a terrible time, given how much you will likely fall. (Assuming that you're a beginner.)

It's an aesthetic for people who don't actually do it.  I can agree with this.  I live 20 miles from Breck, and any person you see who has been out on the slopes are wearing fearing athletic and technical looking gear.  For most restaurants, people aren't dressed in furs or look glam at all.  It's mostly basic bitch type winter garb - knit hats with a fur pom pom, long puffer jackets, skinny jeans.    If you go to Aspen though that's a bit of a different story.  More money over there so you'll see "fancier" people.	labels:20 miles is 32.19 km	episode_done:True
text:“Sadd” Colors: 1620s Puritans to 2021	labels:Any idea what colors the Puritan colonies would have even had access to make locally?   I'm wondering if the association with more garish colors related in their minds to foreign trade and is maybe more about how they feel towards external cultures.
text:The list is basically the full set of colors they would have been able to use when factoring in dye performance (particularly color stability) . It even maps to pre-Twentieth-Century advice on house paint.  There may have been some dyes they could acquire at expense and use on clothing reserved for special occasions (and thus less roughly used), but their association of formality with monochrome obviated such luxuries. It'd be like buying a purple silk velvet tuxedo today.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.
text:>But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers.   Seriously.  You're never "expressing yourself" if you're copying someone else's look. Go explore and find your own joys.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: What do your shoes say about you?	labels:Hey hey! You'd like to think you are creative and into fashion and not getting old but really you just wear the same pair of boots everyday because you have slowly started prioritizing comfort over style but still try to justify it as an actual ~aesthetic~ and totally not because you now have bunions and corns and fallen arches and other old feet problems (why do things between my toes now bother me?!). #Blundstones4Lyfe #oldhagat32
text:Something about the blundstones man, once you wear them you never go back. It’s like a cult.

text:What are "iconic" items that you should know about, and their basic history? What items can singularly be identified as "starting a trend"?	labels:Timberlands yellow nubuck boots have an interesting history, kind of the first major crossing of workwear and urban street wear. Depending on who you ask, it was drug dealers or just urban blacks started wearing insulated timberlands to keep their feet warm standing on the cold concrete late at night. Timberland was slow to embrace this new market, and that brought some controversy. If you believe that it was primarily drug dealers buying the boots you can understand why Timberland didn't want to develop that reputation, if you believe it was urban blacks then it looks a lot like racism. I tend to think they were trying market to construction workers, and were worried the urban buyers would be a shorter term market. In the end, there are plenty of better construction boots out there and they went where the money is greenest and have been an fashion staple ever since.  Buffalo check (red and black check) coats were originally full blown wool blankets that women would sew into jackets for their husbands logging in the PNW. Now it's just a popular pattern in general, and some people still swear by blanket coats.	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:I love loose shapes, but particularly the ones that are a little rigid and architectural, rather than something that hangs. I think it’s nice to wear something where the garment is the focus, not the body underneath it.   For example, I have a boiled wool cape/poncho piece I wear a lot because it is SQUARE and the neck is a stiff funnel and the sleevey parts stick out at an angle from my arms and that is what you see when you look at it, this interesting shape. It’s impossible to tell what my body looks like at all and I find that comfortable and kind of freeing.   I also love wide-leg pants for the same reason. People see the shape of the pants, not the shape of my thighs and butt.   I have a pretty average-looking body and I just have never enjoyed people noticing it (and frankly, I don’t think it’s very interesting, nor do I feel more attractive when it’s clearly visible.) I just don’t really  *care* if people think my waist isn’t small enough or my butt isn’t big enough or whatever. Especially if I think the piece of clothing I’m wearing is interesting even though it hides my boobs etc. I kind of prefer people to compliment my outfit over how I look in the outfit, idk.
text:This makes a lot of sense. It reminds me of talking to a friend who sews all her own (very structurally rigorous) clothing. She says that she finds it more exciting to hide her body in interesting ways than to look conventionally attractive.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What’s a piece you bought before the pandemic, but haven’t worn a single time since because the occasion has been cancelled/we have literally nowhere to go?	labels:My husband and I flew home from our honeymoon about 12 hours early because everything seemed to be hitting the fan with COVID at home. I still have two lovely cocktail dresses I was going to choose between for a last fancy date. That was sad. But for NYE my sister and I each wore one and put on makeup to make vision boards for 2021. I hope at some point to be able to wear them outside of the house.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop for specific things without google clogging up with items from fast fashion? Or. How do you find the real designer of a fast fashion item?	labels:On Poshmark or eBay, I set a minimum price to filter out the worst of it. On eBay, you can also search specifically for pre-owned items, which might also help depending on what you're looking for. (Vestiaire and TRR have much less of it.)   I generally still get some, but it's much easier to scroll through and look for what I want.	episode_done:True

text:WEEKLY DEALZ	labels:I am still reeling from the Nordstrom rack sales on Everlane items. They are so good. The sneakers are really good quality for 19 bucks, and I do see sizes come back, if you check daily. I bought a pair for myself and a pair for my friend.  I also bought a few clothing items that is taking forever to ship though. I might cancel some of them and wait out the rest. I mean, 30ish bucks for dresses/jumpsuits and 40s for cashmere is a pretty good deal, and it's not like Everlane's style is gonna change much. They sell the same shit year in and year out.

text:Styling suggestions: Have an item you don’t know how to wear?

Don’t know how to wear it because it’s longish and wide, quite a boxy cut, when almost everything else I own is skinny as fuck. It’s also a little more... farmer than my city ass usually goes in for.	episode_done:True
text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:Honestly lululemon. Find a pair that fit you well and with all the features you want and you’ll never turn back. Leg pockets and waist drawstring for me.
text:I haven’t shopped at Lululemon in years (seriously, probably 8 yrs) & I always loved the brand, but fell off the athleisure train.  I went online to order a pair of high rise, plain black, full length leggings hopefully slimming & the product ratings were just so bad that it surprised me and deterred me!  Do you have a specific style that you recommend?!	labels:This question is so subjective! R/lululemon should help you out if you know what you’re looking for in a legging. Aligns are very popular, I love them they don’t slide down and are very smooth, however the quality isn’t as great. Wonder unders are popular too but they come in two fabrics that are very different from one another so you need to watch for that. The ones mentioned above with the side pocket and draw string are invigorates I like these but I find they slide down.
text:The issue with Aligns isn’t the quality. It’s the fact that it’s one of their most delicate fabrics. Most people wear them for workouts, and they’re really only designed to withstand light yoga.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What’s on everyone’s Black Friday wishlists?	labels:I decided that working from home needs to be a luxurious experience lol- so I caved and bought a couple of pairs of silk joggers and some cashmere sweaters/ wraps. Still considering cashmere sweatpants from  off 5th saks.
text:I own a pair of cashmere sweatpants and I never wear them. For some reason it itches and irritates my skin more then tops.  I wear the viscose/cotton mixed knit more.

text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:It’s less about the value of the item and more about the stars aligning perfectly.  I wear a size 12-13W shoe, plus other things that make my feet really hard to fit, so I am used to buying formalwear to match the one maybe two pairs of formal shoes I own at any given time.  So when I was 17 and going to prom in 2006, my mom tried really hard to help me find shoes, any shoes, that were suitable. But we could only find casual flats or runners, and I realllly wanted to dress up nicely for the first real time in my life. So she said “you know what, let’s buy a dress and then we will just have to find a way.”  So I picked out a black and pale pink dress that just made me swoon, and I figured black heels would be easiest to find. Lol I was so young and stupid.  Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn’t find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I’d just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.

text:Tucking in shirts	labels:When I was younger I probably thought it was too dorky. These days I care less and I also realize that it helps me look more proportional by visually shortening my torso and lengthening my legs, so I'd much rather do that. In many cases it's more flattering for me (and maybe for you) because it cinches in my waist a little. I'm short, so it can be tricky to look proportional.  For button-down shirts I normally tuck the front, like a french tuck. Tucking it in all around is usually too formal for me.	episode_done:True
text:Fold VS Hang	labels:It really depends on the garment and it's composition.  Dresses and skirts - hang them.  Shirts/blouses are better hung but can be folded.  Trousers can go either way.  Anything that is going to get fold creases in it I hang.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 27, 2020	labels:Hot take: speaking from experience, fetishistically optimizing the most basic of basics (e.g. "the best plain white t-shirt") for maximum imagined value is not a meaningful nor worthwhile exercise. Your wardrobe is not more interesting because your white tee is better than another white tee, and by the time you've found the 'perfect' piece either the prevailing trend or your own preferences will probably have changed.  'Perfect tee' threads are usually highly-upvoted, but the answers have drawn from the same pool for the last goddamn decade:  - *Vintage/workwear (generally heavier, boxier, shorter):* 3sixteen, Buzz Rickson's, Lady White Co. - *Streetwear (generally lighter, slimmer, longer):* Reigning Champ, wings + horns, John Elliott - *"Normal" (somewhere in the middle)*: Naked & Famous, Arket, American Apparel when they still existed - *Edgy goth shit:* Rick Owens mainline for lighter and DRKSHDW for heavier, Kazuyuki Kumagai Attachment, Voidthebrand when they still existed - *Budget*: Muji, Uniqlo, Everlane, Bella+Canvas, etc., but no one really cares  It's functionally a solved question. You can pick one from the applicable list for your style, and it'll be *fine.*

I put this together from my existing wardrobe, since we didn't want to spend a lot. Covid measures made things a bit weird, but the court officer made a real effort into making it nice, which was great.

text:I want to be that bada*** biCTH (Ik it's spelt wrong, it's meme bro lol sry. Plus idk if we can swear, I don't post) tl;dr at the end cuz I tend to rant :)	labels:You've gotten on the wrong train to self confidence. You're becoming a negotiation between different people, rather than your own self. You're totally focused on your appearance and your clothes as a way to get confidence, but that isn't the way. Body image is not related to the way that you look; study after study has shown that even after drastic appearance changes, most peoples' body image stays the same unless they work on it in other ways. Aim for body neutrality, and focus your efforts on things that will actually give you some level of self confidence. Consider reading the book My Body Is Not An Apology and detoxing your social media from "self-improvement" accounts that are only focused on appearance under the guise of "wellness."   What's your 5 year plan to become independent? What are you doing to become involved in your community? What opportunities have you not considered for your future - from teaching English abroad, to artist residencies, to trade school, to university, and beyond? Whose advice have you sought out? What have you read, and who have you contacted? What inspiring WOC outside the entertainment industry, who are NOT self-help "gurus" or "wellness "inspo", do you follow on your social media? The only thing you have to do now is become who you are. Concentrate on figuring out your values, your hopes, your dreams, etc, in isolation of what other people think. This is hard to do, but it's possible.  Dress however you want. The most common outcome of a teenage girl going on a diet of any kind is that she becomes obese; studies have shown that when compared to overweight teenage girls not put on diets, overweight teenage girls put on diets are much more likely to become obese. Set up healthy habits for yourself, like going to bed at the same time every night and getting an hour of good exercise that you enjoy - whether that's an hour long walk, or walking and jogging, or yoga, or boxing. Literally whatever.	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:Everything about your style sounds fine except crop tops probably aren't a good idea for work even if not a lot of skin is showing..  I would feel it out the first couple weeks
text:Agreed that showing you midriff is inappropriate and a big no no professionally. Even in the epitome of casualness in tech I would caution against it. However, one can wear crop tops without showing skin. You can wear an undershirt and high waisted bottoms (skirt/dress as underlay/pants).   It looks like a crop top if you get the proportions right so that there’s no gap and is work appropriate.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:The Instagram Account Showing “Ivy’s” More Eclectic Side – Put This On	labels:First point; /r/NavyBlazer is cringe because people legitimately think it is a lifestyle. The other day there was a post and some guy said that he should be trusted because;   -	He drives a Subaru -	Plays Lacrosse  -	is from New England  Instead of saying “nice dog”, the people there say “your dog is so NavyBlazer”. It’s really a cesspool.   Ivy is a breakdown of ‘Trad’ style, whichever way you cut it leaves room for interpretation and that’s the beauty of it. The whole point of Ivy style was rebellion. Kids were tired of wearing the same uniform their fathers wore, so they decided to wear their sweaters under jackets, sneakers with ties, etc.

Even if you are size 15, or if you are 5-foot nothing, no one is concerned about your feet in the way that you are. Wear whatever shoes you want; unless they are literal clown shoes or otherwise **intended** to make your feet look larger they will look fine. It's in your head.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you feel about vegan/faux leather?	labels:I’m not a fan tbh. My experience which faux leather is that it does look nice... but not for long because it cracks/peels. Also it’s not very sustainable because it’s made of plastics and has a short lifespan (depending on how regularly it is worn). Real leather on the other hand can have a super long lifespan with proper care, and too me it just looks way nicer because real leather items (like boots and bags) are usually made with more care because it’s a more expensive material. I’ve thrifted all of my leather items too, which is also more sustainable for the environment (and my wallet!)	episode_done:True

text:If you're not concerned with it being Patagonia or future resell value, there are tons of great vintage pullover snap fleeces on ebay from Columbia Sportswear, Penfield, Woolrich, etc. There are some from single location or 90s catalog sportswear stores like Campmor which think are even cooler because it feels like such a relic to have a fleece from a catalog company.	labels:The thing is I’m low key against fleece for environmental reasons but I know Patagonia is the most sustainable one (as far as I know) in regards to making it. I don’t think I’d buy one from another company unless it was at the same level of environmentally friendly as a Patagonia one. Thank you for the recommendations though!
text:I mean, if it's used does environmental production really matter anymore?	labels:I mean when it comes to washing it! Fleece sheds a bunch of tiny fibers when you wash it.
text:Ah, I'm aware of that but I didn't know that Patagonia's fleece was better at not shedding. I thought the primary differences were in production.	labels:It's very unlikely that vintage patagonia fleece sheds any less than other vintage fleece. If shedding microplastics concerns you, washing any polyester garment should be avoided.	episode_done:True

text:I had no idea it was a red pill thing, that's so off-putting. I wonder what attracts them to it specifically?	labels:As someone who was raised in a conservative religious household and who fully bought into the red pill women BS in my much younger years, u/PartyPorpoise hit the nail on the head. And to add to that, fashion for the red pill women isn't about personality, individuality or art or anything avant-garde, it's about looking "hot" as defined by society at large (aka men). The Kibbe system gives a sense of right/good/attractive vs wrong/bad/ugly in fashion. It's about being told how to dress (something I got a lot of from church) rather than discovering one's style for oneself.	episode_done:True
text:"Which Sports Jacket Office Are You?" – Permanent Style	labels:Simon seriously has bespoke Levi's?
text:Yeah. I kinda feel like "bespoke" feels far more pretentious than it is. Frankly, I wear denim almost every damn day so I'd love to get a pair of denim in a fabric I like that I know will fit me really well.   I'd be much more likely to drop the money on "bespoke" denim than a suit, coat, shirt, or shoes frankly.  Simon gets bespoke everything it seems like but I can see the appeal occasionally outside of just being a nerd.  edit: Not to mention that there are specialty denim tailoring services to hem with a chain-stitch, taper with flat-felled seams, take in the waist, etc. etc. If I'm gonna spend ~$400 on some specialty denim I can see putting that money into getting fittings being entirely worthwhile rather than some special Japanese fabric and shuttle loom.

text:Dress shoes EEE trouble	labels:I can relate with you quite a lot because I too must wear eee shoes and have searched for brands that fit my desired style choices and budget. Alas, my recommendations are likely not to be too budget friendly; my favorite company is Alden and my second choice is Allen Edmonds. Both are made in America brands (with AE having some exceptions) and offer a great array of width options ranging from A to EEE.  I have worn AE for nearly three years now with my favorite last being the 201 and the 1757, both of which offer more generous toe boxes and insteps: However, my favorite shoe of all time is the Alden 405 (and the 403) because the last perfectly contours to my natural foot shape. This detail is essential because my right foot is slightly but noticeably wider than my left foot. Of course, none of these suggestions are cheap.   After I graduated from university three years ago I went to my local AE store and was properly fitted. I then searched on Ebay for a proper fit and found a decent pair of AE shoes in my size hoping to buy a new shoe later on to make sure the AE salesperson's great customer service did not go unthanked ( eventually I bought my Dalton boots from her). Then last year, I stumbled upon Shoe Mart's Alden Seconds program, reached out to their customer service team to figure out what my Alden Tru balance size. Soon after, I purchased the Alden 405 and instantly fell in love with it. The arch support is great, the ankle support is superb, and most importantly, the toe box fit like a rugged glove.  I hope my personal experience is of some help. Just keep in mind that buying used is not a bad thing if you put in the effort to properly clean and sterilize each purchase until you save enough to buy a new pair.	episode_done:True

text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:This makes me think of a conversation I had with my husband yesterday - he asked me (on my next run to the thrift store) to pick him up some track pants as his main pair have gotten a hole and it's too cold to run in shorts.  I told him he didn't want to wear thrift store track pants (I have spent many hours digging through the men's and women's sections in our local thrift stores for both of us).    Husband: why not?  Me: Let me put it this way.  Women tend to donate their clothes when they don't *want* them anymore. Men tend donate when they *can't* use them anymore.     Men's clothes don't change as much, and men tend to either wear them until they're ruined or they cannot use them (aka, they gain/lose weight, change jobs, have a spouse donate them, they move and can't store it etc).  So while you can still find good stuff if you really dig, there's way more staining, missing buttons, fading and wear on men's thrift clothes.      My usual score for husband at thrift stores is  (formerly) expensive cashmere and wool sweaters, and occasionally, high quality dress pants and shorts.  Nice jeans and regular shirts are hard to find, and this is probably related to the fact that others have pointed out - men can wear their clothes for 10+ years and still be moderately in style.    As for men's clothes that I wear - I never buy women's socks for work.  Always men's wool and cushioned socks.  Same with any kind of technical under layers for martial arts.  I like the women's designs better, but for some reason they assume the women have no boobs and I'll have 2-3 inches of stomach showing under a rash guard.  So I buy men's.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 08, 2020	labels:Hi! My feet have been freezing recently and I'm trying to pick a pair of inexpensive (sub-$50) house slippers. I'm leaning towards a bootie style to keep as much heat in as possible, and Sherpa or some other warm, fluffy lining. I'm a size 12-13 depending on brand and planning to buy online.   A lot of the Amazon options that show up have mixed reviews and sizing issues so I'm hoping someone here can suggest a brand they like. Again, I'm not leaving the house much and these will just be for inside, so I'm looking for function over fashion (gasp!) on this one.   Thanks!	episode_done:True

I think they are better served for weekends and parties. I have a full range, but I go in waves on wearing them often. If you are more jewelry maximal, having a said of wear every day bracelets and fancy occasion ones is the right wardrobe. But the shapes you should choose vary based on wrist size and preferences. I like cuffs over bangles. And I do not like tennis bracelets, I am not a delicate jewelry person.  Sources?   * local craft events * Coach - bags, occasionally costume jewelry * Kate Spade - I like their whimsical costume jewelry, the bags are OK * I have some fave jewelry stores nearby: Crown Nine, Phillipa Roberts, Esquleto, Cielomar. I tend to like geometric shapes, and not colorful jewelry because I am really colorful in my wardrobe.  I generally don't love shopping on Etsy, it is hard to find the gold amongst all the stuff, I don't like the hunt, I like curated sources. Some things are well made and some things I could have made myself with no training. It is hard to discern based on a shop listing.	episode_done:True

text:Do you feel the black Friday sales better or worse than usually this year? Is it worth to buy clothing you won't wear until next year?	labels:Maybe this is just the stores I'm looking at, but it seems like the new stuff that I'm actually interested in isn't on sale this Black Friday, but everything else that's not as good is 40% off. It's annoying, because splashing a big number like that ("30-50% off the whole site! \*exclusions apply") draws me to their site, but the items I actually want aren't a part of the sale.  The only exception being Levi's because I've been waiting for this 40% off sale to get a pair of Wedgie jeans.   Not going to lie, I did buy quite a few bits from the sales this year but with the intention of returning 90% of it because I don't feel comfortable going into stores to try stuff on. Best to buy everything I want to try on at sale prices then return what I don't want to keep!
text:This has always been something I hated! I also think that Black Friday sales are overblown and actually not that good (for clothes). I typically wait until January to shop for sales because that's when retailers are trying to dump inventory to make their year end numbers look better. (Fiscal year for retailers ends in January and doesn't follow the calendar year.)	labels:Oh that's a good idea! I can reliably count on shops like Madewell, Levi's, Abercrombie & Fitch, etc. to have sales at the end of the season. The only problem is whether or not they'll have my size when the sale happens or if they're sold out of everything except XS and XL...	episode_done:True

Just purchased a huge $900 squash blossom necklace and have worn it constantly. My boots range from $30 for a secondhand pair to $750 for custom made and none are worn more or less than the others.  When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was “saving for good”. Ironically, “good” apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I’m just out running errands.

There won’t be a need to “look” hip or cool because you’ll just...be.	episode_done:True
text:Down Jackets	labels:Maybe not the MOST stylish brand for some but, I've really liked my Feathered Friends Eos down jacket. I mostly use it for winters in Montana where it can reliably be in the negatives on my way to work. Couple mornings we were like second coldest on earth that night at -30F or so. But this thing is crazy warm and extremely light. It's 10.6 oz with 3.7 oz 900+ fill SUPER lofty Canadian down. Premium stuff. They also have other more robust expedition jackets and parkas. Again maybe more of a tech piece than a "flex on 'em" type jacket but I think it looks as good as any Patagonia down jacket. Also gotta add, these guys are the best in terms of their ethics and sustainable practices. They were one of the first adopters of the Responsible Down Standard which ensures the down isn't live plucked and is humanely sourced. And they are made in Seattle, WA (and Vancouver, B.C. now) since '72. Not a paid advertisement lol, just really dig these guys.  \*They also have bedding, pillows, and more famously sleeping bags that are top notch.	episode_done:True

text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:I think it can be useful for someone like you to look back at your favorite trends you've jumped on the bandwagon for. If you were really into cutouts and cold shoulders, maybe your style will end up playing with silhouette and shape a lot. If you loved mom jeans, think something vintage-inspired.

text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:I’ve never considered this.   I love fashion and I have A LOT of clothing. I also routinely sell my clothes on Poshmark when they no longer “bring me joy”. So aside from a number of my favourite pieces and basics, my wardrobe is always changing. My mom was quite interested in fashion as well, and she routinely tells me my thrift store finds look like pieces she owned in the 90’s. We moved across the country when I was young so holding on to them wasn’t really an option. I do have some pieces I don’t ever plan on selling and just holding on to as a time capsule or memory; a few political/ charity sweaters, my first Chanel earrings, the Marc Jacobs sneakers I spent 6 years looking for, a pair of bell bottoms from the 70’s with Coca Cola logos all over them.... I don’t know if I’ll ever have kids or if they’ll be interested in fashion but i can imagine myself as an old lady going through a box of my old favourite things and reminiscing.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else wear one brand only?	labels:I only wear Uniqlo. I became obsessed with the brand when when I lived in Seoul 2007-2009 and it's just kinda followed me since. I move a lot between continents and they always end up having an online shop or a location a few hours' drive away, so off I go when possible. It's often one of the few constants that I get to keep when everything else changes.

text:General Discussion - December 16, 2020	labels:I used to hang out in this subreddit in the mid 2010s, I left for a while and have recently come back and what happened to all the people?? This subreddit feels a lot like a small subreddit now! Has men's fashion just like.. fallen out of interest? Not that I'm really complaining, this subreddit is a lot friendlier and less circlejerky now that it's so much smaller. Just curious if anyone has any insight into why it's become such a seemingly small community.
text:In addition to Flames' great comment below, the number of active users tends to also go down proportionally when subreddits get bigger.	labels:Is this because as sub ages, it stabilizes and then gets less popular?

text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:real question - what's the difference between "capsule" and "uniform"? I have a tendency to wear the same thing, or very similar things
text:Imo a capsule has a relatively low number of items that can be mixed and matched while a uniform could technically mean as many clothes as you like so long as they look similar (think cartoon characters' wardrobes).	labels:	episode_done:True
text:4SDesigns FW21	labels: 4S Designs is a relatively new brand, whose first collection was Fall-Winter 20 as things were going absolutely haywire in the world.  A lot of talent working for the brand, with the key designer being Angelo Urrutia. Angelo worked for the Nepenthes brands and Engineered Garments for god knows how many years (Through FW18 if I remember right?). Angelo is commonly known as Daiki's right-hand man, and from an outside perspective seems to have nearly as much influence in the brand's growth as Daiki has.   4s is definitely a different animal than EG. Still a workwear influence to be sure, but the styling is a little more conventional.   Fabrics are even crazier and much more lux than most of what EG has used - a lot of stuff that seems to be made special for the brand. Chanel-esque lurex-laden tweeds, soft and bulletproof melton, heavy twills, and ventile keep the choices interesting. Similar to EG, there have been many unconventional uses of fabrics.    While I don't think Angelo and team are aiming for the Conceptual collections ala Rick Owens, I think they nail an absolutely wearable aesthetic. Their lookbooks have been "different" but are one of the few brands that are unlikely to alienate people. With that, the details are still interesting enough to keep a normal enthusiast interested.	episode_done:True

It’s really a cesspool.   Ivy is a breakdown of ‘Trad’ style, whichever way you cut it leaves room for interpretation and that’s the beauty of it. The whole point of Ivy style was rebellion. Kids were tired of wearing the same uniform their fathers wore, so they decided to wear their sweaters under jackets, sneakers with ties, etc.

I can be super picky when it comes to clothes. I know exactly what I want and what would look good on me but it's hard to find both in stores with a limited selection but it's also hard in the endless sea of clothes that is Poshmark/ThreadUp.   Sometimes online shopping makes it easier to filter things out but other times it makes things harder and not being able to try it on is a huge downside. I have so many things from Poshmark that I've just donated because I didn't like the fabric or the fit.   What don't you love about the clothes out there you're seeing right now?

I used to walk by shops and be unable to decide which items I wanted to take home cause i thought everything was cute, and then end up with a closet full of stuff I hardly wore or felt embarrassed by later lol. Ive become much more selective and comfortable with the pieces I do choose to invest in, and dont think much about whether or not it's in style.  I still get compliments from younger and older people so I don't *think* I look outdated or backwards, but I dont care if I do, either, haha	episode_done:True
text:Advice needed - Nordstroms Out of Stock items	labels:Since the post is being left up for general discussion I also want to throw out that if something sells out because it’s on a good sale you can bookmark the page and keep checking it to see when/if someone returns it.

text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it’s typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it’s a bottom, they no longer “stay up”. This usually happens with leggings or panties after about 5 or more years of regular wear with caring for the items properly.  I also had a faux leather jacket wear out after 6 years of regular wear. The faux leather ended up “peeling off” or something like that.
text:I just had a jacket peel like that. I'm bummed bc it was one of my favorites. I'd like to try and stop the peeling if I can so I've been hanging on to it and not wearing it!	labels:Same, I loved that jacket so much! Found a duplicate on Poshmark fortunately.	episode_done:True

Appreciating the Arc'teryx brand very much btw, thanks for the shared info here!

Thrift stores are great and I sometimes have the energy to dig through the esoteric offerings they have, but a well-curated consignment shop, especially an independent one is great for the community, great for sellers, great for the environment and great for me. So long as store owners are conscientious when examining the pieces they accept in-store, and are reasonable when they do the pricing, I think consignment shopping is the ideal shopping experience for me. I can find excellent condition, unique pieces from a variety of brands, at different price points - at price points far below what it would cost retail.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 19, 2021	labels:I never thought I'd become this person, but man, shipping costs really can fuck up my desire to buy something. I was just about to commit to buying another pair of sneakers and it's probably the best deal I'm going to find on them, added to cart, shipping info entered, billing info entered... $20 for the cheapest shipping option. No shipping codes available, no threshold I can cross to get free shipping. $20 period, no exceptions.  It's a $300 pair of sneakers discounted to $180, I guess should be able to rationalize that at $200 (including shipping), I'm still getting a better deal than what's available anywhere else online (only a few select retailers got this colorway, and all but one are sold out in my size), but still, $20 shipping feels *wrong*. My brain has been trained from years of online shopping that there should always be some way to get around paying for shipping, or otherwise, shipping should be cheap.

text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:A few tips that work for me in thrift stores: - I pick one section and don't feel like i have to check out the entire store.  - I go through racks and touch everything and stop when I touch something that feels like a nice fabric - silk, cashmere, good wool, crisp cotton. This helps me get to the nice stuff when the racks are visually overwhelming. - try on lots of things! Sometimes you fall in love with stuff you didn't expect to.   On websites that are searchable: - have a very specific item in mind or a specific brand you like - narrow the search results by size, brand, color, and fabric - pay attention to the measurements to see if things will fit - don't be afraid to make low offers on sites where you can do that  I find online thrifting very different than in-store thrifting, because online, you can search for all kinds of specific things, where in a store, most of the fun comes from finding something unexpected.
text:Second on feeling fabrics quickly. If I feel a fabric that seems decent I’ll go look at the tags, what materials its comprised of, and what country it was made in. I don’t discriminate necessarily by country, but if it’s a fabric I’m not entirely sold on and it says “Made in China”, I’ll pass. If it’s a great fabric and it says “Made in China”, I’m fine with it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Grad/Masters Fashion Program Reality?	labels:If your goal is to start your own brand or become a fashion designer, or work in the fashion industry on the design and creative side, a marketing degree is an order of magnitude more valuable than a fashion design degree (granted, it should ideally be from a fashion school or a highly respected school). Everyone and their born-rich roommate in NYC has a fashion design degree just because they're interested in fashion and didn't know what to study in uni. In these industries with oversupply of graduates (who are willing to work for less than you), your goal should be to be significantly more valuable than your competitors. Having a marketing double major is one way, though it's also not very uncommon and you will still have significant competition.
text:Well see that’s my issue, I’m going to a general California State College Not an Art College. So even though I’m getting these doubles majors they’re not from a “good name school”.  I’m just at a crossroads, either I can grind out this double major (1.5 years) at my state school  Or transfer right away to PRATT or FIT, directly for fashion.

text:Words to live by tbh. Would rather be overdressed than underdressed any day, just means you'll stand out more and be more noticable. There isnt enough time in the world to look drab in my opinion.   People will rarely hate on an over-the-top look, and I usually get way more compliments with them.

I miss going to the office and feeling cute, and being seen by others. A woman I work with told me ‘you always have the cutest dresses’ about a year ago and I absolutely loved hearing that. I’ve learned in quarantine that I don’t dress for myself, I dress for other people.   I’ll probably dress up a bit more when I can go back and wear more lipstick, since I’ve been in comfy slouch mode for so long.
text:I’m exactly the same. I had a Rent the Runway unlimited membership that I used mainly for playing around with my work style. There were stretches of weeks if not months where I don’t think I wore any of my own clothes. I would legit be a little disappointed if I didn’t get some sort of comment about my outfit every day.   I’m not going back until at least next September and RTR Unlimited is going away so I have no idea what my style will be when I go back.

RL Polo iteration one happens in 67' , RRL comes in 93', and then Purple label is in 94', but over the years I think the gap in quality has really widened sadly.
text:Agreed. RRL has changed and isn't what it used to be. I've at least seen that with their jeans. I'd much rather pay less and pick up a lightly used pair from a decade ago rather than something new. I'm not familiar with their recent leather products, though.	labels:Interesting, I always hear RRL as the grail brand
text:Designs are grail, but honestly the feel is not that great for the money. It also feels kinda funny buying made in India/China stuff with purely American heritage designs for x2-x4 times the price of many other repro brands.  Not to say that designs don't absolutely rip. I love em, but I probably will always go with it's vintage counter part or another brand in general.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Where do you find inspiration for your Outfits?	labels:I use Pinterest, but, I follow the people I get inspired by. So, for me, that’s Blair Eadie, Keiko Lynn, Coury Combs, Wendy Nguyen and some others. I start pinning their outfits I like and then Pinterest uses their algorithm to show similar outfits to what I pinned. So,if it sees that I pinned a photo of an outfit with a pink coat, it will show outfits with pink coats. So, go in mind with what you like, and then Pinterest will start figuring you out.	episode_done:True

text:TheRealReal x Gucci	labels:It’s not generous. $1 for items priced $300-$15000? They have a huge margin.   Also, the Real Real regularly puts the market price/retail price for goods higher than they actually are so that the goods are only a few dollars cheaper than new.   I’m sure people can find deals from time to time but I’m not a fan of the site.
text:I find TheRealReal useful for a few things - my Mary Katrantzou love has been well served! - but they selling things like Outdoor Voices for literally the same as retail AND you'd have to pay their shipping costs which would exceed how much it costs to get it from OV.  Def only useful for *very* specific things.   If I use them, I try to only go for designers not super popular for replicas because they've consistently been lax about checking for authenticity and if I want better replicas I might as well go on Taobao or WeChat.	labels:I’ve gotten some amazing deals - but it depends what you’re looking for. I don’t find deals on Chanel or Gucci but other brands be it shoes, bags or clothing are pretty good. Scarves too as long as it’s not Hermès. I also watch stuff for long periods of time and wait til they drop several times.	episode_done:True

Once in a while I will pick up a cheap item that’s not ethically sourced, but I have found that I can now cover most of my clothing needs without cluttering my wardrobe with a bunch of fast fashion. The two brands I mention are still reasonably priced, with most items between $100 and $200.	episode_done:True

text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:It depends on the item. Underwear, socks, and face masks get washed after every wear. Jeans get washed about 3 times a year. Wool gets washed once it starts to smell funky. If I don’t really sweat, shirts and blouses get washed every 2-4 wears. So I do a load of laundry whenever I have enough things dirty to do at least half a load. This is usually every 2 weeks for me.	episode_done:True

text:This so much. Especially when I've been browsing for way too long, I can get a tunnel view of "just adding this, and oh this is also nice". Bookmarking and then leaving things for a day or two really helps against impulse buys.  I also have a list of things that I feel are missing (eg. in winter I notice again and again that I don't have a warm scarf that works with several of my outfits -> specific colored scarf goes onto the list). With that I can still enjoy browsing for new stuff, but I know I'm actually closing gaps in my wardrobe when I buy things, not just amass new stuff (which of course can also be fun...)	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 30, 2020	labels:hey all. it's been at least 3+ years since I've looked at this subreddit. Lost my old account, but remembered this place exists. What happened? I remember WAWYT threads and the front page being super active, now I see posts with barely any comments and posts from 3 days ago on the front page.  This used to be *the* subreddit to be on with over 2 million subs. Maybe it was because I was most active from like 2012-2016 where hashtag menswear with clark desert boots and americana was huge, and a cultural shift of men wanting to learn how to dress better was occurring. Stuff like the MFA uniform coming out, comments of how people outside of California or NY were labeled as gay because they wanted to dress better lol.   Now it seems as if most men want to look good and dress better. And there are more resources besides this subreddit to help people dress better? It's less of a niche and now a societal norm? Or maybe it's just because it's 9 am where I live and people are still waking up lol.  What are your thoughts? Am I out of touch? Am I just too early? I've seen /r/malefashion is a lot more active.
text:To add to everyone else, a lot of fashion discussion has moved from forums to instagram.

text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:I used to have teal pants I wore all the time. I have been looking for pink, berry, or mustard yellow pants all year and I haven't found a pair yet. The only colored pant I have now, is a hot pink satin jogger. But haven't had a lot of chances to wear them as special occasion pants , I got them end of last year and wore them twice out and once at home.   In the teal pant era (this was a long time ago) I wore them with my myriad of black and white tops - this is one of my faves. And also color blocking! If I can recall, I wore them with chartreuse, yellow, and pastel blues and greens. And light grey.   I love color blocking and often have had colorful bottoms, I just mixed them with whatever colors I felt were complementary. I had a couple of cobalt blue skirts, and I think some pants as well. This color goes well with just about any bright. I wore these with pinks, greens, and yellows.   In my brain, mustard yellow is a neutral, so it goes with basically everything. Hot pink pants - this for me, in my wardrobe, works with other shades of pink, maybe burgundy, grey, and yellow. I do to have many other colors outside of these, so that is what I wear. I also like pink with greens.   I say pull out your color wheel and see which pairing you like. You do not need to be limited to neutrals.	episode_done:True
text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:I think /u/Ghoticptox pretty much summed it up perfectly, nothing to really add. I personally have no interest in bespoke because I value design more than minuscule fit details, I think this sub has a tendency to overemphasize how important fit actually is, especially considering how nebulous of a concept “good fit” even is.  Like, the fit “issues” you highlighted,   >shoulder tiny bit broad in one coat, a little extra material in the waist of another.  Are complete non issues to me, that’s just variance in fit and design, I wouldn’t blink at that on a piece I otherwise really love.  The more important thing to me, and I can’t believe no one else has mentioned this yet, your friend got into clothing a couple months ago, he doesn’t even know what he likes, it sounds like, and I mean this judgement free, he’s just going around looking for the most expensive thing he can find, I don’t think we’d recommend anyone go and buy a $4000 coat right as they’re getting into fashion. Like, is he rich enough that he can afford to make that work or rich enough that it literally doesn’t matter? Because I think unless $4000 is something you can spend in a day and not blink itms probably not a good idea to go and drop $4000 and a true bespoke coat when he could end up getting into streetwear in 3 months and never wear it again. At least in that case something like YSL will retain value better and can be sold for more, as opposed to a lot of traditional tailoring brands, which go for pennies on the dollar on the used market	episode_done:True
text:Can we talk sleepwear?	labels:I was very into this idea as well and invested in some Lunya PJs...but that elegant person I invisioned didn't magically appear. I still had a big messy bun, acne patches on my face and slept with my mouth wiiide open. I didn't feel as comfortable in those PJs and that fantasy I had didn't come true, ya know? I don't want to discourage you, just my two cents as someone who had a very similar thought process  I went back to tank tops and sweatpants and I find I appreciate them a lot more now. I make sure they fit properly and don't have stains or holes so I still feel reasonably put together.
text:THIS. I have been working on a lot of \~self improvement\~ this year and part of making my goals for 2021 has been distinguishing "the person I aspire to be" from "the person I am willing to be" from "the person I can afford to be."   I too have been on a journey to live a budget life of luxury especially when it comes to things like matching lingerie all the time and sleepwear and what I've realized is that I'm not actually interested in luxurious sleepwear. I'm actually interested in being the person that has two hours to unwind every night, takes a warm bath in a massive tub with a v expensive lush bath bomb, does a full face care routine, brushes her hair out, has little tinctures on her vanity to apply just a bit of perfume, puts on a silk gown, lights a candle, reads in bed, and turns out her lamp at a generous 9:30pm.   The truth is that the desire for the sleepwear is really a desire to have more silence, more time spent on me, and more time doing things that look and feel good simply because I like them and not because they serve any kind of real function.   I have moved away from using old t-shirts because I like the idea of dedicated sleepwear but I usually just go with a solid color cami / tank top / shirt and either some shorts or some sweat pants depending on how cold it is. They're cheaper but still look thoughtful.	labels:>part of making my goals for 2021 has been distinguishing "the person I aspire to be" from "the person I am willing to be" from "the person I can afford to be."   I need to frame this and put it on my wall.  Love your bedtime routine. Also want to mention that I have decided that decent black panties (like the 6-pack from H&M) match all the bras.

I have all kinds of office appropriate slacks and cardigans and button up shirts in cutesy patterns, casual jeans and sensible shoes. I want to wear plastic corsets and fluorescent clip in braids and platform combat boots.

Back when she was working, I did help her pick some clothes and shoes so it was always flattering when her coworkers thought something she wore was 'cool'.

I tried to stick to cold colors (which suit me best) for a while, but then I got bored, and now I wear warm as well.	episode_done:True

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:Short of getting a bit of insider info, I think the only way to really have success at those stores is to browse them at least once a week (probably twice).  My aunt tends to go every other day and finds some amazing stuff…because she goes *every other day*.  She says it doesn’t take her long because she’s so familiar with their stock, but it still seems exhausting to me.  (As opposed to spending three hours scrolling through Poshmark in bed every night…)
text:You kinda skim over things. I usually go straight to the skin care and makeup. I always find a few things that are a fraction of the price. Becca foundations for $10 or Anastasia lip products for $8.   Then to organizational stuff, kitchen gadgets, bedding and as I’m going im looking out for anything that catches my eye in the women’s clothing section.

text:Naked and Famous Raw Denim Review/Fit/Experience	labels:It's a bit pricey but one option is having jeans altered to fit. Either by a competent tailor who is willing to **alter from the inseam** (and preserve the selvedge outseam) or a speciality shop like Railcar Fine Goods that you can mail your jeans to. RFG lets you take in the waist by up to 2" and you can specify your preferred thigh, knee, opening, length down to the quarter inch. I'm a guy with meaningful waist and hip/seat divergence, though not nearly a 10" difference like many women, and have relied on RFG to fix some issues. There are other shops in the U.S./Canada that do similar and similarly good work. RFG also carries women's cuts.  Just want to note that with 100& cotton / non-stretch fabric, you won't be able to have a super narrow leg opening since it'll be impossible to put your legs through. Relatedly, it's not the same, but maybe you can get your raw denim fix in the form of a jacket? Potentially not a Type 3 depending on your chest measurements but various other jacket iterations might be easier to size for.	episode_done:True

text:What are you planning on getting rid of this year?	labels:In the last few weeks, I have either sold or donated all of my denim save for one pair (for working outside, on the car, etc.).

text:Covid Dilemna - Finding my style	labels:I got to do some of this in store, and honestly that was a lot easier. But when the stores closed, I ordered stuff online and tried it on at home. I ordered from Zalando, which has a ton of different brands and free returns. Trying clothes at home was pretty nice, because I could take it in for as long as I wanted, get back to some stuff on a different day and pair the new clothes with my own to see if it made a good outfit.   When you're just starting out though, it's important to actually try out a lot of different things. Don't focus on clothes you might want to buy, just get some plain things with different necklines, fits and materials to see what looks good and what doesn't.  Once you have narrowed that down, you can look for more interesting stuff that actually fits your style. So if you do this by ordering online, make sure returns are easy.   If ordering online is not an option, maybe you can borrow some clothes somewhere? Shirts, dresses and skirts also can be pinned to change their shape. And if you have old clothes you don't wear anymore you could cut them into a different fit. Things like cutting a crew neck shirt into a V-neck or a maxi dress into a midi or mini, or shortening sleeves. If you're handy with photoshop or something, you could even try that.
text:These are really great ideas. Not sure I'm comfortable cutting clothes. Everytime I've tried to DIY an outfit, it come out horrible lol.

In 1-2 years you will buy new clothes in your new country pretty much no matter what.    Test pack and use vacuum bags to get extra room. Leave behind anything bulky and if you really miss it, arrange for someone to ship it to you. Do all the other usual travel tips like wear your bulkiest stuff on the plane.

text:Handbag conundrum: lesser know (and lesser seen all over the place) or standard luxury designer bags (think the usual Gucci, YSL, LV, etc.)	labels:Definitely buy what makes you happy. The fact that you have looked at the high end, well known brands and came away disappointed indicates that (this season at least), they aren't for you.   To answer your question directly: for me, personally, showing my own style is 1000% more important than showing the status of a luxury brand. Do the two sometimes overlap? Yes, and that's fine. But I don't personally get buying something *just* because it is a certain brand. Who are you trying to impress? What are you conveying with that logo (wow, you're well off? What kind of message is that, on its own?) I just feel like people who are super into labels, not the design or the style or anything else, just come across as kind of immature? The truth is, anyone worth spending much time with isn't overly concerned with what logo your bag has. (Now! I will concede there is a difference between showing off luxury brands and having higher end items, in some circles. Like, there could be some tension if you're hanging out with super millionaire socialites and everything you wear is from TJ Maxx...but in that case, I'd still say its important to focus on personal style first. And knowing about smaller higher end designers, rather than designers you can buy at a mall, is a whole different thing too...)
text:I feel like showing off the logo is more of a poor person trying to look rich thing. Truly wealthy people don't try to show off like that. Also, a lot of the purses with very prominent logos are fugly.	labels:Truly wealthy people wear whatever they want because they don't have anything to prove or disprove. The Kardashians are very rich yet they have no problem wearing leggings and a t-shirt or being all decked out in Balmain, Gucci, LV.
text:100% this. This whole "truly wealthy people are classy" narrative that's so popular here is so incorrect.	labels:Another commenter mentioned “old money/new money” but I think it has more to do with “celebrity” vs. “wealthy but not a celebrity.” Someone who got rich off real estate investing or lucked out in the stock market or has a career as a stock broker is going to treat their wardrobe very differently than someone who is in the spotlight constantly and has made their money largely based on their own personal appearance/styling/brand.	episode_done:True

text:For the parents of girls	labels:My mom and dad bought all my clothes until I got a job and started buying all my own stuff. My mom dressed me until I was about 9 or 10 and then I started picking my own outfits. My mom and I have very similar body types, but somehow my dad was, and still is, better at finding things that fit me nicely. My mom never really pushed her personal style on me and my sister, even though she bought and picked out 99% of our clothes growing up because it’s just hard to find little girls clothes that are the same style as women’s. My dad just liked to go in stores on a whim and ask employees what was in style at the moment, so he picked out some pretty good things.
text:I love that your dad was so involved!	labels:He still is! Even though my sister and I are 17 and 19 and have jobs, he still buys us things he finds on eBay for cheap when he’s bored at work. My sister and I love fashion now so we talk about it a lot and he has picked up on our favorite brands, the ones he remembers best are Free People and Zara. It’s so funny when he’s opening his packages of car parts and archery supplies and opens up a dress or jeans that he forgot he bought for us lol.	episode_done:True

text:I want to be that bada*** biCTH (Ik it's spelt wrong, it's meme bro lol sry. Plus idk if we can swear, I don't post) tl;dr at the end cuz I tend to rant :)	labels:The confidence comes with time. Buy what you like, wear it were you are feel safe. You might start by just wearing it around your room. Taking selfies and such. Get a feel for how you wear the clothes for yourself. Eventually start pushing your boundaries a little. Be paciente with yourself  This will get easier as you get older, think of your age as an advantage for your adventure not a hindrance. Do the same thing with your body. When I was your age, I was self-conscious of my big butt and thighs. Now they are in style.  You are enough as is
text:Aw thank you :). You're really sweet. Maybe the age thing is an advantage because who when they are my age really knows/knew what they like lol. I think that is a good idea, just to take things slow because I was gonna just jump into it but I don't think I'm ready for that quite yet.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Casual Blazer Inspo	labels:I love blazers/fits like this. The framing  a lapel gives it almost forces your gaze inwards and the work wear connotations in most of these fits gives you license to go really rough on the textures which I also really enjoy seeing and wearing.   The paraboots and Chunky boots really help keep the rest of the outfit casual yet a little bit more formal than sneakers and I just enjoy the look of that footwear.   Having said all that fit 14 (I think lol) with the slim black jeans and Chelseas is prolly one of my favorite I love when the lapels stand like that it gives so much more structure/visual interest than if they are just lying flat	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 03, 2021	labels:Done a lot of thinking about my wardrobe and the amount of clothes I own and I think I’m gonna go through and pick a bunch of clothes to donate tonight.   I think it’s time I let the thrifting and g r a p h i c t e e life go for a bit. I own way too many band shirts and shit that I just don’t wear anymore. I need to suck it up and start investing in my wardrobe to get it to a place I want it to be instead of buying a ton of shitty bandaids for 8 bucks a pop at thrift stores. Time to be a big boy and learn to go for a few expensive pieces instead of a ton of cheap ones.   Wish me luck lads.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 26, 2020	labels:I bought a pair of Bottega Veneta low Tire chelsea boots, and the leather started separating from the sole after a week of wear.      Has anyone else had such experiences with this kind of shoe or other Bottega products? I had to get it returned because my retailer was out of my size entirely, and my next option is SSENSE, which is significantly more expensive. I felt extremely confident in them, but I'm not sure I should shell out the dough if their products are crappy on the whole.	episode_done:True
text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I have no idea how many total pieces I have. I counted black dresses recently and I had 18.
text:I need a new black dress so bad, so I am jealous. I counted the one I am going to make in my dresses count.	labels:Haha yes I’m not sure I want to know the number either.

text:Plants and Fashion: A Marriage of Obsessions	labels:I love plants, and really enjoy leaf as a print in addition to florals. I think it’s nice to pull from nature besides flowers. However, I can’t stand the prints of monsteras on everything. To me it feels a bit lazy and literally just sticking it on because they know plants are popular now. the monsters pieces I’ve seen have not seemed thoughtful in the pattern choice. Anyone else feeling that?   I think a lot of it will burn itself out as a fad, but hope the fun prints with leaves and different florals stick around a bit longer.

text:Just how revolutionary is Harry Styles’ Vogue cover?	labels:I like the gesture a lot and things like this make me as a queer person feel more safe...  *however*, that doesn't stop me from saying I think this shoot was poorly styled. The looks just don't do it for me and in some ways they look incomplete. It looks like he decided to wear a dress the day he showed up to the shoot. It just seems, for lack of a better term, lazy. Like they didn't really care what this meant. He needed more hair and makeup work in my opinion. Something to make people look at it and be like "wow, he looks really pretty and I bet he feels it”  or some eye color would've pulled the whole thing together. Or a pretty necklace! I think lacking these little details is why people will say he didn't pull it off and is sort of a let down considering what this symbolizes. Open to hearing from other people who support the look, tho
text:I agree with the other guy. The styling is supposed to make him look masculine and casual in women's clothing. He already walks the red carpet in Womenswear regularly in many ways an elegant look would be less groundbreaking.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:MFA Wearing Big Coats	labels:This season, I’m seeing a lot of people, from all walks of life, all genders, wearing plaid overcoats (I’m in NYC). Most that I see are grey, and the patterns are big and bold (as opposed to, say, micro-houndstooth) with a little bit of color splashed in. And ya know what? I totally dig it! Very cool. I’ve got a few pretty low end overcoats (J Crew, Jos A Bank, Kenneth Cole) but my favorite has always been my plaid Hart Schaffner Marx. Now I can feel all zeitgeisty when I rock it down the block.	episode_done:True

text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:About a year ago (I think), Sandro was selling a white T-shirt with red block letters that said, “WOMEN WOMEN WOMEN”. I loved it when I saw it, so I went online to get it but it was sold out in my size.   A few months later, my cousin wanted to go to this outlet mall La Vallée Village, and she asked me to come along. There, I found that shirt in my size, for half price. :)	episode_done:True

text:How has lockdown affected new purchases?	labels:Lots more free time and boredom has meant way more time spent looking at and buying clothes. Also spent more time considering my personal style than ever before.  Also covid related weight gain meant a culling of my closet for clothes that fit. I went from working on my feet for 10++ hours a day with MAYBE 1 full meal to sitting around and eating 3 meals a day. I'm still buying clothes I tell myself that I'll be going out in but it's mostly for me to dress around the house.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone take their “power color” really seriously? Basing a whole wardrobe around one color - not just choosing an accent color for a neutral capsule?	labels:It sounds very eye catching and unique tbh. I’d say go for it. Even if you thought it was overwhelming, you could break it up by adding a contrasting colored accessory. That way the eye is forced to divert to something other than the main color.	episode_done:True
text:Just singing the praises of wool	labels:Darn Tough does this amazing sock sale annually (except this train wreck of a year) in November on factory site in VT.

text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I moved from a tropical climate to a place with seasons and my style totally changed! Now I loveeee dressing up for colder weather (even though I hate the cold) and have neglected my summer style.  I think my style before was really based on the culture of where I lived - super beachy and low effort. Moving to a bigger city helped me develop my own style.	episode_done:True
text:Excercises for personal style	labels:Friends helped me narrow my style over the years. The most important is knowing what Looks Good on you. I love many pieces that don't fit my body. Someone had to help me by pointing out things that look bad & good. I also dressed way too conservatively for my shape and situations. They had to help show me - it's ok:)   Now I'm confident in my choices and help others. A clue that you're on the right track is when people compliment what you are wearing- not just what it is but how the color/style suits  you. Or the way you put it together. Complimenting other people is not only a nice, decent thing to do, it's also a good way to get them talking about clothes/styles/etc.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 09, 2021	labels:Are zip up hoodies still in style? What's popular?
text:I think a non zip hoodie is a universally better option.

Stick to simple cotton if you really prefer a zip up over a pull over.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Best way to buy clothes locally?	labels:I shop at locally owned businesses, I go to thrift stores, and I follow local artisans to shop for their products.   &#x200B;  I'm a bit confused as to why it is hard for you to find anything unless you live in a town that only has chain stores
text:I should have clarified. There a ton of small businesses in my city, but I have to visit their sites one by one. Which takes forever. Is there a Nordstrom or Zara for buying local?	labels:not really - that's why a lot of people just take the convenience of buying from chain stores versus supporting local businesses. It takes a bit more effort, and you maybe need to think a bit more about the pieces you are buying, but it isn't really hard.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 04	labels:Is it obsessive to get a jacket in another color?

This year the green was olvie but had a darker portion on the sleeves which looked sleek so i got it too.  I dont really need another jacket but is 20 bucks and i generally dont get everything in every color.  I guess I feel a bit guilty, cause i do have a lot of clothes but i have a closet that isn't even entirely filled so...  i feel like a few things it's okay as long as it isn't everything?  the greens are diff imo, quite diff but def both "green".

I hate fast fashion jewelry because it ruins so quickly and dont buy it, so i enjoy hunting for the perfect piece for each special occasion. Over time other family members have also gifted me nice pieces (new and heirloom) because my family knows how much I enjoy them.

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:I second what everyone said about buying stuff secondhand, but just want to add, if you’re going to buy something from a fast fashion store, only buy it with as high a percent of natural fibers as possible. 100% cotton/silk/linen/wool/leather etc. The items will last longer and will look/feel better. Otherwise, you’re buying plastic clothing.	episode_done:True

I doubt every fifth post in the Funko Pop subreddit is about curbing consumption and how they should be rethinking their involvement in a plastics based interest.

text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:These kinds of dresses are really popular in Japan as casual wear. Many women will wear them around the house or just to run Errands. Often they are worn with leggings for a comfortable look with the fit often being slightly oversize. This is possibly as close as we will get to comfort fashion/athleisure in Japan. The style borders with the Mori girl (forest girl) look which favors loose dresses in natural fabrics.   &#x200B;  Look at shops like Uniqlo or Muji - the womenswear section always has a few in stock all year round. I myself own quite a few of these type dresses to wear at home, on weekends and to work.  &#x200B;  In my office today, all the women are wearing some sort of loose fit dress because it is hot as balls outside.	episode_done:True

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.
text:I feel this to a degree. When I was a teen, I dressed super goth/punk but hadn’t come to terms with my sexuality yet. In high school, I got hit on by all the out lesbians and had to constantly explain I was straight. I didn’t figure out I was bi with, like, a super strong leaning towards women until I got to college and my style was very college boho/stoner/art student at a liberal arts college (peasant skirts every day!) My hair was down to my bra line and all the ladies stopped hitting on me.   I kept telling myself after every date with a guy that my next relationship was finally going to be a woman, but only guys ever seemed to hit on me :(   I’m still not sure how I should have dressed in 2005 to attract the ladies but it definitely wasn’t what I was doing.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:WEEKLY DEALZ	labels:I am still reeling from the Nordstrom rack sales on Everlane items. They are so good. The sneakers are really good quality for 19 bucks, and I do see sizes come back, if you check daily. I bought a pair for myself and a pair for my friend.  I also bought a few clothing items that is taking forever to ship though. I might cancel some of them and wait out the rest. I mean, 30ish bucks for dresses/jumpsuits and 40s for cashmere is a pretty good deal, and it's not like Everlane's style is gonna change much. They sell the same shit year in and year out.

text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:I think it's pretty outdated, but I don't see anything wrong with her saying she dresses for men, if that's in fact what she was doing. There are bits in here that aren't that different than what I hear people say/read on a regular basis:  > I don’t think I could dress like the illustrations in the high – fashion magazines. For that you require what is thought as a Vogueish figure , and is, I believe, a boyish type figure and I don’t have a boyish figure.   Pretty similar to the idea that women with straighter figures can wear clothing or particular shapes that aren't traditionally feminine, but curvier women need to wear clothing that shows their curves or end up looking fat.  > You have to be friends with your clothes if you’re going to dress for men – no too tight zippers or unnecessary doodads to make you uncomfortable! Sometimes their acceptance is just in their response, but the response tells me I am right.   I've heard this often enough: (straight) men don't appreciate complicated clothing, they don't like clothing that isn't "flattering" but might be aesthetically interesting.   I think a lot of the article's pretty silly from a modern perspective and has some eye-roll inducing lines about women not liking her clothing. However, it's not like (some) women don't dress for men at all any more. I don't think her opinions are that unusual, she's just putting them in a way that doesn't sound right for modern readers, especially because hardly anyone actually *says* they dress for men, even when they do. I don't care to dress the way MM did, and I don't share her opinions, but I also think she's conscious of playing a role here.
text:I think it’s so weird that people are saying she’s so outdated and misogynistic for saying she dresses for men when, by the way she describes it, most women still do. So many of the commenters here do the same as her, they just say, “I dress for myself in the context of modern fashion and culture which still is influenced by the male gaze”. I don’t see anything wrong with it besides the self delusion that these people are wearing makeup and heels just for themselves instead of the reactions they get from others. It’s the same thing! She just said it differently/ more straightforwardly. I do it too when I feel like and have zero shame. It’s fun to dress for men you like if you’re a straight woman.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Coveteur: An Ode to the Striped Shirt	labels:I have had to ban myself from buying stripes, because otherwise my wardrobe would be essentially nothing *but* stripes. I am instantly attracted to anything with a stripe pattern when approaching a clothing rack.  My favorite is a circa 2011 mid-weight JCrew sweater with exposed half back zip. It is a blocky horizontal stripe with matte black/off-white and has a nice slouchy drape for being kind of a stiff cottony material. I actually bought three more of them on eBay when I noticed my original was starting to fall apart, because I didn't want to be without  😅	episode_done:True

text:Hiking Aesthetic - Functionality vs. Fashion	labels:I wear my yoga clothes with hiking boots and a Patagonia fleece in the summer and fall, Patagonia Radalie jacket in the winter. My friend has a UV protection shirt (REI house brand) which she wears due to the intense UV rays in Colorado. It doesn’t make her feel hot most days. I mostly thrift my yoga/hiking clothes, and really like thrifted Lululemon. Although I hike and do yoga frequently, I won’t buy Lululemon full price when there are so many used gear stores near me. I buy Zella leggings also for both activities. My hiking boots are currently Oboz, my trail running shoes are Asics, and I have heard good things about Salomon hiking boots. Fjallraven has very nice beanies for colder weather.  I definitely say fashion takes a backseat to function for hiking, as you primarily want to be comfortable, however, living in the mountain west, I want to look nice during an activity I do about once weekly, so fashion is at least a consideration for me.  (Edit) You can absolutely hike in your everyday clothing, and I have seen people hike 14,000 foot mountains in gym shorts and a T shirt. As long as your boots and socks are solid and the rest is easy to move in, you’re honestly good to go.
text:I love Salomon for Hiking boots, trail runners, ski boots, literally everything. I also love the Adv Skin 5 Hydration Pack :)   I've started wearing trail runners for day hikes and I like how much lighter they are as well as how quickly they dry (not having to take them off for stream crossings is huge). Granted I don't have any issues with ankle mobility and I consider myself to be pretty coordinated where I don't need hiking boots to help with stability if I'm not doing a longer trip.  The point about thrifted Lululemon is solid as well. I have leggings that have held up for 10 years now, and I recently bought a pair of yoga shorts from the brand and they're pilling like crazy, while the old ones I have look newer than the new pair.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Drake's | January 16, 2021	labels:I really love my items from Drake's (pretty much all bought on sale). I have a red lambswool jumper with a high crew neck, which isn't the easiest to wear with shirts but would be okay if it had a high enough collar. Had to have it repaired (didn't notice holes in the factory shop) and the repair was excellent - knew where the holes were and had trouble finding them still. I have a selection of neckties from Drake's which I haven't had a chance to wear yet but they have a nice heft and they feel lovely. I also have a purple 70% cashmere 30% silk scarf which is absolutely wonderful to wear.
text:One thing I really want to highlight with Drake's is that while the value proposition is reduced in terms of the items themselves (e.g. soft shouldered tweed jackets, etc) due to new competitors, Michael Hill's eye for colour is still one of the best in the game. His choice of pattern is amazing too, striking just the right balance between stodgy and kitschy to achieve a real sense of fun and enjoyment out of a more dressed up look.	labels:An example of this is the first Drake's shirt I bought - a cranberry + white university stripe oxford shirt. I stumbled across it in their London shop on sale 5 or so years ago in the dead of summer, and in the subsequent years have appreciated how many things it goes with - sure navy sport coats, but also greys, greens and browns all can work as well.     I bought it because it was beautiful and well constructed, but over time I have come to appreciate how versatile it is, when "cranberry and white stripes" probably wouldn't make many "Top 10 Shirts for Work" lists	episode_done:True
text:Any experiences with Wonder Wardrobe or other online courses?	labels:I have followed the WW course ! It's nice but it still leaves you with a lot of questions. My wardrobe hasn't really changed. I think you need to be very much involved and focused and I don't really have the time and money for that.  I also feel like it gave me even more 'rules' to follow and now I have less fun than before with my clothes.  Capsule wardrobe is not for me, I don't own many clothes but seeing the same 8 tops every day is depressing to me.
text:Oh! That's interesting, I feel less sure about taking the course after reading comments.  Did you feel that her style personality categories were too rigid? Another comment mentioned that she apparently uses "five fashion personalities".  If you watched her YouTube channel, would you say her course goes a lot deeper than it, or can you basically get the idea from watching her YouTube?	labels:Hi, sorry for super late reply!  I didn't really felt like the fashion personnalities were too rigid, but she uses seasons to describe different kind of people and what color scheme looks good on them.  While it's not super rigid and she does mention it's just an advice, I ended up not wanting to wear some clothes I loved just because of it. I'm also not sure I agree with the classification. For exemple, I think I'm supposed to be a Winter type (cold, bright colors), but I find that a dark orange looks ok on me. Maybe I got my type wrong though !  I think it gets more in-depth than her YouTube videos, but the fashion advice she gives can all be found somewhere else online. It's just handier and she is very clear in her explanations, which is nice. There is also a very helpful community.  I hope this helps :)	episode_done:True

Then I upgraded to Harley of Scotland/Howlin -> handknitted Inverallan/Northern Watter.  Every single upgrade I see an increase in material quality, craftsmanship, and design.  I absolutely think your baseline should be around 70ish (used from ebay). Harley, Jamieson, and some brands about that price point are what you want to have. The Japanese made some good one too if you can get it proxy. Beams+ have some good ones and sales randomly, you have to keep checking though. Inis Meain is rare to come across at a low price. I bought one luckily from an eBay auction and it was 150 already for a cardigan.  If you are really into it, Inverallan, Northern Watters are what you wanna seek after.

text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:Yes, I do think our age definitely affects what looks dated to our eye.   I’m noticing that some younger men are wearing some strange iterations of 80’s color-blocked track suits that to me look very Golden Girls. Also, I’ve seen shirt and shorts sets on rappers made out of wild print fabrics exactly like the ones I made for my toddler 25 years ago.  I’m older, so I’ve seen a lot of trends come and go. We are now at the point where they are starting to repeat and are designated as “Vintage”.  I have cultivated my personal style over many years (boho/western), and have seen it done well by Ralph Lauren and most recently Christian Dior in 2018(?) and enjoy the idea of wearing the beautiful things I’ve collected until the end of my life.
text:I agree - having seen several decades of fashion, I’ve come to the conclusion that If I can remember the trend the first time around, it is dated and not for me.

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:To put it bluntly, 100% privilege plays a role in the way people dress because there is increased access to options (including natural fibres, so called “sustainable” clothing, tailoring, etc) that are completely inaccessible for the majority of others.
text:100% on privilege. Over the past few years, I’ve slowly transitioned much of my wardrobe to natural fiber clothing (with the exception of athletic wear - but now there’s recycled options at least!). And I know it’s a privilege to do so, now that I’m further in my career. A $300 slow fashion, locally produced w/ fair wage, pasture raised wool sweater simply isn’t accessible for most. And even secondhand, it’s not cheap by any means. This is why as problematic as Everlane is as a brand, I won’t judge someone for buying a much more affordable wool cardigan there instead of from babaa, if it better fits their financial needs.  However, trends are for sure more physically accessible now than before with e-commerce and social media, for better or for worse. It’s interesting - I’m in my early 30s, so our generation was in jr high / high school just as e-commerce was starting. We were one of the first Facebook user cohorts. I grew up in a sleepy suburb that was ~2 hours from a large city. We had an OK mall, Macy’s was our fanciest department store. Whenever a girl wore something from Nordstrom’s, everyone oohed and ahhed because not only was it more expensive, but you had to be fairly privileged to travel to the city to go shopping.   I still remember our family visiting my older brother in another major city, and he took me to an Urban Outfitters store for the first time. I thought all the clothes were _so cool_ and how awesome that the people had local access to that store?? And now it’s both visually and ‘physically’ accessible through the internets (with their problems as well). In that sense, I do think it’s great - but the trade-off is the exacerbation of fast fashion with trends cycling through and consumed at lightning speed.	labels:Ooh I totally relate to the thrill of getting to finally go to the "better" mall that was super far away	episode_done:True

text:Terrible and inapplicable response. This isn’t canceling an order he placed. This is canceling an order he was told didn’t go through. In other words, getting Fila to correct an error it made. It isn’t even a situation where the cancellation policy really applies.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:Decent homewear. Especially robes that aren't bathrobes nor these dainty fragile satin/chiffon thingies. Something cozy enough to set up shop on your couch in, that won't break on the first scoot, actually keep your arms warm.   In loungewear there's apparently four types with no middle ground: For mothers-formerly-known-as-women,  for girls, for seduction purposes only, and Jeff Lebowski.
text:Honestly, it is so hard to find a good robe! I just ordered some robe style sweaters from Uniqlo to wear as legit robes around the house because I couldn’t find any robes that weren’t either super expensive, super frumpy or super cheap chiffon garbage. I figure I like the non robe versions so having the same knit in robe form will be great.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are you planning on getting rid of this year?	labels:The clothes I had to buy due to "Working during the pandemic and  the only food options being gas station and fast food." weight gain. (Plus losing the weight)  And not technically getting rid of entirely, but I kept some older graphic tees to either stretch over a frame like a canvas or turn into throw pillows. It's time I get that taken care of.  Kenneth Cole Reaction suede chukka boots that have no sole texture left.  I really need to go through my cables box and get rid of old cables I'll never use again.	episode_done:True

I know it’s probably me coming extremely late to the party, but for the last couple years I’ve been obsessed with the perfect all white leather sneaker that’s minimal but not too boring.

text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:Honestly thrifting is really more about the love of the hunt than finding a wardrobe full of new (to you) clothes. It’s not like regular shopping where you go, spend 20 minutes looking, and leave with 5 pieces you really love. Last time I went thrifting I spent probably about 2 hours looking, tried on 7 things, and ended up only buying one. If taking the time to dig through piles of trash to find the one treasure is t really your jam, thrifting probably isn’t really for you.	episode_done:True
text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:Don’t forget to check out thrift stores. This is where I stock up on cashmere sweaters for a few dollars a piece, wool skirts, kilts, sweaters, vests, and cardigans, and amazing wool blazers and coats. I’ve found mint condition mohair and camel hair 3/4 coats for as low as $10, black cashmere sweaters for $2-3 and up, and cable knit pullovers for as low as $4. It’s amazing what people get rid of, not realizing how expensive it all is new. I also loooove wool in the fall and winter, and so this has been a super affordable way to build a dream cold-weather wardrobe.   The only thing wool I buy new are socks for the most part, everything else I’ve found at estate sales, garage sales, and thrift shops. When/if you go, definitely go through the boys and men’s departments, too. A bit of tailoring can make anything look custom like some of the pieces on Walker Slater maybe.

text:Does anyone take their “power color” really seriously? Basing a whole wardrobe around one color - not just choosing an accent color for a neutral capsule?	labels:Mine is definitely red. Now that I think about it, I’ve got at least one bright red item for each wardrobe essential I regularly wear, e.g coat, skirt, knit tee, cardigan, shoes etc. so I’m often wearing at least one red thing. It’s not exactly that I base my wardrobe around it, but it’s nice to have it as an anchor when putting together an outfit.	episode_done:True
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:From 2001-2005, clothing I wore as a high schooler/college kid: low rise bootcut jeans, fitted graphic tshirts, fitted polo shirts, fitted shirts in general (shirts were so tight- maybe that’s why we layered??), always layering shirts- and shirts were super long and over your hips, but tight- never tucking them in, cutoff denim skirts, cotton shorts (like soffees) with words on the butt, necklace with my first initial on it, platform flip flops, dresses with Hawaiian prints (like flowers or surfers etc), hoop earrings, fitted hoodies. That’s what I can remember.

text:The Style Blogger Index: finding people who are the same size as you	labels:Thanks so much for this! u/timory one suggestion: would it be possible to add an option to find someone with similar proportions, rather than similar raw sizes? Proportions are so helpful for figuring out what might work, even on someone who is overall smaller or larger than me.
text:Yes indeed! If you scroll all the way to the right, there's a waist:hip ratio for everyone. Also I have a Buy Me a Coffee page (running this project is like a part time job unfortunately, so I got creative) with a members only "Shape Blogger Index" that also has a waist:bust and added shapes (triangle, rectangle, inverted triangle) added for everybody. I'll be adding those all in as results to the next Size Twin Finder app update, so they won't strictly be premium features -- you just won't be able to see the entire database of people all at once without a membership.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Yes! Second hand for sweaters all the way. I buy some sweaters from Poshmark. Because they can be so ageless, we can find pretty nice pieces from a few seasons ago, or even decades ago, and it'd still look current.   The only issue is old sweaters could have shrunk, look tired, or even felted, or come with holes. I returned two Poshmark pieces because they literally had undisclosed moth holes in them, lol. So always be careful about buying quality wool online.	labels:	episode_done:True

White slip dresses in the vein of Liz Taylor in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. And the film Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.
text:Honestly, it’s so hot and humid down here (south Louisiana) in summer that mostly all anyone ever wears are tank tops and shorts.

text:General Discussion - October 25	labels:One of our old friend families we keep in touch with since they moved to the city beside ours has started to go off the deep end with COVID/qanon conspiracy stuff on FB. My wife is much closer to the wife and was really having some distress. My wife works in public health and directly with our COVID response.  Anyways, my wife posted a comment on a particularly inflammatory post and basically said it was affecting their friendship. They wound up having a phone call and it actually turned out positively, with the other person asking for some more information to look at contrary to her views.  Anyways, for now it was a positive outcome from something where I thought we’d have to cut someone out of our lives. Hard because our kids are friends too.  Also we had a provincial election here yesterday and our left-of-Centre (NDP) party absolutely wiped the floor with the centre-right party which is nice. They’ve done a good job with COVID and other stuff so happy to keep going with that.
text:That all sounds good. I'm lucky to live in an area where people take it pretty seriously, but friends around the country (US) have to put up with things like this a lot.  They say you just have to keep in mind that fear is what drives the conspiracy theories--fear of being out of work and having their livelihood threatened, more than anything.	labels:Absolutely. Unfortunately the husband lost his job (that he had just gotten) due to COVID. So there’s real financial stress there.  My wife approached it with sympathy and respect first.	episode_done:True

Maybe I've just seen enough of this battle for now. Like I said, with /u/Rariora, I like the long coat over interesting pants, but I think it came out better last time. And I'm not in love with the black-forward color scheme here. Plasma's look is also more tame than usual, no crazy colors, but the first background was... cheating, really. The long cardigan worked. And is that all color 8? And the scarf being worn asymmetrically like that is a plus for me. Tame, overall, but... really solid.  \--> /u/ngoknows <-- v. /u/chunsak \-- I'd say NGO ahs the most interesting fit here, for me, with the big, fun, scarf. I like the asymmetry in the first photo... Really solid fit. Oh, and I love the detail shot! Chunsak... Also solid, but doesn't stir anyting up in me, personally. I can see how cord, flannel and donegal in this combination might excite some of you, but for me... eh.  Overall... I expect something crazier next round. Don't pull any punches for the finals.

text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:I once got the tip to put everything in your closet with the open part of your hanger hook facing out. Then, when you wear something, turn that hanger the right side out (i.e. round side of the hook facing out). Set a time period that you want to revisit cleaning your closet (i.e. a season/year etc) and after that time period donate or throw out everything that still has the hook turned in. Similarly, pack all the things you aren't sure if you want to keep into a box and set a time frame. If you find yourself wanting to wear something in that box, take it out. At the end of the time-frame, donate what's still there (especially if you forgot that item existed).  Recently due to COVID, I moved across back the country so I had to fit my closet into suitcases. That involved donating a lot of things that are perfectly nice and wearable but what I had to admit to myself that 1)I actually never wore in the 3 years I lived there and 2) didn't miss in the few months that I was living without them (I was living out of a carry on when I got unexpectedly stuck back home).  In terms of the never throw anything out, perhaps donate it to  a charity that's helps dress the less fortunate for work? They're definitely pieces that others will love.

text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:Honestly I think you have to give way more detail on your old pair and what you’re looking for.  In my mind the biggest hurdle to perfect jeans is the fit, and since every body is different this is highly individual. Some people might prefer stretchier denim for a more forgiving fit, while others look for stiffer fabric, and have less leeway.   Personally I still struggle to find a high rise, non cropped, fits my thighs and waist, plain dark wash, straight/skinny, 90% or more cotton, pair of jeans. But hopefully I’ll find it eventually!

text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:>I've started to notice a trend which I can only describe as 'no substance' and how this has become more and more common  YES and it's not just in fashion, but blogs and vlogs in general. So many blogs are exactly the same, it's like they're all just copying each other. So many posts are just ads. I don't mean they *have* ads, I mean the entire post is just an ad for something.  I can only assume they've witnessed other influencers' success and are trying to replicate that for themselves. They don't understand most OG influencers worked for years to add value and build a following before they ever saw a cent. They're trying to skip to the end by following proven formulas and packing their content with as many ads as possible. That's my theory, anyways.	episode_done:True

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:What length skirts do you gravitate toward?  Most of my skirts/dresses are mini or midi length, so I usually wear ankle boots or knee high boots.  I like my ankle boots to hit at the thinnest part of my ankle (right above the bone) and my knee high boots just below my knees.    I’m not a huge fan of mid calf, because that cuts off my leg in an awkward place and I don’t have enough leg to be doing that. (I’m 5’1”.)  My choice of boot depends on  1) how cold it will be 2) how long I’ll be in the cold 3) my coat  For example, if I’m going for a girls night (pre covid) I might decide to wear a mini with ankle boots, but have a longer coat that I can keep me warm if we’re moving around.  If I’m going to the farmers market, I might decide to wear a midi dress with knee high boots and a wool coat, so I can take my time.  I’m a big fan of knee high boots with midi dresses and long coats. The overlap really keeps out the cold. It’s definitely a 70s kind of vibe which isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. but maybe people will come around because Nicole Kidman rocked this vibe in the undoing...	episode_done:True

I wouldn't say that I am a trend setter or anything, but it is so much easier to look at photos online of people who have the same body shape as me whose fashion I admire, compare those photos to what I have in my closet, and purchase what is missing to make the outfit work all in one place. It sounds like a lot, but I find this so much easier, less anxiety-inducing, and less time consuming than brick-and-mortar shopping. Plus, usually returns are just a drop off somewhere with a digital reciept rather than waiting is line at a customer service counter with a paper receipt that I have lost twice, ripped, and had to tape back together. A little tidbit: the biggest trick to online shopping is to KNOW YOUR MEASUREMENTS!!! A cheap measuring tape works wonders.	episode_done:True

text:Future of fibers?	labels:Personally I don’t find it very difficult or expensive to shop for clothing made with natural fibers — if anything it’s gotten even easier to do so with online shopping and websites showing fiber content right in the product description. I don’t have to seek out brands that specialize in natural materials either — my clothing is mostly from Madewell, which doesn’t really market itself as being all that environmentally conscious or sustainable, and is definitely not a high end brand, but they have tons of options for clothing made of cotton, silk, etc.   I will say it’s gotten harder to find sweaters made of 100% wool over the years, however. I have several wool sweaters from mall brands that I bought just a few years ago. I gained some weight since then and have been looking for replacements from the same exact brands and it seems like they don’t even bother with 100% wool anymore, all of their sweaters are now made with acrylic, nylon, polyester, etc. That’s the only natural fiber that I feel has all but disappeared from the mainstream for some reason.   I will also add that I don’t think man made fibers are necessarily “cheap”, either. We’ve come a long way from man made materials of the 80s and 90s. When I think of man made fibers of today, I think of technical clothing and gear such as outdoor or sportswear. Patagonia for example is the poster child for environmentally friendly brands, but most of their clothing is made from man made materials, and their products are far from cheap. Partly because it performs better for its purpose, and partly because it’s supposed last a lifetime.  Which leads me to my last thought — IMO man made materials aren’t necessarily bad for the environment. It’s really our habits that are bad, and the industries that cater to these habits. If we all bought a few items of clothing that were all man made and lasted our lifetime, that is arguably *more* environmentally friendly than if we were constantly buying and throwing away natural fibered clothing.
text:I think there's a very good reason for 100% wool sweaters being harder to find: wool is a very weak fiber, difficult to care for, and itchy. Cutting it with other fibers makes clothing that is more wearable, increases longevity, and minimizes all those negatives.	labels:I'm allergic to every type of animal fibre I've ever tried to wear (hello hives) so the rise in actually warm man made fibres is fantastic for me personally	episode_done:True

I am really struggling to find jogging bottoms or sports trousers (like part of a set) that are long enough in the leg for me.  Every pair I find come up horrendously short and look stupid.  I'm 6ft 1" with fairly long legs. I'm not a massive fan of the 'cuffed' bottom tracksuit bottoms either which is frustrating as this seems to be the current style.   I am between a 32-34" waist and on a pair of M&S jeans I have that fit nicely the inside leg reads 33"  I've tried looking on big and tall sites but they seem to cater more for larger males and not just slim tall guys.

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I have similar connotations as you about them being kind of cheap or tacky looking, but would add one other angle to it. While I'm 100% against the use of real fur/exotic hides, I think part of the cheapness animal prints comes from taking something that in its natural state exists on fur and copy-pasting it onto all different kinds of fabrics. Real cheetahs look beautiful and elegant. A poorly rendered cheetah print on thin polyester leggings just looks like a terrible imitation. There isn't this mental comparison going on with other patterns, like stripes or polka dots, because there's no "real" standard to compare to. They're just decorative patterns.  Even if you attempt to create a faux fur that more closely imitates a real animal hide, it's going to look cheap and fake (to me) unless it is really well done.

text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:Southern California summer: survive 119° in single-layer viscose, rayon, and cotton weave, with big lightweight billowy sun kimonos to keep the radiation from slow cooking the long pork right off of your little soup bones. The billowier the better -- I'm talking sleeves like an emperor, pant legs like you're riding out to drive the cattle back to the barn -- you generate your own tiny airflow vectors. Keep a puffy and some slipper boots in your car because if you wanna watch the sun set over the ocean, your stupid idiot desert body can no longer regulate and you're huddled near death at 65° and windy.  Brooklyn winter: lightweight to midweight merino wool underlayers, because sweating in your synthetics on the train will make you smell like Manhattan. Your black merino turtleneck is literally your best friend and you would kill and die for it. Don't put your cold feet into your winter-weight wool socks because they will stay that way. Put em in a hot sink first if you have to. Also, if you wear your cute boots you will step on slushy shit of indeterminate origin and that's life in the big city, baby. Pick a coat that comes down pretty far because that river wind tunneling through the city architecture will send the kiss of death UP your cervix. Free instant sterilization though! And don't forget your lip balm.

text:How do you care for your expensive/fragile pieces?	labels:Honestly not using the dryer is the best piece of advice (of course being allergic to fabric softener made my decision for me).  I have Forever 21 pieces in my closet that are at least a decade old.  They survived.
text:I do this too for my nicer pieces but there are some made of certain fabric that gets so stiff and no longer soft if you air dry it. Does anyone know how to make these types of fabrics that stiffen up without a dryer soft when they dry?

text:Can we talk sleepwear?	labels:I was very into this idea as well and invested in some Lunya PJs...but that elegant person I invisioned didn't magically appear. I still had a big messy bun, acne patches on my face and slept with my mouth wiiide open. I didn't feel as comfortable in those PJs and that fantasy I had didn't come true, ya know? I don't want to discourage you, just my two cents as someone who had a very similar thought process  I went back to tank tops and sweatpants and I find I appreciate them a lot more now. I make sure they fit properly and don't have stains or holes so I still feel reasonably put together.
text:As a counterpoint, I wear similar clothes to bed (silk nightdresses that hit mid thigh), and I find that even if I'm a mess when I wake up, I still feel great in them. Like, effortlessly sexy even though my hair looks like a tornado visited me in the night. They're the most comfortable type of garment I've found to sleep in as well (but I know I'm in the minority with that opinion).

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "How to Determine Your Body Type" and "On Dressing Your Body Type"	labels:There is a ton of great info in these, though I think what I found most interesting was the section in Body Type about other measurements and proportions, because it offered a clearer explanation of why you might measure as one type and not look it.  Both guides still felt outdated, not only because of the fashion examples, but because the popular silhouette has shifted more in favor of a dramatic hourglass/pear and there more leeway in what’s considered flattering in general.  There already seems to be a lot of (understandable) dislike towards typing systems, so I could see it being beneficial to **start off** with reframing, i.e. “having an understanding of your body shape/silhouette allows you to present it in the way that you feel is most flattering”, and then moving into an explanation of the types (instead of getting right into it/breaking down all the problems before trying to convince you it’s still useful,) the shapes/silhouettes, and how to attain them. Personally, I’d love it if you could go “my body is shaped more like this type, doing xyz would help me look more like that type.” and a mention of each type being more easily read as masculine/feminine/androgynous, though it’d have to be handled delicately;  I just think it’d be helpful for people trying to present themselves more in those ways.	episode_done:True

text:2020 Christmas Gifts Thread	labels:Oh my, I go all out of Christmas gifts for my family. My brother and my mom do a lot for me and have supported me immensely through years of mental illness and addiction issues (sober for 6 1/2 years wooo) so I try and do something special for them.  For mom I got her a jersey, lime green Bottega Veneta shirt, and a golden yellow scarf from Bottega as well. I initially only bought the shirt and then I saw the scarf and knew I had to include that as well!  For my brother, not fashion, but I got him an authentic Penguin pitcher from Argentina, where our dad was from.  Sister in law and best friend, I got her a black hooded Apparis coat that I found on sale for $150!  Aunt and Uncle got puzzles and flannels from LL Bean, their favorite.  For my fiance, I got him a simple black windbreaker from Bottega.  Now on to what I got!  My fiance got me rainbow huggie earrings from Stone and Strand and I'm never taking them off!  My mom and brother got me a green Bottega mini pouch bag.  My aunt and uncle got me this fuzzy fleece sweater that may be the softest thing I've ever touched.	episode_done:True
text:What is your favorite clothing purchase of the year, and why?	labels:If I'm honest, with this year being what it was, the purchase I'm most excited about is four pairs of slim-fitting fleece joggers from Gap. A close second would be two pairs of decent-looking New Balance 574s.  I've been working from home since March and really only go out to get groceries, get a haircut, and occasionally go for a walk on a nearby biking trail. My uniform for the last few months has been joggers and a polo shirt, sometimes an Oxford. It's just enough that I still feel professional at work (I do video calls with clients), but it's the most comfortable I've ever been at work.  When I have to leave, throw those New Balance sneakers on. Cold? Grad a denim jacket. Had I worn this outfit somewhere nice a year or two ago, yeah, I can see that being a cause for ridicule. But now, I'm frequently the best dressed person I run across when I go outside. At work, some people dress a bit better, but it's still comparable.  I look forward to seeing what happens to fashion when we get this pandemic taken care of. Some people have been putting effort together to make things like joggers and sneakers work and look great, I wonder if fashion in general will adopt more of the comfortable trends.	episode_done:True

I also almost exclusively wear my thigh high boots in winter/fall	episode_done:True
text:What’s on everyone’s Black Friday wishlists?	labels:It's mostly shoes and bags for me this year—and mostly secondhand. This season's trends have been too utilitarian for my tastes.  I've already bought a few sale things from & Other Stories (a black velvet bag with gold beading, and a cream blouse with a pointy collar and a million little buttons), and a long-coveted Little Liffner bag in sky blue (from TheRealReal).  Here's my current wishlist, though:  * a pink alpaca sweater in a delicate knit * black knee-high leather boots with a low block heel (and ideally a square-ish toe) * a little cropped boucle or tweed jacket, but with a collar (so hard to find!) * a small, cherry red leather shoulder bag to replace a worn-out one * black sheer tights of decent quality * classic, minimal sneakers: one pair in red leather, another in black leather with white soles * inexplicably, a black pillbox hat (I have never worn hats but am suddenly feeling an urge)	episode_done:True

text:I’m not a tailor but I think there’s a way around it. Maybe it would cost to much to tailor but I think it could be done on jeans for example. kinda like how a tailor would cut jeans to be tighter but then instead of sewing it shut just put elastic behind it to pull it shut but when it opens just the denim shows... again idk what I’m really talking about but I feel like it could be fast ke to make pants go from like a 28 to maybe a 31/32	labels:	episode_done:True

A lot of people working in fashion are on a gig-by-gig basis so it’s Everyman for himself as far as success goes. People will turn a blind eye to the wrong doings of companies if it means that they themselves can get another paycheck or take a step up the ladder. It’s not that they themselves are immoral but it’s a hard industry to make it in and you can feel powerless when you’re not at the top. When you are on your own, which is most days, you will lose sight of the bigger picture of an ideal future.  For example this summer I read that FreePeople implemented racist practices within their stores. I added them to a list of companies that I didn’t want to work for (I’m freelance.) A month ago I was offered an opportunity to work with them and even though on principal I didn’t want to, I still considered it because I need a paycheck and the name would be good for me to have on my resume and would lead to more work.  Until their are unions to protect freelancers the fashion industry will remain corrupt. Everyone is afraid of being blacklisted and/or broke.

text:How do you feel about vegan/faux leather?	labels:Unfortunately all the pleather items I've had ended up peeling so I tend to avoid fake leather now.
text:I’ve had no issues with mine. I even have leggings from Old Navy with faux leather fronts and ones with wide side panels and they go in the wash just fine. Had them for years at this point. No peeling and they look great. Someone even stopped me to compliment them once on the train.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How to Dress for Life at Home	labels:They go from "throwing on yesterdays jeans and a random t shirt dosnt cut it anymore" to "wear broken in workwear (jeans) and random summer attire"  I swear the only point of this article is to make people feel unhappy with their current wardrobe so they buy more stuff.
text:Sorry you feel that way. When I wrote it, I tried to convey that I didn't put much thought into what I wore. Perhaps I could have said pajama bottoms with RRL cardigans. I don't have a perfect description for it, but I do think that the style Andrew is wearing there is a lot more coherent. I think there are ways to do that style thoughtfully, and not randomly. I didn't write this with the intention of making people feel unhappy with their current wardrobe. Just trying to give suggestions on how they may get enjoyment from clothes, even when confined to home.	labels:Hey man huge fan.

text:What are "iconic" items that you should know about, and their basic history? What items can singularly be identified as "starting a trend"?	labels:Hmmm, I would say Doc Martens started the trend of fashionable leather work boots. Punk rockers wore them in the 70-80s and now everyone rocks them! They are definitely fashion staples.  Then the Beatles probably started the shaggy haircuts with the clean look, I can't remember what those "boys" were called but there was a name for them.      Then I would say converse all-stars are staples in casual wear. They were made huge by NBA players (made FOR them actually).   These are staples, at least in a university-aged student's wardrobe.	episode_done:True
text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.
text:I’m the opposite.  People assume I’m a lesbian for my love of distressed denim, nicer t-shirts, leather jackets, converse and Birkenstock’s. I also have an undercut residing beneath my bob (was a pixie pre-pandemic) and pay a lot of money to have my hair dyed untraditional colors. I’m not a lesbian. I am queer in the fact that I’m ace, but it’s always pissed me off that people assume your sexuality based on the way you dress. I just like to be comfy, my dudes.	labels:Oh this is so me. I've worked in a traditional field my whole life, and have had the most trouble at work because I just would not dress like they thought a woman should dress. I'm viking sized and have been mistaken for a man in drag more than once, USUALLY when I'm wearing my ren faire gear, with bosoms popping out of my bodice. Sad to say, for someone as large as I am, I really don't have much up top. I personally  hate clothes so much I am a card carrying nudist	episode_done:True

text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I bought/sold on Poshmark when it was starting to get popular, and found great deals and sold pretty easily on it. I stopped a year later - by that time, I had started seeing wholesale distributers flooding the site and making it alot harder for me to find actual used clothing for decent prices. I'd agree that there are likely too many sellers now compared to buyers - or at least too much merchandise compared to buyers. To me, that makes Poshmark too much like Ebay, and is no longer as distinct a platform as it used to be.  Edit: typos
text:I agree. I like buying secondhand mostly so I used to use Posh/etc a tooooon and have pretty much stopped. I actually find better deals on eBay now for the same things. Sellers want to charge full retail (or more) for items and act like negotiating is a personal attack when that's literally what the site was designed for. Couple that with expensive shipping, no returns, and the high occurrence of issues with orders it just isn't worth it. The last time I was on this site was the summer and everything that I made reasonable offers is still sitting, now cheaper than what I originally offered, and because the sellers gave me attitude they lost my sale. I don't see Posh being successful for much longer, honestly. Mercari is just as bad and harder to find things on.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:I think age matters less than what matches you and how confident you are in your clothes.    I'm 38, soon to be 39 and it's extremely likely that you (at 25) dress far more conservatively than I do.

text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I too am bored to death of the French classic look, the Tik Tok youth trends, the Everlane normcore.   Someone recently recommended Amy Smilovic of TIbi here and I’ve gone in deep, haven’t felt this inspired in a long time.   On her + Tibi’s Instagram she espouses what she calls the “Creative pragmatic” look and articulates nicely many things, like what makes clothing “stuff or style”, does a lot of bolder silhouettes that somehow still work for everyday and uses styling to bring out personality.   Frankly, I haven’t seen anyone be so clear on why sometimes you buy an item you love that feels stylish but as soon as you use it in your daily life it just feels off or not as impactful.   It’s also been helpful for me to see for once how pieces are worn on actual people and not just models. For the first time it’s like I can see where these higher end looks could translate into real life.	episode_done:True

text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:It’s less about the value of the item and more about the stars aligning perfectly.  I wear a size 12-13W shoe, plus other things that make my feet really hard to fit, so I am used to buying formalwear to match the one maybe two pairs of formal shoes I own at any given time.  So when I was 17 and going to prom in 2006, my mom tried really hard to help me find shoes, any shoes, that were suitable. But we could only find casual flats or runners, and I realllly wanted to dress up nicely for the first real time in my life. So she said “you know what, let’s buy a dress and then we will just have to find a way.”  So I picked out a black and pale pink dress that just made me swoon, and I figured black heels would be easiest to find. Lol I was so young and stupid.  Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn’t find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I’d just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.
text:I had picked out black heels to buy for my uni graduation, was thinking to buy them next month. I was randomly walking into a second hand store to spend some time before bus. And there they were, my heels, my size, brand new and 90% cheaper then in store. Yes it's like common brand here, but brand new shoes  in thrift store for that price is definetly not normal.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Some websites (department stores, ASOS) have a true fit tool where you put in your measurements, body type, and well fitting item of clothing and that information is used to recommend sizing.   It’s also a good idea to know your measurements in general if you’re buying secondhand as many sellers will list the measurements of the garment.  But overall sizing can be so wild within one brand, much less across multiple that I dint think there’s much of a rule of thumb.
text:Oh, ASOS can do that? Wow, amazing. I'll definitely be shopping there. I have all my measurements good to go.	labels:They also have a *wonderful* return policy. So if something doesn’t fit you can just print out a return label and do it online. So quick. So easy. And free!	episode_done:True
text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:Reading through the comments it really seems like Modcloth's problem has been consistency of quality all along, and not just since the Walmart takeover. I personally used to shop the website a lot, (especially for quirky jewelry and accessories!) and while I have a soft spot for many of those pieces (especially the blazer I mentioned under another comment) now that I'm really sitting here thinking about it there were def others that didn't last well or look as good in person. I also started thinking about how at that age pretty much all my income was disposable (living at home, no kids) so I guess it didn't bother me as badly if something wasn't worth what I paid for it, especially if it was cute enough to make an outfit with once or twice. So maybe the real issue with the site is its failure to adapt to its customer base's changing needs. Or, alternatively, to attract new and younger customers by staying on trend. I think there's probably a market for quirky but still trendy pieces , but a "vintage" aesthetic is a hard sell when thrifting is much more common now (not to mention cheaper and more responsible).	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:My personal philosophy: If all you can afford is fast fashion, but you buy minimally and wear frequently and for a long time, no one should judge you for not being sustainable. That’s absolutely a valid way to participate in slow fashion. If you can afford ethical brands though, then I think you should purchase from them instead.	episode_done:True

I am also loving the new plaid trend!	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:I think it’s unavoidable, so yep like another commenter said, just choose wisely, and I would also add don’t ‘give in’ to any whims and infatuations. I put something in my online shopping cart (or even hold it and walk around the actual shop), and a few moments later I realise I don’t need it and close the tab/put it back.  For me the biggest thing is knowing my style. I know what things I look best (yes ‘best’, not just ‘good’) in, so I have these items in my closet and I am not likely to randomly get more clothes whenever I feel like it. And knowing your style, you’ll also know you’ll wear the items you buy a lot, so you’ll not feel bad about spending more money and ‘investing’ in pieces. :)	episode_done:True

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:The company already made money off of the original purchase of the shirt, so you buying second hand doesn’t really benefit them in any way. If you really want the item, buying it second hand is probably the most ethical choice you can make. If someone asks where the piece is from, just say you don’t know so they won’t be tempted to buy from the brand lol

text:My Gucci Addiction: Vanity Fair editor Buzz Bissinger's essay about spending $638k on clothes	labels:The line in the piece that stuck out for me was when he said he was on medication for "mild bipolarity."  The out-of-control spending, the hypersexuality, the losing a job due to temper outbursts...I'm not a psychiatrist, I just play one on the internet, but all of that put together  sounds like, at the very least, untreated hypomania.  To pass it off as only shopping addiction or "discovering himself" seems like underplaying some serious mental illness.
text:Regular people have mental illness.  Rich people have *glamorous* mental illness	labels:Exactly. Regular people are hoarders. Rich people are ✨eccentric
text:I’ve seen people say this, but tbh hoarding is something completely different from eccentricity. Rich or not, if your living space is unsanitary because you have too much crap in your house or your spending addiction damages your life, then you’re a hoarder.  If you just have unconventional style or make whimsical choices (like carefully curating an unusual collection) then you’re eccentric.   These words have completely different definitions.	labels:It is, of course, but for a lot of reasons mental illness in wealthy people gets labeled as eccentricity long after it would be called what it is for the rest of us. If you’ve got a huge house and help to clean it, you can hoard a lot more for a lot longer before you hit that unsanitary state you mention, for instance.	episode_done:True
text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.
text:Uniform dressing is the best!!  I have a VERY casual job (dog handler at a daycare) with an actual uniform (if very loose - t-shirts and hoodies with the logo) and it's lovely.  I don't have to think about it beyond checking the weather and seeing if I need two layers of fleece leggings and snow pants or if I need shorts and a wide-brimmed hat.  I now have a "uniform" for off days too.  Still super casual, but it's an easy selection.	labels:	episode_done:True

If you follow me on IG that's the easiest way to hear about updates, but I can edit this comment when it's refreshed, too!   **(11/30 update if anybody is still reading -- the app is updated!)**  Edit: since so many of you are finding the tool mostly useless, I just wanted to say that the goal was to create something that would help you find fashion inspo from people who are more similar in size to you than a fashion model in a magazine.  Of course it's impossible to get an exact body double from just 3 measurements, but that's what the standard is, and that's what I could reasonably expect the average person to know about themselves. I have to make sure that the barrier to entry is very low. The more people can join this index, the more useful it is. Please remember that I offer this tool completely for free, that I don't work in the fashion industry, and that I don't have any background in the industry (fashion, data, or web design). I just wanted to do something helpful for the community. I will try my best to make as many improvements as I can over time, but I have very limited resources, and maintaining it is quite a lot of effort as is. Sorry, all!

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 08, 2021	labels:So anyone have any recommendations for an affordable white leather jacket? I got a couple pairs of white jeans that I want to match with a white leather jacket and haven’t found quality ones that are affordable. Help. My budget is $50-$100.
text:You won’t find quality leather jackets at $100, even used, especially not in an unusual color, your best bet is to either hit up thrift shops, buy leather dye and attempt to diy or to just go with whatever you find at the usual fast fashion mall brands	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:I did a patch with a pair of jeans I noticed wearing down a lot. Took some spare fabric (two pieces a bit larger than the palm of my hand, larger than the area that was wearing out) and sewed it on the inside around the area wearing out. Then set the sewing machine to a zigzag stitch with blue thread (a bit too light, but that’s what I had on hand) and just went to town going back and forth over the entire area. It’s worked well for more wears than any other patch methods I’ve tried	episode_done:True

text:Do you have a childhood fashion icon? If so, does their influence show up in your wardrobe today?	labels:When I was a child, I looked mostly towards like tween and teen fashion rather than adult fashion. I loved Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Mary Kate and Ashley Olson. They were all like the epitome of the sweet-normal-but-stylish-girl-next door characters. Outfits always cute, but accessible/not over the top
text:I will never not love everything the Olsen's wore in their NYU/early NYC days.   We're about the same age and I still absolutely love them but I don't really get their style nowadays.

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Me!! I am currently working through this - I actually created this new account specifically for FFA so I can feel more comfortable sharing outfits. 3 years ago I left a creative job to become a stay at home mom, and since then I had another baby and have been all over the place size-wise. Pre-kids I had a very defined personal style and was really connected to my local arts community and my wardrobe reflected that.   Now I’m kind of in a lost place (after two bouts of post-parting depression, the last one clearing up right as the pandemic started) and I have no idea how to integrate my personal style into my “new” lifestyle.   Currently I’m working on uploading my entire wardrobe to StyleBook, to hopefully track what I’m wearing every day to find trends so that I can clear out things I don’t wear or that don’t fit. I’ve also started browsing Pinterest and Instagram a lot more to encourage myself to wear things other than sweats every day. Even though I’m at home with two toddlers all the time, I think I feel better about myself when I put on real clothes that fit and make me feel happy!   I have a long way to go but you’re not alone!	episode_done:True
text:Stay In-Vested	labels:Woo! I can’t wait to wear my down vest and then write about it LOL   This is good inspo. Sure a lot of it looks the same, but I think certain pieces require a vibe- not everything is as versatile as a loafer, but that’s okay!	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - October 25	labels:One of our old friend families we keep in touch with since they moved to the city beside ours has started to go off the deep end with COVID/qanon conspiracy stuff on FB. My wife is much closer to the wife and was really having some distress. My wife works in public health and directly with our COVID response.  Anyways, my wife posted a comment on a particularly inflammatory post and basically said it was affecting their friendship. They wound up having a phone call and it actually turned out positively, with the other person asking for some more information to look at contrary to her views.  Anyways, for now it was a positive outcome from something where I thought we’d have to cut someone out of our lives. Hard because our kids are friends too.  Also we had a provincial election here yesterday and our left-of-Centre (NDP) party absolutely wiped the floor with the centre-right party which is nice. They’ve done a good job with COVID and other stuff so happy to keep going with that.

text:How does one incorporate haute couture into everyday work outfits?	labels:My advice when incorporating an element that's "off" from the norm is to add another element in the same vein to balance it out and make it look more intentional. By "element" I'm including accessories and hairstyles, makeup. So you could pair a couture blazer with a blowout, or a dramatic blouse with a bold lip, or an iconic skirt with a high end bracelet. Also, outerwear is a great place to start if you're tentative bc you take it off once you get to work. Coats, jackets, bags, scarves.	episode_done:True

I did some research and there are a lot of conflicting views on how the Ashby fits. Some say it’s big so go a size down - some say it’s a slimmer fit. For my frame and style again, some conflicting views when searching.   I normally wear medium or small for jackets and like a tighter fit. I’m 190lb and 6ft tall.   Does anyone have one in a small? How does it fit/ can you share pics plus your weight and height?  I also checked the pit to put and length vs one of my current jackets.

I was so light headed from smoke inhalation that I didn’t even remember to pack any underwear, so I’m just really really hoping the house doesn’t burn down because I packed 4 shirts, 4 pairs of pants, and 1 pair of shoes, and if all my silk blazers burn I’m going to cry	episode_done:True
text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:I'm a big fan of going local if you can.

You have to dig sometimes and I don't know what it's been like since covid but I've found some amazing, unique pieces there.

text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I’m a chemist and my go to is dark skinnies and plain t-shirts or a blouse with a cardigan in every color of the rainbow in the summer and relatively plain sweaters in the fall/winter months. I’m always cold so I love turtlenecks and they look dressier with my lab coat than other things. I’ve got spill resistant boots from Red Wing that I change into when I go into the lab but I generally wear flats and booties if I’m just doing office work that day.  I usually wear pearl earrings and light makeup to look more put together but nothing too fancy.	episode_done:True
text:People who work in the fashion industry - what do you wear?	labels:I work in the fashion industry, but within the tech org of a fashion retailer, which tends to be more casual than the rest of the company.   That being said, for being on the west coast (PNW), our tech org dresses much better when compared to the large tech companies in our area. Worth noting that with COVID and working from home, most people I work with are wearing solely athleisure now.   My role has to interact with our buyers and merchants quite a bit, so before COVID I tended to dress in smart-casual attire (think loafers, slacks, and a sweater — or nice jeans, a blazer to dress it up, and some booties).  Our merch org dresses all over the spectrum of “always fashionable” — where the lower employees tend to lean more casual and trendy, high-street fashion with maybe a few designer splashes, while upper management tends to wear a more business-formal designer wardrobe (think St. John style). Designer or not, people who work in the Merch org always seem to own their look and create a signature with it.	episode_done:True

I’m starting to invest in more modest professional clothes for my personal time.

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:I used to always wear jeans and t-shirts too (and still do a lot of the time), but what has helped me is just paying attention to people around me and what they wear. Friends, acquaintances, strangers. For me, this helps a lot more than looking online because I feel like I can't really tell what the clothes look like in real life.  TV shows or movies help too, where I can see how the clothing a character wears contributes to their "vibe" and matches their personality or other things the creators want to show. Sometimes that's even better than real life because so much thought goes into what the characters wear and what it says about them.  A big barrier for me was the cost of buying new clothes when I'm not really sure if I'll like them long-term, so it's helped to borrow or trade clothes with friends to try new things out. One of my friends used to organize a big clothing swap once a year. Thrift stores, Facebook buying & selling groups, and discount places are also a good option.  Another barrier was that I had only really seen fashion as being about creating a feminine image and emphasizing a slim body type. I would always be upset with my body for not looking like that. I've recently learned I feel much more myself in more androgynous and masc clothing, which I think is why I liked jeans and T-shirts so much. Realizing what I actually like to look like makes it feel a lot more natural and intuitive.	episode_done:True

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:If you like the look of vintage clothing, workwear, brands like RRL etc there is really no need to buy from the expensive reproduction brands or the curated vintage fashion stores or IG pages.   There is absolutely loads of that kind of thing for cheap on eBay (probably where those curated vintage stores get most of it from...) and even well regarded brands like Filson, Woolrich, Schott leather etc tons of that available. All it takes is some extra work on your part to actually sift through it, find whats in good condition, worth buying etc and get to grips with the 'keywords' of the clothing items if that makes sense... ('hunting jacket', 'rancher coat', 'A2 flight jacket', 'type 1 trucker' for example) and can also be good searching by fabric type... ('vintage corduroy', 'vintage suede jacket', 'herringbone wool' and so on), these are a good way to narrow down your search.  Some downsides obviously though like not always having proper recourse on things like returns etc like brands and stores will give. But if you put the time in searching, there can be a lot of good bargains to be had and you can get the look of those reproduction brands on a budget.  Not just vintage either though. Especially on things like jeans, if you have already zeroed in on a specific model with favourite fit you know you like, ebay also has a shit load of people selling Levi's, Lee, Carhartt etc brand new old stock, whether they couldnt return a purchase, offloaded from stores closing down, end of season, whatever. Again though, obviously takes searching on your part to see what is genuine and worth buying, but I have managed to get a couple pairs of selvedge Levis and Carhartt jacket way below RRP, as cheap as I would pay from some crappy high street store.	episode_done:True

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.
text:If you live in the PNW a goretex or good waterproof layer shell is key, I got one finally for this season and man it’s amazing not to be soaked by the end. And all that’s needed under that is layering. But gotetex jackets aren’t exactly cheap.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:I don't think there's anything wrong with preferring dresses and leggings and it doesn't inherently signify that you are somehow unworthy for pants or "letting yourself go".   The thing is, historically speaking, dresses were actually far more practical for a woman's body due the cyclical changes we all experience, from menstrual bloating/cramping, to minor weight fluctuations, to pregnancy and breastfeeding (historically there wasn't much choice about the last two but obviously now there is), cuz you could cinch up or let out your dress depending on how you were doing.   It's only now that stretchy fabric is truly mainstream that pants have truly become as practical and cost effective in that they can tolerate a lot more cyclical size changes, which are *normal*.  Edit: not to mention all the times people would gain and lose weight due to the availability of food.   I'd say I have a pretty confident mindset and 90% of my non work wardrobe is dresses and skirts/shirt combos. I wear undersummers in the spring and summer, leggings and sweater tights in the winter and I've gotten SO MUCH MORE USE out of my dresses... They lasted me up until my 8th month of pregnancy, I barely had to buy maternity clothes.  I have been able to wear the same knit dress/leggings combo at 180lbs prepregnancy and later at 210 lbs post partum and still look cute.  What pair of pants could pull that off? Almost none, I tell you.  Saved me a lot of $$$.   No matter what I weigh, I always have a bit of a belly, so most pants dig into that anyways, which isn't comfortable. Only truly high waisted stuff feels ok, but I don't want to wear that in the summer.   It sounds like disordered thinking is creeping up on you, and you may have to consciously remind yourself that there's nothing wrong with enjoying comfy clothes that don't restrict your abdomen.

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:Check to see if you have one with Runway near you. On the store locator page it will have an R logo on ones with it. Those are the ones that sell the higher end contemporary/designer pieces (it’s separated into its own section, they have purple price tags). The best deals are when someone returns a runway item to one of the non-runway stores and they put it on clearance though. That’s obviously hit or miss. My absolute best finds are those returns during the yellow tag sales. One year I got a $500 beaded Parker dress for like $5.

text:Jewelry trends for 2021	labels:I feel like delicate, minimalist jewelry in general is here to stay for a while longer among the general populous (I personally think minimalist gold jewelry is timeless). It's easy to maintain and it goes with any outfit; can be a day and night piece.  Might just be me, but I feel that high fashion is always trying to promote the big, bold, statement jewelry, which is fine! The way you describe your style mixed with the beautiful pieces you like, it sounds like it fits you to a T. Just not sure if it is trending that direction though. But I think that you should shrug off today's "standards" and wear what makes you feel happy and confident!
text:I think minimalist or non-statement jewelry is timeless to an extent like a simple colour t-shirt is timeless.

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Disclaimer-- I know myself well enough to know that a capsule wardrobe is not for me.  When I get back from traveling, I cannot wait to wear different clothes.  Consider your laundry situation.  Having a smaller wardrobe means that you will be doing laundry more often.  If you're one in a family of 6, it may not be a big deal.  But for a single apartment dweller (pay per load), the additional costs can add up quickly.   Because I pay per load, I make sure that I maximize the capacity and only wash full loads (I'm paying the same no matter the capacity).  I am not one to hand-wash clothes in a bathroom sink.  Not now, not ever!   I do laundry roughly every other week alternating lights and darks.  (Sheets and towels are their own ballgame, and I will sometimes throw things in with them.)
text:Just curious but why didn't you get a washing machine for the apartment?	labels:Some condos either don't have space or they don't have the right connections. I do wonder if some rental apartments mandate coin laundry.

I actually want to understand why too, because I consider a washer and dryer to be basic appliances. IMO some rental places have coin laundry maybe so landlord can make some more $$$ or something.   Other times, for older buildings, maybe the infrastructure just isn't there and it's pretty infeasible to make such radical changes.
text:I'm a landlord, I own a condo in an apartment style building. I looked at getting a washer and dryer in my unit, but there wasn't the proper venting for the dryer in place. It was an issue with the building that wasn't possible to change from my unit. So as you mentioned, an infrastructure issue. I'm happy though at least that the use of the laundry facilities in the building is free for my tenants to use.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:I wash underwear, socks, masks, leggings, and tank tops (I wear one under most outfits for smoothness/sweat!) after each wear. Outer layers like sweaters, hoodies, etc after three or four wears. Jeans after four or more wears— can usually tell by how they feel and fit that they’re ready for a wash.  Bralettes when they start to smell!
text:How do you separate your laundry? I’ve been separating it by “type” but everyone I know does it by color. Now I’m starting to wonder if I’m doing something wrong, but washing black underwear with black jeans just bc theyre the same color sounds so odd to me	labels:I always have my whites separate because it keeps the white 'crisp'.  I've found that washing whites in a mixed load can make them go dull or a bit grey looking. Sometimes I will put one or two light pastels in with them if I need to make up a full load- but only if I know they're colourfast.  I don't separate out all my other colors though. Reds and greens etc just get whammied in with my black jeans	episode_done:True

text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:Personally, I would say it all boils down to feeling like I need a 'treat' when I'm having a tough time. I grew up with a single mum and money was kind of tight, so although she did the best she could, I didn't have a games console or label clothes or the latest trendy toys, and I only ever got anything at christmas or on my birthday. I learnt from very early on not to pester my mum for something in the shop, because the answer was always no.  When I got older and had my own money, I loved to save it. I didn't really get to go anywhere, and so if I did have the occasional day out with friends, I'd make the most of it and spend the money I had been saving up. I guess along the way it became like a special treat that made me feel like I had a chance at 'fitting in' with my friends and finding myself, because I got the chance to buy things that weren't picked out by an adult as a gift or second- third- fourth- hand from the car boot or charity shop.  Nowadays, impulse buys give me a surge of happiness that I can be who I want and buy what I want, and it just makes me feel better when I'm struggling.

text:Messy eaters? Tell your stories and hacks / fixes.	labels:Why do extra work when you can just git gud at putting food in your mouth hole? Changing your wardrobe, carrying a bib, or changing clothes to eat is a bit silly of a solution to a problem that can be remedied by becoming less messy, no?    I'm sure that's not what anyone wants to hear, but I don't see this as markedly different than a child who has to learn to put away their toys. Messy eating isn't some genetic anomaly, you can simply exercise more control over how you eat. It may even be as simple as slowing down or leaning forward more over a table/desk.
text:True. Habits can be hard to change though. I think some are more important to prioritize over others. These days I am more focused on health. But I should try slowing down since that aligns well with better health. Leaning into the table seems like maybe like a suboptimal solution that could lead to bad posture. But who knows...  I'm curious. You've never spilled anything on yourself?  So far I frankly just expect it to happen sometimes.  Most clothes and most of my shirts are fairly inexpensive. Even my sweaters.  But recently I did start to upgrade my wardrobe.. still, wouldn't be the end of the world to replace if even necessary.  But I was still curious what other people did & I am happy to read everyone's take	labels:>You've never spilled anything on yourself?  Of course I have, but not with any frequency that it's something I think about. If I had to venture a guess, I'd put it at maybe 3 times a year?

Some of them are silly.  &#x200B;  I don't think it matters that much.   &#x200B;  But I'd rather keep a spare white shirt around if possible like someone already mentioned instead of leaning into the table when I eat. But to each their own. Or just get my clothes dirty... it may happen anyway.	labels:Admittedly messier-eater-than-I'd-like, here too. I'm in the same boat - I've been more conscientious of not letting oil splatter while cooking, being more careful while eating, etc. I have become better at this, but to OP's point, it's easier said that done to change a habit you've carried for decades.	episode_done:True

text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:As someone who used to exclusively wear black (not exaggerating, it was a manifestation an anxiety/ocd problem- lots of therapy, baby steps, and now I consider leopard and hot pink neutrals), I found it easiest to start with accessories (especially shoes!) and patterns that were mostly black. Dark florals go with just about everything. Once I got used to that, I branched out into floral pants and funky sweaters. There was definitely trial and error, and I spent a ton of money on items that ultimately went to consignment it goodwill. However, now I have a really good idea of what I like, and while I still love a good neutral moment, my wardrobe is probably 1/2 colorful pieces, 1/4 non-black neutrals, and 1/4 black pieces.	episode_done:True

Hands thrust in pockets, lounging on a picnic blanket, feet up binging Netflix?  An interesting thought exists that as mens casual wear became more acceptable that suiting became more structured and stiff. Thoughts?
text:I love the idea of this, although really good custom tailoring as they describe in the article is not exactly easy to come by. I think you are right about suiting; nowadays it seems exclusively reserved for weddings, special events, etc. and is rarely intended for every day wear.   Still, I almost always get dressed up to some extent when I’m WFH. I can’t bear to sit around in sweatpants and an old tee all day like a lot of people seem to do. Look good, feel good!	labels:Obviously the level of tailoring available to the Royal Family and their personal means, makes wearing suits more practical for them than most people. Of course what's interesting about HRH Prince Charles is that he WEARS his suits, meaning that they are repaired and adjusted and stay with him for decades...it's a very Trad approach to clothing.	episode_done:True
text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:I do pretty well at smaller, “high-end” consignment stores and I **love** getting a good deal.  * Pay attention to fabrics. A lot of brands make nice clothes in cheap fabrics. To me, this defeats the purpose of buying from “fancy” brands.  * Have an idea of what you want before you go shopping, but be open to other options. I love coats and have gotten two great coats on consignment when I was really there to check out the shoes. It’s also a good idea to shop for items that are out of season but that aren’t so trendy that you won’t feel like wearing them when the right season rolls around. Now would be a great time to shop for boots, for example (assuming you’re in the northern hemisphere).  * If you’re comfortable shopping in person during these crazy times, try stuff on! Even if the fit isn’t perfect, trying stuff on can help you see which areas may need to be tailored. If you’re getting a garment that retails for $700 on consignment for less than $100, spending a bit of money on tailoring is still a bargain.  * Be patient! I got a very cute pair of heeled loafers by Bally after searching for a proper pair of heeled loafers for MONTHS. Persistence is key!	episode_done:True

text:What are your favourite ways to style a black leather moto jacket?	labels:People have already covered the dresses, but the dress/leather jacket combo is for sure one of my favorite ways to style them.

I love wearing it with a white top, light wash jeans, and my black leather combat boots (for me, doc martens but could be any boot with a similar color/texture to the jacket) bc i feel like a rocker from the 80s.

Prior to that I was in a job where I had to wear skirts, I wore collared tees/shirts, jumpers and cardies with them.  That takes me back to 1981.  Before that, too long ago to remember but certainly not "business wear", and before that when at uni/college/school, I guess the then equivalent of what I wear today.

text:Overhauling my wardrobe with lasting pieces	labels:People may turn their noses up at Banana Republic but I think they offer great value especially if you are a tall fellow. They have a 50 percent off sale quarterly and you could easily overhaul your wardrobe for like less than 500 bucks. They definitely lean more classic/conservative. You aren’t going to be turning heads but you won’t be out of style either. Longevity is probably the only thing you need to be wary of. Their denim, chinos and jackets have been good for me, but their knitwear is hit or miss.
text:I second this recommendation for OP.  Banana Republic is my go-to for exactly three things: Inoffensive winter basics, chinos, and short-sleeve prints (because for some bizarre reason, they're great at them). When I say winter basics, I mean solid-color sweaters/cardigans/pullovers. BR hits an amazing value proposition when their stuff is on sale.   Not sure any of it will last 10 years, but I don't think that's a realistic expectation for any clothing except suits.	labels:Good to know! Thanks so much for that valuable inputs 🙏	episode_done:True

I’d also pay attention to the content of the compliment. “That’s a cool sweater” is NOT the same thing as “you look great in that sweater”, KWIM?   Sometimes people are appreciating the design or color or novelty of an item and not the big picture of how it works for you.
text:It's a lot weirder for someone, regardless of interest, sex, gender, etc. relative to the recipient of the compliment, to say "you look great in x" rather than "x is cool." The less potential implications behind a statement like that, the less it has room to be misinterpreted.	labels:Exactly.

text:You know how audiophiles all make jokes about how meaningless the terms used to describe sound are because sound is so hard to define in that way? Same thing here, “warm” and “cold” are very loose terms that probably mean something a little different to everyone.   I can see the argument for grey and cream being cold, brown can be warm or cold depending on the shade, not sure if I’d agree with black.	labels:Now *that's* an argument I understand. Although I still think the way he's communicating is strange. I think he means tonally neutral, bland, desaturated colors. "Cold" is a really strange way to say that, whether or not the term is technically ambiguous.
text:>I think he means tonally neutral, bland, desaturated colors  I would argue that’s what cold means, while blue is generally cold, I don’t think cold means “more blue”, it’s more about the relative saturation and intensity of the color, basically you have to judge what makes a certain color warm or cold totally in comparison to other similar shades, not as a general sliding scale of “brown is warm, blue is cold, always”, though, like I said this is all a semi useable way of describing it.  Going back to the audio examples, I always see vinyl described as sounding “warmer” than digital, when I first heard albums I knew on vinyl my first reaction was “wow that sounds really different”, immediately followed by “wow, I _definitely_ wouldn’t describe that as warmer”, so, I do get the confusion	labels:Exactly, which is best exemplified when Simon talks about certain blues being warmer (more saturated) vs cooler (less saturated)	episode_done:True

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:I'd say to some degree yes. Most fashion houses are rtw/couture first and accessories second. They dipped into the handbag and accessories market to make more money, but the real quality (and bread and butter) for most fashion houses is their rtw.   Chanel is in this weird spot where they're trying to outrun the secondhand market and regain the exclusivity they once had. They're trying to be Hermes but they could never be Hermes because Chanel is not known for their leather.   So yes, I think when it comes to handbags/SLGs/accessories most luxury houses are trying to put out the latest and greatest and kind of mimic fast fashion to some degree. They're appealing to a market that can't afford to become their regular clientele. The people whom they can't text when the latest $7000 tweed jacket is released each season and know that they can walk away with a $10,000+ sale. So brands are trying to push out the latest and greatest handbags, SLGs and shoes.   In terms of rtw, I do think the traditional fashion calendar is very fast paced, but several brands have said they will step away from the traditional calendar and cut it back down to 2-3 releases per year. It will be interesting to see what this means for S/S and F/W collections.   Commenting more on the handbag/accessories market:  I say this as someone is kind of handbag crazy, but I do wish people would do more research about the brands and bags they purchase. People assume that just because a bag is marked up it's handmade by an artisan who specializes in leather but that isn't the case for most brands.   If anyone is looking for Hermes alternatives I highly suggest Delvaux. Valextra and Moynat also have fantastic craftsmanship. But I bought my first box leather bag from Delvaux last year and it's on a completely different level from Chanel.
text: "regain the exclusivity they once had" - Is that possible? Chanel has too many brand ambassadors that just doesn't scream Chanel.	labels:I think they’re headed in the right direction with all of their price increases. When Chanel increases their prices, the prices on the secondhand market go up. So I guess that’s kind of on their side. On the purse forum, people say the goal is for the jumbo flap to be 10K.   I think it’s fine for Chanel to evolve from the Lagerfeld era.
text:They need to evolve and create a new identity post Lagerfeld era. It does need a revamp so I understand why they want to go back to exclusivity but they also need ambassadors who fit that image as well.	labels:I think once there’s an established image they decide they want. Brands have to evolve to cater to other demographics and markets, especially the eastern market. So of course their ambassadors will be more diverse in style/taste.

About $1500 gone.

text:I'm Not a Watch Guy I Swear - Street x Sprezza	labels:I am a watch guy, but very much a relatively broke one.  Had I known how much trouble it would be to break into watches, I might have said never mind and wisely walked away. I didn’t, though.   Some pointers for those interested:  1.	The cost of the watch is only the upfront cost. Like a car, a mechanical watch needs regular maintenance. Generally speaking, this will be anywhere from $300 to $1,000+...every 5-7 years.  2.	Because of point #1, entry level (~ $500) mechanical watches are not pieces you will pass down to your kids. In fact, it is usually cheaper to trash them entirely and buy new than to bother having them serviced.  3.	People will tell you there are deals to be had in the vintage market. That’s true, but it can also be difficult to find parts or people willing to work on them. 4.	There is relatively little offered between entry level and about $3,000.  5.	There is nothing wrong with wearing a quartz or digital watch.   All that being said, I still love my small collection. Just wish I had known those things from the start.
text:hard disagree with point #4. See: Nomos, Sinn, Seiko, Grand Seiko quartz, Damasko, etc.	labels:Sinns that are worth it are like 2.2k or something. So yeah technically there's stuff that's worth it between entry level and 3k but it's like two or three models from one or two brands and it's usually utility watches. And if OP said between entry level and 2k his point would be very strong.  And I don't have anything against that, I have a limited edition 104 I wear a lot, it goes for 2.6 and I bought it at 2.4 or something. I also have a GS but it's like 7k or something because it's a spring drive GMT.

text:How do ya'll express your culture or traditional fashion in modern clothing?	labels:I’m Vietnamese, and I’ve only recently been interested in my cultural clothing because of - well, internalized racism, which wasn’t great, LOL. But what I’ve done is save up for custom áo dài!  Traditionally, áo dài is pretty eye-catching, especially in the U.S. (where I live). I’m saving up to create tailor-made áo dài that’s more modern and something understated I could wear often: for example, switching out white silk pants for black ones, and the main dress for a crushed navy velvet. I find that modernizing cultural clothing can be a way to represent your cultural and ethnic roots without feeling strange or like an impostor, and seeing the same, familiar cuts in different prints and tones that I like fills me with a whole new type of joy.  I also follow other people who wear modernized cultural clothing. The first example that comes to mind is @asunnydisposish on Twitter, who is an artist but often posts pictures of her putfits (modernized hanbok). I have an album of Vietnamese clothing outside of áo dài (like áo nhật bình) and other designers’ takes on modern áo dài, and another album of textures, prints, and fabrics I would kill to wear.   Other ways you can incorporate this into your clothing is supporting artists and designers from whatever ethnic group/culture you belong to!  If anyone’s interested in seeing the albums, I’m more than willing to share; I just don’t know how to operate imgur yet, which seems to be the go-to for everyone here. I hope this helped!

text:The Terribly High Cost of Cheap Goods	labels:So let me throw another constraint in the mix and ask what the heck do you do if you’re an odd size as well? Like I wear a 37-38” sleeve. That’s not easy to find anywhere and now if we cut out fast fashion that cuts out like 75% of my main sources  Like I think I’d be fine buying fewer, higher-quality, ethically-made clothes but I have to be able to find ones that fit, and the ratings seldom talk about extended sizes beyond adding more Xes before the L	episode_done:True

text:Everyone’s opinions on Youtube fashion channels?	labels:One of few Youtubers I follow is Safiya Nygaard, mainly because her fashion videos tend be very well thought out. She actually does the research on the history of styles and trends, provides insight on why certain things were worn and what they inspired, stuff like that. She has her own very distinct style, but clearly enjoys learning about new and different things. She tries out alot of fashion-related things but is really informative about them, and not doing it just because she can. Videos of other Youtubers that I've tried to watch, seem to focus alot more on the "haul" and materialism aspect which isn't necessarily bad, but bores me. Some of them actually have interesting items or outfits, but they don't go beyond "hey, doesn't this look cool" or "hey I got this thing everyone else wants".   Safiya is also hilarious, and her interactions with her now husband (who shoots the videos) are so wholesome!	episode_done:True

text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:As I gotten older, my weight has mostly gone to my thighs. So my emo/scene skinny neon jeans didn't really fit. I've also kinda changed how I view myself in general. So I've kept the music but changed the pants. I wear a lot of high waist loose/straight leg pants now. Most of my pants aren't jeans either. I've really gotten into other fabrics.	episode_done:True

text:The Style Blogger Index: finding people who are the same size as you	labels:I found none that even resembled me, and I have a conventional type body. Even those who seemed slightly like me, had obviously not told the truth about their measurements
text:I'm so sorry. The database is still very small  (under 600) and the app is only representative of a few hundred (it needs an update, and even then can only represent those who entered 100% of the data without exceptions -- limitations in the programming until I can actually get a web developer.) Please let me know if there's anything you think I can do to improve this, including giving more explicit instructions to participants. The survey does provide measuring instructions, but self reporting does have its limitations and there are always going to be inconsistencies. But I am very open to suggestions for improvement! Even if it's not currently feasible, maybe it will be one day if I ever get funding (the dream, right?)	labels:This is a really neat tool! I didn't find a good size twin for myself but it is awesome to be able to search like this. I think if you added some measurements other than bust/waist/hip and height, it might help account for different body composition.
text:I was thinking about creating a sewists index with additional measurements! The trouble with adding new variables now is that I would have to manually go back and contact each individual participant (and i don't have they're email address since the survey would have to display them publicly) to get that info retroactively. But i could add them in as optional metrics for future users. Or volunteers could help me contact existing entrants but I'm not holding my breath :D	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I haven't worked in a proper business casual place in a long time. My office is casual and I tend to dress up.   As mentioned, it depends on what level of casual is implied. I always took it as sort of one casual element, and the rest is regular business.   So I feel like you can do a couple of angles.   One of my favorite angles is a fancy version of something casual. E.g. a jogger in a trouser fabric or a shirt dress shape in a nicer fabric (like a wool knit, or some sort of jersey knit or silk. Or a shirt dress but with sheen.   The other angle is one casual element with a dressy outfit. E.g. nice dress with fancy sneakers. Or jeans with a blouse, blazer,  and "nice shoes."  Or maybe a sheath dress with a moto or jean jacket.   My default work outfit is usually a dress, and I feel like depending on the shape it could either go casual or dressy. And it jut ends up being a lot easier for me. I have dresses that are a bit more casual and ones that are a bit more fancy. The fancy ones get a casual piece and the casual ones get a fancy piece.	episode_done:True

text:Online Styling Services?	labels:Not sure if I’m a darling or a villain around here so I won’t throw my friends under the bus by posting links or Instagram names but highly recommend just asking a stylish friend while offering to pay for time, my hair person does all kinds of services for me and has been behind my best courtroom looks from growing out bangs for final arguments to when to bust out the red emoji lady dress.  Not for personal styling but for makeup I’ve slid into the DM’s of a couple makeup artists for online lessons, game changing.
text:Ooohh thanks for sharing! I actually rarely go clothes shopping with my friends so I'll try it out more	labels:Ask someone for a zoom hour of going through what you have and recs.  The more specific you can be about your preferences and limitations (for me I don’t do dry cleaning or heels over 1.5) the better your results will be, pro’s and the online services have a form you go through but what I really like asking a friend is the bonding experience and cute compliments, people are always flattered when you tell them that you admire their style.

text:More Men Reach for Sewing Machines	labels:Learning to sew darts, hem trousers, bring in trouser legs, and wastebands, have been some of the biggest savers of my favourite items and keeping up with the fluctuations of weight and style that come with life.        Not to mention jeans repair, crotch on my nudies is more darning than original fabric now. Worn in look on a reliable pair of jeans that fit nicely is hard to imitate.

text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:Glasses are cheap enough now (via something like warby Parker) where you can experiment with this style and see if you make it work or not.   As a fellow glasses user - I treat my glasses as an accessory. I have 10 pairs I alternate between (though truly 2-3 in heavy rotation). Warby Parker changed the game and made this possible.   So you do you man - see if you can make it work and if not then well you have a pair you can use at home :)  Me personally? I have prescription sunglasses and glasses for separate occasions haha if these are more than warby prices I personally would not opt for transitions  Hope this helps!
text:>Warby Parker  I thought I had enough frames haha  I have a similar plastic ones like the Warby Parker already - will be making them sunglasses as the prescription on them is old  &#x200B;  but for these frames, they are expensive yes, but for a good reason really (and I don't mind paying cuz I wear glasses 14-17 hours and won't be doing eye surgery anytime soon)  ...I think like you, in terms of having sunglasses on the side - and prescription seperate  What concerns me the most is the looks - if it will be ruined, having silver frames and some transitions on an expensive frame, most of my family tells me don't do those gimmicks, but 1 is like it might be cool and enhance the look of the shiny silver frame? idk	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:I think that this really depends on what type of washing machine you have access to. If you have a modern, front loading machine, with multiple wash settings, you can relatively easily machine wash many “hand wash only” items. I’ve had varying results with top loaders or old front loading washers-I find them more rough on clothes. Most items do ok on a delicates cycle with cold water for both stages. I often wash sweaters on the wool setting (cold water, low spin) or soak my sweaters with euclean and spin dry-er in the machine before laying flat to dry. Most of the damage to clothes happens in the dryer IMO. Also, brands often put dry clean only or hand wash only because they haven’t tested the fabric for machine wash and want plausible deniability-thus many things can survive with machine wash cold and air dry. But your results may naturally vary based on the piece of clothing. I personally only buy stuff that I feel is very special that is not machine wash air dry safe. Otherwise I feel like laundry ends up taking too much of my life, and it isn’t worth it to me.
text:This. Every front loader I've ever used has had a hand wash cycle which just gently rocks the clothes in water and doesn't spin them.  I don't hand wash anything other than my face cloths and masks (simply because it's quicker).	labels:	episode_done:True

text:“I'm all locked down with nowhere to go – but that hasn't killed my lust for fashion”	labels:I have one suggestion, get dressed and take pictures. It doesn't have to be for Instagram/facebook. It can be for just yourself. If you really like an outfit, remember it with a picture. You can take it in a park, or at a location that is memorable for you, with your SO, or with your cat. You should at least get a few good pictures with you pet in the 10+ years they reside with you.  It's actually a fun learning experience, on how to use the cameras. I am interested in photography and usually use a dslr, but for selfies, dslrs are not as good. With an iphone, I think it's an entirely different genre of photography. You have to use completely different lighting system, etc., to use it to its full potential.

text:Actually Sustainable: How Brands Are Going Vintage	labels:Or buy fewer clothes of much better quality which suit your physique, in a colour which suits your complexion and of a style which is classic.

text:Wolf vs Goat Fonzie Goes to India t-shirt Review and Fit	labels:I'd be curious to hear how these hold up over time.  I bought into the WvG reddit frenzy a few years ago and got a set of tees. I've honestly been horribly underwhelmed with the quality, especially after ~6 months of light/normal use (i.e., worn once a week). They were great at first, but within one year stitching was coming undone on all the shirts. I was very disappointed in the quality especially after all the talk on reddit of how high quality WvG are.

text:Let's talk about sneakers	labels:Probably depends on where you live.   When I was in elementary school in the 90's, the chunky adidas were popular like the superstar. In middle school, the nike AF1s high tops were really popular and also the K Swiss sneakers and the Phat farm ones (throwback). But they resembled the classic adidas stan smith/superstars. In high school, I remember wearing really chunky "skater" sneakers and slip-ons. I remember wearing DCs. In college it was the chucks. Then after I graduated it was those suede vans, and the slip on vans as well as the keds. Now I see a lot of stan smiths, superstars, AF1s, chucks, common projects and those adidas NMD / yeezy. I have yet to encounter more than a hand full of people wearing those big chunky sneakers at all. Only a few who were tourists.  TBH it just feels like everyone just wears whatever the popular sneaker of X company is, and since all of the above are still around, and because social media bubble aesthetics influence groups of people to choose whatever shoe suits them from whatever popular company, the outcome is that all of those sneakers are still very much alive and kicking....	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys who like a formal/business look manage to not look the same all the time?	labels:If you don’t like to switch up colors or silhouettes, how about switching up textures? Silk turtlenecks, velvet dressy pants, boucle jackets, etc?
text:I agree here - if what you like is the silhouette, switch up color.  If what you like is the color, switch up silhouette.  If you can't part with both (i.e., black/gray, dressy pants and turtlenecks everyday), go for textures/materials - I have a charcoal cardigan with black leather pockets that's so fun.  One final thought: outerwear	labels:Thanks so much for adding to that!!  And outerwear oof i feel bad - I own two coats and I love them both dearly, they’re basically the same fancy coat, but one in black and one in tan. If my outfits are repetitive let’s not talk about mh outerwear!

text:Ah sorry for the delayed response!!  I was really into Kensie Rebekah Crepe blazers (with satin lining) for a while - they are pretty comfy and come in a ton of fun colors, but some of them looked cheaper than others and I just couldn't put my finger on why other than that perhaps the fabric content wasn't identical with some of the colors, causing some to pile more easily than the others.  I ended up selling a few on poshmark.  I really like the drape and fit of NY&C Ponte/Sweater blazers - they have a longer length than the Kensie ones and feel more casual prep than the Kensie ones - and they are super versatile and comfy, but they have enough structure to feel professional.  I wish I could find more of them but they seem not be sold too often at the official site so I rely on Poshmark - I have one in black and also a heathered tan/oatmeal color.  I have recently gotten into these relaxed/cardigan type blazers that I got through Stitch Fix - FrenchMauve Melanie Knit Tunic Blazer and Skies Are Blue Hannah Modal Scuba Blazer are really comfortable.  They have a similar long length as the NY&C ones but are much less structured - they are more flexible/thinner and feel like a dressed up cardigan that's a tad less professional.  J. Crew also has some nice sweater blazers but it's a bit of a hit or miss for me on fit/cut/drape - good structure though!!	labels:	episode_done:True

It’s the coldest leather I’ve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I’ve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I’m glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there’s no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 19, 2021	labels:I asked this in yesterday's chat, but I'm sharing again for visibility & hoping someone with experience with this issue:  Does anyone have a recommendation for a specific brand, material, or style of pants (including jeans, slacks, etc.) that are comfortable, stretchy/non-restricting, lightweight, and would fit a taller individual well? My husband usually wears linen shorts but would need to get some new, longer pants for a potential new job. He doesn't like the feel of most typical jeans and slacks and has trouble finding the right fit for his height. Any other guys with a similar issue? Maybe a suggestion for where to shop? Thanks in advance for your help!

text:What clothing items have you reverted back to since WFH/quarantine?	labels:I've really been embracing dressing more youthful. I'm in my early/mid 20s, and now that I've worked a couple years at the same place, I'm wearing more what I want than boring professional. I also started caring about what I wear and planning my outfits. Velvet shoes, corduroy overalls, rainbow prints, sequins, bold colors. Who cares? I've been called out for dressing "fancy" before, but I've stopped giving a shit in correlation with my confidence in my abilities. I'm a teacher...if anything, I'm showing the students it's okay to be yourself and take risks.

text:Future of fibers?	labels:Personally I don’t find it very difficult or expensive to shop for clothing made with natural fibers — if anything it’s gotten even easier to do so with online shopping and websites showing fiber content right in the product description. I don’t have to seek out brands that specialize in natural materials either — my clothing is mostly from Madewell, which doesn’t really market itself as being all that environmentally conscious or sustainable, and is definitely not a high end brand, but they have tons of options for clothing made of cotton, silk, etc.   I will say it’s gotten harder to find sweaters made of 100% wool over the years, however. I have several wool sweaters from mall brands that I bought just a few years ago. I gained some weight since then and have been looking for replacements from the same exact brands and it seems like they don’t even bother with 100% wool anymore, all of their sweaters are now made with acrylic, nylon, polyester, etc. That’s the only natural fiber that I feel has all but disappeared from the mainstream for some reason.   I will also add that I don’t think man made fibers are necessarily “cheap”, either. We’ve come a long way from man made materials of the 80s and 90s. When I think of man made fibers of today, I think of technical clothing and gear such as outdoor or sportswear. Patagonia for example is the poster child for environmentally friendly brands, but most of their clothing is made from man made materials, and their products are far from cheap. Partly because it performs better for its purpose, and partly because it’s supposed last a lifetime.  Which leads me to my last thought — IMO man made materials aren’t necessarily bad for the environment. It’s really our habits that are bad, and the industries that cater to these habits. If we all bought a few items of clothing that were all man made and lasted our lifetime, that is arguably *more* environmentally friendly than if we were constantly buying and throwing away natural fibered clothing.
text:This is the point I came to make, IDK how people are having difficulty finding natural fibers, my entire wardrobe is 100% cotton and linen and I shop at like, Zara and H&M lmao.   Most jeans are sturdy 100% cotton these days, it's easy to find cotton t-shirts, cotton knits and stuff like that...I guess silk is the only one I haven't really seen, but even wool pops up here and there even though, I agree, it's harder to find.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Wish we could just ban people for this shit  Any conversation around "you have to be attractive/tall/skinny to pull this off", when taken to its logical conclusion, is just people saying that people that don't fit Western beauty standards look objectively bad *at all times* regardless of what they're wearing or doing  Like I've seen people say that if you're short or if you're overweight you can't wear "x", but the "x" is basically everything, and they never seem to reach the point where they admit that they just think that the best certain people can hope for is inoffensive or unnoticeable, which disgusts me	labels:I've talked about this before but a lot of these "rules" that people talk about like "don't wear $thing if you're $characteristic" have to main parts to it:  1.

text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I've written about this before, but as someone who is 5'2 on a good day, I have stopped giving a shit about looking "longer and leaner."  In fact, I reject the idea that I should want to look taller. Maybe all those 5'7 women should be taking advice on how to make their legs look as stubby as mine. <--Obviously a joke but to make a point. How stupid is it that I should feel like my natural body is something to correct?  I'm an old woman, lol, and over the course of my life I have never found that my stubby legs (that I was once self-conscious about) have kept me from career advancement or from finding people who thought I was beautiful and wanted to have sex with me, so what's the freaking problem?  Fuck conventional figure flattery.  That being said, of course there are things I think look better on me than other things and I tend to wear the things I think look better in ways I think look better most of the time.  Except when the comfort or beauty of a garment is so outstanding it overrules that.  Thanks for coming to my TED talk.  There are cookies on the table in the back.
text:As someone even shorter ---and I bet older--- I agree!  No clothing trick is going to make people think I'm 5'7" , or even 5'3" for that matter.  So what?

text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:Depends on what the day is like for me.  I have the Madewell Medium Leather Transport Tote currently as my daily go-to and I normally have my phone, keys, wallet, some basic toiletries (chapstick, eye drops, ibuprofen, candies in case blood sugar gets low) in a small zipped bag, and more often than I'd like there are some random receipts and other things that should be cleared out.  When I'm traveling, all the extra space in the bag is used for things like carrying a light cardigan, small water bottle, headphones, small notebook, and other necessities for the day. It's been great for it's versatility.  I've thought about the idea of getting a higher end purse, (I think the Neverfull Tote from LV looks nice) but I honestly can't seem to confidently justify spending 10x more on basically the same thing (large tote bag) I currently have. Would like to hear more on why people buy luxury items and their experiences!
text:To answer the justification question - cost per wear. My own NF is going on 12 years old now and still looks reasonably new, and I am not (and have not been) particularly kind with it either. I've tossed it around, dragged it on planes, beaches, through Asian wet markets etc. and it's still happily trucking along. The LV Canvas is notoriously hard-wearing.  Along the same line, quality of material used to construct the item. I currently also own leather bags from Everlane and Away. They're both well made, but you can tell the leather is substantially lower in quality, thickness and overall substance than say, my mother's Prada totes with leather that feels really thick and luxurious and plush. And with the Everlane bag, the unfinished suede interior is much rougher than the unfinished suede interiors of say, Celine bags and the leather is much, much thinner.  And while not all designer bags will age well, there is a reason Hermes bags can be handed down through generations but my Everlane bag will probably die before I do.     ETA: LV aside, the aftercare services are also generally pretty amazing. There are brands that will take your bag back and "spa" them for free or nominal fees. You don't get that kind of service with Madewell or Everlane.	labels:	episode_done:True

Give it away or sell it for $40 or something. Make it a bit more accessible. Obviously, if there’s a demand, there’s nothing wrong with selling high.

I bought a sweet waxed canvas pencil case from SFBags that can hold my gear and maybe some small stuff for my wife.   Heading to work, I have a nice laptop bag and drop that case in there. During the day, I carry the case around with me.  It’s nice enough not to look out of place, but also blends into the environment enough not to generate a ton of questions.	episode_done:True

text:I love the idea of this, although really good custom tailoring as they describe in the article is not exactly easy to come by. I think you are right about suiting; nowadays it seems exclusively reserved for weddings, special events, etc. and is rarely intended for every day wear.   Still, I almost always get dressed up to some extent when I’m WFH. I can’t bear to sit around in sweatpants and an old tee all day like a lot of people seem to do. Look good, feel good!	labels:>	I can’t bear to sit around in sweatpants and an old tee all day like a lot of people seem to do. Look good, feel good!  I really feel this.

text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:To add onto the rest of the great advice in this thread, following the color trends can be helpful in seeing how color looks on others and how you can apply them to yourself. I follow some accounts that specifically photograph folks during fashion week in various locales, and there's so much vibrancy that occurs there with colors that you might not expect to fit together. It helps to have these (kind of) practical examples in mind before you go on blowing money on colorful goods.  I've never actually done a color analysis, personally, but intuitively over time you will get a sense for what flatters you. You can even try holding random household items like Clorox wipes (lol) or notebooks up to your face or skin to see if that color would work as an actual item on you, preferably in good natural lighting where it won't distort the tones so much. I also like to accessorize with one small bright thing at a time, like bags, belts, scarves, or jewelry. Another way to do this is with wearing nail polish, either different colors on your nails all at once or specific parts of a palette to see if that combination is flattering with your skin tone.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:r/zerowaste has had discussions on the topic. So has r/frugal I guess and there are a few other subs. I don't think there is a fixed rule. The world is changing too fast for that.  Maybe the key is to scale down spending, thrift as much as possible and be critical when shopping. Price does not necessarily equals quality.    The way I see it, high-end brands are just expensive. Nowadays luxury brands seem to be as mass-produced as anything else. Profit above all.  I also have realized that brand loyalty in the 21st century might have become a bit silly. I have trusted brands in the past but it seems pointless now, bc even sizing can change randomly.  Maybe customers shd spend more carefully. Buy what is needed, make sure what you are getting is looking good on you, it looks well-made and it feels nice on your skin. It is better to have fewer garments that make you look superb than many trashy pieces that will not do you any justice. Every person has their beauty, we shd only have and wear what makes us look fabulous.  My two cents	episode_done:True

text:Mostly business info but I was wondering: How is your business doing?   Why does Savile Row as a collective not really work together on marketing and media?      Is there a big gap between a Tailor's management and workers?	labels:Business for us is doing exceptionally well, thank you for asking. We are unique in the Savile Row shops that we have a fully equipped team in the US (cutter, undercutter, seller, etc.) so have been able to keep the US business thriving while most of our competitors have not been able to travel to the US. Its been a slight rise YOY. Coincidentally, we are most worried about Q1 2021.   The short answer is that most of the shops on Savile Row just don't do much marketing, period. We have done some stuff here and there with different partners to get word out, but it is still very much an old school, word of mouth business. With that there is still a strong reliance on the thought process of "**We** are Savile Row! They will come to **us**!". Its a bit antiquated, and isn't the best aspect of the business. Also, most of the marketing and media opportunities that do come through tend to heavily advantage one shop or another, and therefore you want to do what you can to highlight your own brand vs. all of the shops. Think of someone like PTO or Permanent Style doing an article on one of the Saville Row shops -- they won't be likely to name drop all of the other shops along the way.   I'm not quite sure what you are asking about the third question, if you'd like to clarify I'm happy to answer. Are you asking if there is a gap between who manages the tailors and the tailors themselves? Cutters vs. Tailors?	episode_done:True

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls” catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your “fashion house designers” but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I’ve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.

Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.

text:What work for my boyfriends taste and body type?	labels:Consider directing him here, he'll know his preferences better than you. I'd recommend the Basic Bastard in the sidebar, his problems aren't all that unique and most of his questions have probably already been answered in the sidebar.  >He’s got cold undertones and a lot of ruddiness, with ashy hair. So I have a rough idea of what colours look good on him.   Yeah I say don't even think about this. It's very limiting, and considering how little skin menswear shows it doesn't matter at all even if he looks a bit washed out. The clothes take up like 10x more space than his face and hands, which  means that in my opinion the main thing should be matching THEIR colours.	episode_done:True
text:Interesting article on luxury fashion made in Italy.	labels:I remember reading this article a few months ago, agree with u/jameane re: Deluxe. It's a good read. Luxury is so secretive about their supply chain and manufacturing that you cannot really get a good sense of who is crafting your goods and whether it's ethically done. Shit, I'll probably still buy a luxury item once in a while, but my eyes are a lot more open to exactly how much I am paying for the *experience* rather than the goods themselves.	episode_done:True

Well not totally true, I have a convertible Ebag laptop backpack for work, and I have an old The Sak of my mothers for when I have to carry a purse, that I hold in the direction that does not show the stain.  I'm not trying to be those people who chime in on a fashion sub all like "I hate fashion" lol.  I just find it curious because I'm slightly obsessed with clothing and style, and yet have never had any interest in bags and I'm not sure why.  Better for my wallet I suppose though.

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:Yes! I’ve never worn heels regularly but am genetically pre-disposed to foot problems and have had multiple foot surgeries. I’ve been trying to commit to flats or low heels (under an inch) only. It’s so hard when your legs aren’t stick thin and the standard in formal and professional womenswear is always a freaking heel. I’m starting to accept that certain pants/dresses/skirts won’t work on me without a heel. So I spend less money on variety and heeled shoes but more time looking for stylish flat shoes and clothing that works with them. Unfortunately I don’t have any blogs to share. Just wanted to commiserate and say that it’s ok to avoid heels completely for medical reasons - the mythical comfortable heeled shoe doesn’t exist for some of us!	episode_done:True

text:Not so much the process but the opportunity to actually work there: How old are you and how did you originally get into that line of work?	labels:I'm in my mid-20's. Have been working in menswear for the entirety of my working years, so almost a decade in the business now.   While its not exciting -- I started at Brooks Brothers. This was years ago, when the brand stood for something. I got to work along some hardcore industry vets who took me under their wing.   Then over the years I have gotten to work at just about every "type" of menswear shop. Big box retailers, flashy online-only outfits, bottom of the barrel makers, the extreme top of the top family owned shops.   I've been able to do everything within the business, too. I've sold, designed collections, marketed, ran operations, did the buying, taken out the trash, taped up and shipped orders. The whole thing.	episode_done:True
text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:Goodwill totally depends on the area. I'm from a college town and their Goodwill has amazing stuff, probably because there isn't a consignment store in town so they get everything. I live in a big city now and the Goodwills are completely picked through and don't have many trendy items but I would still go to find jeans to turn into cut offs or something. Buffalo Exchange is a consignment store so they don't accept anything damaged or dated, but its a little more expensive. I recommend Poshmark for workout clothes because you can search by brand and size. I buy shoes at Goodwill and don't have a problem since usually you can tell if they're heavily used or not.
text:My local goodwill is sooo overpriced! You’re so lucky! We have a local consignment shop run by my friend's mother and it is awesome, but I think they’re suffering due to the pandemic (the shop is very small and jam-packed).  I really want to check out the GW bins, too! It's definitely on my post-pandemic bucket list	labels:	episode_done:True

text:The Style Blogger Index: finding people who are the same size as you	labels:It's really interesting how someone with my height, size and even shape can be so different from me. I am right now quite into the Kibbe body type system, so it's helpful to understand that someone with my size and even same waist/bust can have a completely body structure (for example I am frame dominant and am visually wider and my bones are blunt, while someone else may be flesh dominant and have a very rounded frame, or might have quite sharp long bones, or a juxtaposition of both). This can make the same item of clothing look so different on two people.	episode_done:True
text:The Very Useful Black Sweater	labels:Wtf undershirt do y’all wear under your sweaters? I find that crew neck sweaters always seem to have wider head holes than my undershirts. And I don’t live the “sweater over poplin buttondown” life anymore

text:BoF: J. Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:i just feel like their price points are so high and the quality can be kind of mediocre. they’re stuck in a weird place where their pricing is too expensive for the average consumer who’s trained to expect bargains and too cheap for someone who buys luxury or higher end pieces.   even with their random extra 50% off sales, it’s still above what people expect to pay. but then again, madewell is thriving. (though i think that has more to do with being able to capture an on-trend aesthetic.)
text:Madewell feels like it's a bit less expensive and has better sales than J. Crew but better quality as long as you're not just getting t-shirts there... I have Madewell sweaters that I've had for going on 5 years that are in regular rotation and look mostly new and yet my J Crew ones have holes or have stretched oddly.   Also seconding the sizing that someone else mentioned, I can order online with Madewell and almost guarantee that something will fit, but J Crew has been insanely inconsistent to the point where I just don't shop there anymore.	labels:Madewell is also known for great jeans as a reasonable price. I think that brings a lot of ppl in!	episode_done:True
text:DIY. Carry-on/weekender leather duffle bag	labels:Damn, I would rock this	episode_done:True
text:What are novelty leather keyrings/keychains for? How do you use them?	labels:I use them because I lose my keys in my bag. Or we have spare keys that get tossed in a drawer and it’s easier to find them with a big key chain. Also, I have cute charms on my backpack zippers because I have trouble keeping straight which zippers go to which pocket. Charms help.	episode_done:True
text:What are you planning on getting rid of this year?	labels:I have a big ol' 50s houndstooth harris tweed balmacaan I don't wear much anymore... probably going to try reselling it unless style inspiration strikes me next year.  In general I've been offloading a few vintage pieces that I don't touch anymore since I got past my whole "thrift and buy vintage to save money" phase.  Looking farther into the future, I want to replace my pair of Bean Boots with a more stylish pair of winter-ready boots. The beans have served me well, but they clash hard against a lot of my wardrobe now.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:Black jeans make stuff more dressy. Grey jeans match well with pastel colours or with black tops. I would start with those since you are a jeans lover!  Real pants can be more difficult to find a nice cut and length, but if you find a check or pattern you like then those are always the pants I reach for first- it is nice if you have a check with a tiny bit of colour in it cause then it pairs well with plain tops in that colour.

text:Down Jackets	labels:Worked for a luxury goods store and got a Canada goose parka that was returned at maybe 25% original price. A lot of people hating here but really incredibly warm and versatile. I don’t read too much into the status thing as in reality I’m a broke college student, but overall I really like the quality. I think the fur can be a little tacky so mine doesn’t have it.	episode_done:True
text:This old thing? / Too cool to care / No effort but excellent style?	labels:I like to add a nice blazer over those good unembellished plain staples, for example a nice white t-shirt and classic jeans, and the blazer instantly elevates my look. And depending where I'm going, say casual like to the grocery store or simple errands but I still want to look polished, I'll slip on a pair of classic loafers or slides (something easy to walk in), put on a pair of classic gold hoop earrings, dab on some red lipstick to just stain my lips, and refresh my mascara. I also always spritz myself with perfume, a scent unique to me.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:The present always feels “neutral”. I think if you watch any reality show from the early 2010s, even as late as 2014-15, you’ll see a big difference from what was considered “no defining silhouette” then. things like just a tshirt change slightly in cut and shape over time.
text:People should watch old seasons of the bachelor if they don’t believe this. Professionally styled TV glosses over or tones down some of the trends you forgot about. The ladies of reality TV, on the other hand, really deliver.	labels:Personally I enjoy watching early seasons of Project Runway and being flabbergasted by what I once thought was “timeless” or “neutral”
text:Oh god I forgot that show existed.  There goes January.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels: This seems like more of a psychological problem than a fashion problem. People tend to have different priorities and motivators. For some people, “fitting in”, “meeting societal expectations”, and things like that are very important. To other people, “Being true to yourself,” and “being individual” and other things like that are quite important. A lot of people end up straddling both though, and the decisions that you make should depend on the values you identify for yourself.   We are very influenced by the values of those around us, so you may feel this disconnect because what you value may not be the same as what your friends value, or what your parents value, or what people on the internet value. But we feel influenced by the values of others anyway if we want those people to like us. So what you should do is identify which things come from yourself and which things come from other people, and then which values out of that whole set you really want to embody. If you can label this more firmly, it may help to ‘own’ whatever decisions you make regardless of the values or expectations of other people.  It’s also important to remember that you can’t please everyone. People who value timelessness, elegance, and classic pieces might look at other people and describe their outfits as tacky, childish, too trendy, etc. Meanwhile those other people are looking at the timeless/classic people and describing their outfits as boring, aging, and bland. Neither camp is really better or worse, it’s just a different perspective - and it’s not like there are only two camps. But there’s no way to please everyone - so you just need to confidence to choose what you want to wear for reasons that feel right to you and then you need to own that choice.	episode_done:True

text:That sweater sounds amazing.  source: am mom.	labels:I really didn't appreciate her taste enough. One thing I did steal from her were a pair of earrings that are just dangling wooden parrots.

text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:This... is not actually a problem.  You should have a certain amount of your what you make set aside for fun stuff (which should depend on your lifestyle and financial situation) and if you prioritize social activities and saving over clothing, there's nothing wrong with that.  Chances are that your friends are finding good deals because some of their leisure time is dedicated that, whether in person are online, so if that's not something you enjoy, you do you.  With the way things are going, in a few months time, you'll probably be thankful to have some money saved up.  Personally, I live in an area where, if you enjoy cooking and don't drink, shopping constitutes as going out, which means my discretionary income is mainly going to clothes.  I've been rebuilding my closet and the *most* I've spent in a month is $90 which... actually equated to a horrifying amount of, mostly thrifted, stuff (which was fortunate, since I axed most my spring/summer wardrobe and went for it about a week before lockdown.)

text:What’s your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:A couple crew neck sweaters in neutral colours I can jazz up with a fashionable scarf. That way if it's warm, I can take the scarf off. Under them I wear tank tops.  I match up my warm scarf with my jackets. I have 2 wool coats which help but if it's below -20C I like to wear my ski jacket(s).  I prefer earmuffs to toques because of my hair and I have a black pair, a brown pair, a white pair and a pair that goes great with my favourite ski jacket.  I have 3 styles of winter boots:   \-low, very fashionable (leather and fake fur) and good long term until about -10C .. these I am likely to wear to go to the mall or whatnot   \-tall, very fashionable (wool) and good long term until about -10C .. these I wear rarely even though I love them, they're a pain because they make my legs really warm indoors but my feet get too cold outdoors   \-mid rise, mildly fashionable and good till -35C .. these are my everyday boots, running errands, off to work, shoveling snow etc  Fleece-lined tights for more a more casual look.  If I'm going to be able to stow my stuff and it's really cold (like -30C or colder) I'll wear fleece pants over my nice pants and take them off at my destination.	episode_done:True

text:Store closings at malls	labels:I pretty infrequently went to the mall, but stores closing retail locations really doesn't impact their online store much. It can, if the stores are fulfilling the orders, but most major brands should be adapted to online long before today and are able to fulfill orders. It impacts the business in that they're not getting the retail location revenue but they're already established online with processes and can usually just adapt. Unfortunately, brands with retail locations can't be like Amazon because Amazon's business is really hosting the retail of other brands with some of its own products, which means it has more resources and volume to make various returns, deliveries, etc. more efficient. It's not without its issues itself. Unfortunately, it's a hard time for retailers. :(	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:I have participated in one.  It was a long time ago but I remember it being super helpful.

text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:I think that an under-discussed part of picking out a first suit for these types of things is getting out and trying them on before you buy. Being comfortable in a suit, even if it’s cheaper or in a less fashionable cut, is more important in interview settings than the eye to detail and quality that we normally discuss on here. A suit that fits in the shoulders, in a neutral color like navy or charcoal, that you know fits because you were able to try it on is way more important to your success than ordering something online that might be objectively better. Interviewers are looking for you to meet their minimum standard of professionalism, not for you to wow with with sartorial taste. Source: had a lot of interviews in college and law school.
text:I completely agree with this. I would add that suits should always be fitted for you by a tailor. It can make a cheap suit look like a million dollars.  I would just add that you should also be aware of the level of formality at your workplace. I work in diplomacy and anything trendy is a no-no.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 16, 2020	labels:I'm building a minimalist shoe collection, no more than 5 pairs. Im looking for some boots to wear when walking through snow. Will YSL chelsea boots in black leather work for this? If not, what boots would work while also being almost as sleek as the chelsea boots?  Additionally, is there any point in having chelsea boots in a minimalist collection? For example, if I already have oxford shoes for formal wear, and white leather shoes for anything else, do these cover everything?
text:I'd consider using one slot for a truly weatherproof shoe, or looking into a more weather-ready style than a sleek designer Chelsea.  Walking about in snow can destroy shoes pretty quickly, especially if you're dealing with salt and slush.

text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:I worked in an office environment since starting after university, so my "uniform" has been business casual  attire consisting of button up shirts and blouses that I interchange with bottoms (dark trousers or pencil skirts). I find that going for a light and/or neutral coloured top, paired with a dark coloured (black, navy or grey) high waisted bottom has been worked for me.  It's about balance I think. Depending on your personal style, you can try a patterned, or colorful top paired with a dark coloured/neutral bottom, or vice versa. Or try monochromatic pairing, or some kind of color theme to the separates. Starting with neutrals is easier, and then maybe venturing into other color palettes, textures and patterns, depending on what you like.	episode_done:True
text:Dress shoes EEE trouble	labels:As some posters have mentioned, Allen Edmonds makes great dress shoes and have width sizes up to EEE (3E). They also make orthotic shoes or used to at least. I know price is a big factor for you, so I *highly* recommend checking eBay for a used pair of Allen Edmonds orthotics in 3E. As long as you don’t mind wearing used shoes. You can often find like new or barely used pairs. The orthotic models often go for under $50 used in my experience (I sell used dress shoes online).   I can help find you a pair. You can PM me or comment your normal shoe size and I can see if I can find a suitable, fashionable shoe for you on eBay.	episode_done:True
text:Everyone’s opinions on Youtube fashion channels?	labels:I used to spend all of my free time watching beauty guru videos. I learned pretty quickly how badly that impacted me! Watching beauty content on a much more controlled scale, avoiding hauls, etc helped a lot so once I started getting into fashion I applied the same logic.  Pixielocks is my favorite fashion influencer. Her video about Lirika Matoshi's Strawberry Dress really transformed the way I think about clothing, got me to quit fast fashion, led me to my favorite brands (Big Bud Press & Mokuyobi), and gave me the inspiration I needed to finally start building a real wardrobe for myself instead of just living in "good enough" clearance rack finds. Her entire house and wardrobe is almost 100% my aesthetic so following her on Youtube and Instagram makes me happy.  I also really like these channels, although I watch them less.  - The Stitchess. Her style isn't as close to mine but her videos are very informative and interesting to me. - Karolina Żebrowska. Her fashion history videos are so cool! - Rachel Maksy. Her sewing videos are very inspiring.	episode_done:True

I’ve seen a lot of ads online for shady looking companies selling this sort of cyber-Japanese-tech style clothing at super cheap prices that are obviously going to be trash, and now you’ve opened my eyes to the high end stuff. My big question is - is anyone out there making this stuff at mid-range affordable prices? As someone starting to explore his style, I’m hesitant to start dropping 300-500 bucks on a pair of jeans or a jacket, but equally I don’t want to waste money on 5 dollar stuff that’s going to be made of plastic.	episode_done:True

text:TheRealReal x Gucci	labels:It’s not generous. $1 for items priced $300-$15000? They have a huge margin.   Also, the Real Real regularly puts the market price/retail price for goods higher than they actually are so that the goods are only a few dollars cheaper than new.   I’m sure people can find deals from time to time but I’m not a fan of the site.
text:Yep, a few odd brands I like put items on sale at the end of the season... the same items regularly show up on TRR NWT above the end of season sale pricing while the same items are still available on sale.  I’ve only used them to hunt for very specific pieces that I really wanted, not the place to look for deals.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:My mom cared a lot of about looks and was very stylish before marriage and kids. She was beautiful in middle age but had no income for clothes and stuff as she was a stay at home mom. She did however teach us a lot about femininity and hygiene and hair and makeup. I didn’t realize how much she had taught me until recently. As a preteen I watched a lot of What Not to Wear so I thought I had become a fashion expert (even if i only got one new outfit per year and it was an embarrassing monkey character T-shirt 🤣) anyhow I always tried to give her fashion advice to make her feel better about herself and in hindsight she shouldn’t have listened to my tip to buy green seersucker capris 😂 she died when I was 17 but if I could, I would treat her to all the nice stuff I can now afford to buy for myself 🥰	episode_done:True

text:What's on your 2021 fashion wishlist?	labels:I'm going from the Middle East (last year) to living in the Baltics (2021) so it's going to be aaaaall about the cold-weather gear and woolens for me. I don't have a super-great grasp on what the formality levels are going to be at work yet, but I'm definitely hoping to get some great all-weather boots, some super warm leggings for non-work or work from home wear. The new job comes with a promotion so I'm going to need a few suits and some wool dress slacks for work (for those days when it's just too cold for anything else!).  I'm thinking a lot about velvet and knit and texture, trying to do longer (and warmer!) skirts than my usual pencil skirt without looking girlish or dowdy... and trying not to splurge on every coat known to man (four wool coats and a cape isn't too-too much, right?)

text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:I've taken a couple of laps before writing this comment, but up-front I think aesthetics section should be split, because I think the most basic question, which is answered aesthetically but not functionally, is what do you want your clothes to **do**? Giving off a vibe is mentioned, but there's an even more functional level of "are these clothes sensible for how I live my life?" Are you buying lots of hawaiian shirts even though live at the north pole, or buying down parkas when you live in Hawaii? Do you regularly find yourself cold and wet because you don't own any raincoats, or find that your fishnet sleeves keep getting caught on the mill in the machine shop, or that your raw denim really doesn't give you the flexibility you need to dance?   I think what the clothes do should meet you where you do what you do, and at the most basic level that's physically enabling you to do things, and you can build a vibe from that.
text:While I agree with you, I don’t think a large segment of of the world aspires (strongly at least) to dress vastly different from what makes sense to Wear in their climate. I don’t think there are guys who work at the factory and dress up in bespoke suits; they’re smart enough to discern context.  Even urbancomposition, a union electrician, is able to dress how he wants, and that means dressing for his context.   I also think figuring out your aesthetic is also finding how to mix context with what vibe you want. Cotton knitwear turtlenecks exist, so you can definitely wear a roll neck in LA (within reason). There are cotton flannel aloha shirts that are long sleeve.  You can have a linen over shirt or a flannel overshirt. Open weave, high twist wool suits exist as much as flannel and tweed. Flannel lined chinos are a thing.  Apart from drastic things like wanting a to wear outerwear, there are definitely ways to make a personal desired aesthetic work for your context.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Are there any actual fashion trends in 2020?	labels:we must be living on different planets.   lingerie as camisoles, fur trim everything, distressed tops, denim skirts, sweater vests, low rise pants, straight leg replacing skinny jeans, patchwork jeans, patterned tights, flared leggings, corset tops, fur lined boots, super tall platform shoes, juicy tracksuits, animal prints, tie dye, hand and leg warmers, fluffy bags, all were super popular trends last year. this has been the most trend heavy year in my memory, I could barely keep up.
text:This! (No idea why you were downvoted...?)   More trends that may not have been new, but were enormous: puffy sleeves, shirred tops and dresses, 18th century silhouettes in general (chemise anglais!)...	labels:haha maybe because I called yoga pants ‘flared leggings’.

text:An Introduction to Japanese Menswear Magazines	labels:When I was in Tokyo i flipped through an issue of Popeye because the subhead caught my eye - "A magazine for fancy city boys."  "That's me!" I thought.   It was a nice magazine and had it been more convenient I would have bought it, but it was $25 and fairly large, and we were traveling kind of light and I didn't want to schlep it around for the next two weeks, so back on the shelf it went.

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.
text:Totally agreed, and this is why it makes me a bit squirmy when people say "wear what makes you happy!" in this sub, in the sense that it should be the last word in clothing. Yes, of course you should wear what makes you happy, but what makes us happy to wear is not so simple for a lot of people.  There are tons of things I don't particularly love in isolation but make me happy on my body, and conversely things I love in isolation but *don't* love on my body, and that can come from many angles: pure aesthetics but also fit, comfort, personal goals, how I'm treated when I'm wearing it, etc etc. What exact elements contribute to any of these is really the crux of personal fashion, and it's a far more complex conversation than just "wear it if you like it".	labels:Yeah, "wear what you like!" is an unhelpful platitude. It's the "just be happy!" of fashion advice, it doesn't tell you HOW to get where you want.	episode_done:True

text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I've written about this before, but as someone who is 5'2 on a good day, I have stopped giving a shit about looking "longer and leaner."  In fact, I reject the idea that I should want to look taller. Maybe all those 5'7 women should be taking advice on how to make their legs look as stubby as mine. <--Obviously a joke but to make a point. How stupid is it that I should feel like my natural body is something to correct?  I'm an old woman, lol, and over the course of my life I have never found that my stubby legs (that I was once self-conscious about) have kept me from career advancement or from finding people who thought I was beautiful and wanted to have sex with me, so what's the freaking problem?  Fuck conventional figure flattery.  That being said, of course there are things I think look better on me than other things and I tend to wear the things I think look better in ways I think look better most of the time.  Except when the comfort or beauty of a garment is so outstanding it overrules that.  Thanks for coming to my TED talk.  There are cookies on the table in the back.
text:As a fellow 5'2" person I 100% agree! I can't wear heels due to medical reasons, and I love my maxi and midi skirts to DEATH. Oh no I look short?

That way you can find what suits you within the category so it can be classic and something you will actually wear!

That way I can see if it actually looks good on people who aren’t tall and thin or if it’s one of those things where it’s designed specifically for that fashion model body type.

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "A Primer on Materials"	labels:Hum it’s definitely an interesting read. I guess nowadays there is more emphasis on ethics and environmental cost when we choose our fabrics, so that would be an interesting add. For example cotton being so much more water hungry than hemp and linen. I was a bit thrown back by the thinsulate entry. Having spent a few years I outdoor retail, I do not really think of it as a textile, more of a insulation, and it’s certainly not the only synthetic insulation or trademark of the sort available.  Edited to add: I re-read my comment and realised it seemed a bit negative overall which is not the vibe I was going for. I think it’s tremendous work and already really helpful, so kudos to the person who wrote it in the first place :)
text:Maybe some quick pros and cons that include environmental concerns? Cotton is a big one I’m familiar with, but polyester is a petroleum product, micro fibers can shed their micro fibers during laundering, etc, etc. I’m sure there are issues with mass wool production or linen too that I’m just not aware of. It’s not really possible to not have any environmental/social impact, but a guide like that could help people make their own choices to balance some of the harms being done. (And it’s independent of brands which may or may not be making things better. Some issues are fairly universal to cotton or poly or whatever and could help guide other consumers as they try to interpret what companies are saying.)	labels:	episode_done:True

The sneaker count is a bit inflated, though - I borrow my husband’s sneakers a lot (same shoe size, 10/10 recommend) and 4 of those are his. I have maybe 5 pairs listed on Poshmark right now, and could stand to get rid of a few more.   Despite the above, I swear I have about 10 pairs on my wish list right now. There are 2 pairs of boots, a pair of heels, and some flats that I have my eye on at present. I’d like a pair of shiny lace up boots, and to replace an old pair of snake print boots with green croc print. I’ve also got a burning desire to own Mary Jane flats, so that’s on the list too.   I won’t list every pair I have, but the frequent fliers are:   Boots: dark red Docs; knee high suede and black Chelsea both from Stuart Weitzman    Flats: black & white Chanel ballerinas, black Gucci mules, red suede Stuart Weitzman d’orsay   Heels: Sam Edelman Barbie pink suede pumps, mid-heel Jil Sander black pumps   Sandals: vintage black patent ferragamo   Sneakers: white AF1 with a painted snake on the swoosh, my husband’s fendi monster eye runners & Gucci ace	episode_done:True

text:Ellen McArthur Circular Economy Report: by 2029 Resale is expected to be bigger than Fast Fashion	labels:Eh, I'm pretty skeptical about claims that fast fashion will die down any time soon. Especially this claim that resale will overtake it. How will that happen? Resale depends on new items being purchased. If people aren't buying as many new items, the stock at resale will drop. And if a ton of people are buying resale, the prices on the good stuff will continue to go up and result in a lot of people buying fast fashion because it's cheaper.  Fast fashion may not be high quality or eco-friendly, but it's inexpensive and offers a lot of variety, and that's always going to be in demand. Fast fashion won't die out unless a lot of governments put in strict regulations on labor and pollution and whatnot.	episode_done:True

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:Any time you're paying more than a few thousand dollars for a basic article of clothing, you're paying for the brand; because you could have that same blazer or pair of trousers custom made by a tailor/dressmaker in the same or better quality, for a lower price.  This was the case in the 50s and 60s as well, but at the time, high quality clothing was more common, sewing skills were more common, clothes were expected to last longer, and the general public had a better understanding of what good-quality clothing looks like; people bought Chanel expecting quality construction, of course, but the main appeal of buying from a prominent Parisian fashion house was knowing that anything Chanel made would be in fashion for the upcoming years.  Now that we are immersed in fast fashion, nobody has the knowledge to hold luxury brands accountable, and fashions change so quickly that a well-made 'up-to-date' jacket from a reliably fashionable brand would be a pointless investment.  It just doesn't make sense anymore for luxury brands to invest too much on quality if there is no longer any demand for quality.  This is not *only* a recent thing: I've seen gowns from the court of Marie Antoinette made of materials costing 30+ years of a working man's wages, yet were hastily thrown together with big, sloppy stitches and tacks.  That's just what happens when your client wants their garment *right now* and will only wear it once or twice.  If you want something that's really well-made and is going to last a long time, there is certainly a market niche for that, but it's become more of a middle-class niche for people who *specifically* care about quality and durability.
text:This was the case in the 50s and 60s as well, but at the time, high quality clothing was more common, sewing skills were more common, clothes were expected to last longer, and the general public had a better understanding of what good-quality clothing looks like; people bought Chanel expecting quality construction, of course, but the main appeal of buying from a prominent Parisian fashion house was knowing that anything Chanel made would be in fashion for the upcoming years.  \- But my question is how can fashion labels go back to this vision right here?	labels:When the people who buy Chanel products start caring about the thread count and style of hem finish used in their clothing, then Chanel will have to start caring about that as well.  But as long as they can sell cheaper clothes for the same price, then it would be silly to expect them to 'go back' to having higher business expenses.  So, really, you're asking for a societal change.  I think we're seeing more pushback against fast/disposable fashion in general, but we'll have to wait and see if that really takes off enough to the point where it changes rich peoples' buying habits.   There is that other issue, though:  \>  the main appeal of buying from a prominent Parisian fashion house was knowing that anything Chanel made would be in fashion for the upcoming years.  That depends on there being distinct fashion trends, and on people feeling compelled to follow them.  In the 50s and 60s, women had to comply with fashion trends in order to be accepted and respected within society.  Personally I'm quite glad that this is ~~no longer~~ less the case, but... well, now that it's less important to be on trend, it's also less valuable to be on trend.   Is it still worth paying thousands more dollars for a garment to be in style when nobody cares and the styles will change in a few months anyway?  If trends don't matter, then what is the point of shopping with a trendsetting brand?  Are brands like Chanel literally just depending on their customers buying solely for the sake of the label?  I guess that's another thing where we'll just have to wait and see if/how fast fashion destroys itself.  Maybe trends will regain some influence if they slow down, or maybe the trend bus will finally explode and people will just scatter into a multitude of alt fashions.  Either way I think there's a possibility for luxury brands to reestablish some sort of high style niche, but I would not expect (or want) them to have the same sort of leadership influence that they did in the 50s.
text:>the main appeal of buying from a prominent Parisian fashion house was knowing that anything Chanel made would be in fashion for the upcoming years.  Yeah Chanel and other fashion houses used to set the trends and it was up to you to make it into your own way. Fast fashion are the ones that are setting up trends same with fashion influencers. I just have more respect for seamstress creating timeless looks that will last a lifetime.  I agree I don't want them to dictate wants supposed to be in but I wish that a fashion brand like Chanel wasn't so cheap. They are raising prices because they want to be exclusive like Hermes yet everything right now is cheap and then conglomerates like LVMH care about profits and mass production its killing creativity and innovation.   This is why the fashion industry is where its at today. Even American Vogue is a shadow of its former self and Anna is the problem too.	labels:	episode_done:True

The solution is obvious: Day of the Week Underwear!  This will ensure that not only do I always know what day of the week it is, but I'll also go back to changing my underwear daily.   I also have resolved to only thrift my clothing, so I bought a used pack of day of the week underwear on ebay. It's missing Wednesday, but Wednesday is the worst day of the week anyway, so I'm just going to skip Wednesdays and go straight to Thursdays. Then, every two months, I'll have a leap week, where I don't wear any underwear at all, so that I can "reset" to the proper days of the week.   A flawless plan!

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Pssst. You don't need to look "in" the way you think you do. Your clothes don't have to look like you bought them all this year. You are allowed to repeat outfits. You don't HAVE to consciously try to express yourself through clothes. You don't constantly have to try to visually display a personality to strangers. You can opt out and wear simple outfits like 90% of everyone. It's OK.     Sometimes the pressure feels suffocating, I know. But it's OK to not follow every trend. Despite what some posters in this sub think, the vast majority of people will not notice that you bought your jumper/coat/whatever in 2018. I actually like clothes and fashion but sometimes I'm too tired and just do the uniform thing. I just try changing how I do my makeup if I feel bored now, before trying to remix my whole wardrobe. I gave myself new eyebrows and tried a different style of eyeliner and I look different enough people asked if I had a hair cut (lol) which didn't involve even buying new makeup.    As for comments on my appearance, if they aren't nice or helpful ("You haven't blended your concealer" "You have leaves in your hair" "your shirt has popped open") I ignore it.	episode_done:True

text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:Not a lot of people still wear hats, but I keep hearing that many people *wish* they were still stylish to wear... so please feel free to help make hats fashionable again!  Typical etiquette for hat wearing is that if it's a very small decorative hat--something that stays close to the head--you may wear it indoors, but if it's a larger hat, you take it off indoors.  With something like a cloche or beret, which isn't exactly tiny but also isn't oppressively huge, it follows nearly the same rules as a coat:  If you're just popping by on an errand, it's fine to keep it on, but if you're planning to stay a while, you should take it off.  This is especially true if you're visiting a place of hospitality--a friend or relative's home, for example, or a restaurant--where somebody is offering comfort and relaxation, keeping your hat/coat on might be seen as a rejection of their hospitality.

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:The company already made money off of the original purchase of the shirt, so you buying second hand doesn’t really benefit them in any way.

If someone asks where the piece is from, just say you don’t know so they won’t be tempted to buy from the brand lol
text:But the second question is where to buy second hand from? For example near me we have the Salvation Army and a church thrift shop. I used to live next to a giant Salvation Army donation center and loved it, but after learning about their philosophy and some of the shady things they’ve done I no longer feel like I can ethically support them! Then supporting the local church thrift is also problematic given their stances on social issues! When I lived in California I was able to find some thrift stores that actually gave to causes I support (out of the closet etc) but now that I’m in the Midwest there aren’t any of these! I just want like a thrift store that donates to something like education or food banks without the religious/social aspect.	labels:I've restarted to online stores because I have no thrift shops near me.

text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:I think the pressure is to not be "strange/unaware of your appearance" or more likely not to look "poor/can't afford more clothes."

Growing up, there were teachers and other school staff who repeated outfits and other children loudly pointed it out.  I repeat outfits as much as possible if I'm not seeing the same people (my household doesn't count). The internal pressure is strong to not repeat within a few weeks of seeing the same people to avoid potential comments.

If you really want to do this and are comfortable with it then by all means go ahead. But from my own experience I did this, and actually did it fairly well after many years, but at the end of the day it stood out too much in real everyday life in a normal town, regardless of how nice the outfit was, and it definitely hurt my social reputation a lot. After toning it down a bit I immediately noticed a difference in how much more positively I was treated by people. You can still dress well, but remember context is key.

You DON’T need to look at it and go “but I couldn’t wear this where I live” because it’s not asking you to dedicate yourself to perusing this as your primary aesthetic, just a “hey this an option”  Also it’s always kinda funny to see what people consider “out there”, it leans more dressy for sure, that’s the point, but outside the couple of all black darkwave fits in there most of this is pretty average	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:It would depend on the skill and machinery of the sewist - I have definitely made clothes that I like and will likely keep wearing, but they’re not the most structurally beautiful garments and are not the same quality craftsmanship you’d get from a higher end brand. Part of it is equipment - I don’t have a serger which is used a lot in clothing making - and part of it is I’m not that concerned about the seams on the inside of a garment that only I will ever wear. That being said, if I had taken the time to do proper seams, there is no reason those garments wouldn’t last just as long as higher end garments.
text:For sewn pieces the investment in equipment needed to approach commercial operations is feasible for an individual, but in knitwear or complicated embroidery there's just no competition. 3D and digital looms are $$$$ and what a consumer pays for good yarn is a multiple of a large operation.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Disclaimer-- I know myself well enough to know that a capsule wardrobe is not for me.  When I get back from traveling, I cannot wait to wear different clothes.  Consider your laundry situation.  Having a smaller wardrobe means that you will be doing laundry more often.  If you're one in a family of 6, it may not be a big deal.  But for a single apartment dweller (pay per load), the additional costs can add up quickly.   Because I pay per load, I make sure that I maximize the capacity and only wash full loads (I'm paying the same no matter the capacity).  I am not one to hand-wash clothes in a bathroom sink.  Not now, not ever!   I do laundry roughly every other week alternating lights and darks.  (Sheets and towels are their own ballgame, and I will sometimes throw things in with them.)
text:Just curious but why didn't you get a washing machine for the apartment?	labels:Some condos either don't have space or they don't have the right connections. I do wonder if some rental apartments mandate coin laundry.

text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:No, no, no and no. I hate the aesthetic thing.

For instance, the asymmetrical shirt that closes a bit on the diagonal, the buttons that are used to pull up the sleeves, the ankle bands on some of their pants, etc. can all be recreated relatively easily and you don't need to spend 100s of $ on their "affordable" items (Amy's words, I always crack up when she boasts about how affordable Tibi clothes are).

text:Hooded Sweatshirt Roundup	labels:Once you get over a certain level of $ point, it's really hard to rank basic hoodies over one another, it mostly comes down to the fit that you want.  I've tried a lot of hoodies from cheap to expensive and most of them are as comfortable as each other. The article mentions JEs villain hoodies which are probably out of fashion these days but JE still produces other cuts of hoodies such as the beach hoodie, raglan hoodie and oversized cropped hoodie which all have different fits and are all as well made as each other. People who rave about a particular brand of hoodie are highly likely to be just really happy with the fit, the quality and comfort isn't gonna really differ between RC, Norse Projects, Champion and such. Even coveted things like loopwheeler also doesn't provide anything unique either when it comes to comfort.  I've rambled but if I had an advice to give to hoodie buyers who are mostly focused on fit and comfort, it would be to identify a fit that you want and just start from the midrange brand that you can find of that fit.
text:I bought a JE zip up hoodie. I also have Stone Island and Burberry hoodies, as well as American Apparel and other cheaper ones. I won't say spending $300+ (cad) on hoodies is smart, but the main difference I note is the cut. Comfort, like you said, isn't too different unless you get into cashmere, but the difference in cut and overall shape and sizing is much better. I definitely wanna get my hands on a Todd Snyder Champion hoodie though, that's right up my alley.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:I only buy brands I know I like and I know my sizing in. Occasionally I will come across something that looks amazing from a brand I don't know, I will look it up and buy it if its a high quality brand. I generally stick to natural fibers, as polyester and rayon can be very hit or miss without feeling it. I don't buy anything with any damage. Thread up also has "premium" section but I find its kinda random what gets in there. You can also search by price >$10 and it will weed out a lot of junk.	episode_done:True
text:Noel Fielding X Fendi menswear colab	labels:I love Noel fielding. Which is why I really really wanted to feel excited about the garments!! But I.. don't. I just feel like.. I've seen them before, many times. A few of the signature colorful statement pieces are OK, and while I love a clean cut, minimalistic design, in this case I would have wished for something a bit more bold.  I'm not a fashion designer nor a trendsetter of any kind, and maybe this opinion is one of the reasons I'm not 😂 I'm just not excited enough to reach for any of these pieces instead of something with a pop from some other brand.

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:In my experience, lower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose) and spending more tends to lead to a more noticeable improvement in quality up to a certain point. That's painting with a broad brush though... leather dress shoes and boots scale much better than sneakers or sandals, where mid-range options are going to be good enough for most people.  T-shirts, dress shirts, denim, and accessories in low-to-mid-range are generally good enough from a quality perspective IMO and I've only really paid more in those categories for a design I like rather than because I think I'm getting something higher quality. There's nothing wrong IMO with buying something because you like the way it looks even if a similar quality alternative exists at a lower price, but that's harder to do if you're shopping on a budget.  I'll also add that for all of the above, your dollar goes a lot farther if you're willing to shop used. Sites like Ebay, Grailed, reddit/styleforum B/S/T threads, etc. have made it a lot easier to buy preowned clothes without having to set foot into a thrift store.  TL;DR When shopping on a budget I'd focus first on having a high quality pair of shoes and jacket. Consider buying used clothes to stretch your budget further.

text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:You do you  Some people might judge ya but that'll happen anyway  It's a big commit tho I feel like transition lenses are the crocs of footwear. Practical, and somehow less fashionable because of it
text:>crocs   Lol if you compare it with crocs I would definetly not get it...I am just trying to understand as to why people think it's not fashionable or dorky/nerdy? I am not saying it is or isn't, but I definetly don't want to come as this scinecy/bookwarm/fashionista type  and tbh I am not that bothered from sun, like I hate it sure, but never had a sunglass and never really complained, so technically I can buy prescription sunglasses, just want to know as to why so many people think it's nerdy/dorky exaclty	labels:Haha I also would love to know why :)  I'm not trying to be like "don't do it" moreso just trynna give you a heads up that i think some people perceive them this way  iunno dude lol
text:Weird, well I don't give a shit about people's opinion, I'll slap em if they think I'm a dork lol  But yeah, weird how people perceive things  I know 1 thing though, I don't understand people wanting tablets when you have a laptop and a phone, why have this middle something that's neither of those and can't do the job of either  I'm thinking transition falls there, if you r going out knowing it's sunny, just put prescription sunglasses and if you go indoor, well who cares...but this in between thing, idk how deal breaking it is...it's like having your phone change brightness automatically depending on brightness outside, which is turned off for me haha	labels:Tablets are invaluable for my work/school (coding).

text:+J/UNIQLO SPECIAL COLLABORATION: What’s the verdict?	labels:the outerwear is all spectacular and i think much nicer quality than regular uniqlo outerwear.  i thought the sweaters were a bit thin, which was slightly disappointing.  all the cotton items are pretty standard uniqlo cotton (maybe slightly smoother) but the cuts were fun. the silk items felt nice, but not as nice as more expensive silks (obviously). the silk knit shirts were less soft than the bow blouse but i think that's just the nature of knit silks?  the wool items were all fab. i got trousers and the skirt and love them both.  also EVERYTHING WAS SO BIG? i know some of the items were supposed to be oversized but the sizing wasn't consistent. i was my usual size in skirt/pants and sweaters/shirts, but i had to size down in the oversized items because they were too big. the hybrid down coat which i got in a M (my usual uniqlo outerwear size) fit like a L or XL. the cotton shirtdress which i also got in a M (for non-outerwear i am usually between a s/m in uniqlo sizing because i am tall, and generally go with a M for sleeve length) fits like a L, but for that one i can make it work by styling it differently. if they had it in a S i would have gotten that instead, tho.  generally i am pleased with what i got. i think for the price it's not bad, and i like the cuts of the pieces and higher than usual fabric quality, although some pieces felt more worth it than others.   i do NOT think it is worth buying at a markup tho. none of the pieces were particularly unique (except maybe some of the outerwear) and you would be able to find similar pieces from other places at a similar price point i think.
text:Thanks for that very thorough summary. How did you manage to snag so many pieces???	labels:i live in NYC and i popped in to the soho flagship last sunday!  they were sold out of most of the popular items (no silk bow blouse, and xs-m sizes of most outerwear and blazers) but i managed to snag a few of the last size M pieces i had missed out on online. (i only managed to get the hybrid down coat online)
text:Nice work! I hopped online last week (maybe Wednesday or Thursday) and found almost everything sold out. Unfortunately I didn’t have time to make it to a store over the weekend. I suspect I’m out of luck. My online haul included shirts and the dress and some sweaters but I suspect the best stuff, the outerwear, is what I really missed out on.	labels:i checked the website at 9:30 the day of the release and most things in size xs-m were already sold out in the more desirable colors (black/white). before the announcement email even went out!!  i think i just got lucky because i checked on a whim after logging in for work.   only some stores were carrying the line irl. if you live near a flagship they might still have some things!	episode_done:True

text:Omg same!! I rarely rewear my sleeping clothes too because I sweat at night.	labels:Night sweating is a mood. I rewear a ton of my day to day clothes, because Im boring and like my light jacket/denim pants/chinos which probably aren't getting washed after one single wear regardless.

text:What’s your everyday purse?	labels:I do a capsule wardrobe and typically keep these purse types out and ready for action, I just swap out which one based on the wardrobe's color scheme so I can spend time with all my bags :)   A black minimalist "hobo bag" for errand running or going to a friend's house. It's split into two sides with several small pockets. Holds a water bottle, my iPad, fidget toys, phone wallet keys or and some reusable grocery bags with room to spare. Could hold a laptop. This is the bag things can get lost in. I could use it for an overnight trip if I really needed to. It's the biggest purse I've owned in a long time, but I'm really loving it.   A mini backpack for bike riding days or hiking with friends. Has a mesh pocket inside and can hold phone wallet keys a sandwich and headphones. Athletic type material. I have this in black, beige and fuschia.   A canvas satchel/messenger bag for doctor's office type visits where I'll have to wait or errands that need less stuff brought along. Has a few compartments and can fit my iPad, kindle or an 8x5 book with phone wallet keys, lotion, probably some makeup if needed. I have this in brown, purple and charcoal because it's such a good bag.   A small black pleather half-moon crossbody with gold accents for quick stuff like the gas station, taking a walk or some type of event where I have to look nice. I have a similar green one and a Togepi one that can be swapped out, but I love this one the most.  I talk too much. Yay.

The sneakers are really good quality for 19 bucks, and I do see sizes come back, if you check daily. I bought a pair for myself and a pair for my friend.  I also bought a few clothing items that is taking forever to ship though. I might cancel some of them and wait out the rest. I mean, 30ish bucks for dresses/jumpsuits and 40s for cashmere is a pretty good deal, and it's not like Everlane's style is gonna change much. They sell the same shit year in and year out.

My favourite pair of sandals just broke and my white sneakers are getting very battered so I’m thinking they may be my next two investments plus some knee high boots for Autumn.

text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:At first? Growing up, like in elementary school and middle school, I really did not mesh with people. The things I liked, others did not like. The things they liked, I did not get. I didn't get the social cues others were picking up on. No one bullied me or anything extreme, but I felt very much like an outsider or an alien, trying to figure out some other species. And fashion seemed to be a predominant part of this culture I didn't understand, so I felt like if I could figure that out, I would unlock everything else. So I put a lot of work into that.  But (and not to sound so depressing!) I actually ended up really liking it, and caring more about it than others did in the end, especially when I got to college and didn't have a dress code any more. Not only could I convey that I was "normal", I could convey my interests! My personality! I could even change myself for the better in tandem with my clothes. Now I find it really fun to try to express who I am on that day, and it's been a vehicle for exploring my gender and sexuality at times as well. I like standing out now, but in a good way. Whereas before I used fashion to understand others, now I feel like I use it to help others understand me.	episode_done:True

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:The best response I’ve ever heard for this question was comparing runway high fashion to the concept cars you’ll see at auto shows.

Same for fashion.

text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I live in France and there is definitely a big push on instagram via influencers for 'nouvelle vague' 60s-70 styles to be promoted as 'french/parisienne girl style' even though that is not actually what most French women wear,  but it is a style category that exists here. I like certain elements of this style but there are intellectual experts in recent years that have shown that the marketing push of this image nationally and internationally had lead to a lot of erasure of the diversity of French population. Luckily more and more media outlets are trying to show the diversity of French style. I love 'Dress Like A Parisian' blog that really instills how stylish french women create their style no matter what kind style 'identity' they gravitate to.  As for sources on instagram/pinterest etc. I have several: In terms of RTW,  I'm not the biggest fan of Hedi Slimane but his Celine collections since 2019 are very wearable and what I could see certain French demographics wearing. And I mine older Isabel Marant (pre 2015-2016) for inspiration to satisfy my bohemian itch. Other RTW I like is Dries Van Noten, Chloé, Old Céline, Virginie Viard's Chanel. On instagram, I follow certain hashtags of certain brands (typically high mid-end/independent designers many of them French)  to see how smaller influencers style certain brands.  Concept stores/Large mulit-brand boutiques also do a great job on insta with styling which helps me hone in my style. I still use Pinterest but it's easy to keep seeing the same pins to repin and it ruins the search for inspiration so I like mine instagram more and more often.	episode_done:True

text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:When I moved from a very seasonal American city to South East Asia, I for whatever reason thought that I _needed_ to live solely in very thin, very loose cottons and breezy skirts. I didn't bring a single pair of jeans or boots because I was fairly certain they would cause me to immediately melt into a puddle. For a period of time, I prioritized the heat over everything, so my style became really plain and blah, whereas I used to be fairly experimental back in the US.  Luckily, I then realized the key to dressing in the heat is just finding a balance. A thin turtleneck is fine with a skirt. Jeans and boots work fine with a tank top. Light weight blazer or loose oversized button-ups have replaced coats and sweaters, but still allow for some layering.   I've come to a good place with what I view my style as now, but I find that I do have to repeat a lot of basic "outfit formulas" and feel a bit envious of people who live in the cold and can layer to their hearts content. I think the cold weather lends itself to more creative combinations, whereas being stuck in perpetual summer makes me feel confined to a life of sun dresses.	episode_done:True

text:Deceptive Marketing Practices by Fashion Companies	labels:I was a fabletics member for close to a year. I mostly liked their stuff but the quality was extremely variable. For the membership, they do give you an option to login to your account and either make a purchase of any amount or skip the month, otherwise you’d get charged $49.99 that you can use for store credit. I had a reminder set to skip and so most months I didn’t spend any money, but one month I forgot and got charged. I was so mad that I cancelled right away (which was easier than I worried it would be). In hindsight, I don’t like this set up and wouldn’t sign up for another rewards service that has a risk of being charged. I just want to buy (or not buy) things when I need them and not have it be dictated by needing to get something by a certain date. I don’t know of many brands offhand that have this kind of thing, so hopefully it’s not going to become the new norm.	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: Ghost Outfit	labels:I'm quite pleased with my ghost outfit: black boots, pink tights, poofy black circle skirt with black velvet cat faces and a black shirt. I'm dressed like a cartoon character.   Alas! I died to provide a male protagonist with a tragic backstory, but luckily am suitably attired for my appearance in a later season where either a. I give my ghostly blessing for him to move on with the much prettier lead woman, or b. Have my form stolen by a bad guy who is getting in his head and trying to psych him out.   It's very sad.	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:Not trans and don't dress intentionally masculine, but I'm a woman who shops in the men's section all the time and it's fine! Just do it and after the first couple of times it'll feel easy. Anybody who is rude to you has the problem, not you, but it's never happened to me, including while shopping in other countries - - in Japan I wouldn't fit in most women's clothes, so I basically have to shop the men's and they seemed to think it was interesting and were happy to make the sale.  Maybe not the most apposite comment for your situation but wanted you to have the perspective that there are a lot of reasons you might be shopping there so you don't even have to feel like you're under undue scrutiny. One more suggestion: if you can, it might be easier to shop in a bigger city; in New York nobody would blink.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 03	labels:   When it comes to leather footwear, specifically chelsea boots in this instance, which type is the more "resistant" to creases, water, stains, scratches, etc.  A list in order of Best to Worst would be perfect really. For further clarification, I'm talking the type of leather, such as suede and calfskin, as well as it's finish, wax coat or polished for example.  To further highlight my question, if there were a pair of chelsea boots with a calfskin polished upper finish, and a pair of wax finished, which would last the longest and require the least intervention.  Any input is very appreciated!	episode_done:True

text:MFA Theme WAYWT: Casual Tailoring	labels:This stuff looks great and the idea is nice in theory but after years of attempting this and being “that guy”, it really doesn’t work outside of the largest/most fashionable locales (NYC, London, Paris, Southern Europe, etc.). If you really want to do this and are comfortable with it then by all means go ahead. But from my own experience I did this, and actually did it fairly well after many years, but at the end of the day it stood out too much in real everyday life in a normal town, regardless of how nice the outfit was, and it definitely hurt my social reputation a lot. After toning it down a bit I immediately noticed a difference in how much more positively I was treated by people. You can still dress well, but remember context is key.
text:Are you sure your execution wasn't just shit?  I mean, yeah, wearing a light structure blazer to grab groceries is silly, but... *hurt your reputation*?	labels:At the time as a young 20-something, yes. Older co-workers and college peers thought I was pretentious on sight and first impressions matter a lot.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 11, 2021	labels:I don't know if this is the right place, but I have an old style of shirt by fruit of the loom. It's akin to your typical a-shirt except the neckline/college is higher, like a t-shirt, and the shoulder "straps" are a bit thicker.  I remember getting it in a pack years ago, but I only have the one left now. I was hoping someone could point me in the direction of finding more, even that if another brand?  Thanks!	episode_done:True
text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:I too had two different experiences.  My first suit I purchased at the Philadelphia store.  They sized me at a 46R and I paid over $100 for alterations.  I lost about 20lbs in the following years and needed to get the suit altered.  This time I took it to the KoP store where they said I should not have been sized at a 46R and had to pay $100 in alterations.  They sized me for a new suit and minor alterations at no charge to me.	episode_done:True
text:For the parents of girls	labels:As a daughter. My mom and I went shopping together. And we figured what would be appropriate for my age that we were both happy with. And then i would dress myself. My mom always says that i came up with some crazy choices. But it is part of your development. You figure out who you are through clothes.
text:Same, My mom would set outfits together in the closet at first but I would always mix and match so she eventually stopped at around 4 years old. As long as I had clothes on my body appropriate for the weather she let me do what I wanted (even from before I could actually put on the clothes on my own). Some days I would literally put on a clown wig with my clothes and my mom let me roll with it. I’m 24 now but we did a lot of shopping limited too and thrifting at the goodwill &salvation army. My sister and I were the same size in everything until after we graduated high school so we always shared a single wardrobe. I could pick out what I wanted (within reason) even from a really early age.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Tucking in shirts	labels:I definitely deal with this too. My best advice, like many others here, is to tuck with high-waisted pants.  I also highly recommend tucking your shirt into your underwear and pulling your pants over them; it creates a smoother look!	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:Figure out what style the clothes you don't wear are, separate them into season based styles then figure out what the opposite would be.     I love my alternate post-modern goth-punk vibe with a sporty twist, think Pinks early music career with less pop-punk and more punk-rock.	episode_done:True
text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "A Primer on Materials"	labels:I think it'd be worth mentioning the difference between the material and the construction/weave because it's easy to mix things up.   Like when people say something is smooth because it's silk, but really, it's smooth because it's satin. Just like how raw silk noil isn't smooth even though it's silk.
text:I think some information on the different weaves and varieties of fabric and what materials they can be made out of would be super useful. I agree that most people tend to equate silk with materials like satin or charmeuse when silks like noil or dupioni aren't as smooth or shiny. Also, I think a discussion on fabric grain and concepts like twill and other weaves would be helpful for people hoping to avoid clothing with mismatched grain that doesn't sit or wash right. Grain is super important to how the material behaves and it's something a lot of clothing manufacturers are sloppy about.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do I feel sexy at home in winter?	labels:matching bra and panties. it works wonders. I do this in the summer too (on summer bra days, which with boob sweat there are not many). when I buy a new bra, I typically get 2-3 coordinating panties in different styles so I have some options, and then put them together under all my clothes. I swear there's a posture change when I'm wearing ratty underclothes vs nice ones. even if no one sees it, I know it's there.

text:Does Anyone Ever Feel Like It’s Hard to Find Basic Clothing Items That Were Plentiful in the Past?	labels:I don't know if I'd consider a velvet dress a basic item.  My basic item is a good quality fitted tee and tank.  Old Navy used to be the place to buy these things but their quality has gone downhill a lot.  I just want a tee or tank that is good for layering, but is not so sheer that I can't wear it alone.  Is something made with fabric heavier than tissue paper too much to ask?  (And by fitted, I don't mean the Everlane oversized/boxy fit.  If I wanted that, I'd shop in the men's section.)

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I got my first fancy bag after calling off my wedding lol I figured it cost around the same amount as the dress I wouldn’t ever wear so why not? The woman at the LV store thought I was on drugs ... “are you celebrating something?” And I’m like as a matter of fact, yes, yes I am. I just lost a ton of money on a wedding but I dodged a bullet and left that POS.

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:Give shoes a day break between wearings.  A shoe repair guy said that even with socks, shoes absorb a lot of moisture from our feet. He suggested going  at least day on day off with shoes to give them time to dry and regain their shape. Otherwise he said they stay in that moist, malleable state and get out of shape more quickly.  Anecdotally I’ve seen a major difference in the lifespan of my shoes.

text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:I'm definitely more into quality and classic design Vs something cheap, cheerful and trendy now.   Perhaps it is a result of being able to afford it more, but I think it's mostly due to being more aware of good quality fabric which lasts, look better and ultimately tired of fast fashion which I'd wear for a few weeks/months and then relegate to the back of the closet.   Looking back, the cheap polyester tops, skirts etc did nothing favourable for my body and just did not look as good as I thought it did at the time.	episode_done:True

text:As somebody who reverse engineers clothes all the time, if you can think of something you found appealing from a media wardrobe then you can probably find a reverse engineered example. If not exact copies then pretty close. Clothing is all basically built from the same blocks, and if there's a suitably dedicated fan base then somebody has likely made it. Cosplay in general is the biggest example of this to me, but there's a lot of famous sweaters out there. Mr. Rogers, Coraline, Flanders, Waldo, Ferris Bueller....	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Kibbe System and Body Inclusivity	labels:I have negative associations with it because 99% of the time "red pill women" (or other women with deep issues) are the ones saying good things about it.  When I hear "Kibbe" I immediately think "red pill".
text:I think I dislike Kibbe because it is so popular in the red pill community. I think the first time I even heard about it in this sub I clicked on a couple of users profiles and they were posting in red pill communities so that confirmed whatever preconceived notions I had about it	labels:Hahahaha I think I know exactly what comment you're talking about. I've noticed that association too its quite odd.	episode_done:True
text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I'm short, and one of the fashion guidelines I tend to read say to create long lines - this means avoiding ankle straps on shoes. I LOVE ankle straps on everything - heels, flats, sandals, etc. I definitely ignore this rule! Another rule I saw was to avoid the midi length since it can sometimes be too long but not long enough to be maxi. I wear my midi length skirts high-waisted so they fall at the right point and I love them. IDC if they make me look short, they're gorgeous!
text:I'm also short and love a midi. I love them for practical reasons (maxis annoy me with all the fabric around my ankles, while I fear wardrobe malfunctions with shorter dresses) but I think they look pretty chic too. I just buy mine from brands that actually sell petite sizes to make sure the proportions are right.	labels:	episode_done:True

Sorry for the rant fleece is just so fucking ugly man	labels:Yeah I dig the look of synchillas and some other crazy patterned fleeces but I’ve never bought one cause of the whole micro plastics shebang.

text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:Not white, not red and depending on area, not black. White and red are the bride's colors (culturally dependent). If the bride wears white, red can be considered attention grabbing. If the bride wears red, her culture probably views white as a mourning color. Black can be seen as an objection to the wedding and mourning - very regional.   Something conservative enough for church weddings. Knee length, covers shoulders? Shoulder covering can be fixed with a cardigan.   Something light for a hot outdoor wedding.   In my area, most weddings are cocktail or semi formal aka short dresses are fine. Formal would imply floor length gown, so if the store has a good one, that you like, and you think someone seems more likely to go full formal, that might be a good call.   If you have seasons, then one for each season. Think about the weather in your general area. How cold or hot does it get?
text:> not red  Christ, yes. One of my old college buddies who I haven't been close to in like a decade wore a bright red dress to my wedding. The photographer took a million photos of her, to the exclusion of older family members I'd have rather had photos of. Part of that's on the photographer, of course, but it wouldn't have happened if she hadn't worn BRIGHT RED.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts on Shein?	labels:Controversial opinion, but, they aren’t that bad.   Let’s have some empathy for a moment: it is an absolute privilege to be able to shop at a sustainable store and/or to be able to buy secondhand. Imagine being someone who hasn’t bought new to them clothing in years because they can’t afford to and then fast fashion prices are waved in their faces on clothing that fits them and is their style. I’m not going to tell someone to not buy clothing from a place they can afford. I’m absolutely not doing it.   People demonize fast fashion because they look at it as black and white and don’t understand that, if you’re shopping at SHEIN, you likely can’t afford the more sustainable sources/you can’t find what you’re looking for secondhand. I’m plus sized. I can’t fit into and afford a lot of the sustainable brands out there. And, people buy out the “fashionable” plus size items in my local thrift stores to sell on Depop, so, I don’t blame people for shopping on SHEIN.  I’ve bought SHEIN secondhand and I’ve had items for years and I haven’t had any issues. I haven’t bought first hand from them in a long time but when I did, I never had any long shipping times or anything, either. I found the same defects I’d find at Target, like, a long thread here or there that I can easily snip off.   This goes for fast fashion in general—if you take care of your clothes and wear the appropriate size, you can make them last. It’s not like they spontaneously rip apart, you have to do something to make them do that. Steam your clothes to get out wrinkle. Tumble dry, hand wash, etc.
text:You raise good points, but I’m going to respectfully disagree - I don’t think there’s ever any valid excuse to buy from a company who openly profits from exploitative third world labour. We can all do better.   Sustainable fashion is expensive, yes. But *usually* buying quality clothing is cheaper in the long run than buying lots of cheap stuff (I know this is easier said than done for people living hand to mouth).   Secondly there are options that don’t exploit people. Namely second hand shops and Depop. I guarantee - no matter what the item is - someone’s already bought it or something VERY similar and wants to get rid of it. Even when I have money I buy from there because... why wouldn’t you?   The “what about poor people” argument always gets made but it just doesn’t sit right with me. What about the people who are being paid 40p a day in sweltering and unsafe Bangladeshi factories? Factories that are dumping toxic dyes into water sources? We all have a responsibility not to perpetuate the monolithic success of these horrible fast fashion conglomerates.	labels:>The “what about poor people” argument always gets made but it just doesn’t sit right with me. What about the people who are being paid 40p a day in sweltering and unsafe Bangladeshi factories? Factories that are dumping toxic dyes into water sources? We all have a responsibility not to perpetuate the monolithic success of these horrible fast fashion conglomerates.  What gets me about it is that there's a pretty big luxury component to fashion. Clothes are a necessity, but how much do we NEED? Are we really so entitled to large wardrobes and constant output of new stuff?  Of course, the people buying the most stuff aren't poor folks, and without fast fashion some people would legit struggle to have the clothes they need. But I don't like hearing the "what about poor people" argument being used to dismiss the issues entirely. I buy cheap shoes when it's all I can afford... But that doesn't change the fact that people suffered for those cheap shoes to be available to me. It's just a difficult thing to reconcile, because either way, someone suffers.  I certainly don't judge anyone who buys fast fashion, I'd be a hypocrite if I did. I just don't think the issues should be dismissed.	episode_done:True
text:How many handbags do you have and which one is your most used?	labels:I have 11 and one is a Kate Spade velvet bag, two are Dooney & Bourke mini bags, one is a Tory Burch tote bag, one is a Christian Dior, one is a Coach tote and the rest are from independent handbag stores.   I haven’t been out much due to COVID, but when I do have to go out, I usually carry either my Coach tote or my Tory Burch tote.	episode_done:True
text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers. Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:I almost completely revamped my winter wardrobe this year and tried really hard to shop sustainably and thoughtfully. I had enough jackets (am currently rocking my mom's old leather jacket, a patagonia puff, and a mountain hardware insulated ski jacket depending on the day).   The big things I did add were 8 new tops (5 good, thick sweaters, 2 waffle long sleeves, and a hooded long sleeve). Everything I get was from REI or L.L.Bean. One sweater and one waffle shirt is an REI Co-op (their in house brand), an L. L. Bean, Icebreaker,  Patagonia, and Prana sweater, the other waffle was North Face, and the hooded long sleeve was Smartwool. I love them all and have gotten rid of almost all my other tops. They are so comfortable and can be worn in many ways.  My other big addition was Kamik Sienna mid duck boots in a coffee ish color. I am in LOVE with them. They look super cute with jeans and leggings and are well put together. I have worn them almost everyday in slush, snow, rain and my feet have never been cold. I can not recommend them enough. For Christmas I got my sister in law a pair of Kamik Rouge lo snow boots and everytime I've seen her (almost every weekend) she's been wearing them.	episode_done:True
text:What's on your 2021 fashion wishlist?	labels:I've decided to just lean into my aesthetic, so I plan on buying or making a lot more circle skirts! If I'm not going to be in class and be judged for it, I can wear whatever I want and have fun with it.

text:In Honor of RBG, What is your Dissent piece?	labels:A pair of great quality, black leather high heels with a slight platform sole, may not sound like much but they give me 5 inches extra height and I’m already 5’8”, walking in to meetings in those gives me an edge as I’m often the tallest one there.

text:General Discussion - November 22, 2020	labels:So I've been lurking / participating here for about a month and I think I have a good feel for the types of posts that generally end up on this sub, common opinions etc.  I see this same pattern - posts that align pretty well with what's discussed in WAYWT/Discussion threads, like the Rick Owens post from today or the coats post from last week, getting thousands of votes and comments from people posting things like "he looks like he's shit his pants", and "nobody would wear this".  Why do people who spend their time lurking this sub, silently absorbing whatever opinions and discussion, decide to come out of the woodwork to post _this_ hot take? Really - you had to put some thought and energy into typing that out. If that's what you think, why are you here?  I just don't understand. At least the post-meta-discussion here is good for a few laughs.
text:People were raised on the internet thinking because they have an opinion and the option to voice it that means people should listen	labels:Tbh this is a general problem in the US, people think that just because you have the right to say whatever you want means you should, and any attempt to argue against that makes them think you’re taking away their right to, so they double down
text:And the misconception that your opinions shouldn't and can't change and that doing so is some sort of failure of character.	labels:Absolutely, it’s natural to be defensive of your pre held beliefs but changing them based on new information/a revelation resulting in a different worldview is nothing to be ashamed of, growth is good, it’s ok to change

text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:No offense intended OP, it’s your money and you should spend it how you choose, but I never want to think of clothing this way
text:Oh, that's fine. Absolutely one of the perspectives I was expecting to find here.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Also, this is a common rule, but no clothing that requires anything special to wear it - eg a shirt that only works when you switch around the bra straps of your convertible bra, a dress that requires shapewear to look how you want it to look, a wrap blouse that has to be pinned into place after you put it on, a shirt that requires another shirt underneath because it’s see-through - all of those are a no for me. If it doesn’t work with just my regular underclothing (except for choosing nude underclothing for light pieces) I won’t buy it - I just know by now I’m not going to make the effort to wear it when I could just put on something easier that I like just as much.

text:Why Did Bottega Veneta Delete Its Social Media Accounts?	labels:I suspect this is a marketing ploy of some description - and it has certainly worked as I have seen this covered in multiple venues. It does start/re-start the conversation about the use and value of social media for brands.   As the owner of a small brand, our results over the last few years have been mixed. We haven’t committed a lot of resources to the various social channels but I’ve found they take up a disproportionate amount of time with frequently unmeasurable results. It’s easy to see these channels as ‘free marketing’ but they are anything but. It’s good to see bigger brands look more carefully at their returns here as the costs of doing things on social media has gone up considerably. And don’t start me on ‘influencers’!
text:Thank you for bringing this small business perspective to it. I only really follow small businesses on my IG. I tried to follow my favorite brands (Acne, YSL, Casablanca, etc) and I had to unfollow. They're just a mess and I never engaged with the posts.

text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:I do know for a fact that if I tried to dress how I wanted to (deeply impacted by movies and more recently, Korean media), my family would mock me mercilessly.

text:eShakti has some really pretty scarf masks that I'm excited for this fall.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:I actually find most people are in the same boat as you, so I wouldn't worry too much.  It does take a lot of time and effort and money to keep up with fashion.  It helps to think of it as a hobby; and people who are really put together generally go about it with the zeal of, say, a stamp collector and stamps.  Just like how some people are basketball enthusiasts and others are gardening enthusiasts, there's really no reason you have to be into fashion.  I find that there's this really pervasive expectation that women all ought to naturally love clothes and fashion; and any failure to invest in that interest is a failure in some biological sensibility.     If you find yourself struggling, then I really do recommend getting a stylist or tailor or ideally both.  The stylist will push you to try things outside your comfort, the tailor will help you with fit issues, and having both can really be transformative in a very quick and immediate way.  But in terms of continuing your education or interest--that really depends on whether you want to make this a bit of a hobby.  It does take time and effort and money, after all.  And if you don't naturally find yourself interested; well, there's no sense in forcing yourself just in the name of "fitting in" to some perceived societal norm.       I assure you, from Paris to Shanghai, there are plenty of women who would rather learn the nuances of cement than spend any time pondering the fit of a pair of trousers; and there's nothing wrong with that.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:I don't trust boutiques on insta, they always seem to be fake low quality stuff. Generally you can plug the items name into a google search and see how many variations come up. Or use the same descriptors they do. Reverse image search on chrome works too.	episode_done:True

text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:Nah. I bought into that, and bought the dress. And honestly never used it.  The idea of having one dress forever is ridiculous. Styles change, bodies change, tastes change.   I’m not saying buy a dress that only fits one occasion but if you buy a dress you actually like regardless of colour or style/occasion you’ll probably get more use out of it.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:There is no way your sense of style isn't defined by others. It's impossible, everything we wear and do is marketed to us	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 02	labels:i feel like my interest in fashion has been cyclical throughout my life, where i'll care about clothes for months, if not years, and then have to drop it for a while  anyway life is pretty tough atm so i think i'm dropping fashion / reddit for a bit. see you guys on the other side!

text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:I think you can still look fashionable while ignoring heels etc.   I agree with you on heels, and my foot shape finds them quite uncomfortable, so unless they’re a platform or quite chunky (like with most booties), I just don’t do them.   Now, I personally love high waist (the higher the better, gimme that steve urkle shit 😂) but lower waist, softer fabrics, or even high quality leggings (like faux leather styles) will look much nicer than sweats.   Well-fitting basic t’s look great. They just need to fit properly across your shoulders and chest. Plenty of flat shoes exist that look nice. Vans, leather or leather-ish ballet flats, nice sneakers (e.g. New Balance or similar) with a well-tailored outfit.  Honestly a lot of it comes down to the fit of clothing, the FABRICS (I mean, put on anything pilled and it looks 🥴 immediately), and other styling elements like hair. Hair thrown into a ratty bun with sweats and uggs? Yeah I look sloppy. Straightened hair with joggers and vans? Now I look stylish! Ha.  ETA: that unfortunately body type also comes into play here. There have been quite a few posts detailing how basics look “timeless” and “stylish” on thin frames, and sloppy or unstylish on larger bodies. I thought I would throw this in there just in case, although I think most of my comments still apply regardless of body size!
text:I feel this! I think I’ve learned that I prefer chunky boot heels. You are so right about styling the hair as well. I’m gonna try to look up new hair styles!!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How to combine colors	labels:Having read a dozen of these articles, I'm not about to read a dozen more, watch multiple videos, et cetera.  The most obvious flaw in most articles I've seen on this topic is a broad lack of photos. In some others, the flaw is that the photos in no way illustrate the point.  I skipped through one of those videos. It briefly showed the woman being made over in black, and then, at the end of the video, in green. Most of the video seemed to involve large amounts of makeup, which I don't entirely understand -- won't heavy makeup change her skin tone, thus fighting the practice of trying to match clothing to her skin tone? Strategically manipulating one of these things in light of the other two is one impossibility -- strategically manipulating all three variables at the same time serves no experimental purpose, and, in the end, still doesn't really seem to make her look much better. She just goes from being a slight goth to an ordinary woman. Perhaps there would be a point if I bothered to watch the video, but I doubt it.  Is there an article you have that illustrates its point visually? Not just writing out a point and putting irrelevant pictures next to it, but actually having relevant pictures that make the point clear. Don't give me another list, because I would just pick one at random again -- please, just give me one good one.
text:>She just goes from being a slight goth to an ordinary woman  Highlighting this because I’m almost positive this is the point they were making and what they mean  by “more attractive”  She goes from “not normal”(bad and ugly) to “normal”(good and attractive).

text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I lost a lot of weight recently (AUS size 18/16 to 8), so this is probably the third time I have rebuilt a wardrobe. I am also a teacher and approaching my 30s so I wanted to appear more put together than what I did in my 20s.  It was difficult as I was anxious when clothes shopping because I had no idea what size I was at the time. My first step was to at least buy some basic but nice quality pants, I started with two pairs of jeans that I could wear to work or casually to figure out my size. She also showed me some blouses they had on sale at the time. I left with two tops and two pairs of jeans.      After knowing my size I went to a store like H&M and purchased a few more basic pieces such as blouses and pants that were suitable for work when I needed to be more professional and opposed to casual. During winter I purchased a couple of pieces that were on sale at MYER that were suitable for our weather, I also got two pencil skirts for variety.  I also took time to walk around my local shopping centre to see what was available close by to my home so I could identify what stores I should keep an eye on or watch for sales. When some of the stores I like are having a sale I will pop in and purchase a couple of things.  I also had to purchase new shoes as I lost half a shoe size (AUS 8 - 7.5)  Overall, start with some basics and keep an eye on the stores you like for sales. Every now and then if you really like something buy it. Even though I purchased all these nice clothes if I were a sim my default outfit would be tights and a denim shirt at the moment.	episode_done:True

text:Where do you get good quality, legit wool sweaters that won't rip/shrink after washing?	labels:My woolllies are Benetton's. Most of them came from Italy and they are 100% wool, sometimes mixed (a bit of cashmere, angora). I have a couple from NZ - these are 100% merino and not Benetton's. I also have a few handamde so they don't count here.  They are old, though - or vintage.  Apart from my Kiwi jumpers, as said here alteady, which can be machine washed (but in cold water, delicate cycle and inside a mesh bag), you cannot wash them in the washing machine. They may not rip if inside a laundry bag, but they will certainly felt. Somebody told me the spin cycle is what destroys them, but my machine spins while rinsing as well, so it's a no-no anyway.   Using Woolite is enough to make them last for many years. Good quality wool jumpers will last a very long time if well cared for.  Having said that, I must confess I absolutely loathe washing anything by hand. So my woollies don't get worn a lot anymore....  They are > 10 yrs old btw  Good luck!!	episode_done:True

You can share your opinion but I don’t have to follow your every word. Then you experiment with light colours yourself.

I'd prefer if it was <$100 CAD but I do know that you pay for quality in clothes and might not mind something a little pricier.
text:If it's work from home: anything (splurge for Reigning Champ?).  If it's not work from home: don't.  I'm big on casual wardrobe for work, I wear Rick Owens shit there, but even I think explicitly gym and lounge gear is kinda inappropriate for work.  I don't think I'd wear my sweats to work.	labels:LMAO I'll wear my drop crotch pod shorts to work but I draw the line at sweatpants.

text:Everyone’s opinions on Youtube fashion channels?	labels:I literally find most fashion channels unwatchabld except for bestdressed, and that’s because of her personality rather than her style.

text:General Discussion - January 20, 2021	labels:My partner is now officially my spouse. I now wear a ring which will look good with my fits, but feels really weird being just ... there on my hand, all the time now.  They vetoed me posting pictures (we have public facing jobs, these pictures are all over social media, too easy to reverse image search etc.), but they wore a Rick Owens dress (that I picked out) while I went full minimalism with a collarless shirt with onyx studs, a sleek blazer and cropped trousers. I put this together from my existing wardrobe, since we didn't want to spend a lot. Covid measures made things a bit weird, but the court officer made a real effort into making it nice, which was great. (edit: just so nobody thinks we are totally irresponsible: it was literally just us at city hall, no guests, no party. We'll catch up with that after vaccination.)  It was fun seeing all y'all Americans count down to my wedding day.

text:The joy of cordovan—and how to wear and maintain it	labels:Cordovan is an Instagram dream - it’s lustrous and has a ton of color depth. Unfortunately I find  actually wearing it is a different story. It’s extremely stiff and inflexible, especially during the first 20-30 wears. It’s the coldest leather I’ve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I’ve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I’m glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there’s no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.
text:Strange. I find them to be great hot weather wear, no warmer than calf (and cooler if unlined). Also have not had problems with permanent water spotting. I live on the equator and wear my shell in any weather.  ETA: That said, most of my shell is on the darker side (burgundy/colour 8, dark brown, black, or navy). I recommend these colours to those who are deeply bothered by water spotting.	labels:Similar experience here. I wear mine year round in Florida and don't really notice a difference between shell / calf leather as far as getting too hot. Usually what stops me from wearing boots is the weather gets so hot I don't want to wear pants so the boots go too. I can see how the spotting would annoy some, but I usually just don't wear them if I know it will rain. If they do get wet a quick wipe down with a damp cloth takes care of it for me.	episode_done:True

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:From 2001-2005, clothing I wore as a high schooler/college kid: low rise bootcut jeans, fitted graphic tshirts, fitted polo shirts, fitted shirts in general (shirts were so tight- maybe that’s why we layered??), always layering shirts- and shirts were super long and over your hips, but tight- never tucking them in, cutoff denim skirts, cotton shorts (like soffees) with words on the butt, necklace with my first initial on it, platform flip flops, dresses with Hawaiian prints (like flowers or surfers etc), hoop earrings, fitted hoodies. That’s what I can remember.
text:I have nothing to add except for the fact that as someone who graduated high school in 2013, yall were the BLUEPRINT. I have this (not exactly groundbreaking) theory that whatever the teenagers were wearing when you were a kid is influential to who you are as a person. Lizzie McGuire, Mean Girls, Paris Hilton were who I wanted to BE in the 2000s as a kid lol. Now as a 26 year old I'm reading these comments about girls who wore long silky camis and super low rise jeans to frat parties and honestly yall still somehow sound so cool to me (even though I already went through that phase wearing the mid-2010 crop tops + high waisted jeans trend)!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite bags at the moment?	labels:I am a teen, so my bag choices are more influenced based on aesthetic, rather than practicality. Also, I love designer bags.  1. Givenchy Mini Antigona in smooth leather (looks so edgy and bought this for the practicality aspect, as it can hold more items) 2. Gucci Dionysus Super Mini in black leather (can barely fit my phone in there, really is just for the aesthetic lol) 3. Prada Brushed Leather Shoulder Bag with Flap in white (my more casual everyday bag) 4. Dior Medium Lady D-Lite in Blue Cannage Embroidered Velvet (probably the sexiest bag I’ve ever seen) 5. Small Lady Dior (when I’m feeling a bit fancier)  I’m thinking of adding a Louis Vuitton backpack to my collection for days when I want everything out the way on my front and just need my hands free and also a Dior Saddle Bag. All of these bags just bring me a sense of pride ever since I started gaining interest in high fashion items. Even though I could easily buy it with my parents’ money, I busted my butt working as a barista to pay for these items, and I cherish each and every one of them. It’s even more special that I worked so hard and put in so many hours to be able to purchase them, which means so much more to me than having every luxury bag on the market. If that were the case, they wouldn’t be special anymore and wouldn’t hold the same value to me.  I also really wanted the Louis Vuitton Pochette Accessoires, for when I need to get out for a quick errand, but they’re sold out on the website :(	episode_done:True
text:What is the breakdown of $ spent for various outfits you actually wear?	labels:Almost daily outfit probably goes as follows as I'm a cheap bastard, or incredibly expensive, there's just no in between for me.   Most days (going cheap)  Vintage double rider leather jacket: $25 (from thrift)  Ralph Lauren cotton button down: 80 cents (thrift)  Uniqlo heat tech or some next level apparel shirt: $2 for the uniqlo, ~$6 for the next level  Pants: either my levi's 511 $10 (from levi's store clearance section) or calvin klein slim jeans $4 (from Costco)  Shoes: Doc Martens 1460: $42 (also on clearance)   If I'm going fancy:   Rick Owens Stooges with cashmere lining: ~$3000  Rick Owens cotton turtleneck: $700  Lululemon ABC dress pants: $100  Story et fall boots: $250   So I'm either wearing an entire outfit head to toe for <$70 or I'm wearing over $4000 worth (at least at the list/purchase price)  Im apparently really cheap or overtly bougie with no sense of balance	episode_done:True

Consider that most men’s pants fall midrise, they do not have high or low rise the way we do so I would size the waist based on the dimensions of your women’s midrise pants.  Men also have alot more inseam options than we do. Also check out brands popular in Asia - for example, Muji, even Espirit.

text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I have had the opposite experience because I'm gaining weight! I work from home in my one-story home now so it's easy to go a whole day without getting even 25% of the steps I normally would take, pre-pandemic. That plus stress-eating equals weight gain, but I'm trying to be kind to myself.   This does mean, however, that I don't fit in 75% of my clothes. I still have stretchy size 8 jeans in my closet I need to part with, which is absolutely crazy considering size 14 is what fits me most comfortably now.  I love to dress up and was often the overdressed person at pre-pandemic gatherings, so I get what you're saying about wanting nice things to wear on the rare occasion that you're seen. It feels nice to change it up from my favorite cozy/comfy sweatpants outfit I wear most days.   That said, I haven't been shopping as much as I normally would, but when I do, it's usually in-person from retail nearby so I can see items in person. I size up from what I think would fit (trying to be honest with myself) and usually it works out fine. I sometimes will over-buy, take things home to try on, then return what doesn't work. It's not perfect but that's what I've been doing, occasionally.  If I shop online, I shop from my trusted brands only, or again I follow my size-up rule.  Mostly though, I've found that the few cuter things I buy (like a Vera Wang blouse or a sweater dress from the Target down the street) hang in my closet for months before I realize I was fooling myself to think I'd rather wear this to sit at my desk than pajamas.	episode_done:True

text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:This style was trending waaaay before the pandemic in the slow fashion world. Oversized prairie dresses, loose billowy tops, elastic waist wide leg linen pants, dresses that resemble paper sacks, etc. I always wanted to try some of these styles but at work I mostly wore fitted and the more traditionally feminine  business causal clothing. To me a lot of the slow fashion stuff looked comfortable but not something I could pull off in the office and I always had a mental block about justifying spending money on clothes outside of work wear. Now that I don’t go into the office I’ve spent a ton of money on these types of items, and I suspect there are a lot more like me.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:Short of getting a bit of insider info, I think the only way to really have success at those stores is to browse them at least once a week (probably twice).  My aunt tends to go every other day and finds some amazing stuff…because she goes *every other day*.  She says it doesn’t take her long because she’s so familiar with their stock, but it still seems exhausting to me.  (As opposed to spending three hours scrolling through Poshmark in bed every night…)
text:Definitely agree with this. I consider it my "quiet time" when I'm combing through a store like TJ Maxx or even a thrift store. It's not a hobby for people in a hurry. I enjoy the hunt almost as much as I enjoy the find!	labels:I used to. But last time I was browsing Marshall's, I was followed by a security guy. Made me feel guilty for just looking and not really buying (but at the point he started following me, I wasn't through the section I really wanted to see.) Sure hurried out of there, haven't been back.	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Beauty is Pain	labels:I go old school by making my corsets with actual human bones. Now I am ethical so mine are reclaimed grave bones of my size (or smaller to give me motivation to be slimmer).   I adore vintage fashion so the corsets etc 'donors' have died the original time the style was invented. This also involves some really good back to the land shovelling.  That sounds hard, but that's authenticity baby.    Also if it is a great outfit I take it. #upcycling #environment #ecofashion	episode_done:True

Then I wore a dress, no one commented on it and we all moved on with our lives. Now I'm happily flip flopping between super feminine and more leather/cool/boyish looking styles :)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is your favorite clothing purchase of the year, and why?	labels:I bought a Seiko Flightmaster SNA-411 watch early in the Summer and have been really enjoying it. It's very different from other watches I have, busy-looking dial, but fun to look at.   In case watches don't count as clothes, my second favorite is a Barbour Sapper jacket, which I found in the Spring at a very good price. I've gotten a lot of use out of it. It's warm and dry, good pockets, and looks nice.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 10, 2021	labels:Out of curiosity what setups are you guys using to take and edit your fit pics? Phone in a mug? Professional camera? What focal length is your lens, are you using a tripod? Anything interesting you'd like to share?  I have a 23mm lens on a Fuji X-Pro1 (APS-C, so I believe 35mm equivalent) that I usually mount on a tripod with a 10sec timer & 6-frame burst-shot. It's time consuming to set up and get a good picture because the preview is tiny and there's no e.g. WiFi sharing so my alternative setup is a phone mount for the same tripod. Recently discovered I can get a live preview from my phone on my laptop so I've been using that to browse the pictures and check I've framed everything correctly etc.  I use the lightroom mobile app to crop and edit the photos. Basically every photo is cropped because I have to stand quite far back from the camera to get everything in without distortion.

They look like they’re wearing the most basic clothes girls wore at my mistake of a Christian college, the removed girls, and *please* do not get me started on the white washing of some of my faves!!!

Does anyone have any stylish but functional suggestions? For the time being I've been unhinging my jaw like a snake and fitting everything down my gullet till I need it, but space is limited and I'd like to be able to carry a few more essentials. I really am a purse person.

text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:When I was at my heaviest weight I was actually *proud* that I didn’t wear proper jeans for 5 years, instead I wore jeggings and leggings under short skirts/dresses.

text:Speaking to the LGBTQ-owned label whose kilts were adopted by Proud Boys	labels:I understand discontinuing the kilts to disassociate with them, but why not just keep selling them and continue to give all profits to charity?

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:YES. I've never paid enough attention to pants in my wardrobe until about two years ago. I mean, years ago when the mom jean/boyfriend jean became I thing, I did hop on the train; but mom jeans and skinny jeans were really the only thing I had, never really paid attention to pants that much. UNTIL TWO YEARS AGO. PANTS CAN SAVE YOU FROM YOUR BORING PANT-LESS LIFESTYLE AND ELEVATE YOUR SOCIAL STATUS.  Well, this was the case for me, at least.  I started with ambitious rips. Then I got more into the loose/baggy jean look. Then I got into joggers, straight-leg, wide-leg, balloon pants, cargo, sweats, patterned pants etc. Now I have a wide assortment of pants that fit every vibe, every minuscule emotion, every single hormone that possesses me that day. Now I'm just a huge pants fan. People are always complimenting me on my pants. Everyone by default pays more attention to what is worn on top when planning an outfit, but when the BOTTOM is factored in -- WOW you really know what you're doing.  There is nothing wrong with skinny jeans -- they're versatile in nature and really can go with everything. But it can get boring quickly. A strong, multi-dimensional pants game can elevate your look and wardrobe. I really do recommend looking at the pants on Aritzia, for example, Or Hailey Bieber's/Kendall Jenner's outfits. I tend to rely on Pinterest a lot for ideas and inspo.  PS. Many times have I failed in my pants journey (bought pieces that were actually quite ugly/didn't work/unflattering/one-time wear kind of thing). BUT BEAUTIFUL PANTS IS A JOURNEY AND A PROCESS. I'd start simple (like a wide-leg or mom jean or patterned loose pant) to ease yourself into a different pant-style. And once you feel more wild and comfortable, explore more.	episode_done:True
text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:/r/BlueCollarWomen might be of help here.  I split my time between the office (well, from home) and field work. For boots, I LOVE my Carhartt 6" composite toe hiking boots. I tried construction sole boots for a hot second and decided I have better traction with hiking boots. Red Wings has several women's safety toe shoes as well  For pants (again of the more cargo/field variety), I love 5.11 Tactical. They have women's cargo pants that are durable, actually cut for those of us with an ass, have useable pockets, and have a *hammer loop*. I bought one pair, tested it out for a month, loved them, and went back for 2 more.  As for looking professional, polo shirts are the default, but not particularly fashionable. Tailored fit button down camping shirts might be worth looking into as well. I'm not much help here because any time I'm meeting non-company personnel on site, I'm probably wearing company branded outerwear.
text:I am between an office and field also and I find good comfy boots, and comfortable base layers such as cami, t, and “long underwear” in the winter.  It makes a difference, I wear a uniform so it is pretty “lite” on make up and jewellery, but I work on a simple but nice job on my hair as it is also quite long and needs to be tied up high!.    If I need to be at a more professional or less “uniform” I will bring if I have to travel that day or while on course, I will take a few button ups , a nice blouse, and dress pants or skirt and tights.  As it is a toned down environment, it means classic but cute, so a nice set of earrings, classy but simple make up and a few muted accessories., a really cute classic skirt is easy to travel and pair it with a variety of shoes will work nicely.  It is a bit of a hassle bringing more clothes as well as shoes but it is often business casual.    I try and go a tad more than chinos and a polo if possible as I do not dress up often and it is a fun mix up.	labels:	episode_done:True

I have MAJOR issues with restrictive clothing. Winter coats feel like a straitjacket, turtlenecks \*literally\* made me vomit when I was younger, and anything that's even slightly itchy or makes a weird noise (like a swishy windbreaker) drives me insane. I can't wear bracelets or watches because the sound of them clicking on my desk grates against my soul.  I usually live in American Eagle jeggings (soft joggers as soon as I get home), comfortable shirts, soft and loose sweaters/cardigans, comfortable ankle boots/Converse, and sometimes a well-fitting skirt with tights.  Interestingly, I have no issue with wearing tights, which I know a lot of women find uncomfortable. I don't mind wearing a bra, either.

Went crazy on walmart camis so I could wear them under button downs and also go braless.  Got a bunch of portofino/express button downs because the fabric is flexible, they are very wrinkle proof, and it's comfy.	episode_done:True
text:People who made out like a bandit during COVID-19 sales, what gems have you picked up?	labels:The lululemon sub is a CULT but since I got a job after being laid off for months and it's work from home I've been obsessed.

text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:If you don't have any requirements about synthetic fabrics, you have a lot more options. Are you in a climate controlled warehouse? I basically dress for outside weather every day just in case I get stuck out there all day.  Golf polos and dark jeans. T-shirts and tops with fancy/formal detailing (like a half zip and a little pocket, or a fabric with a neat pattern or modest see-through or lacey details on the shoulders). If they have giveaway or purchasable polos with the company logo those are a good option. I used to only wear unisex cotton blend tshirts to work on the days when I would be sweating a lot, but I invested in some nicer athletic fabric v neck tees from Under Armour and now even drenched in sweat I at least look better than I did in high school marching band camp. Also on the topic of sweating, if you know you'll get gross, bring a change of clothes so you can look and feel fresh for your afternoon meetings!  I've seen some womens' only safety toe brands, but never tried them. I use the free boot truck at work. But they have some that we call the "el jefe" boots, that look more like boating shoes or desert boots or are a nicer looking leather. Those might be a good option to make you feel confident and put together.  I think fit goes a long way to make you look professional (and like a boss).

text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:Security here.   My non-work wardrobe is extensive and colourful and very 1950s.  I don't like wearing my security uniform into work unless it's freezing cold and I can hide it under a winter coat, because it's made by the same uniform supplier as our local PD.   So I end up wearing most of my clothes anyways, because I don't want to be mistaken for something I'm not.      Plus i've had incidents where people threaten to wait outside for me after I get off work (because I've kicked them out, or caught them stealing) and I've walked right by them and they have NO IDEA because I look so different in my regular clothes.   So it's a safety thing too.	episode_done:True

text:I'm Not a Watch Guy I Swear - Street x Sprezza	labels:I am a watch guy, but very much a relatively broke one.  Had I known how much trouble it would be to break into watches, I might have said never mind and wisely walked away. I didn’t, though.   Some pointers for those interested:  1.	The cost of the watch is only the upfront cost. Like a car, a mechanical watch needs regular maintenance. Generally speaking, this will be anywhere from $300 to $1,000+...every 5-7 years.  2.	Because of point #1, entry level (~ $500) mechanical watches are not pieces you will pass down to your kids. In fact, it is usually cheaper to trash them entirely and buy new than to bother having them serviced.  3.	People will tell you there are deals to be had in the vintage market. That’s true, but it can also be difficult to find parts or people willing to work on them. 4.	There is relatively little offered between entry level and about $3,000.  5.	There is nothing wrong with wearing a quartz or digital watch.   All that being said, I still love my small collection. Just wish I had known those things from the start.

text:Bags that are actually beautiful - what are you loving?	labels:I’m also a fan of understated but elegant handbags. I bought a pre-loved Celine nano luggage that I have been loving. I enjoy Mulberry’s designs too and will probably get my next bag from there as their bags are relatively affordable compared to some of the bigger designer names. I love Chloe bags too but I think those might be a little too trendy and blingy for me.  Totally agree with you on Bottega, I think it’s overrated, especially the dumpling looking bags.
text:I was also considering getting the Mulberry Alexa (which I wanted back in the day), but it reads a little too cutesy to me, and in general Mulberry I associate with upper middle class 40+ Londoner, though I think their designs are really beautiful.   Agree with you on Chloe designs being nice but too trendy/iconic, I swear when I was younger there were so many nice bag designs (celine luggage, alexander wang cylinder satchel, proenza schouler etc.). I just can't with the boxy BV bags either or any bags that look like a hard square...  Feel like these bags are going to be out before they are in. Heavy branding on YSL bags has already cheapened their look to me. Love Cos/Madewell bags but the colour selection is boring (just black/tan). Meh!

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.

We recently found out (3 weeks ago) that he has autistic spectrum disorder and we’ve missed it because he also has a high IQ.  He’s hit a growth spurt recently and I’d like to move his wardrobe to more sensory friendly/ easier to dress himself clothes. He's going to have enough hardships in life, I figure that his clothes don't need to be one of them. It would also be pretty amazing if we could help him develop his own sense of style!  I think that there are pieces in streetwear that would be much easier for him to use than the jeans, flannel and laces boots that I wear. Seriously, this old millennial hipster basically looks like the token bearded bastard on every small batch beer label.  I’m looking for a starting place to find affordable pieces that I can help him start building a new wardrobe out of.  His needs: No buttons, no laces that need to be tied  His preferences: He doesn’t like material touching his calves with the exception of pjs, he dislikes wearing socks or shoes that go above his ankles  His likes: Space, nerd culture, kind messages, bright colors and fun graphics  Side note, my wife was recently diagnosed with cancer for the second time so our budget is really tight with her upcoming treatments.  If you made it this far in my post I appreciate your heroic effort! Thank you for any help you can provide.

I sent RC an email explaining the situation, and they happily sent me a replacement pair and a prepaid label to have the defective pair shipped back. It's entirely possible the rip was my fault and I didn't notice (could've easily snagged it on something), but they took care of me.  I would try contacting them and see if they can do anything for you. At 2 months, it may be pushing it, but if you make an effort to articulate your situation, you might get a replacement. Mention that you took the advice of online fashion forums when you made your purchase and that you were surprised by the poor durability and that you think you may have gotten a defective item.

I will say some of my stuff fits similarly. Like MOST of my pants are high waisted skinnies, but in a bunch of colors/patterns. I have like...10-12 beanies that are all different colors...  I'd say my handbags is the part of my wardrobe I change out the least. I have a black pleather mini backpack and a beige woven cross body that are my go-tos, with like 3 other bags for special occasions.	episode_done:True
text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:In the old days where one got dressed I had somewhat of a personal uniform:   The perfect black pant (own four of them, cheap from h&m but perfect for me) plus the same blousish top in all nice colors they sell it in (short and long sleeve) plus cardigans in all nice colors they sell it in, though mostly black ones. Some neutral blazers. Some dresses.  For fancy appointments I own the same etui dress and blazer combination in black, navy and grey.   Shoes black leather (ballerina, winter, closed shoe, pumps).   My whole wardrobe fits in one ikea pax (1 meter/3 ft). Generally it is boring bottoms and some more color for the tops. I always feel huge in colored pants.

I'd agree that there are likely too many sellers now compared to buyers - or at least too much merchandise compared to buyers. To me, that makes Poshmark too much like Ebay, and is no longer as distinct a platform as it used to be.  Edit: typos
text:I've got some great deals as a buyer and now I'm dipping into selling, just to get rid of some old stuff without having to dump it at a thrift store where I know it will probably be thrown away.   The wholesalers have ruined the site, I feel like it's impossible to discover new brands, since if you don't type in a specific brand the results are almost all shitty wholesalers selling crap.   Ha there is wayyyy too much merchandise on both of those sites, I might never have to buy new clothing ever again! It's shocking how wasteful the clothing industry has become.	labels:Go to the filters and the Boutique and Closet option. Choose closet only, it takes away all the crappy wholesale stuff.	episode_done:True

text:Is black tie comfort fashion a thing?	labels:As far as the baggy thing I don’t have too much info  But my buddy has a similar sensitivity and he gets almost all of his non cotton clothing (so generally, suits) lined with his safe fabrics by his tailor.

text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:Anuschka Rees does a great job of explaining how to merge styles in one wardrobe:  “If you think about it, a style is nothing but a set of individual elements. To merge two different aesthetics, you need to break them up into their elements, carefully select exactly which of these you want to incorporate into your own style concept, and then figure out how to turn them into actual outfits.   *As a first step, you need to ask yourself which exact elements—colors, shapes, textures, specific pieces, details, and so on—of those two styles you want to be a part of your own unique look.* By doing this, you are reducing those big, restrictive top-level concepts into a simple set of tangible elements that are much easier to work with.”  For my wardrobe last year I wanted to add some typical cottage+cowboy style pieces, since I live on a farm now and it felt kind of fun. Using her method I broke down what I liked about the cottage/farm style into this: - patterns and colours: plaid, paisley, traditional embroidery, light colours, plant/animals print, fringe - materials: cotton, leather, suede, denim - items: flowy dresses + tops, cowboy boots, sandals   Using all of that I added the following items over the last year ish: - white embroidered denim jacket - black denim jacket with plaid lining - cowboy boots - flowy embroidered blouse - flowy paisley dress - embroidered jeans - fringe skirt  I usually have a tougher/punker look, so i can wear eg my plaid sundress with sandals + embroidered jacket for a countrier look, or I can wear it with my combat boots. I can wear my embroidered jeans with my embroidered blouse for a cottage look, or I can wear it with a colourblock sweater and ankle boots for a day in the city. It added a bit of feminine with the flowiness but also more of the masculine that I usually gravitate towards. Still really versatile!

text:Dressing for “housework” vs “working from my house”	labels:Why wear shoes at all if you're home? I wear shearling slippers when it's cold, and just socks when it's not.
text:My feet started to ache a lot from standing all the time barefoot.  Before the pandemic, my shoes were off at the door and my house was quite shoe-free.  Since the pandemic, I wear shoes for like 4-5 hours a week instead of 50 hours a week and my feet need more support.  I designated a pair of my "regular" shoes to be house-shoes for the foreseeable future because I need support and structure for my feet.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 04, 2021	labels:Sidebar; I've been thinking about what I/we can do to bring some light-heartedness and fun into the sub. Would anyone else have interest in a Meme Monday or similar to have one fun post to poke fun at ourselves and joke around? mfa_irl is fun but low activity, and I actually want to engage lurkers (positively).
text:I like the idea. MFA is a large sub, but I get the feeling it has a relatively low level of engagement compared to other subs. I don’t really see a need to relegate memes and other lighthearted content to separate subs that most lurkers will never find.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:I think that as we age, we have more responsibilities crowding in that can push out time for staying current with fashion, unless we make intentional choices to carve out that time.  I also think that our fashion circles change as we age - it’s not natural to be surrounded by whatever is trendy for people in their teens - early 20s. I’m 33 and work in academia - the students I teach have a very different perception of what is trendy/cool than I do, and I would assume that a lot of that has to do with the influencers and social media we consume.  There was a discussion here a few weeks ago about Gen Z vs Millennial fashion, and I was cracking up - I am pretty fashionable in my same-age friend set, but a lot of the comments from the Gen Z participants described items that look “old” to them that I still wear regularly.   I think the other piece of this is pairing. Most items that cycle back around in style may be older items, but they have to be styled differently than they were the first time to look fresh (*cough Doc Martens cough*). If someone styles a currently trendy item the same way they did 10-20 years ago, it will probably look dated even if the item itself is trendy.   Finally, as we age, I think we stop thinking of fashion as one of the only ways we can communicate who we are to the world. When I was 22, I cared a lot more about what my clothes said about me because I didn’t yet have many professional/personal accomplishments. Now, I care a lot less. Style is a enjoyable hobby for me so I still think about my clothes, but more as a way to have fun - at this point, I’ve built somewhat of a professional reputation for myself and my clothes don’t need to have such a prominent voice to others.	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:I recently lived in Paris near some of the the biggest tourist attractions, and I would spot Instagram influencers daily. I’d say I’d see them change into heels about half the time. Some folks just commit, but it always stood out as unusual. Paris is not stiletto friendly. Although it’s seen as a formal city, compared to any American metropolis, footwear is casual and out wear is practical. That being said, a 2-3 inch heeled boot or bootie was not uncommon and along with sneakers, the norm.   My most memorable influencer sighting was a very glamorous woman in a tiny yellow dress and heels on a 40 degree (Fahrenheit) day taking pictures on a windy terrace, only to see her minutes later coming out of a public restroom in weather appropriate and casual attire.   I feel like this stuff is dependent on your own lifestyle, and the context of the city. My own comfort level with heels has changed significantly over the past decade, from wearing a heel everywhere, everyday to now owning one pair for parties.  As for non-heeled influencers: there are so many! What kind of style do you gravitative towards?

text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:I think that an under-discussed part of picking out a first suit for these types of things is getting out and trying them on before you buy. Being comfortable in a suit, even if it’s cheaper or in a less fashionable cut, is more important in interview settings than the eye to detail and quality that we normally discuss on here. A suit that fits in the shoulders, in a neutral color like navy or charcoal, that you know fits because you were able to try it on is way more important to your success than ordering something online that might be objectively better. Interviewers are looking for you to meet their minimum standard of professionalism, not for you to wow with with sartorial taste. Source: had a lot of interviews in college and law school.
text:Totally agree with your take. I had to wear a number of suits for professional events and interviews.   Make sure the suit fits and stick to charcoal and navy. Invest in making sure the clothes fit (aka. a tailor) and not overspend on the interview suit. Same with the shirt and tie; keep it neutral and unoffensive. Don't need loud patterns on the shirt or the tie. You're not there to peacock your fashion; be memorable through showing qualifications for the job.	labels:	episode_done:True

Awful photo, the jacket could barely sit worse if they tried. 3. One of the least bad things here, and the dude is literally wearing his blazer with a white tee and sweatpants. 4. "Layer it" -- ah, the standard cliche. 5. "Wear it with this expensive moncler vest, who cares if it looks good? That logo is GIGANTIC!" 6. Two completely different suggestions, one of which is their second unhelpful cliche. Somebody clearly took the photo first and they wrote the tip afterwards. 7. "Play with color." Oh, gee, really? I was only going to wear a white shirt and gray trousers with a navy blazer, ever, but gee, you want me to *consider things*? Cool. Thanks. Super helpful, Mr. P. 8. "More formality" -- shows a wide-open denim shirt, sunglasses, a mess of bracelets under an open wrist...  Yay, I caught 'em all, what do I win?

text:Can someone tell me where people get their outfits that we see during Seoul Fashion Week?	labels:A lot of people who go to these things are SUPER into fashion and most likely have been collecting clothes for a long time.

Third picture has a Lady Dior that runs about 4000-5000+ new. I'm not familiar with any of the clothing but some brands you could look into as a first step are Undercover and Comme des Garçons (and its various lines).  For the affordability issue, I second going on Yahoo! Japan and other resale sites but you need to know what you're looking for and have some idea of what might be a fake. This is also good if you're looking for past season clothing and other rare pieces. For more current stuff, you can also try SSENSE during their sale seasons.	episode_done:True

My only complaint is that it doesn’t quite fit  sunglasses + phone + keys. It’ll fit 2 of 3 very nicely, but that third one doesn’t happen.  My larger bag is a either the Mulberry Alexa or Bayswater. My Alexa is 10 years old and seems to look nicer with wear. I did treat the leather so that I could take into it in rain, but I’m not particularly nice to it (things have spilled in it, and I’ve overstuffed it more times than I can count...). It’s a perfectly sized cross body bag (translation: fits tons of stuff and frees up your hands so you can do all the things!).  The Bayswater is my work bag. I can fit my laptop in this, along with my walled on a chain (so no changing bags!). It’s structured, so it looks polished and professional. I’ve had it for 3 years and it isn’t showing much wear yet.   My advice: get a small wallet on a chain type bag and a larger zip top leather tote. Not having to change bags and wallets was a game changer for me.	episode_done:True
text:Let's Talk about hats	labels:Don't wear them inside. But that one is pretty spoken. Edit: inside a house. Not like shopping at the mall or as a required element of your job uniform...  Don't buy them too tight - it's tempting to ensure they don't fall off your head but they'll leave red marks on your forehead.  Remember to wear forehead sunscreen if youre wearing a backwards baseball cap or you'll have a very, very strange tan line. Thats not from experience at all...
text:Girl if I go to the trouble to put on a hat and secure it to my head, you better believe I'm keeping that shit on inside.   If you take it off, it ruins the security previously established when you left home, never to be attained again on the go, you inevitably have hat hair, and then you have to carry it or put it somewhere, which is annoying.   Wear your hats inside! No one cares!	labels:Its generally considered very rude to wear a hat inside someones house in my area (and many others) which is why I mentioned it. I wouldnt actually say anything to someone who wore a hat in my house bc thats super awkward and rude lol. Of course this may vary with location and absolutely never applies to religious head coverings.

text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:I’m in Toronto, Canada.  By January, no one is wearing cute outfits anymore... it’s all goose-down water resistant parkas, balaclavas, Uniqlo heattech long-johns under thick jeans and heavy boots.  But before it gets to those super extreme sad months, I like wearing a short fitted puffer jacket with a winter down miniskirt over leggings and doc martens.  The short jacket makes me feel like I still have a shape and the down miniskirt keeps my bum warm and looks cute.

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.
text:Exactly. It’s the fantasy life that those images convey. When I see someone wearing crisp trousers, soft button ups, stilettos, etc., I imagine that I’m living the life of someone wearing them. Effortless, breezy, maybe wandering around Paris window shopping on a nice spring day... but in reality I’m working from home on my couch. Structured trousers would be uncomfortable AF, cotton/linen blouses would be a wrinkly mess, my cat would get fur everywhere, I’m allergic to wool and I don’t wear shoes in my house, because ew. Or I’m going for a walk in my neighbourhood after work and it’s raining and dark, so I need a waterproof/reflective jacket and sturdy boots. It’s fun to look at pictures of nice styles, but they aren’t my reality.	labels:Ironically, right before the pandemic I was looking at buying a new suit, as I was just months into a new job that required me to be a bit more "business" (at least on 5 or so days a year) than my previous "distracted-professor" type jobs. I'm now glad I hadn't bit the bullet yet.   I just bought a new pair of jeans, as I was wearing out my previous pair. The ones that came are a little too big (despite being the same numerical size, style, *and color* as my last pair...), but maybe that's ok right now?	episode_done:True
text:“I'm all locked down with nowhere to go – but that hasn't killed my lust for fashion”	labels:Ugh I got the most DIVINE 70's Jean Muir dress that I've worn once for virtual Christmas mass with my parents. I can. not. wait to break it out for brunches and shopping and maybe even a date night or six!  I also can't stop buying fancy sneakers? I might be wearing a beige tracksuit for the third day in a row but goddamnit at least I have pink glitter sneakers.  I'll be honest though, I dress pretty loud on the day-to-day (orange skirt, bright blue sweater, red jacket) so it's not that big of a change.	episode_done:True

text:I wonder if they'll all come back once things get back to normal	labels:I was wondering that too, but I have a friend that works as a manager at one of the stores that closed and he said it wasn’t likely at least anytime soon. Luckily he was already in the process of moving and they transferred him to another store.	episode_done:True
text:+J/UNIQLO SPECIAL COLLABORATION: What’s the verdict?	labels:I got the silk turtleneck is grey and black. I never see turtlenecks made of 100% silk so it intrigued me. The material is very thin as expected with silk so I skipped the white one. The standout of the silk knits would be the grey. The grey has a nice sheen to it and looks so luxe compared to a regular cotton turtleneck. They are so soft and warm and I can see myself wearing them for many years. I also got the double breasted wool coat in black. I had no intention of buying this but decided to try it on. I am a short gyal and this coat fit me so well I snatched it up right away. I was in the market for a new coat but was thinking of buying an Aritzia one but this one fit me much better. The thing I noticed with this coat is that the arms are cut in a way that it curves with the way that your arms fall on your body. It also has two inside pockets. I’m very impressed! I also tried the cashmere coats but I didn’t like those as much as I wanted something with a little more weight and more structured.

text:Riches to rags: The myth of sustainable fashion (The Financial Times).	labels:The best pieces of clothing I have I've found from driftstores.

text:I wish! I am a very common size - it is so rare to find anything in a thrift store that is good and fits!	labels:I'm an uncommon size so it's also rare for me to find anything that fits lol	episode_done:True
text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I had a school uniform til 17 and truly wore the most random clothing until I was done university. I never thought of the clothes I owned as a whole, and instead just picked up whatever piece of clothing caught my little magpie eye.   When I was about 23 I started looking at my clothes a bit more strategically in terms of “outfits” rather than “items” as in, if I want to have these cool funky pants then maybe I need to have a simple black shirt to go with it. When I started I definitely got sucked into the “essentials in every wardrobe” lists but in the last two years (since I was 24!!) or so I have learned stopped using those as a template for my own closet.   It also helped that I became a bit more confident in myself — I used to just want to blend in and be unnoticed and that showed in my wardrobe, but now I am happy to be wearing something a little more out there. I have always loved the ripped jeans, all black, big stompy boots look, but where I grew up was so not a big stompy boots country that you couldn’t even find items like that back in my day. Now that I’m older I’m more confident in wearing those kinds of items.    Since that is my main style I don’t vary too much from it, but I have been enjoying working on little “mini capsules” of items that are a style I like to delve into occasionally, such as a cowboy/cottagey look or just looking like a disco ball. I have a very narrow colour palette of 3 colours so  as long as my mini capsule items are the same three colours I can wear them head to toe for eg a full cottagey look, or I can just wear my peasant blouse and black jeans to tone it down. :)	episode_done:True
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Nothing that needs to be dry cleaned except winter coats. Hate the smell, hate the bother, hate the expense.  No glitter, no metallic thread. I like it on other people, but on me it makes me feel like I’m wearing a costume. Sequins and paillettes only on formal evening wear (for me).  No dolman sleeves (for me). I don’t like how they look on my busty inverted triangle shape.
text:YES. I used to have a ton of silk and fine wool clothes...when I lived in an apartment in Manhattan, with a dry cleaner on the way to the subway, and didn’t have kids.   They started to fall by the wayside after I had a kid and was tired of getting spit-up on them, and now I live in a house that requires me to drive to a cleaners. Screw that.   I still wear the merino sweaters from Uniqlo all the time but machine wash them on gentle and hang dry, and because they’re $40 I don’t mind if they occasionally go through the dryer by mistake (they don’t shrink much).     All done cleaners, as my toddler used to say.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:All-time favorite cold weather pieces?	labels:For slippers, there are various version of "down booties" for cheap on Amazon or for more at REI. Don't bother getting anything else, down booties are the best things around. I use mine camping and just around the house. I will never go through life without them again.	episode_done:True
text:Natural Fibres	labels:I just made my first order from Seams Friendly. They are based in India. Apparently everything is sustainably ethically made. Natural fibers and naturally dyed.   The best part is they make everything to order using your measurements so clothes are basically tailored to you. And the prices are unbelievably reasonable.   I ordered a dress and a top, both are 100% cotton, well constructed, and fit me like they were made for me (because they were).   The one drawback is it took about 6 weeks from order to arrival, but I actually think that’s pretty quick for something that was made to order and then shipped from India to the US.
text:Oh wow. Thank you. The prices are reasonable as well. Plus, they have some old Indian art styles as well.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:Here's a different point of view... I'd take a serious look at two categories beyond the bespoke / haute couture options.  First, my preference is for the Italian tailoring houses. Kiton, Zegna, Loro Piana, and Etro Milano etc.  First, they are more male / menswear oriented. And their materials and tailoring are exceptional and can be altered or mtm if needed. I have a Loro Piana Icer in cashmere that's beyond mere mortals. Of course, $4,000 won't get you very far - - but the quality is a level beyond the French design houses.   Second, depending on his design taste (and if I was younger) I'd consider the younger brands like CP Co, Rick Owens, Acne Studios, etc to see if they are more in tune with my desired look.	episode_done:True
text:Can Your Outfit Influence the Way You Feel? Enclothed cognition describes the effect that clothing have on how an individual thinks, feels, and behaves	labels:All the time yes.

text:What is the upscale version of Fashion Nova / SHEIN / boohoo / Nasty Gal? i.e. trendy + youth-oriented but not trash quality	labels:Reformation does some sexy/trendy stuff, but I wouldn’t say the quality is amazing for the price.   You might have luck with Topshop? I don’t know where you’re located, but in the U.S. Nordstrom’s junior department has an entire Topshop section. It also frequently shows up at Nordstrom Rack.
text:I've found reformation's quality to be horrible - especially for their price tag. They're a hard pass for me.  Unlined dresses, finicky materials, ruined after washing, etc.	labels:Reformation quality is the absolute worst. I stopped shopping there after a t shirt fell apart after one wash and they refused to refund it. They have very shady sale practices as well.  Beware their sales, it’s all clothing of very poor quality saved for sale, most of it was never on sale for reg price in the first place. And it’s all final sale.	episode_done:True
text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I am a teacher that went back to working in the building at the beginning of September, so to be fair I was only wfh for several months in the spring, but it still drastically changed my style, or my perspective on my style.   Pre-Covid my work style (and general style) had morphed over the years to become very, very minimal and neutral. Lots of Everlane and Eileen Fisher. This was both because I wanted to be taken seriously at my job (I read very young) and because it also seemed like what was in style to me.   Returning to work in the fall, I realized I really f*cking hated all of my sensible, plain, go with everything black and grey clothes.   I still really prefer earth tones and blacks and greys, and I still wear some pretty simple outfits somedays, but I went on a small spree on The RealReal after I had my realization. I bought myself some louder statement pieces that feel more me, including an embroidered Happy Sheep sweater, a knit Missoni sheath dress, a multi-colored leather and fur purse, platform oxfords, and a couple of geometric patterned silk shirts and dresses.   For me life is too short to try so hard to be timeless and professional. I’m not knocking the look, it just isn’t ~me~ I want to love the clothes I wear and the clothes I love are fun knits and patterns.
text:I have kind of done this over the fall as well...  In the last few years I wore so much black- black shirts,  black leggings....every day.   Since I had to wear all black for work  the only nice things I bought for myself were black...  I just got so sick of it I started craving color. So I have kind of been on a spree but only for things with color, pattern, LIFE!  Life is too short to just live in neutrals	labels:	episode_done:True

Pack them in the closet but bne careful they don't come into contct with clothes  You can also get moth traps, sticky things which they will stick to  Seal suits up in zipped garment bags as previous suggestions  Central heating doesn't help  be clean in the home make sure you vacuum regularly especially corners and edges because eggs are laid in corners	episode_done:True
text:Why Ralph Lauren Never Goes Out of Style	labels:My first job was for RL and I actually just quit as an HR manager there this summer to start my own company. RL will always hold a special place in my heart, at the top they really are a good company. There’s some corporate shenanigans on the district levels and below but nobody’s perfect. Ralph pumps out a lot of pieces and some of it really is ass but those special pieces are *special*. RRL and Purple can’t be beat. Going forward I’d start to stray away from outlets as more and more items are being made specifically for outlets instead of strictly just being the previous season’s items as it used to be :/	episode_done:True
text:What niche do you feel is missing from the fashion blogging/YouTube world?	labels:Alternative fashion bloggers... that aren't teenagers.

text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:I loved modcloth because it fit perfectly in my wardrobe requirements (I am a professor and project manager at a design company, and I essentially live in floral print dresses, cardigans and leggings). Their plus size options were stylish and fit great. I did notice the dip in quality when they were bought out by Walmart, my newer dresses from them rip too easily and the threads are constantly coming loose.   Does anyone have recommendations for other, similar online stores with a great plus size selection? I've been disappointed with certain items on Torrid's website when I try them on, and I at least knew I'd always get a good fit ordering from Modcloth. I have an auto immune condition so I don't go shopping in person anymore.	episode_done:True
text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:I spent like two months investing in a bunch of nice wool sweaters that I could wear through the winter, put them in a separate laundry bin after wearing so I could launder them myself, but my ex washed and dried them on high heat and they all shrunk so badly that I couldn't even fit them on my dog. About $1500 gone.
text:I'm not currently in a relationship and I live at home, so obviously it's a bit different, but omg I have never been so thankful that my dad and brother are actually really good at laundry.

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls” catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your “fashion house designers” but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I’ve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.
text:Johnston of Elgin is fantastic! I visited the factory while in Scotland and it was so fascinating to see how their goods are made. I got a few sweaters and a hat while there, and it’s been two years with very minor pilling (nothing a shaver couldn’t put right quickly) and lots of wear.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel the black Friday sales better or worse than usually this year? Is it worth to buy clothing you won't wear until next year?	labels:I always think Black Friday is overhyped. When I worked in retail, we would actually mark up our prices a couple of weeks before Black Friday and then put everything “on sale”.  I’ve found way better deals shopping end-of-season sales where brands are actually motivated to clear out their inventory for the new season.

I think the last time I got new clothes besides socks was like...2-3 years ago.    Treat it like any other expense.

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:The best response I’ve ever heard for this question was comparing runway high fashion to the concept cars you’ll see at auto shows. Those cars will often never make it into production but that’s not the point. The point is to show off new materials, technologies, design philosophies or to generally stir up interest in a brand. Same for fashion.
text:But I feel like unlike runway fashion, concept cars are more appealing to the masses, even if they ultimately can't afford them.	labels:It doesn't make much sense; a businessperson will always look more on-point with a futuristic funny-looking sportscar than a geometric nightmare of a peacoat.	episode_done:True

I also go the opposite, slim fitted trousers and ponte pants with more whimsical tops. I'm not really pushing an boundaries because the industry I work in is pretty relaxed even for execs, but I definitely look a little different from most others in my office.

text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:I have a pair of olive green pants and I used to have a pair of maroon ones that I loved and wore out. I also love plaid pants but only have one pair right now - white and black with a pale pink stripe.  Neutrals are always good with crazy color pants, but so are complimentary colors. Some combos I think would work:  Pink/Teal  Orange/Royal Blue  Purple/Mustard  &#x200B;  I wear my green pants with rose/blush a lot, and I also really like black and white pants that have a pattern on them. It's like the fun of wild colored pants without the commitment to a color.	episode_done:True
text:London street style Inspo (circa 1985-1990s)	labels:As everyone is saying, this could be today. I was especially struck by the girl in the carhart vest.  Even more so because the clarity of the photos sets it apart (visually) from earlier vintage looks. If it weren’t for peripheral details like the cars, cigarette boxes, amount of garbage on the street, etc. I wouldn’t be convinced this was 30 years old.  Kind of interesting to compare with some of the outfits and haircuts in the backgrounds, which seem more typical for the era.
text:Yeah the carhartt fits are exactly just like how /r/streetwear is dressing these days. Makes it more impressive how certain styling trends has always been here all along.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:When I moved from a very hot climate to a super cold, snowy one I was in a weird place both financially and with my wardrobe. It was supposed to be extremely short term but ended up being long term/possibly permanent, which definitely messed with my expectations for my wardrobe.  Eventually I got rid of all my "warm weather" clothes for various reasons, mostly size/style ones, and when I was able to started to stock up on winter wear. I didn't know what I liked so I just kind of went for it. For example, I thrifted tons of scarves only to barely use them a couple years later because I realized I only like infinity scarves. The same thing happened with multiple categories because I was so desperate to fill the missing chunk of my wardrobe.  I agree with the advice to wait as long as possible before making drastic changes. Its hard to know what you'll actually end of needing, much less what you'll like or enjoy using. See what you can pick up secondhand to try out styles that suit your new climate best before investing a lot of money or time into altering your wardrobe.	episode_done:True
text:Who is your ultimate style icon?	labels:Right now for me it’s Gemma Chan. She’s always wearing the most beautiful, feminine dresses that are pretty yet statement-making. I love her color choices.
text:Oooh great choice! Thank you!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you challenge yourself?	labels:I just bought one of those dresses that's transparent and looks like a meadow of embroidered flowers - so I guess I challenge myself by wearing things that are SO ME but that I would've shied away from before because no one I know wears stuff like it.  Like something that looks like my favorite paintings.
text:Yes! That’s me exactly right now-I am challenging myself lately wearing stuff that’s “me” and that I love but feels a bit out there.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:I grew out of the ModCloth aesthetic, but still own a red dress with a Peter Pan collar which I called my “power dress.” I wore it whenever I needed “good luck” and was convinced I needed it to ace a test or give a good presentation at work. I even wore it on my first date with my (now) husband! Although it feels too young for me now, I still keep it in the back of my closet 😊 Thanks for reminding me that ModCloth existed - good memories!	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Body Types (no fruit answers allowed)	labels:Ok, true story. My boyfriend’s daughter and I were talking about body types, and how I’m a pear. He overhears and disagrees vehemently.   He’s a quick-thinking guy, and I know he’ll have a good answer, so I say, “ok smart guy, what shape am I?”  “Well, you’ve got good hips and butt, and a long but slender torso. You’re male genitalia. Penis and balls.”  So, apparently I’m genitalia shaped. Sorry, that’s not a food, but it’s what I’ve got.

I think it gives a nice definition to the waist on dresses and long tops since I'm not to fond of belts which I find too bulky. Bows at the neckline, shoulders or on sleeves, elegant bows on evening dresses, bows on office wear, boho chic ties, little bows on nighties, I'm just attracted to them all 🎀🎀	episode_done:True
text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:<rant>  If I said "Wear cropped jackets so you look taller" I'd be laughed out of the room but somehow "Short people shouldn't wear long coats" is a valid thing?   Also what's defined as short? If someone is 5'7" do they get to wear long coats? What if they're 5'7.5"??  It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering". If you care so much about these gender norms, masculinity and being ~ flattering ~ then sack up and wear the clothes you like.   That whole thread is just people saying that someone else told them they couldn't *wear a coat* so what should they do? Oh idk. How about tell them to fuck off and wear the damn coat.  </rant>
text:It’s a perfect opportunity to do MFA’s favorite thing: find away to talk themselves out of wearing anything cool and combine it with dudes on the internet’s favorite thing: complaining about being short even tho they’re the average height.	labels:>find away to talk themselves out of wearing anything cool   ...... hey, to be fair, the fact that everything I like is crazy expensive is a valid excuse, so just because you called me out for my bullshit DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO STOP.  >complaining about being short even tho they’re the average height.

text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:Most of my secondhand finds are from online auctions or poshmark-type sites. I’d say about half my wardrobe is from these places (more like 80% for shoes).  - Have a pattern. Search for the same items/brands/keywords over time and get a good idea of what’s available and what a fair price is.   - Buy fabrics, brands and cuts you already know and like. I’ve made some big mistakes with things like second hand cashmere because I don’t normally wear it and I didn’t know what to look for.   - Be picky. There’s so much choice that it becomes overwhelming, so you’ve got to have a firm idea of what your dislikes are. No matter how cute the garment is, I won’t buy certain things... for example, visible distressing, suede footwear and polka dot are all off the table because I just won’t wear them.   You’ve got to be willing to take the hits with the misses when you’re doing this online - I’d say my success rate is around 50/50 for things that make it into my regular wardrobe rotation. I do my best to resell my fails, and I’d say I probably break even on average, but it’s a lot of effort and not for the faint hearted. But I love doing it so it’s more like a hobby than a chore - but it’s not for everyone, and there’s no shame in that!	episode_done:True

text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:The weather is kinda crazy right now. Sprinkle in the mornings. Hot in the day. Cold at night. So my current bag is the Longchamp Neo crossbody. It's my Mary Poppins bag that also keeps my hands free.  I carry my life in my bag six days a week for work. I don't baby my bags and this is easy to dump out and wipe clean.  Inside: I have my small wallet. Essentials punch with neosporin, bandaid, hand sanitizers, extra gloves, extra masks, some meds. Tiger balm, salonpas, hair ties, pads, wipes. A diaper. A beanie with a puff. Tea bags, instant coffee packets, sugar packets, mayo and mustard packets. Soy sauce. Chopsticks, spoons, and forks. Various random snacks. Electrolytes drink mix packets. My makeup bag. A note pad, random pens. Phone charger cord and battery charger. Glasses case...  That's what I see so far. I carry alot.  If I am carrying light. I have a Coach Cassie Crossbody bag that I carry for going out.	episode_done:True

text:The Instagram Account Showing “Ivy’s” More Eclectic Side – Put This On	labels:@berkely_breathes is an amazing account I highly recommend to follow on insta. The article gets into this, but the account dives into old thousands of old yearbook photos—which show off this “Ivy” style across both diverse people and people engaging in diverse activities. It really contextualizes how the “Ivy” approach can be for everyone and I think it deserves the recognition.	episode_done:True
text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:The majority of my closet follows the capsule wardrobe mentality. Colours are black, white, tan, navy & stripes. Mix of tops and bottoms that generally work well with each other for mixing it up.  I live in a hot climate as well so am slowing swapping all my fast fashion over to linen clothes as they fall apart.  My only exception to this capsule wardrobe are my bohemian, flowy, colourful print dresses (brand is Jaase if anyone wants to know) that are great for the beach, pool or hot weather. No need to pair these with anything as they are dresses. But outside of this, I stick to my standard capsule wardrobe :)	episode_done:True

text:Menswear I Drool Over: FW/2021 Part III	labels:The Jil Sander collection is quite stunning. I also like the Junya Watanabe with the Italian automotive brand collaborations, pretty left field and not something I would expect to see, but why does Junya Watanabe always make the outerwear kind of one size too small?

text:Recent Purchases - February 14, 2021	labels:I bought a pair of American Eagle slim black jeans for $30. I don't think it's too bad a price and their slims fit me pretty well. Last summer, I bought the same fit, but in a dark rinse with 2% elastane (they're so comfy). This new pair will be 100% cotton, or so they claim. With shipping, the price ballooned to $38. I'm not happy, but I didn't want anything else from American Eagle.  I expect a fair bit of wear out of them. I did a cost per wear analysis and if I wear them once every other day for a year, I will pay 22c per wear. I don't even wear actual pants that often, especially in these COVID times. So I can reasonably cut the wear down to 1/4 of the year and extend the lifetime to 2 years (assuming the jeans fail at the end).   Wanna know what's more reasonable? 52 days of the year. I'll wear the jeans once a week, 3-8 hours per wear. I have many other pants I can wear when I'm not wearing those black jeans. Once a week for 7 years will amount to ~10.4c per wear.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 25	labels:I got a question about shirt sizing... So I'm a short guy (5ft 6in) and long sleeved shirts are usually a problem for me because I have a large chest/shoulders for my height. I just got a Taylor stitch shirt in XS as that's what they're size guide recommended me. However, as is the case with most shirts I try, it's a bit tight in the back (I have a 38in chest). This only applies if I'm crossing my arms, giving a hug, or tying my shoes or something (basically moving both arms forward). The shirt fits everywhere else and is otherwise fine. I know that it I size up though, the shirt length will be a little too long and the sleeve length will be too long, despite fitting more relaxed in the chest/back area.  Do I size up or retain my current size? Again, the only real problem area is that the shirt hugs my chest a little bit and I feel the fabric strain across my back if I try to cross my arms (not enough so that it feels like it will rip, but it still strains).	episode_done:True
text:Fellow clothing trackers, what coveted items are you tracking now?	labels:Tory Burch came out with this colorful green and blue beetle pattern years ago.

text:Fall Fashion Inspo!	labels:I plan on dressing in a lot of wool, plaid, tweed, and leather. I definitely play it safe as I live in a pretty rural area in a conservative part of the country, but I am envisioning lots of plaid, wool shackets, chunky boots, mom jeans, long, wool coats, chunky knit sweaters in neutral/autumnal tones, gold jewelry, leather jackets & pants, etc. I typically wear a lot of earthy tones as well, but I love a pop of red here and there. I'll try to get a board together to put a picture with what I'm describing, but any Youtube video titled Fall 2020 clothing haul will probably give you an idea of what I'll be wearing as I'm not much of a fashion risktaker lol.  I have been searching all the resale sites for vintage wool shackets, as the Zara one I'm interested in keeps selling out and its like 90% polyester anyway. I plan on buying a few vintage pendleton/ll bean/eddie bauer oversized wool flannels to wear as jackets instead.

Also breezy palazzo pants - essentially pajamas for the outdoors!	episode_done:True
text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I personally swing wildly between an academic honors student, vaguely retro, more gender-neutral street style, and then something a little more punk. I just wear whatever I’m feeling like wearing on a given day (or what weather dictates, occasionally), so I don’t consider it strange to have more than one style. I admire the people that can just do one style and be happy, or have a capsule wardrobe, but there’s nothing wrong with enjoying mixing it up.	episode_done:True

text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers. Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:I live in MN so practical artic weather gear is what I go for. Here’s my winter gear list with my opinions on it.  The North Face Chilkat boots- keep my feet warm even with thin socks on, also have great grip for ice and snow.   Columbia Lay D Down II coat- light weight but warm enough to wear in below zero weather, nice big pockets, but wish the hood had strings to adjust width. When I put the hood up on a windy day I can’t adjust it so it just gets blown back down.  Artix snow pants- warm and can take a beating, very durable. They have survived lots of sledding and other winter activities, and they keep me dry.	episode_done:True

text:The Fall Edit: Mr. Ethan M. Wong on the Rugby, Balmacaan, Western Shirt, and Raw Denim	labels:Re rugby vs polo fabric difference, it's not so much that polo shirts weren't actual sportswear, but that rugby shirts had to stand up to a much more aggressive sport with lots of tackling, scrums etc. I remember my old PE teacher claiming if you pulled on the arm your arm would come off before the shirt sleeve. In addition, there is also the fact that rugby is a winter sport vs tennis as a summer sport.

Many people really appreciate nice dressing. I'm still in school, and though I can appreciate a cute sweatpants fit I'd be ecstatic to see a nice skirt and cardi combo. Make it normal, and people will appreciate it!	episode_done:True
text:Indoor layers	labels:For clarity, because I think I get where you’re coming from—are you saying that the outerwear makes the outfit complete, so you’re wondering what people do to complete their look after they’ve taken off the coat once indoors? I’ve often felt like this while scrolling through Pinterest and wondered the same.
text:That's how I interpreted the question as well.  The "third piece" rule pretty much would have you to put a third piece on top, and in winter, that third piece is a coat, and once you are inside you don't wear the coat anymore.  For me, I typically have an indoor third piece waiting for me, ie a neutral color cardigan at my desk, so when I take off my kickass outerwear I can still complete the look with a third piece for indoors.  If that's not possible for whatever reason I'll wear the indoor third piece under the outdoor third piece because if it's cold enough to wear the winder coat, a thin cardigan isn't going to seriously mess up the temperature calculus.	labels:	episode_done:True

Ordered a NWT jacket from a seller and it came absolutely doused in Febreze and perfume. She'd also sold it to someone else before and had mislabeled the size, so presumably that person also received and returned the item. Tried to return it because it's not in NWT condition (New with Defects at best, but that's more of an eBay designation) and got denied by Poshmark.   A big RIP. I have contact dermatitis and patch tested positive for every fragrance they tested, so... dope. I'll open a chargeback but will probably get banned by Posh for it.

text:Thoughts on jumpsuits?	labels:I drink water constantly and a few cups of tea a day so anything that is that difficult to take off is a no for me unfortunately.
text:I'm both obsessed with jumpsuits and I pee a lot. Not the best combination.   My compromise is that I only get jumpsuits that I can pull on and off. if there's any buttons or zippers I have to fiddle with it's a hard no.   I don't wear them when it's cold out either. If I have to remove more than my bag and one additional layer of clothing to pull down my jumpsuit it's too much.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:I used to work in a funeral home and can tell you that I've seen it all. There will always be the guy that shows up in jeans and a barely nice t shirt, for some reason. There will always be a woman who shows up wearing a skin tight tiny club dress that barely covers her bum, but I guess she thought it was okay because it was black and also a dress? I've seen people wear sheer black clothing like somehow that's supposed to be a shirt. I've also been to funerals with wacky dress codes: everyone wears Hawaiian shirts or the everyone wears a chosen colour associated with the deceased.   But good rules to stick by: Wear clothes that are darker in colour; black, navy, dark green/purple. White dress shirts are appropriate, but having a jacket to go over it is ideal. If it's the summer and it's hot; boys, skip the jacket, but wear a tie and tuck in the shirt and girls, wear a flowy dress, ideally to the knee, with a light shawl or dress pants and a light blouse.   The purpose of the funeral is to pay respect to the deceased, and you want to keep the focus there. Wearing something too bright, or tight, or short, or casual can distract from what's going on and the importance of the funeral. The goal is essentially to blend in, not stand out, because the funeral isn't about anyone other than the deceased, so the attention goes to them. It's one of the few times that I believe everyone should put aside their own ego and allow the day to be about the deceased.
text:>The purpose of the funeral is to pay respect to the deceased  I disagree 100%.  Funerals are for the living, they do nothing for the deceased.  You seem to lay out a lot of guidelines, but honestly, when I die I am expecting and hoping that people just move on with theirs lives and dump my ashes wherever they will be the least amount of trouble.  I have often thought it would be cool to be mixed with potting soil or grass food so my nutrients can help sustain new life.  But please, stop believing that funerals are for paying respects for the deceased, at best they are to help the living say goodbye and gain closure, but in the 18 or so I have attended in my life, they were mostly for people to compare how terrible this is for them in some gigantic, disgusting pissing contest of grief and in general, I consider them a waste of money, more so than a wedding.  I remember the joy my mom gained from my brother's funeral, when it was so expensive for the most basic services that she had to make payments on that funeral for 5 fucking years.  As far as I am concerned, the funeral industry is 100% \* 100% predatory and should have more regulations slapped on it than a Russian drug dealer with a windowless van in an alley.	labels:...sir this is wendy’s.  in all seriousness, you said that funerals are not for paying respects for the deceased, “they are to help the living say goodbye and gain closure”... which... is literally paying respects to the deceased.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - October 27	labels:I think early MFA and the attendant blogosphere it spawned / belonged to / helped popularise is partially to blame for the whole "timeless" nonsense.  We've come a long way from "well dressed men wear suits" to "actually shirts and blazers can be dressed down" to "actually you can wear what you want and look good", and maybe the whole "timeless", "dapper", "classic", "gentleman" thing was a necessary part of the journey, but... would it just fucking die please.
text:I think people maybe forget what the culture was here a long time ago. Runway looks were *never* talked about.

Runway looks were never talked about. OCBDs literally were the height of fashion.   As I recall it it was just a lot of noobs helping other noobs and trying to bootstrap an understanding of fashion out of that. Actually worked reasonably well for what it was, but the results were sometimes terribly myopic. I think it's better now.  > Timelessness was also very much a product of the post-recession mindset and attributing it to MFA seems a bit grandiose.  Yeah I wasn't sure about "spawned" -- "belonged to" seems definitely right, though. But many of the blogs really pushing for #menswear (DAE spezzatura) seemed to be posted here a lot and gained a lot of their community following from here.

Had most of my cashmere sweaters getting on for twenty years now. Likewise my John Smedleys. Trousers made to measure have had for around fifteen years.
text:Cashmere especially should last for a long time. The issue is with fast fashion companies selling cheap and low quality cashmere. It doesn't last and the impact on the producers of raw material is horrific.  But I agree with you, most of my stuff hold up very long. Even t-shirts, if you take good care of them can last several years minimum...	labels:I’m calling shenanigans. I wash cold, with like colors and no heavy pants/denim, and hang dry.

I can see it being legit but I’m not sure. Can anyone confirm?
text:i mean, over time the canvas in a jacket will conform to your body shape, but that will happen as you wear it. it's not like you'll lose that if you don't wear it quickly, so you shouldn't feel obligated to wear your suit for that reason.  but if you have nice suits you should come up with excuses to wear them just because it's fun to wear nice suits. wear it to work even if you don't need to, wear it when going to a nice restaurant, etc.	labels:You're right, I was just worried that if I wasn't wearing it enough, it wouldn't conform to my body or something.

text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:Women will pay more for their clothes, and pay more for nicer clothes than men will. Supply and demand, baby.
text:I also wonder if men tend to buy clothing staples, and clothes for women tend to be on trend. So, we get cheaply made fast fashion that has extra development costs.	labels:100% because it's pretty easy to sell women stuff if you make them feel bad about themselves. I've recently been actively avoiding fast-fashion and buying more high-quality stapes, I end up buying a lot of "unisex" clothes.	episode_done:True
text:How many distinctly different outfits do you have?	labels:I think that’s a great way to do your wardrobe.

text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I'm a fan of combining bold pieces with more bold pieces. They say less is more, but I believe the inverse is true too: more is less. Meaning that when a piece feels like it's "too much," it can often help to add other "too much" pieces to balance it out and create a more intentional look.   The pink suit would rock with a base layer in red, light pink, tan/brown, or even a print or stripe if the mood strikes.

text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:What is it about your personality that you feel is lost in workwear?   Also...oftentimes when I talk to people having this struggle, their understanding of work wear styles is very narrow. Workwear isn't just Ann Taylor. There are tons of ways to go beyond a button-down shirt and a pencil skirt. Interesting fabrics, for example, or subtle accessories that are more reflective of your personality.
text:This exactly. I have a pretty stuffy office job with a fairly traditional business dress code (not business formal, but the kind of business casual where jeans are 100% not okay, people wear pantyhose with skirts, blazers are extremely popular, absolutely no thighs or cleavage or shoulders seen), but I still have no trouble finding work-appropriate clothing that makes me feel comfortable and that I like to wear.   I have pretty loud taste and I am not one for neutrals, while also being pretty conservative with regard to the amount of skin I like to show, and I love to find stuff with bold colours (like my very favourite suit, which is bright magenta), strong shapes (like oversized boyfriend blazers instead of a traditional hip-length fitted ones, wide paperbag pants, cape sleeves, etc), and unusual patterns, like a cardigan I have with small intarsia unicorn silhouettes. I only buy the shapes I like, so no pencil skirts, high necklines only, pant rises similar to those in my casual wardrobe, etc.   I absolutely live in athleisure outside the office, but I still like and enjoy my work wardrobe a lot and I think it's still expressive while being appropriate for my specific office. I pretty much only wear it to work and I don't pull any of it out to go to the grocery store, but it's still great for the purpose and I don't need to be able to wear all my clothes for every occasion.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Shopping for clothing items you already own: confessions of an outfit repeater	labels:I'm quite picky about tops so if I find a style I like in a good, durable fabric that won't disintegrate after 3 washes, I like to buy it in different colors so I have some variety in my outfits (even if it's just the same silhouettes all the time lol).  I usually buy "basics" in multiple colors too since they're blank canvases -- I can dress them up or down or layer them so it gets quite a bit of mileage in terms of use :)	episode_done:True
text:Model poses while online shopping	labels:They do that when the fit if the garment is inferior. It is intentional.  Beware items that have this kind of photography, because most of the time it means the garment has bad construction, weird seam placement, or unfortunate details.  Well constructed items are not shot in this manner. Brands want to show off their excellent construction. It is known.  Hope that helps!
text:I notice this the most with Asos, when there are like 4-5 pics of the model hunched, or with their arms crossed, or with their back to us hailing a cab. Asos does sometimes have a short video clip so you can watch how the garment moves, which is slightly helpful.   &#x200B;  Zara has their weird pose things and you have to compare it to the pic of the garment laid flat (which they usually include).   &#x200B;  It's shitty because you literally have a basic understanding of garment construction, where seams are lining up on the model, your own body type and shape, and do a mental algorithim that looks like that guy from It's Always Sunny at the wall with the conspiracy strings to figure out if a dress will fit you.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:I've completely stopped buying from Amazon and actually feel ill when I see anyone buying from them - which is everyone I know except my husband. Even people who are verbal about how shitty of a company it is still can't resist the "convenience." I think it takes practice. The longer you abstain from certain things, the less you want to go back.   I've also been a lot more conscious of the companies I buy my clothes from. If it seems too good to be true (i.e. cheap,) then it probably is. A beautiful top listed for $10 might seem like a deal, but you have to really think about why that garment is so cheap in the first place. I've gotten to the point where I can push past being seduced by a low price and look into the company itself. I read about their business practices, and if they seem fishy, I don't buy.  I'd rather thrift my clothes and feel more confident that I'm not buying in to fast-fashion. I'd be content wearing the same clothes forever and just reworking them through the years with my own hands, as opposed to buying from a company that treats people and our environment badly.	episode_done:True

Uniqlo was a big part of the beginning for me, I really like their airsim and heattech lines. How can my clothes work for me? I really took on a evolutionarily perspective lmao, like I need Shelter from Rain, Insulation in Cold, Sweat Wicking in Sun. It got me to pay attention to fabric choices more, which meant I was pickier, which meant I was buying more expensive items... so then I started to care about the quality of stitching and longevity of the piece.  I had IBS for a year and there were some clothes I could really NOT wear with that, so I had to learn to make adjustments too. I like high-rise bottoms, but I can't have an elastic cutting off my intestines all day, so I get something with a zipper instead.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have any visual guides for how clothes should fit	labels:The Palmer/Pletch Complete Guide to Fitting and Kenneth D. King’s Smart Fitting Solutions are the classics on this. They’re meant for sewing, but the fit principles apply to RTW as well. I’ve never used King’s book, but Palmer and Pletch have lots of photos.   You should be able to find them a library, but if not they might have other fit guides meant for sewers in that section.  Edit: I should add, the key to fit is you shouldn’t have any weird puckers or gathers anywhere. If you do, that means the item doesn’t fit you properly: either it’s too big somewhere, or too small. The puckers usually kind of point towards the area(s) where the fit problem is, like if they point towards your crotch on a pair of pants it usually means either the front rise is too short or or the trouser hip is too narrow, or both.   If you know that rule, it’s usually pretty easy to google videos about that particular fit issue, although with ready to wear it can be difficult as it usually means either you get the thing tailored or you keep shopping (or you live with the problem).
text:Seconding this, but also want to say that sometimes the fit issue is not a clear cut as the front rise being too short. It can also be the curve of the front rise that creates the creases and gives “camel toe.”   Additionally, some of these problems can’t be solved by a tailor—if you find crease lines pointing from your collar to your armpits, it’s a problem with the flat pattern, and you cannot add fabric into a pre-existing garment to fix that.  Finally, if you find that your clothes have a lot of these creases indicating fit issues, just remember that **your body is not the problem.** It’s a problem with the RTW industry.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:"Can people just hate fashion again" - Synecdoche When Talking about the "Industry" Discussion	labels:> Should spaces & industries for fashion lovers, clothes lovers, and people that have to wear clothes be completely separate?  I don’t think that any of these groups should be completely separate however I do find them all being lumped into the same spaces very frustrating as someone who does love fashion as a form of art and creativity.  I like harsh and blunt constructive criticism in pretty much all areas of life and I most certainly want it for my outfits as well. I want to hear what other fashion lovers and artists think of my colour choices, proportions, textures, fit, etc. and be able to refine those things and really flex my creative muscles when creating an outfit. Instead, many fashion spaces are dominated by ‘you do you hun!’ and ‘so long as you like it, that’s all that matters!’ which is great for someone *who has to wear clothes* and doesn’t actually care about fashion but joins fashion spaces because they feel some obligation as a woman to care about it but... those spaces just become unhelpful and bland for those who really love fashion and want to get better at it.  I’ve been an off and on follower of FFA for a few years and I feel like it’s definitely dominated by the “people who wear clothes” group and unfortunately it limits the amount of critique that is acceptable to give.

text:When is a garment worth it to you?	labels:For most reasonably priced items, my rule is (unless there an urgent sale) to wait ~3-4 weeks. If I still want the item just as bad, I get it (or wait for a sale to get it). If I’m excited about something else, then so be lol  For expensive items, I do the same but also find an excuse (holiday, birthday, publish a paper, etc.)

text:General Discussion - November 08	labels:Woke up to snow on the ground. Don't think I am ready for boot weather yet. I wanted to wear socks and sandals just a few more times...
text:Back when I was in Uni we had this one (Computer Science of course) teacher rocking the SnS combo all the way through winter. Of course he had his leather trench coat to keep him warm.   Now that I think of it I’m pretty sure that guy is always there, and always has been, wherever you are. It’s always only the one, but I’m not sure they’re different entities or it’s the same one with an infinite number of variants.  Edit: I wonder if they compete with the shorts-in-winter guys (ok let’s be real they’re usually jorts) for food, females and territory.	labels:I've come to believe that something around 1% of the Dutch population has a genetic mutation that makes them immune to weather, so they can wear socks, sandals and shorts all year round. I'm assuming it's an adaption to the erratic weather patterns seen on the North Sea coast.

text:Where do you get good quality, legit wool sweaters that won't rip/shrink after washing?	labels:Lots of good tips here but I wanted to add, if your husband's sweaters are very scratchy, get Eucalan or Soak and give them a soak, the lanolin softens them back up a bit! You can put it in a mesh lingerie bag and run them through spin cycle, then lay flat and shape gently to air dry.
text:That's a great tip, thank you!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your coziest winter finds/essentials?	labels:Carhartt overalls. I thought I might need snow pants for extra dog walks this year since I'm still working from home. However, snow pants seemed hard though and I just settled on some carhartt overalls with legging/pajama bottoms underneath.   So far, I'm pretty dang cozy on daily walks and it can double mucking around clothes.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 27	labels:Are jeans just not happening right now?  I've been mostly wearing black skinny jeans the last few years and I'm tired of them (pre-pandemic, anyway - I've been wearing mostly pajama pants since March).    I've been looking around trying to figure out what to do in the jeans category, and it seems like men in their late 20s/early 30s have mostly moved on past jeans and are generally wearing chinos, work pants, or other non-denim pants.
text:denim will literally never go out of fashion. screencap this and prove me wrong in 2080 idgaf	labels:Okay, maybe a better question for me to ask would be: what's good with jeans right now?  I can't stomach any more skin-tight denim.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 26, 2020	labels:I've always heard "match your leathers and metals". But it's honestly pretty hard to match all of your leather and metal items perfectly. I often have items in varying shades. Is it a big faux pas to mix leather colors or is it not a big deal? (E.g. natural colored leather accessories while wearing dark brown leather shoes)
text:Matching  metals is not a thing,  except in men’s tailoring where you match your belt buckle, to your cufflinks, to your tiebar. It doesn’t apply to jewelry or watches both of which come in two-tone varieties,  making it impossible to match in those circumstances.   Matching leather is a little more nuanced.  With men’s tailoring you should match your shoes and belt pretty close. Same with the upper levels of business casual say blazer and/or tie. It also doesn’t apply to watch straps or accessories  Anything below that level, getting it approximate is close enough. I like to match brown to  brown but don’t worry about the shade all that much.  if I’m wearing oxblood shoes I wear a brown belt.   For actual casual outfits; jeans and iron rangers or streetwear etc,  it doesn’t matter at all	labels:	episode_done:True

Head to a store that has basic tops (sweaters or t-shirts depending on your location) and pick a colour that makes you smile. Bring it home, try it on with all your bottoms til you find a good combo - given your focus on basics, there will be more than one!  Uniqlo is good for this, also banana republic usually has a table of sweaters with a few “this season” brights (last year I got an amazing Kelly green sweater there - works so well with navy!)	episode_done:True

I know Arctic Bay outruns Fjallraven with insulation level and quality, but I liked the brand value of Fjallraven, and since it's almost $400 cheaper, I am still considering.  Plus I live in Vancouver, Canada where the coldest temperature is around -15 Celsius degree, so I do not need a Himalayan alpinist level insulation.

text:Southern hemisphere ladies where do you get inspo from?	labels:I had the same dilemma when I moved down under 2 years ago! To be honest, I just started following popular brands on Instagram - Zimmermann, Bec & Bridge, Camilla & Marc, Dion Lee, etc. The algorithm took care of the rest, lol.   So I guess my advice is to look around at what the popular brands are in your locale, follow them on Insta and trust Zuckerberg’s algorithm to lead the way.

text:The joy of cordovan—and how to wear and maintain it	labels:Cordovan is an Instagram dream - it’s lustrous and has a ton of color depth. Unfortunately I find  actually wearing it is a different story. It’s extremely stiff and inflexible, especially during the first 20-30 wears. It’s the coldest leather I’ve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I’ve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I’m glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there’s no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.

text:What are your go-to, everyday shoes?	labels:Blundstones in the winter, white keds in the summer. I'm a simple gal. 🤷‍♀️  Side note, I wear orthodics so my shoe choices are based on whether I can rip out the insole and fit my orthodics. Unfortunately this means no sandals during the summer unless I really think it's worth it to sacrifice cuteness for knee pain!

Having said that, it's one of those things I can't bring myself to wear. I wasn't varsity anything in school so wearing a piece like this feels like trying to be someone/something I'm not and never was. It is also definitely only wearable in your 20's, because after that you're going to look like the kind of guy who peaked in high school and unironically reminisces about those days. Harsh take but that's my two cents.	episode_done:True

My top three habits include:  - Putting on a cute outfit every day and wearing a full face of makeup so that I'm not only slightly uncomfortable all day, but I'm also reminded of the fact that I haven't seen another person in over 10 months, so no one cares what I look like.  - Every Saturday I make myself a cocktail and put on one of my formal dresses to reminds myself of how much weight I've gained since I last attended a fancy party.  - I cut my own bangs  I'm pretty sure I'm at the brink of a nervous breakdown, but my *soul* looks radiant over zoom.	episode_done:True

text:What are your tips for being stylish when your weight fluctuates like crazy?	labels:Wrap dresses and wrap skirts tend to be flexible with size fluctuations. I don’t know if the same wrap skirt can take you from a size 4 to 14 but they’ll fit longer than other styles do.

Great tips about how to buy clothes purposefully, how to accessorize, how to identify quality, etc.   As far as the aging thing goes - I’ve found I just become more myself. I don’t buy into trends now. I know I won’t wear a color that isn’t navy so I don’t bother buying it. No velvet. No shorts. Etc etc. I just have less time for navel gazing and bullshit. Maybe because I’m a nurse in a pandemic who is also in perpetual grad school. Or maybe because I finally have money now to buy what I really want? Either way. No real advice but just a question to think about what you actually want to wear for who you are today. Not an imaginary person who doesn’t live your life with your budget and your body and your friends, ya know?

I’m working on curating a weekend wardrobe and not focusing on work outfits until I have just as much weekend  and after work clothes. I’m thinking fun  Art teacher and also colorful mom clothes but we will see I also like basics a lot like jeans and a black top .
text:I love the idea of a weekend wardrobe! I work in an office where everybody is super casual (jeans and T-shirts) that whenever I dress up (wear a cute dress or even mini skirt + stockings in the winter), I get asked if I have plans after work or I end up feeling overdressed. So even if I do feel good when I leave the house, I feel super conscious by the time I get to the office. A weekend wardrobe sounds like a good plan!	labels:Thank you. I feel like a lot of my years of shopping for work clothes was just me surviving and not really being too fashion forward or myself  but now that I have a little bit more heads space and time to think about what I wanna wear outside of work I am really excited about creating a great wardrobe. That being said if you have a lot of cute pieces that you want to wear to work it would be Cool challenge to set for yourself to see if you can find a good middle ground  to use some of your nice pieces for work while still keeping it business casual. But yeah I do wish that in the past years I had spent more time on outside of work wear, I feel like having multiple interests and hobbies outside of work is super important and my wardrobe wasn’t reflecting that	episode_done:True

text:Wish we could just ban people for this shit  Any conversation around "you have to be attractive/tall/skinny to pull this off", when taken to its logical conclusion, is just people saying that people that don't fit Western beauty standards look objectively bad *at all times* regardless of what they're wearing or doing  Like I've seen people say that if you're short or if you're overweight you can't wear "x", but the "x" is basically everything, and they never seem to reach the point where they admit that they just think that the best certain people can hope for is inoffensive or unnoticeable, which disgusts me	labels:I've talked about this before but a lot of these "rules" that people talk about like "don't wear $thing if you're $characteristic" have to main parts to it:  1. They're always about *not* doing something 2. They're always about a stereo-typically "negative" characteristic  > *Don't* wear $thing, if you're *$negative-characteristic*  You never hear the opposite, for any characteristic "positive" or "negative".

I live in Sweden, and here you basically never have to personally pay for the kind of work attire you are required to wear. If it's free to choose, you may have to buy those things for yourself.

text:How to wear nice casual clothes with a cotton allergy?	labels:Have you tried looking for clothing made out of hemp or linen? You can find casual tshirts and whatnot that are 100% hemp fabric. You can also find causal shoes that are hemp (i have an older pair of Adidas that are 100% hemp fabric uppers). Plenty made out of leather as well.  Do you have a budget for clothes? A lot of companies that use these alternative materials are considered "premium" brands and carry their price tags accordingly.
text:Hey thanks for the suggestion. Sorry, I should have clarified this but I'm also allergic to hemp, linen, wool, and a few more obscure fabrics.  I'm willing to pay as much as needed for this kind of "alternative material" jean.  Leather might be an option but I'm vegetarian so it would need to be vegan leather probably	labels:I definitely recommend updating your original post with this info btw, it will yield you a lot more useful responses.	episode_done:True
text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:I went through this too, and while going through it, did an entire wardrobe overhaul. Instead of lamenting the weight gain, I chose to have a ton of fun buying new clothes for my bigger pandemic size. I’ve had a great time eating really enjoyable food during quarantine, I don’t care that I’m fat now. Also, I had been ready to re-do my style for a while, and this seemed like the perfect time.   However, now knowing how easy it is to fluctuate in size, I used weight fluctuation as a deciding factor in what I chose to buy: I only purchased items that will fit with a fluctuation anywhere from 5-15lbs (I’m 5’2). Seems crazy, but it actually is possible. I stuck to either loose silhouettes, or tight yet forgiving stretchy styles.   What worked for me in choosing what I invested in was just ensuring I put enough time and effort into the process. I downloaded Pinterest and spent an inordinate amount of time looking at street clothes, I set a budget, thought about what items I needed, and did a ton of online window shopping. Once I had a better idea of what I wanted my new style to be, I did a lot of online shopping. I did return a lot of things, but also kept a lot, too.   Think about items of clothing that you gravitate towards, that make you feel really good. Use that to form the basis of your wardrobe. The process does take time and effort, but doing enough prep before buying will really make the process way easier.
text:I love the eye for clothing that will fit with a weight fluctuation -- especially since I am now trying to be a bit more conscious of that! Do you have any particular examples of items that have worked well for you?  I think part of my problem is that the silhouettes that used to work for my pear/hourglass body now do not at all with a bigger stomach, and it's slow to figure out what will. The other part of the issue I'm finding is that clothes quality and silhouette fit is a challenge in plus sizes for me, even with brands I trusted before. I'm having issues with things riding up or sliding down over time even when they seemed my proper size.	labels:I’m also an hourglass/pear! In terms of oversized fits, I made sure everything I bought hit me at my smallest spot so that it looked correct for my shape. For example, I bought an oversized cashmere sweater, and it ends mid thigh. I wear it with tight pants (I often follow the baggy top/loose bottom vice versa) and a shoe with a heel to balance it out. The sweater is big enough to fit a huge weight range and still look good. Oversized is in, and I think it looks trendy.   In terms of plus size clothing, I haven’t yet ventured into that because I stuck to brands that offered already oversized clothing. The sweater I mentioned is Ben Taverniti (bought on deep discount) and was already marketed as oversized, so I bought the biggest size and it fits great. It’s an easy way to not have to find new brands or learn how to style yourself with plus sized clothing.	episode_done:True

I just finished a month-long cyberpunk roleplay/cosplay/lifestyle and the elements that I was looking for in my fashion choices were sharp edges, black or neon, things that light up, face coverings or face paint to confuse facial recognition software, straps, heavy black eye makeup, bright hair, metallics (although that's just because I have metallics-- I think iridescence is more on-brand). We modified it to tie in some vaporwave/outrun aesthetic as well, so pastel pinks were on the table as well as anything that looks glitchy. I'm loving seeing the overlap and non-overlap between the looks we went with and this album!   Favorite cyber-looks are the wide-brim hat with the blue veil, the Calvin Lou look with the spiked hair, the Emporio Armani look with the black translucent fabric and the tiny 90s shades, the Each Other "free hugs" photo, and the Rocostru silver straps.  I love the veil because I think facial masking is a part of what I imagine a cyberpunk future to be about and I think the color scheme is right on-point. The Calvin Lou and Emporio Armani looks both just nail a Matrix-era vibe to me. I love the way both looks play with showing skin and I love the hair styling for both... both read very cyberpunk to me. The Each other look is great partly because I love turning the storm trooper "free hugs" guy into a nostalgic cyber-icon but mostly because the 3D glasses are super on-brand-- both colorful and technological-- and the outfit is also super functional. And, loving the silver straps in general.  I wish I'd had the idea and courage to go more nipple-forward in my costuming for last month... digging that part of this album and loving the implication that our future is more down with women's nipples.

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:I was like this too and just had skinny jeans in different washes for a long time. In the past year or so I’ve collected some more interesting jeans that I love to wear even more and change up every outfit but are still jeans. For example, I have looser fit jeans that have a paper bag waist, looser jeans that have a pinstripe wash pattern, jeans with a plaid wash pattern, wide leg jeans with buttons instead of a fly. I think this, along with the different colored jeans others have mentioned, is a good way to change up your look while still keeping the comfort of jeans.  I’ve found these jeans from Hollister, Levi’s, Gap.  I myself have been looking to upgrade my wardrobe a little bit by looking for some dress pants that I could use to dress up otherwise casual outfits. For inspiration I would look to pinterest or stylist tiktoks. @morgankvogel is a toktoker I just came across that had some aesthetic inspiration tiktoks I liked and she included some stores to get started.	episode_done:True

text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:Well I just got a new job that is more corporate (worked in software office previously), and I needed a fashion update. I’m sure it’s not everyone’s style, but I found a bunch of basically new stuff at a thrift shop for $2 a piece the other day: an Eileen Fisher silk undershirt, 2 Eileen Fisher all-wool pants, 2 Pendleton blazers, 1 pair of Pendleton slacks, an all-wool Valerie Stevens jacket, a cashmere shrug, a virgin wool sweater, an angora sweater, and 2 pashmina scarves. I also found 2 pairs of life strides heels in my size for $.50 each. It was a good day.   But that’s not all!   I popped in to the mall after, and the New York & Company was closing. Everything was 70-90% off. Normally I wouldn’t shop there because of the quality / age target, but they had a decent collection of accompanying items I could wear with nice blouses. Got 2 ginormous sacks of clothes for about $200. About 10 pairs of pants, 3 pairs of shoes, 2 earring sets, 3 blazers, 4 cardigans, 2 dresses, and 5 tops. Noice.  I was really worried I’d need to spend a fortune on updating my wardrobe. I was so relieved I caught a break.

That said, I've found lightening up the hairstyling and makeup is quite helpful if you want to look more relaxed.  I also have a personal rule about shoes and skirts: the higher the hemline, the less sexy the shoe. This keeps miniskirts looking relaxed, and prevents longer skirts from skewing frumpy. Obviously rules are meant to be broken, including this one, and it doesn't really apply in the evening.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 09, 2020	labels:Is there a way to wear a black denim trucker jacket without being inherently “bad boy” looking? My style is what I’d consider to be prep/ivy with a little bit of Americana thrown in (lots of OCBDs, donegal sweaters, chinos, with more rugged boots like Viberg and the occasional Chelsea). My concern is that it might look a little costume-y, as if I’m missing the motorcycle and everything else that’s required with a black denim jacket.

text:I keep getting moth holes in suit jackets - how to solve problem?	labels:Take all the clothing out of that closet and have it all cleaned. Before putting it back, vacuum and clean the fuck out of the closet. Woodwork, corners, cracks in the wood floor, etc. Wash it down and let it dry completely with a fan. Buy some moth traps and hang them in the empty closet. All they do is show the presence of the moths... which lay the eggs and spawn the larvae which eat the clothes. But if you have the traps in the closet for a couple months and see no moths stuck to it, you should be good. Only then put your clean clothes back in the closet. Google around for some chemical pesticide control, too. Cedar is a myth... but it does smell nice! And clean the fuck out of the room the closet is in, too.  Anything wool should be put away clean in sealed plastic bins or ***sealed*** bags. You can't seal everything all the time. So, keeping the door open helps, too. The bugs like complete darkness and trapped air. Move the clothes around from time to time. They like tightness, moisture, and dark conditions. They like to eat oil-stained clothing. Don't overstuff things in the closet.  It's a lot of stuff to do, but if you DO have a problem, you have to really get rid of them thoroughly and completely or it'll just keep happening. So don't half-ass it.  These techniques worked for me. They aren't a nightmare like bed bugs, but it takes work or they just come back.  PRO TIP: quarantine any wool items that have been held in a rental storage space. That's what happened to me. Someone else has bugs, and they find your stuff.  I had moved and had some clothes and wool rugs stored for just a couple  months. They destroyed my one (very nice) wool oriental carpet. Quarter-sized holes. It wasn't as bad a problem for my clothes, but I freaked out with the rugs and went ballistic on my new closets and clothes. I haven't had a problem in over two years now.	episode_done:True

This is why the only fast fashion sites I tend to use are SHEIN when their items are on sale. I've only bought 1 full price item from them because it had super good reviews.

text:Indoor layers	labels:I have these thoughts almost every Fall. My inspiration Pinterest boards are filled with photos typically taken outside with individuals wearing amazing outerwear. Last year, I bought a camel coat (faux wool, because I couldn’t invest until I knew if I REALLY liked the look). I loved the look with the coat and I was so sad and torn to remove once indoors. So I guess that’s the TL;DR, I remove my outerwear indoors. Unless I’m quickly stopping in somewhere. But it was always a bummer to do because I love the look.  Aside from outerwear, I try to achieve other interesting layers in the form of either mid length structured cardigans, chunky scarves, slightly oversized tunics with tight sleeves (Free People-Esque), and/or bomber jackets that I’m comfortable leaving on indoors.	episode_done:True
text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:The company already made money off of the original purchase of the shirt, so you buying second hand doesn’t really benefit them in any way. If you really want the item, buying it second hand is probably the most ethical choice you can make. If someone asks where the piece is from, just say you don’t know so they won’t be tempted to buy from the brand lol
text:I partially agree with you. But the company still benefit from second hand purchases.   The second hand price is based on supply/demand, buying the unethical brand even second hand shows demand and increase public perception of the brand then prices go up. That’s why some brands are still more expensive than others even in thrift store.  Yet if you like an unethical brand, like you said, buying second hand is better.	labels:Postmark and eBay are full of people who intentionally sell for secondary market. Might be worth looking into Goodwill online or something like that.
text:if we're talking about ethical shopping tho, isn't goodwill like.. not great ? i used to shop there all the time and the local goodwills have some of the best selection, but i've read that they exploit employees with disabilities so i don't shop there anymore.  please correct me if i'm wrong btw, but iirc they consider disabled employees "volunteers" and don't pay them.	labels:You’re pretty close to right. They consider job training one of their charitable activities and use an exception to the minimum wage that allows them to pay below minimum wage to people who are disabilities, sometimes as little as cents an hour. This is intended as “job training”, but in truth employees rarely leave these jobs. And, imo, it’s absolute garbage exploitation of workers with a guise of helping them. They also have been in some allegations of having a dangerous workplace. Not trying to shame anyone and tell them they can’t shop at Goodwill, but since I can I try to go to other thrift stores. If anyone wants links, lmk and I’ll get them when I’m off mobile.	episode_done:True

text:I think this is a bit of a disingenuous reading. Leandra voluntarily stepped back because her statements about Black Lives Matter in June were so off the mark, and the accusations of racism and her role in perpetuating an unsafe and unfair environment for POC employees spiraled from there. I don't know about the gossip, but to pull the plug without giving her employees the time to actually demonstrate their new vision, or even make preparations for being on the job market during a pandemic--maybe it's the behavior of a typical investor/owner, but it's not the "humble, always learning/growing" persona she has been putting out since the summer. I am a little tired of people getting away with cruel capitalist bullshit just because they are women. That's the whole "girlboss" conundrum and I'm glad it's dying out. I was excited to see what the staff did to turn the site around, but they weren't even given the chance. And this isn't corroborated, but if you tell your employees on Sunday the site is closing and less than a week later they get their severance and that's it, it seems to me like that is at least a potential indication of reactive, irrational and last minute decision making, if not a "tantrum."	labels:Yeah ngl, I am so completely disinterested in any form of feminism that's more aggrieved about one very wealthy woman being criticized with vaguely gendered language than it is about a whole bunch of financially precarious women on her staff having their livelihoods upended without warning in the middle of a pandemic winter. Who-owns-what-and-has-the-legal-right-to-lay-off-whom doesn't really factor into my moral reasoning either. If that makes me a crackpot, well, so are the people who actually wear these outfits in real life.
text:God, hear hear. Callous capitalist bullshit is despicable when it's done by and man and it's despicable when it's done by a woman. The brand was successful and there were a million ways to handle this that allows the writers at least a *fighting chance* of keeping their jobs.

text:What age did you start pinning down your style?

I’m 28 now and still dress the same, which may not seem that long but before I was changing pretty dramatically on a yearly basis. I think it just came with age and getting to know myself better. Before I was always chasing trends and trying to dress for others, but as of 23 I started to dress for myself and stopped caring if something was in fashion or not. It led me to discovering pieces and styles that I really loved, that also suit my lifestyle, which hasn’t changed too much over the years (living in a big city and working at an office that allows for casual dress).	episode_done:True

text:Inspo Album: Vintage Wool Sweaters Need Good, Loving Homes	labels:As a born and raised Norwegian, now living in the UK, my love for wool jumpers is endless and my sadness is twofold. 1) I might be Norwegian, but I've also got extremely sensitive skin. Thus my heart may be set on wool, but my skin is absolutely not, unless it's very fine cashmere or particular blends. 2) When autumn comes my immediate reaction is "WEAR ALL THE WOOL JUMPERS", and then I remember I live in the south of England and it doesn't actually get that cold here, plus it always rains.   Neither of those points are going to keep me from now spending several hours looking at vintage wool jumpers online though.
text:Yeah I hear that and my heart does ache!  I have a wool Aran cable sweater that I love but it is indeed itchy AF.  I'm usually wearing long sleeves below it so don't feel it, but a lot of sweaters you'll have at least a little contact at the wrists and neck.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:The Style Blogger Index: finding people who are the same size as you	labels:Oh my gosh I'm so happy to see this here! I created this because of FFA! I hope you enjoy it ❤️  P.S. just a note that the size twin app is going to be updated in the next week or so -- it's very out of date. If you follow me on IG that's the easiest way to hear about updates, but I can edit this comment when it's refreshed, too!   **(11/30 update if anybody is still reading -- the app is updated!)**  Edit: since so many of you are finding the tool mostly useless, I just wanted to say that the goal was to create something that would help you find fashion inspo from people who are more similar in size to you than a fashion model in a magazine.  Of course it's impossible to get an exact body double from just 3 measurements, but that's what the standard is, and that's what I could reasonably expect the average person to know about themselves. I have to make sure that the barrier to entry is very low. The more people can join this index, the more useful it is. Please remember that I offer this tool completely for free, that I don't work in the fashion industry, and that I don't have any background in the industry (fashion, data, or web design). I just wanted to do something helpful for the community. I will try my best to make as many improvements as I can over time, but I have very limited resources, and maintaining it is quite a lot of effort as is. Sorry, all!

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:I grew up in poverty in Kansas. We hardly ever had a house of our own let alone nice clothes. Everything was handed down or good will and I stopped asking for nice things to fit in in school quite early because it was flat out never possible. Even after I moved out on my own and had a decent paying job I always wanted to buy nice clothes, but could never bring myself to spend the money. It’s just how my brain was wired. Nice clothes were a luxury and if I spent the money on something a bit more expensive I just threw away money that could be used for bills or gas or the inevitable emergency that would deplete what little savings I did have. All of my clothes throughout my 20s were fast fashion or thrifted.   I am 32 and I am in a much better position financially than I ever have been. Couple that with my very fashionable fiancé and moving to California and my wardrobe has done a complete 180. He’s helped me realize how bad fast fashion is and now I spend more time finding clothes that actually speak to me. My style has broadened exponentially. I don’t feel stuck in a particular style (used to be strictly grunge) and I have adopted a more sophisticated style as well. I change up my style day to day based on how I feel and it just feels really good to be able to do that. It’s a slow process but I’m very happy with how my wardrobe is improving.	episode_done:True
text:Have your clothing purchases dramatically dropped now that we can't go anywhere?	labels:Absolutely!

text:Naked and Famous Raw Denim Review/Fit/Experience	labels:I’m a personal stylist who focuses JUST on women’s jeans and in all my years of experience I’ve only put raw denim on 2 of my clients for this exact reason. It’s too difficult to really nail the fit.... and if you do, there’s a good chance it’ll change as the jeans settle out or if your body changes. Plus, cutting around curves is super tough.   Raw denim is awesome in theory. It ages with you and confirms to your body. And the look of it over time is so cool. But I’ve almost never seen it work with women, especially in skinnier cuts. There’s just no give.   I would otherwise recommend vintage Levi’s or 100% cotton premium denim in a heartier weight for a more structured jean. The difference it that it’s been rinsed/washed so the fit is more predictable and longer lasting than raw denim.
text:Uhg I recently spent a lot of time trying to find a pair of well-fitting jeans that are made of higher quality fabric than the cheap high-stretch jeans that I've worn in the past.... Fuck me it was way more frustrating than I thought it would be. Eventually I tried the Levi's mile high skinny jeans, which I do really like, but it took a while for me to accept that the dream of raw denim was pretty much unobtainable.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I’ve actually completely changed how I shop. I’ve been focusing on high-quality investment pieces rather than trend pieces. It’s definitely a lot slower to build my closet this way, but I just want a closet that I love so I can eventually just “shop” my closet every morning instead of always feeling the need to add to it. For a lot of my high end pieces, I’ve been going for secondhand sites so I don’t have to worry about quality or authenticity. Personally, I don’t mind spending several hundreds of dollars on a pair of designer shoes that I know I’m going to love for the next 10 year (and are actually made to last that long) rather than cycling through low end finds all the time. But that’s just me.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 28, 2020	labels:There's a part of me that wants to lean into "Small business Saturday" and buy something from Etsy or wherever, but damn, they don't make it easy. It's such a wasteland of drop-shipped Alibaba products, cheap crafts (like Gildan tees that have been tie-dyed or bleached and then upsold for $50), and just straight up scams (i.e. polyester being marketed as wool), finding actual stores by actual craftspeople seems a total crapshoot. I know they must exist because I know actual craftspeople who sell through Etsy but unfortunately they seem like the minority. I wonder if anybody has ever made like a Chrome extension or something to cross reference Etsy with Alibaba/Aliexpress to at least filter the shameless "I'm even reselling using Aliexpress's same photography" 1:1 matches.
text:This is the same problem I have with eBay. I'm sure they have exactly what I want _somewhere_ but digging through all the mislabeled or fake crap is exhausting and not worth it.   Especially disappointing when you see something "handmade" that looks nice in the photo, immediately followed by several listings from different sellers with different titles using the same photo.  Or how the reviews for an item saying "great quality!" are actually for different items from the same seller.  _Ugh._	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Street style	labels:As opposed to when I’m at the office, I tend to wear a lot more like loose, slouchy, oversized tops/sweaters, shorter skirts (pleated/schoolgirl-ish ones especially), more printed t-shirts, more stretchy cotton dresses, and more large belts with chain or stud details. Stuff that feel a little too revealing or edgy or casual for work but that I still like.  Typical free time outfits for me would be a stretchy, short tight, or flared cotton dress dress, thick tights and a big cardigan, or a short pleated skirt with a camisole and an oversized, off-shoulder sweater, or a long is-it-a-shirt-or-is-it-a-dress and patterned leggings.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 15, 2021	labels:A question about cotton/modal blend undershirts:  I used to buy the **Hanes** Comfort Fit Ultra Soft Cotton/Modal undershirts, and they were OK.  A little while ago, I picked up a few **Goodfellow** brand cotton/modal/spandex blend undershirts from Target on a whim, and they were much better than the ones from Hanes. Softer feel, but still thick enough to wear around the house, and longer than the Hanes shirts so they stay tucked in better. My only complaint was that the V-neck wasn't very deep, so it would often show when I left the top button of my shirt unbuttoned. I can't really wear them with casual and camp collar shirts.  Recently I haven't been able to find the Goodfellow modal-blend undershirts at Target (only 100% cotton), but I'm reluctant to go back to the Hanes ones now that I've tasted this luxury.  I've looked at the **David Archy** modal undershirts, because I have some of their boxer briefs and find them very comfortable, but they are a 92% Modal, 8% Spandex blend and the reviews suggest they leave nothing to the imagination.  I'm also looking the **Uniqlo** "Dry" V-neck short-sleeve shirts. However I already have two Uniqlo "Airism" undershirts, and they are so thin they are nearly sheer. I don't really feel comfortable wearing them without another layer.  Are there any other cotton/modal (or similar) blend shirts that you'd recommend? My personal preferences are:  * Ideally less than $10 each * Soft and moisture-wicking fabric, not 100% cotton * V-neck deep enough to leave one button open without the undershirt being visible * Not too thin and revealing  Thanks!	episode_done:True
text:Which color palette do you hate wearing?	labels:Ha, my mom looks good in pastels so that's what she always bought me. I'm pale with red hair and look like a corpse in mint green, blush pink, baby blue etc. Jewel tones and bright white don't work on me either. I like saturated fall colors  - rust, pumpkin, mustard, orange-reds. My absolute favorite is sage/olive/OD green, I always get compliments when I wear it.	episode_done:True

I think it’s from GQ, but I’m very well aware that I could be wrong. The ad features a man who gives advice on how to be a modern man. Some lines I can recall from the ad being things like, “Learn to dance, wildly and out of control.” “Get a book. Print is back in fashion.” And, “Exercise. A body in motion keeps the mind in motion.” Or something similar (clearly, I don’t exercise enough lol).

text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:I did a no-buy year and a low-buy 6 months after that in 2018. I'm probably going to do the same this year.   I started as I needed to spend as little as possible as I had a pet who cost a lot for an ongoing chronic illness before he died.  I think I became more selective about what I bought. I also unsubscribed from a whole lot of sites. I also  became much better at money management and making outfits work in different ways. Also, by the end if I didn't wear it, it was worth thinking about what didn't like about it so I wasn't tempted by something inappropriate in the future.   The only reason it ended was I changed jobs and lost significant weight. But now my new wardrobe is complete, I don't need anything in the forseeable future. I'm probably going to just go through clothes seasonally  and  make a list if I need anything.  I did this before my no buy year and it worked well, but I had a lot more than I needed. It should work better now as I'm comfortable with the amount.	episode_done:True
text:Tailoring as a lifestyle choice - Suiting in The Crown	labels:In the age of WFH, what if men just started really living in their tailoring? Hands thrust in pockets, lounging on a picnic blanket, feet up binging Netflix?  An interesting thought exists that as mens casual wear became more acceptable that suiting became more structured and stiff. Thoughts?
text:I love the idea of this, although really good custom tailoring as they describe in the article is not exactly easy to come by. I think you are right about suiting; nowadays it seems exclusively reserved for weddings, special events, etc. and is rarely intended for every day wear.   Still, I almost always get dressed up to some extent when I’m WFH. I can’t bear to sit around in sweatpants and an old tee all day like a lot of people seem to do. Look good, feel good!	labels:I go back and forth.

text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I would recommend, first of all, assessing your goals and trying to make rules that are fair to you, and which can be adapted into life long habits.   Flexibility is important, especially when it comes to something you will eventually *need* to do, like purchasing clothing.  Not buying a single thread of clothing for an entire year was a failure waiting to happen (because, y'know, shit happens,) and it isn't even that helpful if it just results in binge periods before and after.      What works best for me is keeping a system of criteria for shopping.  If you actually *need* something, buy it guilt-free, and then budget out the things you don't need.  *Always* assess potential purchases critically: Ask yourself it it suits your wardrobe, if it's practical, if it fits well, it it's well-made and if it's something you are likely to wear a lot.   If helps, reserve nonessential purchases for use as a reward when you complete major tasks.  Try to avoid shopping altogether if you know you're not supposed to be buying stuff.  If you feel like you can't stop shopping, there's almost definitely *something* else you can be doing that scratches the same psychological itch.

If it doesn't, then it's just not gonna be worn in the fall/winter, it's too cold where I live for bare legs and I have never really found other colors/patterns of tights that I like the look of.

text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:Anecdotal, but here goes. I bought a pair of rag&bone jeans during Anniversary a couple years ago. They were thin and stretchy but I knew this going in so no problem. I liked them. I liked them well enough, in fact, to buy a second pair as a backup, which I've been known to do. The second pair, SAME cut AND wash was full-price after Anniversary. Thicker, not as stretchy, stitching was slightly different, felt "nicer" I guess, even though I had no complaints with the first pair. They were definitely different though, and purchased maybe a month apart.      Second, and this was this current year. Bought a couple Zella workout tees. Now, I've had numerous Zella pieces over the years and have never had an issue with washing and drying with regards to shrinking. This one shrunk on the first wash before I even had a chance to wear it, following the instructions to a T. The exact material blend was the same as my others. I will be returning this one when I get a chance.   I have no hard evidence either way, but I am suspicious. Also, as a longtime cardholder, every year Anniversary is more and more of a shitshow. There seems to be a huge amount of influencers (the blogger people, not the level of Nordstrom's rewards program) getting items that are never truly available to the public, even in the upper tiers of early access. It's all very frustrating and ultimately, not worth it for a retail sale. I'm not going to go full Karen and threaten to cancel my card or not shop there. I'm simply going to ignore Anniversary entirely from now on.	episode_done:True

I don't have a perfect description for it, but I do think that the style Andrew is wearing there is a lot more coherent. I think there are ways to do that style thoughtfully, and not randomly. I didn't write this with the intention of making people feel unhappy with their current wardrobe. Just trying to give suggestions on how they may get enjoyment from clothes, even when confined to home.	labels:Hi! I love most of your writing, particularly on the Die Workwear blog.

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:First for cardigans and sweaters is I either go fully wool or fully cotton. Can’t be any sort of blend, and I avoid mohair. I have a cotton cardigan from urban outfitters that’s like 5-6 years old and looks brand new, so you don’t even need to go super pricey, just look at fabric content.  Second is I wash everything on cold, and hang dry as often as possible. Heat basically transforms fabric, so using it is unnecessary. I also find that it sets pit stains instead of removes them.  Shoes I have no idea. I walk a lot and constantly wear out shoes. I find leather with a sewn in sole lasts a lot longer, but flats and heels never last that long. I’ve also had luck with shoes that have wooden soles which I’ve added a sole with traction to.  For bags, I’ve always heard it’s bad luck to keep them on the ground, but that’s more superstition than keeping it nice lol.
text:Lol I’ve heard that superstition too. My ex was Turkish and that’s what his mom said, so I assumed it was a Turkish thing.   But I don’t keep my bags on the ground, because the ground is nasty. Why people put their LV never fulls on the floor befuddles me.   My beautiful YSL leather bag that I saved up for months working hard: She pretty. She sits on the table or the designated purse chair.   I also moisturize my leather products once a month or so. I’ll clean them too if needed.   As far as clothes, it helps tremendously to hang dry, hand wash or machine wash on delicate cold.   Shoes: moisturizer every month. Take in to the cobbler once the season is over, store away in dust bags.	labels:	episode_done:True

Edit to distract myself from current events I'm gonna add  "what is the difference between American, italian and British cut suits?"  "where do I go besides MFA to learn more about fashion?"
text:> "why do some fits get praised when they clearly go against the sidebar"  I think this one could be enlightening to a lot of the people who don't understand how avant garde (or even just mildly experimental) inspo posts get so much praise by breaking traditional style conventions. It might help some bridge the knowledge base gap (i.e. you have to know the rules before you can break them) and help explain the (perceived) cognitive dissonance of traditional tailoring *and* designer fashion both being acceptable styles. I think that would help make it seem less jarring to those new readers who get confused when they come to this sub expecting to find answers for "how do I dress so that I look good," but they find a lot more of "how do I dress to express myself?"  For the record I think the second question is a lot more interesting and certainly the reason I'm here, and there's plenty of resources here that answer the first question (*if only people would look for them*), but I do value that this sub does an excellent job of tackling both. More discussion might be beneficial to newcomers to the world of intentional dressing, is all I'm saying, and the ones who are asking questions in-good-faith I think deserve to understand the rationale behind why someone might choose to wear Kapital instead of a suit.  One last edit: Not that I'm saying anyone owes anyone else any explanation for why they dress the way they do, but I think it's always interesting to learn the context.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Not really answering the question, but my issue has been the opposite. I'm about 10lbs lighter now than I was in high school, and I've stayed short and tiny my whole life. I basically kept my high school wardrobe all through college, then packed it with me when my husband and I got married and I moved. I didn't see the issue and thought it was ludicrous to get rid of an entire closet of clothes that were still intact and fit me well, until I started getting more serious about my career as a professor and realized my "professional teaching clothes" still read as "student attending an award ceremony."  Starting over the summer, I began weeding through my closet and donating anything that didn't make me happy or I couldn't imagine myself wearing in front of a classroom of college students or colleagues (except for my loungewear and workout clothes.) I felt A LOT of guilt at first, because I realized how many pieces I held onto for the nostalgia or just because they fit. I had to invite one of my closest friends over to help me make the tough decisions and she didn't let me talk myself into keeping a piece I initially put in the donate pile. That really helped my perspective, and now I can make more objective decisions without needing a cheerleader.   Once I got rid of about half of my closet (spring/summer and fall/winter wardrobe combined,) I gave myself permission to buy a few higher-end pieces that are much more my style but also fit both my daily life and professional needs. Neutral colors and versatile silhouettes. I feel so much less stress and guilt when I open my closet now, it really feels like I've moved into a new chapter of myself. It's my dream to have a 10-15 piece capsule closet, but one step at a time.  I'm so sorry I just went on a big tangent. It's been an enlightening quarantine for me obviously lol.	episode_done:True

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:To put it bluntly, 100% privilege plays a role in the way people dress because there is increased access to options (including natural fibres, so called “sustainable” clothing, tailoring, etc) that are completely inaccessible for the majority of others.

text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:I sometimes YouTube people with my similar size and watch reviews on certain clothing/items before I purchase them. I think it would help to find fashionistas with your similar body/taste to start.  Taking measurements is also really helpful!!! I bought a dress online for the first time using measurements and I was very happy with how well the dress fit. It's soooo much more accurate than just going off small/medium/large sizes.  I also want to add that, at least for me, my clothing and fashion sense was *extremely* awkward (and at times unflattering) at 21. It's a bit of a strange age because you're transitioning from being a teenager to being a "young adult". The way you express your identity can change radically from teenage to young adulthood to adulthood. So I guess I bring this up to say that it is totally normal to be frustrated with your clothing at this age. People on social media will typically post themselves looking their best; please know that they too have days where their outfit doesn't look right, where they feel insecure. Fashion is ultimately a never ending process of learning and expressing one's identity as we age and grow.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 22, 2020	labels:So I've been lurking / participating here for about a month and I think I have a good feel for the types of posts that generally end up on this sub, common opinions etc.  I see this same pattern - posts that align pretty well with what's discussed in WAYWT/Discussion threads, like the Rick Owens post from today or the coats post from last week, getting thousands of votes and comments from people posting things like "he looks like he's shit his pants", and "nobody would wear this".  Why do people who spend their time lurking this sub, silently absorbing whatever opinions and discussion, decide to come out of the woodwork to post _this_ hot take? Really - you had to put some thought and energy into typing that out. If that's what you think, why are you here?  I just don't understand. At least the post-meta-discussion here is good for a few laughs.

text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Its ok if a strict capsule doesn't work for you. Everyone's capsule can be different. You could have a secondary casule for your bright stuff to mix and match if you want! It's all about what works for you.
text:And that may very well be. My idea for wanting to set up a capsule wardrobe was because in the last 5 years, I've moved 7 times, so I'm trying to keep my clothing as little as possible. With a capsule wardrobe, I can have, say, 20-30 pieces and 50+ outfits with them instead of having 20-30 pieces of non-matching color schemes and having maybe 20 outfits.	labels:One more thing, if you can narrow your colors a little, it helps with cohesiveness. Like 1-2 neutrals and 2-3 colors for everything else. You still get some color, but there are a few limits. I have a rule that all my patterns need to have at least one of my colors in it. The primary color should be one of my neutrals or one of my colors, and then it can have anything else after that! If it is a pattern that prioritizes my neutral, then it also needs one of the actual colors too. In my world, that means, if I get a floral item with black, then it should have some pink. It can't be only blues, reds. and greens.
text:Ooo, I like your idea about the prints having a color in your color scheme! That’s something I’ve never thought of but I like the idea of. I have to go check my dresses now to see how close I am! :)	labels:It makes it easier for me to say no to items as well. :P I have tried multiple times to make navy and white dresses work in my wardrobe and they never get worn.

text:I’m moving from California to Michigan. Best way to move my wardrobe?	labels:I moved across country. May be an unpopular opinion, but use the opportunity to clear out the wardrobe and free up some space. When I moved I sold off/donated probably half of my clothes and shoes. Otherwise, what I did:  \- Left everything that was in the dresser/drawers in there and moved them as one piece (even stuffed extra stuff in each drawer)  \- Space bags for all of my button downs (lots of ironing when I arrived)  \-  Anything that could tolerate it (like suits, wool coats, down jackets), I rolled, folded, etc and packed them into either space bags or just into boxes  \- Packed shoes into boxes as tight as possible (I don't keep the shoe boxes normally)  \- Anything of any high monetary or sentimental value (RMC leathers, a few of my favorite Vibergs/Aldens, etc) traveled with me in the car.
text:Thank you for the tips. I will look into the space saver bags. Are there any you’d recommend?	labels:I just bought the cheapest ones on amazon. I've never had good luck re-using them multiple times, so you just need something that will survive the move.	episode_done:True
text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:If you have the space to store your current wardrobe, then my advice to you is simply not to pressure yourself into getting rid of clothing that you're not comfortable getting rid of.  Minimalistic wardrobes are not for everybody, and you certainly wouldn't be helping anything if you were to throw away those clothes only to end up  buying replacements later.     Take the clothes that you don't think you need and set them aside, maybe in a box or the very back of your closet, and keep only your 'minimalist wardrobe' in the easily accessible location.  If, after a year, you find that you didn't really miss anything from the old collection of clothes, you won't feel as hesitant about getting rid of them.  If you have to dig a few things out of your stash, just keep them.  If you find that you've completely ransacked your stash over the course of a year, and ended up wearing everything you didn't think you needed, then, well... maybe minimalism isn't for you.	episode_done:True
text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:My fashion is evolving! I was raised in a strict conservative homeschooling environment, so until college my fashion was nonexistent.  In college, I had the same instincts for fashion I do now— but no taste. Meaning I knew the message I wanted to send but didn’t have the language down.  It took me five years, and several kind friends in grad school. I used the Curated Closet, lurked on this sub, and- I know it sounds weird- watched RuPaul’s Drag Race with a very fashion-forward friend.  I have three key “styles” and rotate based context: 1. Business casual— lots of black leggings and Uniqlo swing dresses, blazers, button-ups, minimalist sweaters. Clothing that says Take Me Seriously, I’m Here to Work. 2. Flannels and nerdy or artsy graphic tees. Laid-back mode.  3. Artsy, edgy, fashion-forward. I like the subversive and truly odd. As a confused baby in undergrad, this love combined with poverty drove me to a series of failed experiments. Notable: the notorious black sequin dress and top hat, a vintage 20s button up with poofy sleeves paired with high waisted jeans, camo jacket and flowy skirt. Now, my artsy style manifests in outfits like: Universal Standard Geneva dress, green bomber jacket, cherry Doc Martens and matching lipstick, dangling silver figure earrings, statement bag. (I’m currently in love with FashionBrandCompany’s garbage bag purse).   I put a lot of thought into my wardrobe and 75% are pieces that can rotate through all three. Black leggings and black dresses are great neutral canvases— the accessories make the style!	episode_done:True

I only kept and subscribed to channels that tend to do their research or seem pretty down to earth. Honestly a pretty good rule of thumb is, does watching this person make me feel good and fulfilled afterwards? Inspired even? If not then, i just don't watch their videos anymore. YT is suppose to entertain you, not make yourself feel bad.  Someone mentioned Justine Leconte in the comments and for ex, after her videos, i just feel so much more knowledgeable, like i actually got something out of it. I like watching bestdressed because her personality is relatable and she knows she has imperfections but still posts anyway. Jessica Neistadt is one that hasn't been mentioned yet, but i watch her cause she has a good energy. Most of her hauls are thrifts so they're affordable, with a few expensive pieces here and there. Also, she has a quote of the day at the end of her videos. Obviously, what makes me happy isn't an answer for everyone.  I tend to mix up my feed as well so I don't get tired of one topic too quickly (food, social experiments, science, video games)

Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.
text:>* Less SKUs. The amount of stuff BB sells is overwhelming.  >* Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof.      Oh god, yes. It's so frustrating trying to work out the differences. John Smedley also has a bunch of items very similar, marginally different pricing and not enough info about what differentiates them. Drives me up the wall.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Many years ago I moved from Hawaii to college in the Northeast. I would recommend 1) Buying it all there, because they'll have what's good for their climate and 2) starting out with cheaper options (thrifted, Old Navy, Target range) even if it's not quite your style. Don't spend much time, effort, and money until you see how you really feel after at least a year of seasons. Maybe you want warmer stuff than you thought you would, or realize you should invest in nicer socks, or discover you don't actually like turtlenecks, or shift to a different style when you're surrounded by a new area's vibe. Let yourself experience it for a bit without pressuring yourself to do it all right.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 16, 2021	labels:I'm needing help finding jeans (or pants in general) for a tall slim person with semi-muscular thighs. I think I'm settling for finding pairs in 30x35-36 (but I think my actual size is more like 29x35). The 32x34s I have bunch up really badly if I tighten my belt properly (I can fit my fist in the wasteband without it being too tight). I've bought some slim 30x34s from jcrew that fit pretty well, but were a little too tight in the thigh.

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I also hate pants for the same reasons as you. But I also live in a Nordic country which is hella cold.   I just wear thights that are made of comfortable quality fabrics (sometimes cotton/wool blends) and I buy at LEAST one size bigger than my actual size, with wide waistbands. I want comfort above all, and for me this works.  Also if I only had to deal with cold weathers in the morning, frankly I would just put the thights on in the morning and then take them off later and put them in my bag.	episode_done:True

text:Winston & Co. Shawl Collar Cardigan Review (But mostly preamble)	labels:This is good stuff. I think the important takeaway is that there are really not likely going to be shortcuts here - you are likely going to find scratchiness at lower price points, and moving up the pricing ladder, you may find that the ply numbers align with price = wool sweaters whose weight is in pounds not ounces are going to cost $XXX not $XX.  Also, if you do value horn versus leather buttons, you are further slicing your options - there is a strong correlation with Scottish knits with "tradition", and that means the default tends to be leather buttons. In fact, years ago I was at NMWA when a S&C order came in... with leather buttons. I think that meant they had to ship back a few cubic yards worth of cardigans
text:You're right, there aren't short cuts to this level of quality.  I think this knit represents the best entry level option for this sort of sweater. It's not as heavy, but it's FAR from insubstantial.  I don't mind the leather buttons, but they definitely add a level of "Old fogey" vibes if you're not careful.  Even horn buttons can miss the mark, I saw the new Spier & Mackay chunky cardigan and a common comment is that the buttons are just a bit too large.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does Anyone Ever Feel Like It’s Hard to Find Basic Clothing Items That Were Plentiful in the Past?	labels:I don't know if I'd consider a velvet dress a basic item.

I just want a tee or tank that is good for layering, but is not so sheer that I can't wear it alone.  Is something made with fabric heavier than tissue paper too much to ask?  (And by fitted, I don't mean the Everlane oversized/boxy fit.  If I wanted that, I'd shop in the men's section.)

text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:A huge chunk of my wardrobe is built out from Amazon. I add everything to a list, and wait until Amazon's algorithms decide they need to sell it for $6. They also offer Tall sizes on quite a lot of items, which is great for having sleeves that fit.  Uniqlo for jeans, Amazon's Peak Velocity brand for Tshirts, and Goodthreads for everything else is what I would do if I had to start from Scratch.  If there's a certain type of item your looking for, feel free to ask for recommendations and I can send you a link to what I'd look at.
text:Thanks for sharing!   Items I'm looking for:  \- White sneakers - preferably leather   \- Jeans - Slim/skinny light blue, navy, black   \- Jackets - from bomber jackets to other non-bomber kinds  \- Sweaters or sweatshirts I can layer under my jacket  \- Long sleeve shirts/henleys  \- boots   If you've come across any of these on amazon that you think may be decent purchase I'd love to check it out	labels:Amazon has pretty decent t-shirts and sweatshirts (not knit sweaters!) that you can get for a good price. You can also buy some decent quality sneakers from Amazon too, just make sure it's from a reputable seller and from a recognized shoe brand (Adidas/New Balance/etc.).  &#x200B;  However, for stuff like jeans, jackets, boots, and knitwear, I'd look elsewhere. I've bought jeans from Amazon in the past that came with low-quality buttons and ripped after 2 months of wear, so I don't think the quality is quite there. My recommendation would be to search on places like Uniqlo/Carhartt/Champion or even thrift stores to get better quality jeans/jackets/knitwear that can last you a lot longer than whatever you'd find on Amazon for a comparable price.

text:Noel Fielding X Fendi menswear colab	labels:I see Noel Fielding. I remember the Great British Bake Off. I updoot.  When I think of Fendi, I'm not a fan due to the overt branding on the baguettes. I don't think this collection really strikes me as interesting, though I am a fan of look 31 and the blue piping detail. The graphics also don't excite me a ton, except for the cursive Fendi coat in 23 (and I actually love the pop of the turtleneck and gloves and piping - so whimsical!) This collection confuses me as it's simultaneously very muted but also funky, but I don't feel as though there's cohesive messaging. I don't know Noel from anything besides GBBO, but I would have expected or liked a l'il more goth and/or more color out of the collab.	episode_done:True
text:Tailoring as a lifestyle choice - Suiting in The Crown	labels:In the age of WFH, what if men just started really living in their tailoring? Hands thrust in pockets, lounging on a picnic blanket, feet up binging Netflix?  An interesting thought exists that as mens casual wear became more acceptable that suiting became more structured and stiff. Thoughts?
text:I love the idea of this, although really good custom tailoring as they describe in the article is not exactly easy to come by. I think you are right about suiting; nowadays it seems exclusively reserved for weddings, special events, etc. and is rarely intended for every day wear.   Still, I almost always get dressed up to some extent when I’m WFH. I can’t bear to sit around in sweatpants and an old tee all day like a lot of people seem to do. Look good, feel good!	labels:Do keep in mind what you described is mostly American culture. Italian tailoring in particular is huge on unstructured suits and jackets still.	episode_done:True

ThredUp either sells my clothes to a new owner or recycles them and maybe I even get a couple bucks out of it.

I like pairing mine with a really minimal white tee and jeans look with a red lipstick, which looks really simple and classic , or with a black fitted pencil skirt for a work-but-make-it-badass look.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:Figure out what inspires you about the style and then "translate" that to your own shape (and vibe and lifestyle etc). The retro men's khakis probably look good on the men in the photos because they're tailored to flatter that specific shape - they communicate ease and perfection and the possibility of summer fun. Try a capri pant in a bright or summery color that fits your shape to communicate those vibes on yourself.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 14, 2020	labels:I'm currently looking at purchasing an entire new wardrobe and accessories, and not sure where to start.   I'm completely new to actually putting in the effort to look good. I want to be able to look classy but also be able to go out for a beer and not look like I'm overdoing it.   I'm about 6'3 200lbs, very broad shoulders and chest, I'm a big guy but yet skinny if that makes sense lol. I've always worn nothing but jeans, t-shirts and basic pullover hoodies. I don't mind that look but want to move away from it some and try something new, get my own style per say.   Any advice of where to start will be greatly appreciated!	episode_done:True
text:Yearly Aesthetic Goal Setting	labels:Great goals!  My goal for last year was to experiment with makeup, far outside my comfort zone. I normally cheat and just do "Floki eyes" when i go out dancing, but last year i did some lightning inspired crackles, a tree-like crackle (similar to the lightning so that was also kind of cheating), a circuit board motif across half my face, and a couple of different heavily Viking looks with bindrunes.  I will continue to try new things (i have one based on the lead dancer in the Suspiria remake on deck) as soon as we're allowed to go out dancing again.  Until then, my low key goal is to continue working my way through my mending box, and to take the logos off my favorite tshirts that are falling apart, and transfer them to either new tshirts or tanks, or if they are small enough to bowling style collared shirts/guyaberas.  Most of my tshirts are from charity or small business fundraisers, such as Pride or a local band, so i want to keep the memories alive even after the fabric decides to give up the ghost.	episode_done:True

He’s a quick-thinking guy, and I know he’ll have a good answer, so I say, “ok smart guy, what shape am I?”  “Well, you’ve got good hips and butt, and a long but slender torso. You’re male genitalia. Penis and balls.”  So, apparently I’m genitalia shaped. Sorry, that’s not a food, but it’s what I’ve got.

text:Just how revolutionary is Harry Styles’ Vogue cover?	labels:Women look better in dresses.  You can be as progressive and woke as you want, and encourage whatever you want so people can express themselves, but aesthetics dont care about that stuff. Womens clothing is typically styled to cater to the female (sex) body. People always comment on the dress itself, or whether it works, but never how that same outfit would just look better on a female.  This is a matter of aesthetic and taste to some extent, and thinking that men generally look bad in dresses is a justified opinion.

text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:When you're looking at pictures for inspiration ask yourself if you like the clothes or if you like what you feel the clothes etc represent. If you buy clothes because of what you feel they represent you may end up wasting money and having to do another wardrobe re-vamp.  To give you an example: I find myself drawn to drapey, flowy, bohemian, artsy types of clothes. The sort that tend to look good on taller women with small busts. Now I'm a firm believer in wearing things you like regardless of whether conventional wisdom says they look "good" on you. But in this case what I was being drawn to was the lifestyle I felt those clothes represented, not the clothes themselves - which it turned out did not fit my lifestyle, my personality or my shape. It took quite a few expensive mistakes to realise this.	episode_done:True

text:Goals and Resolutions Check in: February	labels:My goals are going well! A couple of ours are essentially the same. Good luck, we got this!  1) Wardrobe Overhaul  At the beginning of the year, all I owned was athleisure. I was a very cozy, but very bored, person. So I’m working on filling my wardrobe with clothes that really make me happy, and it’s working! I’m in a fortunate position right now, so I’ve been spending the last stimulus check on ThredUp and Poshmark. I gotta say I am loving online thrifting.  2) Dress for my emotions rather than comfort.  Part of moving away from athleisure. My clothes really influence how I feel, so dressing up to look like a badass bitch makes me feel like a badass bitch. Even on days I work at home, I wear outfits to emotionally prep myself to enjoy being productive. I change into pjs when my work is done for the day, so I actually get to look forward to my comfy clothes rather than feel like it’s just another lazy day in leggings.  3) Focus on fit and proportions.  This one is harder but is making me feel the most ~fashionable~. I’m trying to identify how/why certain pieces work on me while others look slightly off. I take videos of myself where I make a bunch of tiny adjustments to my outfits to identify the little details I do or don’t like. This is definitely the biggest of my goals, and will take a long time to really figure out. I can often tell when something isn’t right about an outfit, but identifying that element is tricky.

Or rather, magazines are no different in Japan than other things: some of them are just pure perfection due to the dedication and effort of their creators.  It is well known here in the sub that the same applies for Japanese denim and even for fast fashion like Uniqlo, among many other things. When they do something, the Japanese really do it right.	episode_done:True
text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:Like others have mentioned, it’s entirely how you feel about your look and ultimately your decision when it comes down to it. However my advice would be against it, I find that while they try to be the best of both worlds with glasses and sunglasses they just end up being a worse version of either. Either they’re bad sunglasses because the glasses part is small, or they’re weird looking glasses because it’s a big sunglasses frame. As well I personally find the awkward grey tinge they have in the “mid” light conditions to be very tacky/dorky looking. Like many others have said, with the price of cheap frames now a days you can just get a cheaper pair of both. Prescription sunglasses or contacts for days you need sunglasses is likely the better option for you.
text:Yeah after all the advice I got here and your to top it off, I think you are on point  This is why, my store has two sizes 51 and 53, 53 looks big on me, I need 51 as I wear 52 usually anyways  but if I go with transition, the guy told me I should get 53, as the transition on 51 would make it look smaller  &#x200B;  so yeah, you are on point here, it will look either bad as sunglasses cuz it's small or bad as eyeglasses cuz it's big  &#x200B;  I ended up choosing 51 eyeglasses, and then I will just get prescription sunglasses on the side by changing one of the old lenses on my frame - I think that's the best way to go on about this, transitional glasses are like tablets - neither a phone nor a laptop  &#x200B;  Thanks for the advice, I might make a new post later black plastic frames what sunglass lens colour to get	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:A few tips that work for me in thrift stores: - I pick one section and don't feel like i have to check out the entire store.  - I go through racks and touch everything and stop when I touch something that feels like a nice fabric - silk, cashmere, good wool, crisp cotton. This helps me get to the nice stuff when the racks are visually overwhelming. - try on lots of things! Sometimes you fall in love with stuff you didn't expect to.   On websites that are searchable: - have a very specific item in mind or a specific brand you like - narrow the search results by size, brand, color, and fabric - pay attention to the measurements to see if things will fit - don't be afraid to make low offers on sites where you can do that  I find online thrifting very different than in-store thrifting, because online, you can search for all kinds of specific things, where in a store, most of the fun comes from finding something unexpected.
text:> I go through racks and touch everything and stop when I touch something that feels like a nice fabric - silk, cashmere, good wool, crisp cotton.  If anyone is curious, this is a trainable skill. Go to a thrift store. Just go down a rack and touch every garment in the rack. Make a guess in your mind about what fabric it is, and then check the actual material label. If you do this over and over again, your guesses will become more accurate until you can accurately predict what the material labels will say. It's a skill that can be systematically practiced.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:Love this question! After I’ve determined my outfit, sometimes I have shoes already in mind if I want a specific silhouette, but if not I think about a purse and shoe combo to fit based on if I need to carry things or if I’ll be walking a bit. Most of my shoes, purses, and belts are either cognac brown leather (my weakness) or black leather, and in the styles I wear most like oxfords I like to have a version in each color leather.  Now that I think about it, the only color among my footwear is a pair of red pumps. Even my more casual shoes like Supergas are tan or white. I’d love to add more color to my footwear but I opt for quality first, which is more expensive, which makes me more likely to choose a color thats versatile (like cognac brown, which is again, my absolute weakness).	episode_done:True

Its been a super common look for a minute now. I think this is a good sometimes option, to try something new.   Personally, I try not to wear the same outfit more than once (although i do have fall back go-to formulas).  so if you're like me, or you just want to try something new, i think this is an option for switching things up, it gives you an other option to work with for fall.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:I think what's consistent in the examples that you've shown is that she has a very minimalist style in darker colors. The quality of the fabric appears to be high. When you use natural fibers like cotton and wool and silk they will naturally drape better on any body type. Look for pieces like cocoon jackets, cropped wide leg trousers, and tunics for example.

text:When will I be "too old" to look cute, cool, hip, whatever?	labels:36 year old here, grinding my teeth at you for asking this question at 22.  This is my constant internal monologue, but I think that it is always appropriate to try and present yourself to others in the best possible light.  I can't tell you how things will change for you, but I have found that my tastes have developed and age has sanded off the fringiest edges of my fashion interests.  I used to want to (relatively) keep up with trends, and now my aesthetic goal has shifted into a desire for a more timeless look; probably because at 36 I would also like to be timeless.  So at the end of the day I hope to dress like someone that wears quality clothes, with a flattering fit, and they indicate that I care about my appearance.  And I don't think you're ever too old to fit that criteria.  The fact that you're asking the question probably means that you are introspective and will adjust your style as well.
text:Also 36 and you summed up how I feel exactly.   I moved from a big city to a smaller blue collar city a few years ago, around the same time I had my first kid.

(Meanwhile, I can wear a nice top and PJ pants on that Zoom call.) If I don't need to be on camera, then the sky is the limit and I will go wild and colorful.  I have over 30 palettes and do a shop my stash rotation.  Also if it is a holiday, I will do a look in that holiday's colors.  Coming up is a pink look and later a green one.	episode_done:True

text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I had a general style from a relatively young age, like teenage years. Kind of preppy, kind of quirky, lots of animals on my tops, lots of jewel tones, etc. I'd play around with buying other types of looks, but most of them left my closet pretty quickly. In my early/mid 20s, I did have this horrible period where I thought I needed to "grow up" so I purged a *ton* of stuff and thought I was just going to stick to neutrals and sleek lines and be very polished, or my idea of polished...I was miserable and by the time I was in my late 20s, began rebuilding my wardrobe to be filled with more things that just make me smile. I do have some of my neutrals hanging around. I learned I don't hate them, as long as they have texture or dramatic sleeves or things like that. So I guess the experience wasn't a total wash...  But yeah, I'm 31 and my style journey is just kind of ending up where I was at like 3. (I mean, I just bought a sweater of a giraffe, haha) But it was really about just kind of accepting who I am and realizing I'm probably not going to outgrow a lot the idiosyncrasies the way I thought I "should" 🤷‍♀️	episode_done:True

text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Your comment about thinking each new piece will “complete” your wardrobe is so spot-on - I’m the master of convincing myself that once I have a [insert item here], my clothing collection will be complete and I’ll never need anything again. Surprise, surprise - there’s literally always something new that I “need” to “finish off” my wardrobe.   Like you, I’m trying to learn to work with what I have and narrow down exactly what I feel best in. I like high-waisted everything, plain tops in neutral colors, subtly patterned pants, button-downs that don’t need too much ironing, and a variety of jackets and shoes to switch things up. (Which I already own in spades.)   For 2021, I’m hoping to curb any non-necessary shopping impulses and am creating a shortlist from which I cannot deviate (as there are a few items I still want to add, such as a camel coat and a ski bib).	episode_done:True

I’d love to wear it as part of everyday wear, but it looks a bit formal for most occasions. I have seen some more modern versions and a bit trendier versions, so I’m trying to get my hands on that. As for now, I just wear my cultural dress to church on Sundays, which is a more appropriate setting.  But I wouldn’t worry yourself about what your mom has to say about it. If it you like it and it makes you feel good, then why not wear it? I bet you look amazing in them, it sounds so cute!

text:Shitpost Saturday: What do your shoes say about you?	labels:Hey hey! You'd like to think you are creative and into fashion and not getting old but really you just wear the same pair of boots everyday because you have slowly started prioritizing comfort over style but still try to justify it as an actual ~aesthetic~ and totally not because you now have bunions and corns and fallen arches and other old feet problems (why do things between my toes now bother me?!). #Blundstones4Lyfe #oldhagat32
text:Got my first pair in February of 2020 (pre-covid) and only wore them twice before my state went on 84 day lock down, which by then it was summer. Now, I wear them literally every day and I don’t ever want any other shoe!!!!! THEY ARE AMAZING!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:I think it would be good to start with some gold and silver necklaces that you can layer like basic chains with charms and some some hoop earrings, pearls, or diamond studs. You can even get some colorful jewelry for statement pieces or a pop or color. And I would say get a black belt and a brown belt cause they can go with anything almost.

text:yeah same - I think the cuts look nice, but style wise it feels pretty standard and I don't feel like there's a definitive point of view happening here (the best things I think here are probably the puffers though).  Honestly, I'm going to pass on this collection - especially since right now I'm not looking for workwear or outerwear.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else hate literally everything they put on?	labels:What i wear in my private life i know suits me and even if it doesn't flatter me according to fashion "rules", it makes me feel invincible and powerful.  What i wear to work is just temporary cloth to cover my body.  I have basically no emotional attachment to any of it, and i know it is actively unflattering.  However, showing up at my science job in full goth/pagan gear would be....frowned upon.  So i have 2 separate wardrobes and rarely shall the twain meet.  I don't love the situation, but it's the reality of life, so i endure.	episode_done:True
text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:I feel the same way, I'm bewildered at so many people finding ALL pants uncomfortable.   The only thing I can think of is that they're either wearing the wrong style (I vastly prefer super high rise. midrise and lowrise cut me across the stomach in an uncomfortable way, unless they're a size too big), the wrong size (too small jeans WILL be terrible, especially 100% cotton), or they have sensory or digestive issues/stomach sensitivity.	labels:I have the luxury of having a live-in taylor (my mum) and consequently I wear high-rise stretchy jeans perfect for my pear/hourglass shape. In spite of that, I still find them way more uncomfortable than skirts. I dislike how they enclose my thighs and how they cut off my range of movements. I understand that sitting cross legged on the floor is not meant for jeans, but I still dislike that the fabric does not allow me to do that! At least, not as easily as leggins...	episode_done:True

text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I don’t know about “everyone should own,” but I have a pair of square opal studs that I wear allll the time. The white goes with everything, the colored specks add interest, the shape is unique, and they don’t look as fancy as pearls. I can wear them grocery shopping or to an event. I love opals so much!
text:Opals are so lovely. I would agree here, jewelry can be so subjective I would say pearl, diamond, gold and silver/white gold studs (or good looking imitations of any/all depending on budget) are good any occasion go to pieces. Even a standard pearl necklace or even studs isn’t necessarily going to be something someone with an edgier asthmatic would go for, I think standards fall more in to categories- daily wear, statement and fancy. For more of an upper class type of vibe I’d say for necklaces a diamond collar style or choker for fancy, pearl strand and perhaps something with a tasteful small scale  pendant or single colored stone for everyday and a funky maybe chunky mixed metals or stones piece for statement. Edgier might be a sharp glitter crusted but not over large ice pick pendant (icicle? Skinny inverted triangle shape...I’m sure they are called something else but I cannot think of the proper name) on a standard 18-20” braided or box chain for everyday, large round stone on a long  chain for fancy and a chain mail type collar for statement. Personally my go to pendants are a sparkly star which was my first real diamond jewelry and a cz unicorn my husband got me on a thin but not super fine chain and rose gold bezel set cz studs for every day. Little dress I change up the earrings to something with a dangle and if I’m going fancy I have a choker (on me) with white gold alternating small ‘bars’ and geometric balls and I add a long chain with a chunky pendant. Favorite statement piece is a Betsy Johnson with a large fixed crystal pineapple.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What's Up With G By Guess?	labels:> Any thoughts?  It looks like stuff that ends up at Ross — cheaply made with nonsensical design elements.   If you like it, great, but I don’t think it’s a loss. Check secondhand markets for the remainders that are still floating around.
text:Their quality was better in 2010-ish. Designs too. But I did notice quality fading over time, as well as designs becoming more and more simple. The main GUESS brand has had this issue too. Sucks. I grew up loving the GUESS/G By Guess brands.	labels:The brand is definitely not even closely remote to what it used to be years ago, but I’ve been to one of the stores in Los Angeles and you can definitely find some quality pieces. I think it all depends on what you are looking for. Their denim is solid: not the best out there, but also not the worst. I would would wait for their sales, but I could see myself finding something to buy.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 03	labels:My new coat ~~has~~ had this beautiful fluffy texture of brushed camel hair. Well today I got caught by a massive rainfall, coat utterly soaked, decidedly less fluffy now.  :|	episode_done:True
text:Reigning Champ Hoodie: 2 months later	labels:Often times, cheaper, more utilitarian fabrics are more durable. While I can't speak to RC's quality as I have never owned any of their stuff, terry-cloth is generally a softer material and can be more likely to abrade. So if you are like me and place a lot of weight on your elbows while seated at a chair with armrests (esp if you have pointy elbows), then you might find that you develop holes there and so you either change up how you sit or you realize that you need something that will work with your use-case (denser weave material or maybe reinforced elbows/elbow patches). Not dissimilar to how some people put holes in socks more easily than others. Shape of your body and how you do normal, everyday things can impact how things wear on you.    More expensive does not mean more durable. These are not the same thing and it's something that people really need to stop using as a reason to spend more on something. Durability \*can\* be a high-quality product's claim to fame, but is certainly not generalized to everything.    Durability is also not a measure of quality. It can be part of why you consider something to be "quality", but that's up to you what you want from your garments. Unfortunately, you don't know what you don't know, and going by what people recommend means that you're basing your purchasing decisions on other people's preferences. Fashion can be an expensive hobby and there is a lot of trial and error as you learn about yourself and about the various things that go into making a garment.	episode_done:True

I have plenty from like j.crew and madewell but I feel like they don't hold up for as long as I want.

Then today I walked past The Kooples on the way to the bathroom and saw the exact fucking coat I wanted 50% off, roughly what I paid for the first coat. Fit perfectly off the rack. For fuck's sake.

After a while, look at your board and look at the styles that repeat or similarities in what you've chosen. That should give you an idea.

text:Bruce Boyer on Finding Your Wardrobe and Sustainability in Fashion – Put This On (Derek Guy )	labels:i wish articles like this avoided the "expensive clothes sustainability" trope. the systems that lead to people being able to drop several thousand on a suit are inherently not sustainable, and i would love to see more discussion like that in the last question where consumption itself is addressed. imo the answer will involve more people taking responsibility for the origin of their own clothing with a focus on local labor and materials
text:Could you say more about why those systems are unsubstainablr?   I'm not very rich, I would struggle to afford a house in my expensive city, but I have dropped a few thousand on a suit - made with good materials by a local bespoke maker.  I think extreme wealth gaps are unsustainable, for sure, but dropping a few thousand on a suit every couple of years isn't much more than people spend on a computer, out drinking, or on games and gaming systems. For me, it's a hobby I get to wear.	labels:One decent suit in any closet is always a must, a couple of times I got the job I was interviewing for simply because I wore a suit and tie to the interview.   Sustainability and changing trends are another can of worms which depend on the individual. Contemporary vs Classic, $300 suit which can be altered by a tailor vs $4,000.00 fitted suit. Like he said “buy the best you can afford and take care of your purchases”
text:Yeah, I definitely lean toward buying the best I can afford - for my own enjoyment, but also because of sustainability/long term cost, and because I can better (though not perfectly) make sure people get paid well along the supply chain that way.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:No, no, no and no. I hate the aesthetic thing.

I got burned by that once in 2012-2014 and as they say, "fool me once..."  I do find it interesting that this one parent company has maintained the same operating procedure through name changes and brand additions. Nice digging!
text:I signed up for fabletics several years ago and it was stressful to skip each month, their policies were needlessly difficult to navigate, and the quality of the actual clothes was subpar. Very inconsistent sizing, bad seams, and not a single sports bra provided anything approaching useful support for me (I do have a larger bra size but not abnormally so!).

text:General Discussion - December 24, 2020	labels:Have we come to a general consensus on what “well-dressed” or a “good” outfit is? I’d posit that the most important thing is effective execution of intentionality, conveying what you want to communicate through the fit.   A bonus factor would be something interesting within the fit, be that through challenging pre-existing rules or providing something unexpected. I don’t think it’s a necessity to a good fit, but it definitely adds bonus points

text:The shit I see spewed by a few friends from high school and relatives on Facebook is just mind-numbingly stupid. My favorite, by far, has to be that the Democrats created the "COVID hoax" to win the election. Yeah, because every single country on earth hates Donald Trump and the Republicans so much that they'd be on board with perpetrating a massive conspiracy that has killed more than a million people and sent the global economy into a recession.  Never does the thought occur that had Trump and the GOP just responded to it like people that actually possess empathy and compassion for other human beings, they could have rode a wave of popularity into a White House victory and maybe even flipped the House back.

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items are my Native American Turquoise jewelry and my cowboy boots. Just purchased a huge $900 squash blossom necklace and have worn it constantly. My boots range from $30 for a secondhand pair to $750 for custom made and none are worn more or less than the others.  When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was “saving for good”. Ironically, “good” apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I’m just out running errands.

text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:My first (meaningful) boyfriend gave me a diamond necklace when i was 18. It was lovely, I wore it constantly, and received many compliments. And then we broke up, as one does with their teen boyfriend, and blah blah blah, after a while I was like, "wtf do I do with this?"  I was *never* going to wear it again and selling it felt a little mercenary.   I ended up giving it as a gift to a girl I babysat/nannied for when she turned 18. It was nice because it was a way for me to give it to someone I cared about and I was able to give her a much nicer gift than I normally would have. And now when I think about that particular piece of jewelry, I don't think about my imploded relationship with my ex, but my relationship that I had with this girl as she grew up.

text:What are your favorite straight leg jeans?	labels:Hi, my favorite for years are DL 1961 Coco Curvy straight jeans.  I recommend sizing down 1 size from your usual as they rung big.  They are a little long on me.  I'm 5'4.  I also like the Mara ankle ones also from DL 1961 and The Mari high rise(almost the same name, very confusing) from AG.  I also just bought Jen7 by Seven --a straight ankle length & I really like them.  I buy most of my jeans at Nordstrom Rack or Bloomingdales on Sale.  I don't believe in every paying full price but I really think getting a good deal on premium denim is worth it!  Hope that helps!	episode_done:True
text:What are your go-to, everyday shoes?	labels:Blundstones in the winter, white keds in the summer. I'm a simple gal. 🤷‍♀️  Side note, I wear orthodics so my shoe choices are based on whether I can rip out the insole and fit my orthodics. Unfortunately this means no sandals during the summer unless I really think it's worth it to sacrifice cuteness for knee pain!

text:I feel this at my core. I used to wear such casual chic clothing around my clients with big funky accessories and always with a bold lip color. But now, I am in hatelove with a gigantic chunky green sweater from Target that cost me all of $22, but I wash and dry it as if it were some high end boutique item from a Brooklyn designer. Gentle cycle, cold water. Fluff. Hang dry. And then I wear it again for 3 days in a row without makeup because I can't even begin to relate to my stylish clothes. They seem like old friends I've lost touch with and I forget what we have in common.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:rip in peace	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I've never been interested in anything home related (to the point where I will likely never own a home, by choice) as I spent every weekend of my childhood on some home project.  Enough is enough!  While I'm now WFH (so what I wear does not matter) I've noticed that fashion as of late is simply butt ugly.  The oversized boxy neutral aesthetic is just blah to me.  THe last time I really liked some of the trends was around 2014-16 when things like skater dresses/skirts (you know things that actually had a shape to them that was not a paper bag).    Now the trends remind me of that scene in The Little Mermaid when Ariel first becomes a human and they dress her up in an old beige sail and make it fashion.	episode_done:True

I’ve found a lot of inspiration from tiktok believe it or not! I’m 27 and I dress very alternative , but it’s refreshing to see what other people are doing with their style through the clips they post. If you are interested in second hand shopping, I’ve had some great luck using the Vinted app, it can take a while to do some searching but you can find some really great pieces , even new with tags.

After a bit I suddenly feel more comfortable.   Also, avoid mirrors! This helped massively when I was trying to get comfortable wearing bright lipsticks.
text:This is a great answer. I did this with a few of the shorter dresses I have and pretty soon I was just used to it and when your own brain is used to something, you don't care as much what other people think. Excellent advice!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Why Ralph Lauren Never Goes Out of Style	labels:I f***ing love old Ralph Lauren. I eat that stuff up. I agree that the quality is part of why it never goes out of style. But also Ralph Lauren is still huge and relevant today, so vintage pieces feel both en vogue and archival, a very "intellectual" take on an American classic. Like an old Herman Miller chair. It was cool then and it's cool now. And RL has infiltrated all sorts of cultures, namely hip hop and streetwear meaning the demand for it isn't just bankers. And RL has been a titan of American fashion in that he sort of figured out his formulas a while ago and hasn't changed that much. RL from the past is just as recognizable as RL from today. In my opinion it's aged unbelievably well. Old RL pieces are like darling Americana that can styled with anything. An old RL knit hangs just as well with streetwear as it does with jeans and boots. And while similar brands like BB are nice, they are one trick ponies. RL has and continues to offer an expansive product line from tech skiwear to western clothes. I think this huge line up means that even if there are duds, they are hidden by the massive catalog of hit pieces like the bear line up.
text:I think at its best, RL pulls from all the great American heritage brands:   * Prep outdoors brands like Ll Bean or Woolrich * American Trad like Brooks Bros * Western brands like Pendleton or Levi’s   And finds a way to blend them and tweak them in such correct but interesting ways.   Ralph is the ultimate Americana guy, he just gets the genre. Very Ralph is a great doc too.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:Having gone through this transition, the main advice I would give you is to understand the categories and "slots" in your wardrobe before you shop for pieces, and if you have an item-type you like while you wish the piece were better in a particular way, upgrade that piece specifically, and take your time doing so.  For example: I learned I love well-fitted, thin turtlenecks with structured trousers and skirts, so now I feel secure shopping for high-end turtlenecks. But I also know I only have 4 "slots" in my closet for these - one black, one gray, one taupe/camel, one cream - so that's all I need, forever, and I can upgrade one piece at a time. I'm giving myself permission to wear the same things all the time, like a cartoon character, while I do so. :)	episode_done:True
text:What socks do you guys wear? and some advice on socks please?	labels:Darn Tough
text:would you say they are thick?  also, looking at the site i wanted to confirm. is it $16 per single pair???	labels:Yes, they are expensive socks, but if you're patient, you can find them on sale frequently throughout the year. Most of the time a sale happens, it's posted on r/frugalmalefashion   I will also mention the great return policy/customer service from Darn Tough. Had a couple of pairs (several years old) lose the elasticity around the ankle of my no-shows, and I filed a claim on their website, sent the socks in, and they sent back a $17 online voucher for the site. Highly recommended from me. I have ~9 pairs of DT, and they're my only brand of socks.
text:If you have an REI near you (or I guess maybe they do it online too, never bothered to check) they almost always seem to have some sort of "10% off when you buy 3 or more pairs of socks" deal or something similar going on (and if they don't and you're buying full-price socks, you'll get 10% back in your dividend if you're a member, just gotta wait for it)	labels:	episode_done:True

Left side is days, right side is plain lined paper.  Plus the cover is pink glitter and says Super Professional.	labels:Appointed Co. has planners like that!	episode_done:True
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:From 2001-2005, clothing I wore as a high schooler/college kid: low rise bootcut jeans, fitted graphic tshirts, fitted polo shirts, fitted shirts in general (shirts were so tight- maybe that’s why we layered??), always layering shirts- and shirts were super long and over your hips, but tight- never tucking them in, cutoff denim skirts, cotton shorts (like soffees) with words on the butt, necklace with my first initial on it, platform flip flops, dresses with Hawaiian prints (like flowers or surfers etc), hoop earrings, fitted hoodies. That’s what I can remember.

text:The Instagram Account Showing “Ivy’s” More Eclectic Side – Put This On	labels:It’s strange that in the US that the upper class conservative fashion trickled down whereas in Europe it seems to have gone the other way, in the UK upper class have dressed as hippies, mods, roadmen etc through the decades, originally working class fashions. Maybe it’s due to a more rigid class system (allegedly) in the UK.	episode_done:True

text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:Oh no. Until I was 24 I either wore jeans + sweatshirt or full business formal and nothing in between. I had like 6 JCrew pantsuits when I was 14 because I did extracurriculars like mock trial and speech. I sold or donated my suit separates, because I don’t work in an environment where most of them would be suitable (I used to be an accountant, now I’m a sommelier). I’ve never been consistent in wearing makeup but I stopped tweezing my eyebrows.   I have one pair of jeans now, since I prefer wilder colors and styles (I have a lot of very funky flare pants now). I guess it’s on-trend now but I don’t like it because it’s on trend. I have one scarf I bought when I was 16 that I am wearing right now and will wear for the rest of my life, and a ring I bought when I was 12, but I haven’t had any clothes for longer than 2 years.	episode_done:True

text:I feel this so hard!!!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:From a logical perspective, it makes a lot of sense and this system would work for most people. I think everyone naturally has a different idea of what "on par" means to them given their budget and taste and there's a saying that the value of a piece is what the buyer is willing to pay for it. Sometimes there will be those pieces that just speak to you regardless of the price and while those are a rarity, I would like to see that incorporated into this system. This is more true when you start going up the scale where fashion becomes more of an art form instead of "clothes". For me, I would pay $1000 for a Craig Green jacket because I love his work and it speaks to me on a deeper level like a '97 Honda NSX would; to me the experience is worth the money. While the numbers are important, to match your golf analogy, it's still a game to have fun.
text:Absolutely. But I also find it helpful in those contexts with beautiful pieces. So, if I tell myself, yeah, $400 for a piece of outerwear with features a, b, c is fair, but this $600 piece really speaks to me, I might go for it, but if it's $1800, fuck that, I could probably just get it made, or get something else that speaks to me just as much for cheaper.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Winston & Co. Shawl Collar Cardigan Review (But mostly preamble)	labels:thanks for this review. I love shawl collar cardigans but i'm very sensitive to itchy wool, which makes it very difficult to find them. would you happen to know of any decent/higher end ones constructed in alternative materials?
text:I think the most obvious alternative - albeit $$$ - would be cashmere. There's quite a few options that have the same basic rib design as OP's wool version. I think the challenge with cashmere is that if what you want is a super-chunky look, your options become more limited since cashmere tends to be finer and thus the sweaters don't always have the same heft. That said, if you're willing to invest in a 4-ply or higher cashmere SCC, you might be able to attain that nice chunky look.   Personally, when I'm working from home, I have a knockabout 2-ply cashmere SCC that I'll wear when I just want a warm layer; it's really nothing special and doesn't look anywhere as substantial as my Northern Watters-made lambswool SCC but it's kind of perfect for a home sweater.   The other common option would be cotton or linen or blends of both but then you lose out on warmth/insulation. That said, I had a cotton SCC for years that was a go-to "lemme just throw on a layer" option in temperate months.   Do you have the same reaction to merino?	labels:	episode_done:True

Rather, I have a kind of "capsule" mindset for my wardrobe: not too many statement pieces, and everything in my color palette (black, grey, Ivory, Navy, taupe, blush). I honestly haven't had to think about an outfit in years (outside of accounting for the weather). I can pick up practically any blouse, trousers, jacket, and accessory and they are almost guaranteed to match. I do find myself gravitating to layers (sweater over a blouse, cardigan over a top, etc) but I'm not too specific about it and I usually just choose whatever sounds most comfortable.  It works so well that I started doing this with lingerie too -only buying my lingerie in black, blush, or nude. Now my underwear always matches and it gives me the strength of ten men.	episode_done:True

text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Maybe for starters not listen to what your mom has to say. I was a tomboy and got girlie in a second when my first skirt turned out pretty. Mom told me I had scrawny legs which was exactly not a nice thing to say at the time. She also made me wear pantyhose with my skirts AND made me pay for them out of my allowance which was a huge bummer because I loved music and had a hard time buying albums as it was.

text:What can I wear when I have a medical issue that makes my waistline change a lot?	labels:Perhaps you can hem your clothes with iron on hemming.  usually at supermarkets, some mothers use it for kids school uniforms. Very easy to use but try it on a piece of old fabric first so you're confident in hemming your own pants. If you launder them carefully it will last a while maybe even q couple years.	episode_done:True
text:When is a garment worth it to you?	labels:I have a high bar now. If I am wearing it for work I have a more perfunctory response, although I still put thought into it. My high bar is basically, “am I excited at the idea of wearing this”. I used to be way too swayed by whims.	episode_done:True
text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:A well fitted black wool coat in a cut that flatters you. It goes with any outfit.

I love it because it’s a pretty tiny bag— perfect for me since I don’t need to carry any makeup around because I don’t wear it! I couldn’t focus at work with all that cake on my face, I don’t know how those other girls do it. they probably aren’t hitting their performance targets like I am!

text:Discussion: what does your shopping process look like?	labels:1. Decide I really needs to replace a favorite in my wardrobe, something normal, like a short sleeved knit t-shirt, or a ribbed long-sleeved t-shirt with scoop neck. 2. Try to search online.  3. Realize most online stores have horrible search features. 4. Find nothing that matches, and age over how a store with 20 000 t-shirts doesn't even have a good ribbed one. 5. Get's distracted by a metallic knit and buys that instead because I'm a magpie. 6. Keeps wearing the worn out stuff I needed to replace.	episode_done:True
text:What high quality fashion or style related hashtags do you follow on IG?	labels:One that I like is #averagegirlsize to keep my Instagram feed somewhat grounded to reality. It’s cool to see how ‘normal’ girls dress!  Not sure if this one fits the bill, but I find some of my favorite brand or designer tags quite helpful to figure out more ways to wear clothes that I may already have, or am thinking about getting from them. My favorite is #zimmerman.
text:I'm a little wary of using the terms "real" and "normal" to refer to women's bodies. All bodies are normal and real, they just range in size. No one size is more "real" than another. I mean if your point is showcasing actual untouched photos vs. photoshopped images I get it though.	labels:That’s a fair point and of course all human models are real people :). I didn’t mean to imply otherwise.  I picked ‘normal’ to differentiate from all the instagram models and fashion models I follow on Instagram. Not that they’re abnormal, but they do have body measurements that are out of the norm statistically. I once read some data that said typical model measurements can only be found in <0.1% of the population.  Secondly, as you mentioned, there’s the other factor of airbrushing, perfect/professional posing, light etc. that is also special to typical Instagram models.
text:Yeah the whole photoshopped instagram model body thing skeeves me out. Most of those women don't even look like that in real life and I really don't get it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:I wash underwear, socks, masks, leggings, and tank tops (I wear one under most outfits for smoothness/sweat!) after each wear. Outer layers like sweaters, hoodies, etc after three or four wears. Jeans after four or more wears— can usually tell by how they feel and fit that they’re ready for a wash.  Bralettes when they start to smell!
text:How do you separate your laundry? I’ve been separating it by “type” but everyone I know does it by color.

text:Discussion: Clay Jewelry?	labels:I love polymer clay earrings (at least those made by the more skilled makers). The look is exactly the aesthetic I go for, and after years of feeling very meh about various precious metal jewelry, it was a relief to finally find this style. What kind of bugs me is that occasionally I've had pairs fall apart on me, whether the clay itself or the hot glue holding the studs on. I guess quality just varies dramatically from person to person, and it's tough to tell since we're buying from individuals selling their own creations on Etsy (and I want to support them in the end, so it's not really a big deal).	episode_done:True

I may end up wearing some of the sparkly stuff for NYE in our house with the roommates haha. I did finally find a perfect Free People yellow floral wrap dress that is too airy for winter, but will be in regular rotation as soon as its warm enough.

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.
text:Evidently, I present as “an upper middle class lesbian” (quote stolen from a FFAer). I’m not but whatever. Assume away. Clothing style is a combo of conservative/traditional New England/androgynous except for shoes ;-)  Pros: Was never sexually harassed at work. Also, lesbians were treated very well *in my division* of the aerospace corporation I worked at (more than a few in mgmt). Suspect there was some “honorary man” caca going on but it certainly benefited other women that did not behave/present traditionally.   Cons: None that I noticed but I’m pretty clueless. Took me until my late 40s to figure out I present this way.  ETA - I have discovered that now that I’m technically “old” dressing better is to my advantage. See invisibility & condescension.	labels:It’s so interesting because my workplace attire/lounge attire is very very “gay” reading. I wear hella blazers ar work and when I’m not there, it’s joggers, flannels, bun in a slick top knot. But the other half of my closet is girly ass dresses. Peak bisexual confusion I guess.	episode_done:True

text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:I haven’t worn a bra in months and I love it. I’m a 38D and even if I have no problem wearing a bra, I chose not to in my everyday attire now because it’s more freeing and comfortable for me. If men can go out and not wear undershirts/go shirtless I public, I should be able to not wear a bra and not be criticized. I’ve been out and sometimes my nipples show but who tf cares?

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "A Primer on Materials"	labels:Hum it’s definitely an interesting read. I guess nowadays there is more emphasis on ethics and environmental cost when we choose our fabrics, so that would be an interesting add. For example cotton being so much more water hungry than hemp and linen. I was a bit thrown back by the thinsulate entry. Having spent a few years I outdoor retail, I do not really think of it as a textile, more of a insulation, and it’s certainly not the only synthetic insulation or trademark of the sort available.  Edited to add: I re-read my comment and realised it seemed a bit negative overall which is not the vibe I was going for. I think it’s tremendous work and already really helpful, so kudos to the person who wrote it in the first place :)

text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:One thing you could do in search of your "real tastes" is to make a Pinterest board (or equivalent) of pictures you find beautiful and evocative - pictures that do NOT include clothing. If you think about style in terms of anything else - home decor, for instance - don't include that either. Think pictures of landscapes, animals, buildings, even abstract art. It sounds crazy but it really works - patterns will emerge. For instance, my board includes things like white billowy curtains, pink clouds, sea glass, foggy beach pictures. There's a general mood that I can't really describe or quantify through more defined "style groups" like goth, boho, romantic, etc. It's just what I find beautiful.   From there, find parallels to clothing. White billowy curtains -> white billowy blouses. Pink clouds -> pink fluffy sweaters. Sea glass -> sea glass jewelry! Foggy beach pictures -> muted colors, soft textures. If you are more artistic you might not even want to create clear-cut parallels but would prefer to think in "moods," whether a certain piece of clothing evokes the same mood as your board. That works too.  I get that how you want to be perceived is part of you too, but I still think it's useful to understand your more fundamental aesthetic preferences. Personally, I feel like after spending awhile in the world of style bloggers, youtubers, etc. it's easy to appreciate a huge variety of styles or to like certain things only because of exposure. It makes it hard to hone down what exactly you want from your own look. For ME, moving outside the world of clothing seems to do the trick.	episode_done:True

text:Knit Tie Inspo / Lookbook	labels:I picked up a black knit tie and a navy knit tie at the same time. While for normal woven ties, I'd usually reach for a navy over a black, with the texture of a silk knit, somehow the black knit tie just looks better than the navy knit in so many outfits.   This might be a function of bias because I've read articles extolling the virtues of the black knit tie, but I think the texture of the knit helps to offset the starkness of the colour

text:What’s the comfiest material you can put in a washing machine without fuss?	labels:Columbia makes super soft and cozy 100% cotton knit sweaters that are machine-washable.   I actually find my merino sweaters faster to hand wash. I use Eucalan, which doesn’t require rinsing. Soak them in the sink with Eucalan for a half hour, wring out, roll in a towel to take downstairs to the drying rack, dry flat. It takes the same amount of time as finding the mesh delicates bags, washing on delicate, being nervous that I’ve ruined them, and drying flat.	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:Took me a while to appreciate that loose != ill fitting and form fitting != well fitting. For example, that jacket accentuates the model's waist, is a good length in the arms, flatters their neck, and has a lot of interesting structural details and textures. The idea for me isn't baggy for bagginess sake, but usually some interesting structure or contrast in tandem with a more fitted piece or the natural outline of my body.	episode_done:True

text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:Logos are *trademarked. Clothing designs are... a more grey area. Like, a v neck knit sweater can only be designed so many ways, you know? However there are some instances where parts of a design are copyrighted, like i think the red soles on Loubitons, which i cannot spell, are copyrighted/trademark. Prints and artwork are a whole other story.  There are a lot of factors and copyright and intellectual property law also differs from country to country - there is no international copyright law, just general agreements between specific countries.  I personally feel that knockoffs and replicas are different. Replicas are illegal as they are faking an item AND copying the logo. Knockoffs that just copy the design... not illegal, generally speaking. Ethical? Truly depends on the situation.  In your specific examples, yeah theyre probably inspired by Sezane but tbh theyre not really dupes, there are clear design differences in each example.
text:I've watched a video on this and I think you're right.  Also, I think the argument is that a knock-off is not going to steal market share from the original. Those who want to and can afford a high end designer brand aren't going to buy a knock-off and those who do probably can't afford the original.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:I have a diploma in fashion design and worked in the industry off and on for 15 years, and have been a hobby knitter for about 20 years, I would say creating something that looks store bought takes far fewer hours of practice, and there's far less to know with knitting.  Knitting is just so much more rudimentary.  Once you learn the basic stitches and get a decent tension, you are pretty much on your way, if you are patient and can follow basic instructions like a recipe, you'll make something good.  Be thorough, swatch and block, and buy good yarn.  I think one if the biggest issues I see with home sewists is incorrect fabric choice, it makes a very big difference in a finished product, and is usually my first tip that something is homemade.  Notions are another big one, good quality, professional looking notions are a lot harder to find in retail stores.  Stitch choices, stitch quality, proper cutting, finishing methods are also all big giveaways that make stuff look unprofessional, and unless you have industrial machines and tools, some of that is out of your control.  But with enough practice you can get some pretty decent homemade products in a lot of clothing categories.  Stuff like jeans, leather, fur, swimwear, I think are always best left to professionals with specialized tools.  Reading up on fabrics and practicing high end finishing techniques is a good start.	episode_done:True
text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:A huge chunk of my wardrobe is built out from Amazon. I add everything to a list, and wait until Amazon's algorithms decide they need to sell it for $6. They also offer Tall sizes on quite a lot of items, which is great for having sleeves that fit.  Uniqlo for jeans, Amazon's Peak Velocity brand for Tshirts, and Goodthreads for everything else is what I would do if I had to start from Scratch.  If there's a certain type of item your looking for, feel free to ask for recommendations and I can send you a link to what I'd look at.

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:Poshmark filters suck, but the fact that you can ask the seller for more details and they can offer you discounts means that you can find great things!  I find that if I like something, about 30% of the time the seller will offer me a discount right away, so start going crazy on the likes if you are ready to purchase something.  I always sort by new so you get first pick of the best stuff.    I search for specific fabrics, but this doesn't work perfectly on Poshmark.  I love linen, so I often just type "linen" into the search bar and see what I find.  The problem is that Poshmark doesn't have a fabric filter, so "linen-looking" items will end up in there, and sellers that don't list fabric won't show up there.  But I've found awesome pieces this way!  "My size" straight up doesn't work for me.  It's annoying, but I always manually pick my size once I get to a category.	episode_done:True

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:Hi! As a stylist I get this question ALOT. For starters don't get rid of too much before buying replacements. What ends up happening is we get rid of everything without establishing what pieces we actually need.   Start with establishing your personal style. What do your want your closet/style to be? What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping! Now that you have a moodboard and list of things you need you can shop to fin in the gaps and more importantly you can shop with intention!   &#x200B;  I hope that wasn't too much and was helpful haha. I'm always happy to help.
text:That's actually really helpful! How do you suggest finding my style? I feel like I have such a wide style that I wear (minimal, to punk, to cutesy, etc). I feel like I love all of my clothes but some go months without being worn.	labels:Why exactly are you aiming for minimalism? Minimalism isn't a virtue and it's only valuable in so much as it matches your lifestyle, needs, and desires. You don't have to aim for minimalism for the sake of minimalism, or just because it’s in style. It's ok to own things that make you happy. It's ok to only wear something once every couple of months (or less often). You don't have to get rid of things just because you are not living up to some arbitrary standard of use.
text:I just feel like I have too many clothes, and it has lead to a pretty bad laundry habit because I know I have more to wear. I'm not trying to be 100% minimalistic just trying to lower the amount of clothes I have. I'm not one to shop very often so it's not a shopping habit but I have a hard time getting rid of clothes. I know it's not wrong to have a big closet, I just want to have less. I enjoy donating clothes that I no longer have purpose for but I somehow still have a hard time getting rid of things. I haven't really thought of how it's okay to not wear everything ALL the time.	labels:	episode_done:True

I already have the outfit, but I'm on a weight loss journey (steady throughout the past two months, 5 lbs left to lose) and I need to lose 3 lbs for the skirt not to look awkward with my slight tummy bulge when I'm eating huge meals.  I do, however, wear a lot of interesting clothes just for when I'm out shopping or even having to go to the doctor. I'm doing a lot of experimentation with style now that no people of any importance to me whatsoever are gonna see me, and I can try out shoes with different heels and clothes with different fit, wear it throughout the day, and then know if it works for my lifestyle or not. I realized that a glitter top is see-through in some kinds of lighting, and that the cleavage on my wrap top is getting looser throughout the day, revealing more than I would like, etc. Also buying heel buffers for shoes I have never worn because they give me blisters, and wearing new leather shoes around the house to break them in, etc.	episode_done:True

text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:This absolutely depends on occasion. Where are you going to wear the stuff you want to curate? School/ uni? Office job? Partying? Hiking? I suggest you figure out your colors, needed occasions and a rough direction of style and look for capsule + whatever tags suit you.   If you have an idea of favourite pieces that look well on your frame you can try to look up those and build different outfits around them.  Just take it slow, and when adding new pieces make a rule that it has to go with a certain amount of pieces you already own or plan to get soon.   Last advice, depending on your funds (or people who want to give you a present) do a professional color and style consulting; your body type won‘t change too soon, your colors never will, so this is a great investment.	episode_done:True

text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:If you aren't married to the idea of capsules:  Buy seasonally appropriate basics and rent fancier work clothing or special occasion garments from Rent the Runway (or another rental brand). It's a good way to take your time with building a wardrobe you like while trying out trends you may be curious about but hesitant to pull the trigger on. It's worth noting that your wardrobe is never really done. Things get worn out, fall out of favor, stop fitting your lifestyle, or you just stop liking them. I think if you have a solid foundation (jeans, slacks, a few blouses, sweaters, t-shirts, undergarments, a few pairs of black and brown shoes) you can find flexibility with styling beyond that without feeling that you have not enough clothing or a million things and nothing to wear.	episode_done:True

text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:I love this! Personally, I love to dress *majority* of the time in what I would have to call, “neutral academia” which is edging closer to, “dark academia” but with softer neutrals and occasional splashes of pink. This tends to be seen as professional, so it’s my work go-to. The closest reference I have is from the Chinese drama Meteor Garden, the newer one (2018?), I was amazed to see the Hua Ze Lei and I dress almost identical. A lot of that style section of my wardrobe is from Abercrombie, Little Lace, Reformation, and Nordstrom.   On the days I’m feeling playful, I dress more, “girly grunge” where I mix distressed jeans, with baby tees or crop tops and layer on a sweater or open cardigan. That section of my wardrobe is typically from Tilly’s, WildFox, Free People, Patagonia, or PacSun.   The days I feel moody/sexy remind me of the edgy part of your posts. I don’t wear black often so when I do I’m sultry about it. I love wearing Doc Martens or Paladins with distressed black skinny jeans and mesh tops, or a edgy graphic tee/sweater, or I wear fitted black dresses with any combination of shoes. I’m also really into wearing lingerie bodysuits with outfits—it’s feminine in the bedroom but reads as edgy once you step outside your house. That section of my wardrobe is typically from Ruckus, Dolls Kill, Gooseberry, Intimissimi, or Nasty Gal.   I incorporate hard details with accessories. A soft outfit can be topped off with a dark brown or black wool hat. I’m always wearing my All Saints goat head necklace, shortened to be almost a choker, and when I eventually replace that I’ll be looking on Etsy for a new one. It’s so dainty that it looks sweet until you *really* look. I also tend to carry a black purse no matter what the outfit. Plaid, gingham, and houndstooth also feel (to me) to work well together when making an edgy/soft combination look.   Such a great post, and good luck cultivating your dream wardrobe; you’re going to look amazing!	episode_done:True

text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I think they’re like jewelry accessories. They range from wild to professional. If you style a very plain item in a wild way, it’s no longer a plain item. Like hair colored bobby pins used to sculpt your hair into a helicopter. I think scrunchies can be great with a sleek bun or a lovely scarf as a head wrap and still look professional.

text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:I suggest organizing and developing categories based on how you work through creating an outfit. Do you need to see items to choose them? If yes, maybe focus on hanging the items you need to see. When you go to pick out a top, how do you decided what you are looking for? Is it color, sleeve length, pattern? Do you mentally group crop tops in the same category as other shirts, or do you specifically look for crop tops? Have you designated some items as work clothes or more formal clothes vs casual? Group your clothing in the categories you put thing into in your head, even if they wouldn't make sense to others (it's your closet after all).     For example, when I'm picking out shirts think about sleeve length and pattern, and I need to see and feel the shirt to make a final decision on what to wear. For what ever reason, sorting by color isnt as big of a priority, but whether I want to wear stripes, plaid, floral, or solid is. So my shirts are hung, divided by sleeve length, then arranged by pattern (like patterns together). I also have separated out my formal clothes and my gold clothes, as those are only used at specific times and dont need to be visually cluttering my daily wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 27, 2020	labels:Hot take: speaking from experience, fetishistically optimizing the most basic of basics (e.g. "the best plain white t-shirt") for maximum imagined value is not a meaningful nor worthwhile exercise. Your wardrobe is not more interesting because your white tee is better than another white tee, and by the time you've found the 'perfect' piece either the prevailing trend or your own preferences will probably have changed.  'Perfect tee' threads are usually highly-upvoted, but the answers have drawn from the same pool for the last goddamn decade:  - *Vintage/workwear (generally heavier, boxier, shorter):* 3sixteen, Buzz Rickson's, Lady White Co. - *Streetwear (generally lighter, slimmer, longer):* Reigning Champ, wings + horns, John Elliott - *"Normal" (somewhere in the middle)*: Naked & Famous, Arket, American Apparel when they still existed - *Edgy goth shit:* Rick Owens mainline for lighter and DRKSHDW for heavier, Kazuyuki Kumagai Attachment, Voidthebrand when they still existed - *Budget*: Muji, Uniqlo, Everlane, Bella+Canvas, etc., but no one really cares  It's functionally a solved question. You can pick one from the applicable list for your style, and it'll be *fine.*

text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:I buy a lot of my stuff on Depop or Etsy. I've found that the easiest way to do it is know what you want and have a lot of strict rules for yourself. If you're just looking to browse and buy whatever catches your eye like you would in a store, it's gonna be harder. So recently I've been buying a lot of jumpers. These are my rules:  * no fast fashion brands * under £20 * must be "buy it now" because I can't be bothered with auctions * must be at least 50% wool * must show a photo of the label stating the materials used * body of the jumper must be at least the same length as the sleeves because I don't want a cropped jumper * must have a picture of the front and back of the jumper * Nothing that has a brand name or logo outwardly visible  so my search terms are things like "wool jumper size S" "vintage wool jumper" "Ralph Lauren wool jumper" etc. which narrows it down massively from just searching "jumper".  Then I filter by "used" and "buy it now" (on Ebay)  Sometimes I then sort by Price - Low to High, sometimes I don't bother.   Then because of my rules, I know quickly wether something meets my criteria, so I'll open like 20 tabs that meet the criteria without looking closely at them.   When I've got about 20 open, I'll actually go through them and decide if I like / want any of them.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: What are the different use cases of boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes, and loafers?	labels:Bear in mind I'm a traditionalist but boat shoes should only be worn near water. Moccasins are predominately house slippers (unless they have a more constructed sole in which case they're sort of loafers anyway). Driving shoes are the most casual genre of loafer (excluding sneaker/loafer hybrid stuff). Loafers is a super general term for the whole range of slip on leather/suede shoes.	episode_done:True

If you really want to do this and are comfortable with it then by all means go ahead. But from my own experience I did this, and actually did it fairly well after many years, but at the end of the day it stood out too much in real everyday life in a normal town, regardless of how nice the outfit was, and it definitely hurt my social reputation a lot. After toning it down a bit I immediately noticed a difference in how much more positively I was treated by people. You can still dress well, but remember context is key.

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.
text:This is a Good Comment.  Especially the part about reacting to the model's body and styling as well as the items of clothing. And man, it can be real tough to come to terms with that sometimes. Having a cohesive style certainly helps with the styling aspect in these situations, but the part about the body is rife with stress and emotion for a lot of people. There's no one right way to deal with that. Everyone just needs to find the line between what they like and what they actually want.	labels:	episode_done:True

The fact that you have looked at the high end, well known brands and came away disappointed indicates that (this season at least), they aren't for you.   To answer your question directly: for me, personally, showing my own style is 1000% more important than showing the status of a luxury brand. Do the two sometimes overlap? Yes, and that's fine. But I don't personally get buying something *just* because it is a certain brand. Who are you trying to impress? What are you conveying with that logo (wow, you're well off? What kind of message is that, on its own?) I just feel like people who are super into labels, not the design or the style or anything else, just come across as kind of immature? The truth is, anyone worth spending much time with isn't overly concerned with what logo your bag has. (Now! I will concede there is a difference between showing off luxury brands and having higher end items, in some circles. Like, there could be some tension if you're hanging out with super millionaire socialites and everything you wear is from TJ Maxx...but in that case, I'd still say its important to focus on personal style first. And knowing about smaller higher end designers, rather than designers you can buy at a mall, is a whole different thing too...)
text:I’ve actually thought a lot about who I’m trying to impress with the logo and the short answer is, I don’t really know. None of my main circle would care either way. The longer answer is I think I’m really trying to impress myself. Maybe show to myself that I’m successful and can afford it? Show myself I worked hard for it and was able to attain it because I wanted it? I don’t know it’s a tough question which is why I struggle on if the bag is worth the cost even if I can afford it.	labels:The best part of being able to afford something is that you can also afford to not buy it and just wait until you fall in love with a bag.	episode_done:True

They vetoed me posting pictures (we have public facing jobs, these pictures are all over social media, too easy to reverse image search etc.), but they wore a Rick Owens dress (that I picked out) while I went full minimalism with a collarless shirt with onyx studs, a sleek blazer and cropped trousers. I put this together from my existing wardrobe, since we didn't want to spend a lot. Covid measures made things a bit weird, but the court officer made a real effort into making it nice, which was great. (edit: just so nobody thinks we are totally irresponsible: it was literally just us at city hall, no guests, no party. We'll catch up with that after vaccination.)  It was fun seeing all y'all Americans count down to my wedding day.

text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Your post really resonated with me. First and foremost, hats off to you, for real. I definitely would not consider a no-buy during 2020 easy, at ALL. Yes maybe on a superficial level it would seem so since we are all just sitting around in onesies watching Netflix, but shopping - especially for new clothes - is an extremely effective way to self-soothe and lord knows we have needed a lot of that in 2020.   I personally broke up with fast fashion in 2019 during my second pregnancy (which really was easy in a way, because I didn’t actually fit into anything so it was difficult to justify purchasing new clothing). I’ve had a few weak moments but have discovered sewing/dressmaking. It is really exciting in its own right because, as you said, I actually have a personal style and a lot of my dream pieces are actually super attainable. It also just feels so good to finally be outside of the hamster wheel of endless trends, sales, promotions, influencers, newsletters, marketing and whatever else have you. Good luck in 2021!	episode_done:True
text:What are your most loved ride-or-die winter clothing items?	labels:A parka I got from Target last year. It wasn't even $50, and it's the *warmest* jacket I've ever had in my life. I live in the northeast, where the snow and wind can be brutal, and I was used to spending upwards of $150 on coats that didn't even do anything.  I'm in the process of losing weight, so I figured spending $50 on a winter coat I would wear for maybe two seasons wasn't bad at all. Cue my surprise when I spent a weekend in the Adirondacks last November, where everybody else around me was freezing, and I'm snug as a bug in my cheap Target winter jacket!  I'm hoping come next winter, it'll still fit well enough to be warm, because it's honestly my favorite winter clothing purchase I've ever made.

text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:My Mum saved some of her clothing for me. I really cherish the pieces she gave me. My favourite is a black velvet dress she wore a lot in her mid twenties. She also saved some of my nicest baby clothes, so I could use them with my future daughters.  Almost all the items that she saved were high quality velvet, lace and silk. They also were in solid colors.   In most instances it was items she didn't fit in anymore but had an emotional attachment to, so they stayed in the back of her closet until I hit my late teens. She made most of the items, a couple were purchased, and some were made for her. Since she has a talent for sewing and repair, all the items were kept in top condition. She didn't give me all the pieces at once. She would offer to lend me a dress for an event, and I'd try it on. Then she would tell me the story behind it, and say it was mine if I wanted it.   I have wool coats and leather jackets that I'm using currently, but will put away for future generations when they don't fit anymore or I change up my style. After an unfortunate pen in the laundry mishap I've also considered purchasing doubles of items I really enjoy. If something happens I'll have a spare. If nothing does I'll have a vintage-with-tags gift for future children ☺️ purchasing items specifically for future generations seems a bit high pressure though..  My Mum also saved shoes and boots for me but our shoe size is different so that didn't work out unfortunately.   My husband (at 30yo) is saving some clothes he felt he had grown out of for any future sons we may have. It's stored in the attic.   Solid pieces in quality materials that are cared for and stored properly are likely to be received well. I'm thankful my Mum saved her best clothing over the years for me. Obviously saving every ragged Walmart t shirt is going to become a case of hoarding like other posters mentioned. But if it's a reasonable amount of high quality pieces and you have storage space then why not? It's family heirlooms and history.	episode_done:True

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:Work in fashion so hopefully can give some insight,   First thing to say is that some people do wear full runway looks on the daily, many many Comme Des garçons fans who wear increasingly full looks daily, crazy suits and dresses, pieces that don’t even look wearable. Although it is a small portion of people, it does happen (even see it now and again around london)   For the top conceptual brands (again I’ll take comme as an example) a fashion week show is as a form of expression, to present your concept in its fullest form - an art piece. This will then be watered down and made more commercial and sold, some brands sell their exact runway looks, some make it more commercial  It’s also important to add, what you see in this group is a small “subculture”, in other groups in in, most people do wear runway clothes daily, and even full looks daily, just depends what your seeing on your feed	episode_done:True

text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:This guide is actually really comprehensive and goes into the finer details. I think it’s easy to be like “just look at the basic bastard and go from there” and even some of the guides on the sidebar aren’t that great or informative. Developing a style takes time, takes years and a lot of mistakes in choices. Still I think taking a moment outwardly and asking “what do I want my style to be” and using the questions really would have had me avoid some of the mistakes I made and maybe sped me up to where I am now
text:Absolutely agree. Learning the technicalities behind stuff is great and all, but you really need to hash out your own taste otherwise that stuff is useless. I think having a style journal where you reflect and elaborate more is great. What kind of style, shape, fabrics, colors, patterns, etc are all questions you need to answer to develop better style. Having a journal or way to reflect on prompts gives you not only a think tank for you aesthetic but it also can inform how you purchase and style things. Lots of beginners just have no idea how to start developing, I certainly didn’t.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Can You Wear a T-Shirt Under a Blazer and Not Look Like an 1980s Leftover?	labels:It's got to be a very casual jacket, with a tee that does not look like underwear. Way back when a suit or jacket is part of normal daily wear, people wear them over anything- think tweed work jackets over thick crew neck sweaters, with or without neckerchief. Tailoring used to be much more free-form compared to the generally more prescriptive "worsted-wool sharp businessman look" nowadays. Crew neck sweaters are basically the OG t-shirts, and easier to wear on its own since plain t-shirts were originally underwear and not meant to be seen.	episode_done:True

If we were talking about a group of exclusively Han Chinese people or something, I’d agree with you that BIPOC might not be the right term. But Asians aren’t a monolith and neither are the people who live in Asia.  The OP was clear that the clothes in this album are inspired by Asian culture and the models do skew heavily towards the typical E/SE Asian, but OP said the brands are mostly BIPOC-owned and I think that’s a fair statement to make when we don’t know the background of each brand’s owner. Particularly when one of the brands included in the album is owned by a woman of Nigerian descent living in Singapore.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:I associate Gen Z fashion with crop tops and sweatpants, so yeah it makes sense that people in their 30's buying expensive ethical clothes aren't going for the sporty spice look.
text:Totally.  To me, Gen Z is a lot of clothing that isn’t work appropriate but super fun. A lot of crop tops, bra tops, spaghetti straps, usually some tummy showing, and then some baggy pants. Lots of thrifting and also cheap fast fashion. Doc Martens and other platform shoes. Very 90s/early 2000s. Long acrylic nails, false lashes. Really fun and can be a really “hot but trashy” style   Millennial fashion is more professional/better quality/structured. Linens, trousers, heels, sandals, etc. Frankly I think it has to do with millennials having more money. Low key hair, nails and makeup. Neutral colours and patterns. It’s a more mature style   I’m 25 so I get to do both 😎 woohoo	labels:I think Gen Z doesn't believe in "trashy" as much as other generations did.	episode_done:True

A lot of companies that use these alternative materials are considered "premium" brands and carry their price tags accordingly.

text:Drake's Collection One, 2021 Lookbook	labels:Love Drake's style, but it's so expensive. Any more affordable alternatives (preferably european)?
text:Yes! It takes a bit of work but you can definitely replicate Drake’s styling for much cheaper.   A lot of the value of Drake’s is in their styling, and a lot of what they sell is basics. Some of their clothes are literally just marked up pieces manufactured by other brands - their suede crepe sole shoes are Astorflex, for example. A lot of it is also basics, and you can find a lot of similar stuff at other brands for much cheaper. For example, kamakura has great slim fit oxford cloth shirts with a substantial collar for a fraction of the price of Drake’s. You can find slim fit high rise jeans for much less than they charge at lots of brands nowadays.   It takes a bit of sleuthing but I’ve been able to replicate the “drake’s look” much more cheaply. For example, I really liked their crepe soled suede shoes, so I bought a pair of astorflex chukkas for $40 on eBay. I liked their corduroy chore coat so I bought a j crew one for $100. I have brushed shetlands from other brands - also made in Scotland, but a lot cheaper. The main thing that’s tough to replicate is their ties and scarves, IMO. Even that, you might have luck with some clever searches on eBay.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:I don't think there's anything wrong with preferring dresses and leggings and it doesn't inherently signify that you are somehow unworthy for pants or "letting yourself go".   The thing is, historically speaking, dresses were actually far more practical for a woman's body due the cyclical changes we all experience, from menstrual bloating/cramping, to minor weight fluctuations, to pregnancy and breastfeeding (historically there wasn't much choice about the last two but obviously now there is), cuz you could cinch up or let out your dress depending on how you were doing.   It's only now that stretchy fabric is truly mainstream that pants have truly become as practical and cost effective in that they can tolerate a lot more cyclical size changes, which are *normal*.  Edit: not to mention all the times people would gain and lose weight due to the availability of food.   I'd say I have a pretty confident mindset and 90% of my non work wardrobe is dresses and skirts/shirt combos. I wear undersummers in the spring and summer, leggings and sweater tights in the winter and I've gotten SO MUCH MORE USE out of my dresses... They lasted me up until my 8th month of pregnancy, I barely had to buy maternity clothes.  I have been able to wear the same knit dress/leggings combo at 180lbs prepregnancy and later at 210 lbs post partum and still look cute.  What pair of pants could pull that off? Almost none, I tell you.  Saved me a lot of $$$.   No matter what I weigh, I always have a bit of a belly, so most pants dig into that anyways, which isn't comfortable. Only truly high waisted stuff feels ok, but I don't want to wear that in the summer.   It sounds like disordered thinking is creeping up on you, and you may have to consciously remind yourself that there's nothing wrong with enjoying comfy clothes that don't restrict your abdomen.

text:"Can people just hate fashion again" - Synecdoche When Talking about the "Industry" Discussion	labels:> Should spaces & industries for fashion lovers, clothes lovers, and people that have to wear clothes be completely separate?  I don’t think that any of these groups should be completely separate however I do find them all being lumped into the same spaces very frustrating as someone who does love fashion as a form of art and creativity.  I like harsh and blunt constructive criticism in pretty much all areas of life and I most certainly want it for my outfits as well. I want to hear what other fashion lovers and artists think of my colour choices, proportions, textures, fit, etc. and be able to refine those things and really flex my creative muscles when creating an outfit. Instead, many fashion spaces are dominated by ‘you do you hun!’ and ‘so long as you like it, that’s all that matters!’ which is great for someone *who has to wear clothes* and doesn’t actually care about fashion but joins fashion spaces because they feel some obligation as a woman to care about it but... those spaces just become unhelpful and bland for those who really love fashion and want to get better at it.  I’ve been an off and on follower of FFA for a few years and I feel like it’s definitely dominated by the “people who wear clothes” group and unfortunately it limits the amount of critique that is acceptable to give.

I agree, I think this sub is made up of people who enjoy looking at clothes or just want to know how to dress appropriately for work & school. There's a few subjects *related* to the industry as a whole that people are passionate about, like sustainability & ethics, but I don't think this sub is able to appreciate fashion as a form of art.   I agree that a *you do you* isn't very helpful. If someone specifically asks for constructive criticism, they want feedback from people with an eye for detail. If it looks like their blazer or pants need to be tailored a bit, then let them know if they're seeking constructive criticism.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:>	This system seems okay to me, but I don't really know how to differentiate each category based on function. For example, with the system I work with now, button-downs I wear in formal situations are currently grouped with tops I wear in informal situations AND workout-tops I wear for exercising. And this stresses me out so, so much. Then there's the issue of how effective my groupings are; like, should crop tops be with tank tops? Or maybe they're more like tees? And how do I deal with seasonal clothes?   You’re way overthinking it. You don’t have to be so strict about the categories or follow a plan to a T. Do what feels natural/right to you. If it doesn’t end up working, change it. It’s not set in stone.   1.	How do you mentally construct an outfit?  I would use those groupings because that’s what you already gravitate to. I personally sort by general type, then seasonality or formality. For example, my dresses/pants are split into formal (eg cocktail dress and up) and everything else. Within those subgroups, I sort by color.  Skirts are only sorted by color. Tops are split into sleeveless/short sleeved/long sleeved (3/4 sleeves go here), and those groups are subsorted by color.  Workout/swimwear/PJs/sweaters/underwear/socks/leggings/bras are their own categories that get dedicated drawer sections for their specific groups.  2.	Crop tops would be sorted by sleeves with other tops.  3.	worn but not dirty clothes go on a purposely dedicated row of hooks the wall (basically a fancy coat hook array that you might see in an entryway).  I’ve done this since I was a child and recommend.	episode_done:True

I’m always curious to see how it would look with business casual and business formal wear, without being over the top.

There was one stylish black man who would wear diamond studs with suits but that’s about it.  Curious if anyone has examples of subtle jewelry with suits and business casual outfits.
text:During the height of #menswear people were copying many of the Italians and wearing multiple beaded and/or leather bracelets which are a bit more lowkey since they don’t shine like metal. A single signet ring on the pinky probably wouldn’t draw that much attention given the old-school tradition of it. And if you’ll allow me to plug myself a little bit, some of my waywt posts have me wearing some rings and bracelets even with my tailoring, though it may not be super visible. Metal jewellery primarily has the intent of being seen though, so you will be making a statement by combining it with tailoring.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:I’m using swopped (UK version of Swap Society) and it’s good if you can’t sell your clothing or you don’t want to donate to charity (as it may end up in land fill). The items you send in gets assessed to see whether it’s in fit condition to swap. I’ve tried to do direct swapping on Depop but it’s hard to just find people who have similar tastes to your style or just the imbalance value of clothing offered. It’s a great way to get new clothes if you don’t want to spend money neither.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have “irony pieces”?	labels:Unfortunately, my entire wardrobe as a construction worker.  I'm a construction superintendent, so I wear the same thing every day. Boils down to a thermal layer, hiking pants, a quarter zip fleece, a heated jacket, work boots, a vest, and a hard hat  After a couple years, I'm so used to wearing actually practical clothes that I'm annoyed to wear heels or deal with shitty pockets or worry about a skirt flying up.  I'm officially that queer woman who goes to the bar with her keys clipped onto her belt loop with a carabiner so I don't have to carry a purse

text:General Discussion - January 16, 2021	labels:A dark and surreal week for me:     Accidentally went to the wrong floor for a meeting this week and stumbled across a sweatshop right here in beautiful New York, New York (the city so nice they named it the big apple), so this is your friendly reminder that "made in the USA" doesn't necessarily mean shit when it comes to ethically made clothing. Reported it to the DoL but I don't expect them to do anything about it.     In unrelated but equally bleak personal fashion news, In my search for some VERY obscure soviet-Czech trainers I accidentally stumbled across a sketchy forum of people selling battle-worn combat uniforms, complete with burns, bullet holes and blood stains. It's always fun to imagine you're living in a Blue Ant book until you actually start living in a blue ant book and life becomes very depressing! The first rule of the forum is you are not allowed to ask how these things were sourced.     Lastly the embroidery studio i work at was contacted for a large order of Rhodesian flag patches. I contacted the client to see if it was for a film or something and he was very cagey about their purpose, so I cancelled the order and refunded his deposit, which lead to me getting chewed out by my boss, who is apparently fine with making White Nationalist memorabilia if it's obscure enough to not get him in any trouble.

text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:Not buying Uniqlo was super hard this Aussie winter, because their thermal underwear is so good and so well priced. I also liked their jumpers a lot. I am typing this while wearing their duffel coat.   When I needed winter woolens I bought Australian merino, which I should have been doing anyway. I also bought lounge pants from a small “ethical” (hopefully true) Kiwi brand. Both were more expensive than I usually get, but I told myself to suck it up. Buy less, buy better.	episode_done:True

text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:If you're nervous about the look itself: I used to wear things I was iffy on when I was in a new or different place. Like, if I was worried a dress was too loud and attention-getting for my comfort level, I'd wear it when I was in a different city for the day, because if it did catch too much attention, who cares, I was never seeing these people again! Obviously this is harder to do in covid, because we aren't casually daytripping or traveling, but even just wearing the outfit to the grocery store, where you're probably not going to know everyone, vs wearing it in the office, where you see the same people all the time can ease you into being comfortable...	episode_done:True

text:My spouse grew up and went through the US education system. A decent--for NYC--public school. It is *shockingly* bad all around, but especially so where US history is concerned. America is always the good guy, civilizing the natives, spreading democracy worldwide, blah blah blah. Really opened my eyes to how bad things are in poorer regions, schools with even less funding and resources, etc.  /u/badger0511 is right about collegiate education, but that mostly has to do with professors actually knowing their shit and trying to teach history properly rather than spreading propaganda. And that's why Republicans absolutely loathe higher-ed and have waged war on it since Reagan's time.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 13, 2020	labels:Heyo,   I'm looking for some chino pants and am mostly concerned about the material.   Around a year ago, I bought some RSQ chinos and they were great, I liked the material, the fit (slim straight) was just right, and the cost was worth it ($45 a pair, BOGO 50% off)!   I decided to buy some recently and despite the website (Tilly's) saying they were the same fit/style, they felt off. The material isn't what it used to be I guess despite having the same ratio (97% cotton/3% cotton), it feels thinner. The pants also feel more loose on me, I made sure to order the same fit but I guess that changed too.   I'm interested in any recommendations where the pant material definitely felt nice and worth the asking price.   As for my price range, I wouldn't feel right spending more than $50 per pair as I'm just a college student.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 06, 2021	labels:Is it super bad if you wear a dark top and dark pants? I'm talking about polos/shirts and jeans here, nothing super fancy.  For some reason, I have tons of dark tops (well because I like dark tops) and I know I should probably get lighter jeans but I have a hard time finding them.  Anyway, what do y'all think?

text:What are your favorite straight leg jeans?	labels:My favorite is the Levi’s Ribcage Straight Ankle jeans! I love how high-waisted they are and they are definitely a steal if you can get them on sale!	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:Hmm....I think when it comes to feeling like you don’t fit in fashion wise, it’s helpful to realize people aren’t as aware of the details and flaws as you are, and most people probably think you look fine, or more normal than you would think. Besides that, experimenting with different cuts of clothing can be really helpful in getting started. For example, if you’ve been mostly wearing skinny jeans, you can try some more straight legged jeans with rolled cuffs and see how that looks. If you mostly wear tshirts, try tshirts in different cuts, or look for an outfit with a T-shirt on Tiktok or instagram, look for the details you like, then look for a T-shirt with similar details. Getting into fashion and finding a style involves experimenting, and starting with small changes with basics you’re already comfortable in might help with making fashion feel more natural.	episode_done:True
text:Do you think that designer brands will no longer be as sought after in the future?	labels:I don't get the logic.  Why would people be buying secondhand designer clothing if they didn't want designer clothing?  The pop in secondhand designer does not just *happen* to coincide with multiple major economic recessions and historically low relative wages for working class people.  At the same time we're in the shadow of a fast fashion industry that deliberately produces 'affordable' clothing of an extremely poor quality.  So, for a lot of us, the only way we can obtain good quality clothing is to buy it second-hand.  As for online platforms, I believe those only contribute to the popularity of designer clothing.  Since people can no longer handle clothing in person before we purchase it, we are even more reliant on brand reputation for a clue as to what the garment's quality might be.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have moved for extended periods of time on 1 or 2 suitcases only, how did you do it? Here's the beginning of my process	labels:My job has made me a nomad (I WFH now to most offices being shut down).  However, only 1 of my assignments over the last decade had me travel by air.  The rest of the time, I simply loaded up my car.  I am no minimalist (fashion wise, I am in other parts of my life) and a capsule wardrobe has zero appeal to me.  I typically hit the road for anywhere from 2-6 months at a time.  When I flew, my luggage was 1 wheeled carry on size suitcase (the largest carry on size allowed), 1 larger checked bag, and a backpack (I gate checked the carry on suitcase when they were looking for people to gate check bags).  I was able to fit enough clothes for 2 months into those because I also brought a collapsible mesh laundry basket with me along with laundry pods (which I otherwise do not use).  My caveat is that due to my industry (US politics), everything is domestic.  I've never traveled internationally as an adult.
text:If I could drive there I would definitely feel more secure. My greatest packing achievement yet was packing 1 suitcase + 1 backpack for 2 months, 5 countries and 4 different ranges of weather. I was able to fit everything I needed without having to shop, but I can't imagine surviving on it for an entire year without resorting to minimalism. It just seems so boring to me, I can't see myself looking like me in those types of clothing	labels:One thing I think a lot of minimal capsule wardrobe inspo images don’t show is that you don’t HAVE to do only neutrals. This is a revelation I just had recently — I came to the end of about 2 years of personal style exploration and put together a capsule wardrobe to see if it would work for me. I’m all about colors and floral patterns, so for me the trick was to choose everything in a color palette that would mix & match. My colors are navy blue, coral pink, yellow, and dark green. Almost all of my items were one or more of those colors, and everything interchanged really easily, even though I only had 20 items or so.   You said fashion is how you express yourself. What are the consistencies between your favorite pieces? Do several of your pieces already go together? That might be the basis for creating a “minimal” wardrobe that still feels expressive and in line with your personality.
text:I've started mapping out my clothing and a lot of my things go together and everything I own is either floral or polka-dot, I've tried sticking with a colour scheme but I love too many of them. In the last 4 years I've gone through navy-black-maroon, grey-blue-black, orange-yellow-black, dark green-navy-black- brown,and the past year I've been a solid black-white-hot pink.  So I've ended up with a crazy mix.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How to Put Together a Successful Outfit – Put This On	labels:I have a question that’s been nagging me as I’m still pretty new to this.  The section... “pick an asthetic”... are you guys keeping a consistent asthetic from day to day or within a single outfit?  I feel strange sometimes wearing sleek monochrome top, black jeans and black chelsea boots one day and then a more workwear look the next.
text:For me it's day to day. My outfits definitely have some "shared DNA" between them, but I would say that each day I try for a different aesthetic to an extent	labels:I hate using the word "optimal" because constantly trying to min/max your wardrobe is a silly thing, but I think this is the optimal way of doing things. Day to day the aesthetic changes but the shared DNA of the entire wardrobe is a cross-section of a small handful of general aesthetic ideas that work well with one another.

Stopping the inflow will help me get things under control.  And I may have to move at the end of 2021 depending on my WFH situation so less stuff means less stuff to move.	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:I feel my best in heels. I completely identify with that actress who insisted her character would keep her heels on in Jurassic World. I hate how casual everything has gotten and can’t wait for sneakers with everything to die the ignominious death they deserve.   That being said, 3 inch stilettos are not a shoe to wear frequently.

If you can't live with out a certain label, maybe buying it second hand will lesson personal conflict created when buying new.

text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:I divide my wardrobe into two main categories - workwear (including going-out clothes too) and home wear (including clothes I'd wear to run errands but are not nice enough to wear to work.) Those are divided again into spring/summer and fall/winter (obviously there are overlaps, I'm ok with these.)   Dresses, blouses, blazers/jackets, skirts, and dress pants go on the hangers; tees, sweaters, and jeans are folded. Socks, underwears, and scarves go in the drawers. I also have a coat stand where I hang my worn-but-not-dirty clothes.

I love beanies of all kind and will never part with my collection. I used to have a couple other random hats, like a straw fedora and a black and white printed sun hat, but they never seemed to mesh well with my fashion sense and I ended up getting rid of them to free up space for... more beanies.	episode_done:True
text:It’s 2021. A vaccine for the virus has been made widely available and businesses may operate at full capacity, including bars, clubs, salons, etc. How will this influence fashion?	labels:People will go ALL OUT. This sub usually salivates at the thought of athleisure taking over and killing fashion (and fast fashion) but that 100% wouldn't happen. Almost every woman I know is bloody sick and tired of not getting to dress up, not being able to wear lipstick, not having places to wear heels and vacation outfits. People would literally go crazy and it truly would be the roaring twenties. Dresses of all types, miniskirts, sparkle and glitter, heels for days, fun fabrics, bolder colors, leather pants, blouses with impractical sleeves, statement earrings – women would really be dressing to the nines *and* wearing bold lipstick colors to compliment.

It stayed at my parent's house when I graduated college and dumped stuff there while I moved to Germany and rejoined me when my parents got rid of their house. It has now followed me to our tiny house on the arctic circle because I figure an item of clothing that durable should stick around for what must be at least the third time it's been trendy! Along the way it even had afb elimination fight with a sad knockoff jean jacket from some mall brand that shrunk to half its size the first time it touched water in a washing machine 😆 it will definitely still be here, and probably still be in style, at the end of the world lol	episode_done:True

text:Brooks Brothers's Future Looks a Lot Like Menswear’s Past	labels:* Less SKUs. The amount of stuff BB sells is overwhelming.  * Do away with there weirdly named fit system. Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.

text:Southern hemisphere ladies where do you get inspo from?	labels:I had the same dilemma when I moved down under 2 years ago! To be honest, I just started following popular brands on Instagram - Zimmermann, Bec & Bridge, Camilla & Marc, Dion Lee, etc. The algorithm took care of the rest, lol.   So I guess my advice is to look around at what the popular brands are in your locale, follow them on Insta and trust Zuckerberg’s algorithm to lead the way.
text:This sounds like a solid plan, but I don't have IG	labels:I bet you could do the same with pinterest if you're trying not to get too deep into social media. Onc you start pinning certain types of images, you'll see more that are similar to it. But you can follow folks on Pinterest and brands from the same hemisphere as you, who are following current seasonally appropriate trends. Plus, I have a winter and summer pinterest board and am always pinning out of season clothing whenever it comes up, even if I can't wear it atm.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - October 30	labels:probably my least favorite lurker take is "there's not a lot of style variety represented here :/"   First off, that's not even remotely true.

I’ll put on something that’s risky or different from my usual fits and think it looks awful. All I see is how it is too tight in the bust or emphasizes my waist, then I take it off and move back to safer ground.   My husband’s favorite dress on me... I was going to return it, when he saw me trying it on and told me to pick a restaurant. I still don’t love the dress on, but he swears it looks amazing on me. (And he does not shy away from expressing negative opinions).   I’m just saying, sometimes we see what we expect to see. And getting a second opinion is worth it, because that look might really “look right” on you. It just might not be what you are used to seeing.	episode_done:True

text:"Can people just hate fashion again" - Synecdoche When Talking about the "Industry" Discussion	labels:> Should spaces & industries for fashion lovers, clothes lovers, and people that have to wear clothes be completely separate?  I don’t think that any of these groups should be completely separate however I do find them all being lumped into the same spaces very frustrating as someone who does love fashion as a form of art and creativity.  I like harsh and blunt constructive criticism in pretty much all areas of life and I most certainly want it for my outfits as well. I want to hear what other fashion lovers and artists think of my colour choices, proportions, textures, fit, etc. and be able to refine those things and really flex my creative muscles when creating an outfit. Instead, many fashion spaces are dominated by ‘you do you hun!’ and ‘so long as you like it, that’s all that matters!’ which is great for someone *who has to wear clothes* and doesn’t actually care about fashion but joins fashion spaces because they feel some obligation as a woman to care about it but... those spaces just become unhelpful and bland for those who really love fashion and want to get better at it.  I’ve been an off and on follower of FFA for a few years and I feel like it’s definitely dominated by the “people who wear clothes” group and unfortunately it limits the amount of critique that is acceptable to give.

text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:I came to that realization a few years ago too, I used to be really into Zara and H&M and all that bs. Basically I've found a few specific brands and stores I really like, (Reformation, Realisation Par, Anthro, and Rokit Vintage to name a few) that I follow, focusing on sustainable/vintage/consignment shops. I get a lot of ideas from social media, my friends (I'm lucky cause they're mostly art students so they're always looking cool), movies (old and new),  and also just people watching. Like if I'm on the subway and I see someone wearing a great coat, I think about what I like about the coat (fit, color, silhouette, etc.) then I might go thrifting and try to find a similar piece, or a piece that has an element of whatever I liked about the inspiration piece. I did a wardrobe overhaul recently and I started with basics I loved and just built my way from there. It's hard to avoid trends entirely, but if you focus on what you really are attracted to you're bound to find your style. There's a lot out there, just keep looking for it!	episode_done:True

That said, you can pull off any look you want to if you do the work! I actually find the egirl style pretty cute and I don’t think there is anything about being a fat WOC where the style wouldn’t be cute on you!  As for your family, this grinds my gears so much!!!! I’m old enough to be your mother and it makes me so sad when adults crush the creative expression of their children. You don’t have to ever fit in the box they want you to. As long as it makes you happy and you aren’t hurting anyone else, it’s your life to live and they are just clothes. If you can muster the courage to do it, have an open conversation about how your family makes you feel when they trash the style you like. Tell them it hurts and makes you struggle with self confidence in a world that already does that to fat WOC every day. I think if they get that it hurts you, they’ll stop being unsupportive.  Keep your chin up! It’s gets easier to give less of an EF what others think about you as you get older, I promise!	episode_done:True

Honestly I don’t think trends move the same way with going out wear as it does in other areas of fashion. A body con dress or some fun short shorts are usually good for a couple years imo. However I’m definitely the first to admit my taste leans more towards trashy and loud than special event most times, it also gets worn to rocky horror showings pretty regularly so that’s my kinda vibe lol.   I did buy a couple of pieces at the beginning of this when I thought it would just be a few months, but since then not really.

text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:The most basic thing, fundamental, objective thing is if it uncomfortable or impedes your movements. Some of this you only figure out when you wear things particularly if they are too loose (too tight you usually notice faster), like tops or dresses too big their neckline might move a bit and look askew, or you step on the hem of skirts or dresses at you climb stairs. Skirts too tight might ride up, pants too tight might dig and create camel toe or the zipper give way and open...  For other things, say pant or skirt length it might be a matter of aesthetics, 5 or 10 cm lower or higher..  Probably the most important point for things to fit is the shoulders and armpits, so it does not impede movement and because outerwear, tops, etc, hangs literally from there. If fitted, the seam should be at the edge of your shoulder blade naturally.  Not everything can be altered to fit right. There might not be enough fabric for that, or it might just a design which was cut for different proportions than yours. Tailoring can do subtle tweaks, on woven fabrics (knits are harder, way harder), but the first and most important step of getting clothes which fit well is REJECTING things, lots of things, most things, almost all things. Trying many many things, being analytical so you can learn stuff (if it looks like that chances are it will loook  this other thing on my body, Brand X pants always fit me right and Brand Y pants never).
text:FFS just got  direct message of people trying to build a community to fix fit problems or get clicks on something.  There is not ever a one size fit all solution to fit problems. It is not necessarily because somebody is fat (well some people are) or very small or whatever. Try try try stuff, be analytical, all bodies are different, reject 90% or more of what you try. If you want to say something to me, say it here.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What work for my boyfriends taste and body type?	labels:I have found the best way to hide my dad-bod tummy features that I’m self conscious of is through layering. This is very weather specific, but one of my go to options is a t-shirt, an open flannel, then a denim jacket. You can smarten it up with a nicer shirt buttoned up.   Another strategy I really like when I’m trying new things that I’m not quite comfortable with is to wear it out for an hour or so (like go get coffee, walk in a park, or something like that where you aren’t too social but still in public) then go home and put on clothes more in my comfort zone. I have found this slowly builds my confidence bit by bit and allows my to trial run things for what works and what doesn’t.   Playing into the braid shoulders might be a good idea as well. That’s something typically masculine that looks good. Trying suspenders instead of a belt (or just not tightening the belt too much, so as not to accentuate the belly again) is a good option. Where long sleeves either rolled or pushed up can make upper arms look bigger too. I like a Henley style shirt this way as the cut is very masculine there.  Find pictures, have them on your phone while shopping to try to find inexpensive alternatives.
text:I think layering will make him a lot more confident to try new things. I feel so bad for him with his insecurities. He sees his belly as really big when it’s not it’s just not flat like a models. And he always wants to cover it.   I think he does need to slowly build his confidence up. Just a bit at a time like you said. And Henley shirts looks like they’ll really suit him! He’s never rolled up god sleazes but he’s got very good arms that he could really show off.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Grad/Masters Fashion Program Reality?	labels:If your goal is to start your own brand or become a fashion designer, or work in the fashion industry on the design and creative side, a marketing degree is an order of magnitude more valuable than a fashion design degree (granted, it should ideally be from a fashion school or a highly respected school). Everyone and their born-rich roommate in NYC has a fashion design degree just because they're interested in fashion and didn't know what to study in uni. In these industries with oversupply of graduates (who are willing to work for less than you), your goal should be to be significantly more valuable than your competitors. Having a marketing double major is one way, though it's also not very uncommon and you will still have significant competition.
text:My goal is genuinely just get enough knowledge to work in clothing design. I have a pretty solid brand made thst ive been working on.  But a brand isnt my “goal” it’s more to get enough knowledge and experience to work in clothing and then maybe down the road do that.	labels:You don't need to go to FIT to work in clothing design. But the kind of company you want to work for will determine what kind of school you want to go into. Not because that school necessarily produces better graduates, but because school name and personal connections matter more than skills in that particular industry.   If you want to work for a designer or designer brand, then yes the best way to get there is to get into a reputable fashion school, make connections, and hope for the best. However, if you want to work for fashion brands that are still really good but considered more mid level (especially brands without a "designer" at the helm) then you don't need to go to a high fashion school; you need work experience and a good portfolio.   Your two choices have very different paths to your goal. If you complete your double major, you can begin your career working for smaller brands or larger fashion conglomerates to build your portfolio over a few years. Then, you aim for a well respected mid level brand like an Acne or Our Legacy to establish yourself in the field, and if you're good enough, take a step up to work for a designer.   If you switch schools for fashion design, then you're going to have to try and meet the right people, make the right friends, and produce work that will get people's attention (I cannot stress enough how deeply nepotism runs in these types of industries). If you're lucky (part of the 0.1%), you can graduate with a job at a designer house waiting for you. If you're not lucky, well, you start at a small brand of larger fashion conglomerate with a bigger student loan and fewer meaningful skills. High risk, high reward.   So, it really depends. Do you only want to work for a designer, and nowhere else? Are you willing to spend years building up to your dream job? Do you have a once in a decade talent for fashion design, or do you have grit and determination?
text:Wow, this is such a good answer.   Thank you   I enjoy high end and have a massive knowledge of it. But working immediately in high end isn’t really my goal. I wanna get a great education, be stimulated , be pushed, I wanna put all my time a nd energy into fashion. It’s all I think about, all I do, all I want.  My father is ironically a fine artist, that’s how we live as a family, Off his art. I’ve grown up knowing the work, dedication and talent you have to have even to even make a living off fashion.   It’s taken me a long time to realize how much I want this, but I’m 21 and it’s all I can think about.  If you wanna check some of my work my Instagram is @liepkes. Dm me tell me what you think.	labels:A lot of people live and breathe fashion and say it's all the think about. One of the downsides of an industry that is also a hobby for many, is that there is no shortage of people who desperately want to work in it. That means that: 1.) there is an oversupply of applicants; 2.) it can be a race to the bottom just to get in (unpaid internships, low wages); and 3.) your passion is not enough to get by.   Good luck on your future, and always remember that a job is still a job. And sometimes, it's worse when it's also your hobby.   If your dad is the first result for Liepke then I actually follow him on IG and really admire his art.
text:YES Wow, small world, that is my dad Malcolm Liepke I’m his son! So wild you know him. Saying I look up to my dad is an understatement. I’m very lucky to have grown up with such a unique outlook on the arts.  Thank you for the kind words, If I choose the Pratt path I knows it big gamble. I’ll have to live with the decision I make, I’m leaning towards Pratt but it’d gonna be hard convincing my parents.	labels:I agree with u/Reactionaire that a marketing degree is extremely valuable. I also agree that fashion is a field with no shortage of talented people. If you want to do actual apparel design, sketching, building concepts, technical design, etc I don’t see how you’re getting in the door without a degree unless you have an EXCEPTIONAL portfolio, even at at ‘mid-range’ brand whatever that is. Even FIT grads with exceptional portfolios have a tough time finding a job.   As someone who has worked in fashion in New York for over 20 years and hired for countless entry level positions, take it from me: you have to do the work.
text:Oh yes totally, I definitely need a degree in it. Never Said anything about that. In addition the work has to be put in is definitely massive I understand that.  My question more should I tough it out for 1.5 years at my state university and double major in Marketing/fashion design.

text:Yeah, I will be posting on insta, maybe Facebook (land of in-laws) depending on how sexy the Edie Britt (Desperate Housewives) and Shane McCutchen outfits turn out. I added the social media part moreso so people could try for themselves, because I do keep my social media private. However, I really do think you need to have some kind of goal other than "I'm going to try and dress like Blair Waldorf" to make it fun and keep momentum going.   I suppose I could post outfits here with my face blurred if anything comes together particularly well! However, because I'm not buying any new clothes, not all of the references are as spot on as they could be. As such, I'm nervous people would be disappointed!	labels:No, the not buying new clothes makes it so much more interesting! Buying the cloth is something everyone could have done. I totally get keeping socials private, but would be very exited to see the blurred edition here.
text:It is very fun! I think to myself, "what would this character do with my closet?" so even though I don't have the low-rise jeans and tight satin tops of the 2000s needed to make more exact replicas, I still have a sense of what colors, fabrics, and silhouettes the character would go for. I am also fairly curvy, with prominent dark curly hair, so have to make adjustments there as well. For example, most of what Gabrielle Solis (Desperate Housewives) wears looks much less "classy" on a curvier frame, so to get her "vibe" I have to pick different pieces to fit my body type.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Somebody else loosing so much time to choose the right item to buy when looking for something? I feel it cost me more in time when I try to buy responsibly.	labels:A while back I was watching a YouTube video that mentioned the best way to learn about something is to make all of your passive entertainment geared towards that thing.  It was specifically talking about designer fashion, but I think it's something that can be applied to any kind of fashion.  Personally, I'm more of a shop local/thrift sort of person, but if I were to go out of my way to find a specific product, it would take a lot less time on my part because I follow people with a similar outlook.  The Youtubers I watch are concerned about buying ethically/in an environmentally conscious way.  Most people I follow on Instagram are about my height/size.  When I'm watching TV I'll open up Depop and to my lists when something catches my eye.  About half the work is done for me, and when I need something, I spend a lot less time actively searching.  I started a wardrobe overhaul last year so I do get how sometimes it can feel like you'll never find exactly what you're looking for, but maybe finding some people doing the same can help.	episode_done:True

text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:I'm trying to decrease my consumption of plastic so yes, if I'm buying clothing nowadays I tend to look for natural fibers. I've never had any issues with natural fibers. But I still have a ton of synthetics in my wardrobe of course, it doesn't make sense to get rid of them. If I'm buying new synthetics it tends to be activewear.	episode_done:True
text:Formula for a put together outfit that works for most aesthetics	labels:I think this strongly depends on your natural features. E.g. I have an hourglass figure with noticeable boobs, so if I'm wearing something fitting it's already like 4 points, lol, even if it's a simple black dress. If I'd put 7 more "points" worth of accessorizes and stuff that would turn me into overly feminine very much in your face type of appearance. So I usually have my outfit - fairly simple but fitting, some makeup on the face, and everything else is a bit toned down, e.g. simple jewellery, maybe a pendant or earrings, simple hairdo, etc. If I had less prominent features, the "blank slate" model look I feel I could push further with adding scarves, bags, more jewellery, etc. But being curvy even red lips become kind of a provocation.	episode_done:True
text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Zara | January 30, 2021	labels:2012 through about 2014 I was out of college, unemployed for stretches, underemployed for others, and underpaid for the rest. After being unemployed post-college in 2012 and living with my parents, and then my entire annual income in 2013 was about $13,000 while I was living on my own, and somewhere around $20,000 in 2014. I had some freelance gigs here and there where I could pull in $500 or $1000 bucks outside my reported income, but I was ostensibly "living in poverty" for a few years.  Zara was honestly kind of a godsend in that period, I needed somewhat fashionable clothing but had basically no money to spend on it. I work in the contemporary art world and dressing well is literally part of my job. While Zara isn't exactly highly respected, I was able to get some decent looking clothing on the cheap.  Today I find it easy to criticize Zara, whether it's the stolen designs, or the fast fashion model, or the inconsistent sizing, the sweatshop labor, and so on, but I admit that for a moment in my life they were a really useful utility. When I didn't have money for clothes but I needed decent looking clothes, Zara was one of the best options available to me. There's a lot of better options in the world if you have time and money, as I do now, but I'd be a hypocrite to ignore the benefit they provided me when I had neither time nor money.  Also while they're not exactly a "buy it for life" brand, their clothes didn't fall apart on me either, so, I'll give them props for that. Everything lasted an appropriate amount of time for the price.

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:I associate Gen Z fashion with crop tops and sweatpants, so yeah it makes sense that people in their 30's buying expensive ethical clothes aren't going for the sporty spice look.
text:Totally.  To me, Gen Z is a lot of clothing that isn’t work appropriate but super fun. A lot of crop tops, bra tops, spaghetti straps, usually some tummy showing, and then some baggy pants. Lots of thrifting and also cheap fast fashion. Doc Martens and other platform shoes. Very 90s/early 2000s. Long acrylic nails, false lashes. Really fun and can be a really “hot but trashy” style   Millennial fashion is more professional/better quality/structured. Linens, trousers, heels, sandals, etc. Frankly I think it has to do with millennials having more money. Low key hair, nails and makeup. Neutral colours and patterns. It’s a more mature style   I’m 25 so I get to do both 😎 woohoo	labels:I am a completely broke, jobless 24 year old and recent graduate and I have recently adopted a more mature style because I don't want to be jobless forever. So now my closet is 50% fun, sexy Zoomer/Millenial clothes, and 50% blazers and cigarette pants with varying shades of brown.	episode_done:True
text:Black is Beautiful, Braids are Beautiful, Bald is Beautiful: Ayanna Pressley as an icon of feminine professionalism	labels:I think people just now are starting to really see the beauty in blackness, not just in fashion sense, which has always been apparent, but also in human terms.  I mean, black people or people of black skin color have been painted in very ugly and negative terms for hundreds if not thousands of years.  And that has been done by people of light skin color.  I have not seen a lot of examples of people of dark skin color vilifying people of white skin color, just based on their skin color alone.    This stuff has been around for thousands of years.  I think it really started with the Romans and the great lie they have perpetrated to steal the identity of Christ, because they could not contain the spread of Christianity despite the persecution of Christians after Christ's death.    The color black in fashion has always been wildly successful.  However, that success has never translated to black people or people of black skin color because of the concerted effort that has been done throughout millenia against them.  Black beauty is a light within which had been hidden from the world.  Despite efforts to reverse this coming to light, or as I would call it Black Enlightment, it is undeniable that this trend too is unstoppable.  Justice for All...	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 23, 2020	labels:Not to bring up the cape thread again, but something really has been stuck in my craw. It was some comment about how people who basically wear cowboy shit are “attention seekers.” This was very clearly framed as a bad thing. Western wear aside, I feel like the subtext of the comment was basically “if you’re not wearing something to fit in, you’re seeking attention.” Isn’t the pursuit of dressing better/more fashionably inherently attention seeking? And why is that a bad thing? I don’t understand what seems to be the lurker notion of “wanting to dress better to blend in better.” If wearing the shit I wear labels me as an “attention seeker,” then I’ll wear that badge proudly.   Sorry for the rant, this really just got under my skin

text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:I generally find its easier to base your outfits around one piece, often an accent piece or statement piece. I got the idea from storytelling/art composition seminars, its infinitely more easy to come up with a composition once you know what your main character is interacting with scene/item wise. The same applies to outfits, once you have your main piece for that outfit you can decide how casual/dressed up you want to be, whether you need to add more textures, and what colors will match with said pieces color.  Generally I stick to the rules of trying to match the metals/detailing of outfits, trying to either go with neutrals for primary pieces with skintone matches to accents, or going with monochrome outfits(which generally look very stylish automatically). Fit wise, I generally make sure that I alternate between loose up top/form fitting below the waist, or vice versa. Silhouette is the most important thing, I try to go for clean lines.  Pattern wise I limit them to one pattern max, the same goes for textured pieces.	episode_done:True
text:Let's Talk about hats	labels:There is hat etiquette from the days of yore. Here are some of the conventions that were adhered to:  A lady does not remove her hat when indoors or for the national anthem. This is in contrast to men, who are to remove hats when indoors and for the anthem. However, if you‘re sporting a baseball cap at a ballgame, I would remove it for the anthem, whereas if you were wearing a more formal outfit with hat then I would not remove it.  A hat is a daytime piece in most cases not suitable for evening wear. The fascinator is an exception to this rule, but is more of a Commonwealth/British thing.  A lady does not wear a hat in her own home, ie when receiving guests, and as a guest in a friend’s home a lady would remove her hat.

text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:I'm in a similar situation as yourself. The way I think of it,  I save the clothes that I absolutely love in a small box. That way, regardless of if I have kids or not, I will have a curated box of my favorite pieces that I can look back on in time and think, "wow, I'm so happy I saved this." It's a little tedious, seeing as you will be hauling around a box for years, but if you take the approach of a museum curator, the old pieces can resemble pictures in a photo album, as opposed to clothing to be worn.

Even though I'm home all by myself and the only person who ever sees me is the Amazon delivery guy who I wait for by my window because *oh my god, I need human contact,* I'm still putting on a full face of makeup, doing my hair, and wearing spanx, a push-up bra, a sheath dress that fits like a second skin, 4" heels, and perfume.  I'm doing it for *me*, you know, because feeling sexy while I'm all by myself is much more important than being comfortable. Sure, it's easier to get coffee and cheeto stains out of my bathrobe than a 100% wool dress, but cheetos aren't sexy either.   For Christmas, Fashion Santa is going to bring me a brand new dress for every zoom event I have scheduled in 2021, because I would just die if people saw me wearing the same outfit week after week, which is definitely the kind of thing people are thinking about these days.

Can't have too much to choose from or too much inspiration.  The details about materials are cool too. I can't remember the name right now, but there was a company here in Aus that I was looking through and loving a bunch of years ago. They were aimed at men and produced rings in alt materials you don't normally see in mainstream jewelry. It was interesting cause the materials were the kinda stuff us dudes specifically might find intriguing. Alt metals like titanium where they burned in colour highlights like you see on high end aftermarket exhausts. And other stuff that's tough, totally overkill in terms of the strength of jewelry, normally used to create components etc. But they were interesting in that they had these industrial finishes, very matte and other non-metallic colours so they cut them in ways that could be geometric and have a totally different vibe etc.  I'll try track down who they were.	episode_done:True

No white shoes after Labor Day hasn't been a rule in many decades. It's just trotted out as article fodder (to proclaim "These Rules Are Dead!") every so often.
text:How have you maintained them for years? I’ve been looking for a cheapo pair since I don’t think white shoes of any kind would last me more than a season	labels:I don't wear them regularly; probably average of once a week in cool weather. Depends on the outfits I feel like. Periodically I rub off smudges and black marks with nail polish remover on a cotton ball - works like a charm on all white smooth-surface shoes I've ever owned. I find it easier than sneakers since the fabric is harder to clean off and not all fabric shoes wash well.

text:Thoughts on Shein?	labels:Controversial opinion, but, they aren’t that bad.   Let’s have some empathy for a moment: it is an absolute privilege to be able to shop at a sustainable store and/or to be able to buy secondhand. Imagine being someone who hasn’t bought new to them clothing in years because they can’t afford to and then fast fashion prices are waved in their faces on clothing that fits them and is their style. I’m not going to tell someone to not buy clothing from a place they can afford. I’m absolutely not doing it.   People demonize fast fashion because they look at it as black and white and don’t understand that, if you’re shopping at SHEIN, you likely can’t afford the more sustainable sources/you can’t find what you’re looking for secondhand. I’m plus sized. I can’t fit into and afford a lot of the sustainable brands out there. And, people buy out the “fashionable” plus size items in my local thrift stores to sell on Depop, so, I don’t blame people for shopping on SHEIN.  I’ve bought SHEIN secondhand and I’ve had items for years and I haven’t had any issues. I haven’t bought first hand from them in a long time but when I did, I never had any long shipping times or anything, either. I found the same defects I’d find at Target, like, a long thread here or there that I can easily snip off.   This goes for fast fashion in general—if you take care of your clothes and wear the appropriate size, you can make them last. It’s not like they spontaneously rip apart, you have to do something to make them do that. Steam your clothes to get out wrinkle. Tumble dry, hand wash, etc.
text:You raise good points, but I’m going to respectfully disagree - I don’t think there’s ever any valid excuse to buy from a company who openly profits from exploitative third world labour. We can all do better.   Sustainable fashion is expensive, yes. But *usually* buying quality clothing is cheaper in the long run than buying lots of cheap stuff (I know this is easier said than done for people living hand to mouth).   Secondly there are options that don’t exploit people. Namely second hand shops and Depop. I guarantee - no matter what the item is - someone’s already bought it or something VERY similar and wants to get rid of it. Even when I have money I buy from there because... why wouldn’t you?   The “what about poor people” argument always gets made but it just doesn’t sit right with me. What about the people who are being paid 40p a day in sweltering and unsafe Bangladeshi factories? Factories that are dumping toxic dyes into water sources? We all have a responsibility not to perpetuate the monolithic success of these horrible fast fashion conglomerates.	labels:Absolutely agree u/librarygirl. Second hand/preloved/‘vintage’, whatever it goes by atm, is cheaper than new, better quality and ethical.   I have definitely been through periods where I’m calculating every penny and in those times I have bought ‘fast fashion’. And it’s always been terrible quality/fit, made me feel self conscious that it looks ‘cheap’ and I always wished I’d mended or styled up something I already had rather than wasted my money.   It’s part of a bigger problem though, and I would not blame anyone for doing the same.	episode_done:True
text:What ultimate-splurge fashion item would you buy to reward yourself for achieving a big milestone?	labels:I usually buy solid gold jewelry. Something timeless that will last forever and I'll wear forever. My most recent purchase was a pair of simple 45mm 14k gold hoops.
text:Why 14k vs 22k?	labels:Some reasons could be:   Gold is a soft metal. 22k gold will become damaged easier. Usually more important factor for rings that are worn everyday. In some countries, jewelry is made 14 or 10k gold. Some people prefer the color of 14k to 22k. The color difference is the other metals added to the jewelry.	episode_done:True

text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I think the size of your wardrobe is going to depend on your climate, job, hobbies, and general lifestyle. I have a lot more clothing than that. I also live in a place with four seasons. I have outdoorsy hobbies that require some tougher clothes. I can‘t wear my casual clothing to work (and I’m also holding onto some more professional clothing from a past job in case I return to that field). I don’t have a lot of disposable income either, so I always keep things like dress pants even though I never wear them in my everyday, because I can’t afford to go shopping when interviews and funerals come up.  For instance, I probably have at least 15 dresses alone, once you count all the strappy sundresses, nice work dresses, wool sweater dresses, the cocktail dresses, and the evening gown that’s in the back of my closet - and everything in between.  I swap out my clothing with the seasons and have one closet that I share with my husband, so I try to be judicious about what I keep, while giving myself grace that I don’t need to get rid of something just because I don’t wear it regularly.
text:Really feel you on the past job clothes. I invested in classic pieces and tailored almost every item when I worked in a much more business professional role. I have no use for that wardrobe, or for the 10+ cocktail dresses I needed then, but I know I won’t be able to easily replace them.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I am a teacher that went back to working in the building at the beginning of September, so to be fair I was only wfh for several months in the spring, but it still drastically changed my style, or my perspective on my style.   Pre-Covid my work style (and general style) had morphed over the years to become very, very minimal and neutral. Lots of Everlane and Eileen Fisher. This was both because I wanted to be taken seriously at my job (I read very young) and because it also seemed like what was in style to me.   Returning to work in the fall, I realized I really f*cking hated all of my sensible, plain, go with everything black and grey clothes.   I still really prefer earth tones and blacks and greys, and I still wear some pretty simple outfits somedays, but I went on a small spree on The RealReal after I had my realization. I bought myself some louder statement pieces that feel more me, including an embroidered Happy Sheep sweater, a knit Missoni sheath dress, a multi-colored leather and fur purse, platform oxfords, and a couple of geometric patterned silk shirts and dresses.   For me life is too short to try so hard to be timeless and professional. I’m not knocking the look, it just isn’t ~me~ I want to love the clothes I wear and the clothes I love are fun knits and patterns.
text:I also work at a school and realized I hated all of my pre-Covid, neutral clothes! Like to the point that I couldn’t wear them without getting very depressed. I’ve since bought some new things in lighter neutrals (grey, camel, cream) and light pink, and am so much happier.	labels:	episode_done:True

If you're new to the idea of dressing well or with intention, it may be worth holding off on springing for things.

text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:start off your job dressing in line with the majority of the company, especially when you go back in person. during that time, strengthen your in-person connections with your coworkers and make yourself as indispensable at your job as you can. you'll also get to observe how people *actually* dress in the office as opposed to having mostly people's zoom outfits and the HR dress code to go off of.   once you have that strong foundation from both a performance standpoint and a team dynamics standpoint, then over time start integrating your typical style into your work style. pay attention to people's reactions to it, both direct and indirect, and scale back or plunge ahead accordingly.   this worked well for me and my style is pretty off the wall. it took about a year for me to feel secure enough in my role and on my team to wear renditions of "my style" to work all the time, and then an additional year to make the more 'permanent' choice to color my hair (i chose to also check with HR before i did this!). i also personally find that the overall aesthetic is what's most important to me, so the "just wear bizcaz but with fun earrings and socks" sort of advice that many people exchange on ffa is not relevant	episode_done:True

Well it took 2 months to get here and there customer service was terrible. And when I tracked it, it was coming from the Netherlands. I kept contacting them in chat and I would always be like 70th in queue!  It was awful. When I looked them up there BBB rating was something awful. I guess I should’ve researched the company first and just stick to reputable sites. I had another order in the same time frame coming from Lithuania and it got to me in 3 days. Another site though.
text:Yeah, I've ran into them a couple of times - they consistently have the best prices for a wide range of products, and also appear to have the largest stock available - sizes you can't find anywhere else are listed as "in stock". They have lots of webshops - runner inn, but also dive inn, outlet inn, kid inn, tech inn and so on, and all of those webshops have some of the worst customer feedback I've ever seen. Avoid at all costs, I'd say!	labels:I wish I read this 4 months ago. Now I know!	episode_done:True

text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:I get it, I'm a nurse who is also an introvert who loves fashion/style. Its tough because we can't express ourselves at work, and I've also felt insecure about wearing my best clothes on the rare occasion I would go out (especially nowadays), and feeling like no occasion is good enough to wear my nicer or different clothes.   I still struggle with it, but my advice is to incorporate items slowly and consider how things can be dressed up or down. For example, I have some shorter skirts that might be a bit of a statement on their own, but I'll bust them out in winter with a sweater, scarf, and leggings and go grocery shopping. Simple and still casual. I do the same with shorter dresses. A nicer top and jeans is not over the top by any means. Try pairing a nicer pair of shoes with your jeans to dress down the shoes (and dress up the jeans i guess!)  As for asking why you're so dressed up, I don't see why people have to comment in that way, but I'm guessing they mean no harm. I typically get compliments from friends on my stuff but they also enjoy style, so if you hang out with people who aren't into it at all then they probably won't get it, or maybe they are interested and are in the same dilemma as you. Either way, the appropriate thing to do would be to compliment your skirt or top or whatever, not make you feel weird about it. I think "because I like it" is actually the best response. How can anyone argue with that? If you want to be petty you might say "oh, don't you like it?" and see how they respond, I'd actually be curious. The more you wear your nicer things the less you will be asked. Fake it till you make it! I've worn things out that I thought maybe was "too much", and people might stare but for all you know they are admiring your look, and occasionally I will get a compliment from strangers which is a great confidence boost.
text:This is such great advice. Not only does it help one get more comfortable with dressing up, it's just good fashion sense.  The 'why are you dressed up comments' I think are a function of location. Where I am and the places I go I get way more compliments on my outfit than questions why I'm dressed up. I think it would be a bit more difficult if you live in an area where everyone is super casual. But hey, maybe you'll inspire others!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:I think the pressure is to not be "strange/unaware of your appearance" or more likely not to look "poor/can't afford more clothes." Some people do notice, and the rude ones point it out. This perception starts young. Growing up, there were teachers and other school staff who repeated outfits and other children loudly pointed it out.  I repeat outfits as much as possible if I'm not seeing the same people (my household doesn't count). The internal pressure is strong to not repeat within a few weeks of seeing the same people to avoid potential comments.
text:Ah yes, strategizing when you wear which outfits because you want to wear an outfit multiple times but don't want to risk being seen wearing it twice. I loved the first two years of college for that reason- M/W an T/TR classes had entirely different sets up people. The outfit repeats were abundant.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I'm autistic and I have a lot of sensory issues so I can relate. I've found that wearing a layer underneath other things helps. For example, I have uniqlo leggings and a long-sleeve undershirt that I know I like the feeling of against my skin, so if I want to wear a sweater that's kind of scratchy or something else similar I'll just wear an undershirt that protects me. Another thing that helps me is tight sleeveless undershirts tucked into my jeans/skirt/bottom half whatever so that my shirt and waistband don't rub against my skin. (edit: I don't know if this will work in warmer climates, it works where I'm from because it's cold pretty much all year)  I also have a strict policy of not buying things that I know I'll find uncomfortable (and that I don't have a workaround for), wishing that maybe this time it will work. Because it won't, I'll just wear the thing out once and feel bad the entire time and then feel guilty for never wearing it again. If I find something that I really love, I cling to that and try to find similar things in the future and things that will complement those items.	episode_done:True

I also have a small beaded purse from her, it looks quite older, maybe 1930’s. I only use it for special occasions and otherwise it just sits on my dresser looking pretty. The same great aunt was the oldest of my grandmothers siblings and gave them fancy dresses from a lady she worked for to play dress up in. Later my mom played dress up in them and so did I. I wish we had realized how nice they were because they’re in rough shape now even though I’ve saved them. They’re probably 1920’s, one is silk and could possibly be repaired enough to look nice displayed.   My mom did her own sewing and saved a lot of her favorite clothes. I still wear some of her 70’s maxi dresses but she wore her dresses too short in the late 60’s for me to wear most of them as an adult. There’s one wool jumper dress I wear over leggings.   When I was in high school I wore her 1980’s Calvin Klein jeans, the ones with the white labels instead of the modern leather patch.   My aunt gave me some of my grandmothers costume jewelry and it started my love affair with tacky mid century jewelry.	episode_done:True

As a dude with an odd shape, big ass and thighs while having short legs, they fit really well without being too loose.      My only problem is I feel ethically wrong about wearing these pants, as they're made of 65% polyester, and washing them releases microplastics into the water. I'm trying to move my wardrobe, eventually, to being mostly if not exclusively organic materials like cotton and wool.     Does anyone know of any pants/work pants that have a similar fit to them, but might not use as much polyester/are 100% cotton?

text:The joy of cordovan—and how to wear and maintain it	labels:Cordovan is an Instagram dream - it’s lustrous and has a ton of color depth. Unfortunately I find  actually wearing it is a different story. It’s extremely stiff and inflexible, especially during the first 20-30 wears. It’s the coldest leather I’ve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I’ve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I’m glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there’s no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.

text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:I don't even have stores like that anywhere close to where I live - but I DO try on stuff from thrift stores that would be out of my price range new, and that's how I learned about higher quality garments.  For me it's more about the materials and construction than brand.  For instance, I learned the value of real wool, silk, etc. from gaining experience with them through thrifting.  Same thing with really good structure, weight, stitching.  Sometimes it's a brand I would never be able to afford new, like JCrew or Loft, and sometimes it's just a vintage piece from the 1960s when clothes were more likely to be made of natural fibers and be really solidly constructed.  My favorite thing I learned about was what cashmere feels like to wear!  I can now just go into a thrift store and run my hands down the rack until I my hand feels merino wool, cashmere, real silk.  I've also gotten better at identifying them by sight.  I'm also more likely to shell out for one nice new item in a natural fiber from a brand with a reputation for durable, long-lasting clothes than to buy a whole wardrobe of "fast fashion" stuff.  I'd rather wear the same two merino sweaters in just two colors I love all winter (in a classic cut I can wear for years) than 20 "fashionable" cheapy synthetic sweaters that are "in style" for this year.  I still stay away from purely luxury-type brands, though, as they are both out of my price range, and because I think I can find stuff that's functionally almost as good without the markup for being brand name.  I've also finally recognized that it is worth it to take care of natural fibers properly and doesn't even take much time (especially considering I need less clothes overall because these wear more often better).  Thrifting is my friend!	episode_done:True

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:When I watched The Devil Wears Prada, I thought Miranda Priestly explained it pretty well for a plebeian like me:  "'This... stuff'? Oh. Okay. I see. You think this has nothing to do with you. You go to your closet and you select... I don't know... that lumpy blue sweater, for instance because you're trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back. But what you don't know is that that sweater is not just blue, it's not turquoise. It's not lapis. It's actually cerulean. And you're also blithely unaware of the fact that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns. And then I think it was Yves Saint Laurent... wasn't it who showed cerulean military jackets? I think we need a jacket here. And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers. And then it, uh, filtered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin. However, that blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs and it's sort of comical how you think that you've made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you're wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room from a pile of stuff."

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 24	labels:can someone elaborate on the difference between the following 5 types of coats?: peacoat, duffle coat, trench coat, top coat, and overcoat?
text:A peacoat is a specific type of wool coat.

A duffle cost I can’t remember the specifics but I think has a good and toggle buttons? Could be wrong.  A trench is a raincoat, generally cotton or at least not wool, usually tan, doubtle breasted, belted, mid thigh or knee length.  Top coat and overcoat are generally pretty interchangeable iirc longer wool coats , single breasted, wool. A lot of variety under those terms but usually a top coat is intended to be worn over a suit iirc.   Different manufacturers will use a lot of these terms interchangeably which can be confusing.	labels:The difference between a top coat and an overcoat is actually in the weight of the fabric; overcoats area heavier.

text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:So, look, I don't want to tell you _not_ to do this, but if I've understood correctly you're looking at creating a bloodborne-inspired victorian/traditional wardrobe. There are elements of that style that have mainstream appeal today, high-waisted wool trousers being one example. However, when you take them in context with the more "interesting" elements you picked out it gives off serious cosplay vibes. Perhaps you should take the fact that the only places offering this sort of clothing are Etsy/cosplay stores as a hint that you should reconsider this idea.  You might be thinking, _what about the cyber goth vampire Rick Owens fits I see on this sub?_ It's a valid question. The key difference is that the style you're going for here has _such_ a strong association with cosplay and videogames and so little mainstream appeal that the number one association people are going to make is that you are cosplaying. Doubly-so if you're wearing cosplay-quality clothes from cosplay vendors. While the Rick Owens aesthetic may not have mainstream appeal it _is_ very accepted within fashion circles and _doesn't_ have that strong cosplay association.  So with that said my advice is to take what you've got and tone it down. Treat it like a high-fashion runway show and take inspiration from it instead of trying to recreate it 1:1. High-waisted trousers, great. Gaiters? Maybe just get some actual boots. Bloodborne-style woolen collars/scarves/hooded shawls? Wear a regular scarf that has an interesting shape or texture, or a shirt with a more exaggerated collar. Maybe the fact that you can't find retailers selling this kind of stuff is the limitation you need to make it work in the real world.  Or maybe I'm just talking complete shite and someone smarter than me can help you more. I hope that I've at least broken the ice and said what needed to be said so that people can try to constructively help you.
text:I appreciate your comment and understand what you're saying. Like I said in the post, I have tried many aesthetics and styles through out the years and I really do think I know what I'm talking about when it comes to dressing well. I have no need to prove anything to you but in my own social circles I've always been the stylish one and most of my friends come to me for advice or do the exact thing that I'm doing here, which is ask me where to go to find certain items.  I just don't really understand the fascination with people wanting to tell me that what I'm looking for is wrong, and forgive me if I'm misinterpreting this, and then I should stop and look for something more mainstream and appropriate? I mean to me, isn't that part of fashion? To step out of your boundaries and try new things?   If all your comment is is a warning that I may look like a cosplayer,  then I appreciate it. But funny enough, I am also a cosplayer and I think there is a fine line between items that will look like everyday clothes vs costume pieces and I'm doing my best to find those.  And either way, you won't know until you try it :)	labels:> If all your comment is is a warning that I may look like a cosplayer,  then I appreciate it.  That's all it is. There are plenty of people who try e.g. the Rick Owens aesthetic and fail to pull that off because they don't have a feel for what works and what doesn't. Confidence is also a huge deciding factor in whether you're pulling it off or not. I'm not saying it isn't possible, just that you really have to know what you're doing in order to be successful with it.  Like the other guy who replied to me said, if you have to ask you probably shouldn't.  > I just don't really understand the fascination with people wanting to tell me that what I'm looking for is wrong  We get _a lot_ of people coming through here and asking our opinions on wearing cosplay gear. Some items are asked about so frequently that they've become huge in-jokes in the community (BR2049 coat, Drive scorpion jacket, Bloodborne trench coats) so the first assumption people are going to make, particularly here, is that you're another one of those people. When someone comes here asking if they can pull off a Bloodborne-style coat the answer is almost always no. Not in the contexts in which you want to wear it, not in the outfits you intend to pair it with, not if the quality is terrible, not if you don't have the confidence to not care what the majority of people will think.  There's nothing wrong with doing this if you know what you're doing. If you're sure that what I'm saying doesn't apply to you then I really hope you find what you're looking for.   I genuinely look forward to any posts you make in WAYWT because I'd love to see someone successfully pull this off! If you have any inspiration images for complete outfits perhaps you could put an album together and post it here.
text:I would love to post pics once I find some stuff! I think maybe that's where it's getting muddled up: I don't think I asked if I could pull it off, I was just asking where to get them.	labels:You didn't ask, but people often skip considering whether they _should_ before they go full steam ahead and start spending money. Since this is an advice sub and the people asking questions are generally new to this and unsure of what they're doing, people here tend to err on the side of caution especially when it comes to more niche styles like this.	episode_done:True

text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:I'm in my early thirties and live a comfortable life. In my early twenties I loved shopping for secondhand clothing and had a regular loop of my local thrift stores, Clothes Mentors, and consignment shops. I was always on the hunt for a good deal and was really developing my personal style (with a lot of experimentation and questionable choices.)  A few things that I've been reflecting on recently:  1. I no longer find shopping (specifically browsing) fun. Now I would much rather seek out a specific item on Poshmark and only shop to replace needed items or fill legitimate gaps.  2. Related to the above, I have a short list of brands that I buy and it's based on quality, warranty (I have a lot of outdoor/athletic gear), and environmental impact. Right now, I'm looking for a Patagonia Houdini for at least 50% off retail. I'm not in a rush to buy it but I'm also not aimlessly shopping for "a windbreaker" and then come home with three t-shirts. 3. Fabric/fit snobbery. I don't care if the cutest top I've ever seen is on clearance for $3... if it's 100% polyester it's just not coming home with me. Same with "I really like it, but if only it..." I have far more clothing than I need so there's never a moment where buying a pair of leggings is the difference between owning pants and going to work naked. I can wait till I find the perfect item.  4. Lifestyle creep is real! Across all my spending (groceries, clothing, hobbies) I just don't pay attention to the cost as much. I still have an upper threshold that gives me pause, but I don't have any month-to-month "oh, I can't afford that right now." Which, I really should be saying far more often!   All together, it takes most of the fun out of shopping because I am so picky and can usually say, "okay, I really don't need/want this."
text:Mid 30s, and this all rang so true for me. It was a sad day when I was finally honest with myself and realized I just don’t like “going shopping” anymore.  I used to be able to spend hours combing through the racks at Last Call or Off 5th looking for an amazing deal or whatever struck my fancy.   Now I know what I want, I want to price check a few other sites to make sure I’m getting a decent price, and I want to be done with it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Black Like Your Soul (and wardrobe) Friday	labels:Hubby and I bought a nondescript van at an abandoned vehicle auction and painted the CDC logo on the side. We’d roll up to the store, park right on the curb, and charge inside wearing hazmat suits and yelling for people to clear the area. It was a luxurious private shopping experience. We hauled our purchased goods out in a silver trunk marked “biological waste” and no one was the wiser.  The kids? Oh, we just left them in the vehicle. They would’ve blown our cover and whined incessantly about being hungry. Besides, I needed the room in my cart. I left it running, I’m not a monster...	episode_done:True

text:Do you think fashion or style has age restrictions?	labels:I'm mid-30s and I still wear that stuff on weekends! There is definitely stuff I avoid, but honestly, reflecting on it right now, that might be more my personal style at play than my age. I avoid anything too tight or clubby, and I  tend to go for block heels or pumps over stilettos or platforms. There was a whole going-out-top-nice-jeans trend in the 2000s that makes me avoid anything satin- or lace-based. But I think that Vans/Converse or crop tops/high-waisted jeans are definitely still in play if you're 30. And if that changes soon, I'd guess it's because the trends change rather than what is appropriate age-wise!
text:The 'going out' top! I just realised why I've avoided fancy tops from that era, I think I was firmly over the impracticality of them.   I wonder how soon halters and/or one long sleeve tops will be back?	labels:I've already been seeing one sleeve tops around a bit lately. And I'm in Perth, Australia which isn't exactly fashion central haha.

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:The most sustainable choice is the one that is already in your closet. If you already own something that wasn’t made ethically or sustainably, there’s no benefit in trashing it if you still like it and can use it. In a similar vein, there’s already so much clothing out there, that buying something second hand that’s still in good shape is often an option.  I think aritzia and j crew are still fast fashion, just more expensive fast fashion than old navy or forever 21- they’re still introducing tons of new products and feeding in to the consumerist drive to have the newest things.   No one is perfect, but we can strive to reduce our impact on an individual scale and aim to reduce our purchases, focus on buying used when it’s possible and try to purchase ethical and local when it’s not.  I definitely am not perfect on this front, but I try and buy from consignment shops as a first choice when I want something, and I’m working to choose smaller brands that have clear supply chains and ethical manufacturing. If it’s made in Canada (where I’m from) then that’s awesome.  At the end of the day I hope that my fashion choices exploit the least number of people and has the lowest environmental impact possible, and often that looks like me telling myself I don’t really need the new thing, even if I think it’s amazing and really really want it	episode_done:True

text:Why are they 2-3 times the price of Uniqlo?   At 60quid a polo, they are competing with Kent Wang.  The traditional retail price is just insulting to anyone who makes clothes or works with cloth.	labels:Their clothes are made in Europe, the fabrics mostly traceable and they cover about 15 sizes. All things Uniqlo doesn’t do.
text:Clothes made in Europe is irrelevant.  Cloth quality, pattern complexity and quality of finish and stitching is the mark of quality.   Their Polo costs 18gbp to make, but they sell for 60gbp (3.1x the cost).  Their profit margin hints about what kind of market they are aiming at. This is why i said their traditional price is insulting to anyone who sews and works with cloth.   They are a high end fashion brand using sustainability as part of their brand marketing.	labels:A 70% margin is entirely normal and maybe low for some apparel products.

I hope you enjoy it ❤️  P.S. just a note that the size twin app is going to be updated in the next week or so -- it's very out of date. If you follow me on IG that's the easiest way to hear about updates, but I can edit this comment when it's refreshed, too!   **(11/30 update if anybody is still reading -- the app is updated!)**  Edit: since so many of you are finding the tool mostly useless, I just wanted to say that the goal was to create something that would help you find fashion inspo from people who are more similar in size to you than a fashion model in a magazine.  Of course it's impossible to get an exact body double from just 3 measurements, but that's what the standard is, and that's what I could reasonably expect the average person to know about themselves. I have to make sure that the barrier to entry is very low. The more people can join this index, the more useful it is. Please remember that I offer this tool completely for free, that I don't work in the fashion industry, and that I don't have any background in the industry (fashion, data, or web design). I just wanted to do something helpful for the community. I will try my best to make as many improvements as I can over time, but I have very limited resources, and maintaining it is quite a lot of effort as is. Sorry, all!

We always had tons of fun! We were all roughly similar sizes but many different heights, styles, and budgets. Whatever wasn’t claimed at the end of the party was donated. It was always exciting when something fit someone else better than the original owner. I still have several pieces from those swaps.   Now that we’ve scattered across the country, I haven’t done a big swap in a while but when I’m cleaning out my closet, I do occasionally set aside an item or two that I know a friend would love or look great in. I know a few things have even been handed down to friends of friends - especially a lot of first office job clothes I bought at H&M that have made their way through 3 or 4 people now.	episode_done:True
text:Reliable brands to buy in South America - Americans your opinions please!	labels:/u/bestmaokaina might be able to help you.  Personally, I think Tommy, Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss, and some lines from Armani are all low-end brands that bank on their names and established supply chains and distribution networks to get attention for cheaply made, uninspired clothing. Some Armani clothing is better, but it's all drastically overpriced. Lauren Ralph Lauren and some Polo Ralph Lauren are the same; some Polo Ralph Lauren is pretty good, but you won't find it in a Macy's or equivalent. The really good Ralph Lauren clothing is mostly only sold in Ralph Lauren stores.  Lacose is fine. Nothing too special, but not trash.  Ermenegildo Zegna is quite good. Better than Z Zegna, not as good as zegna couture, pretty nice in general.

The cut of the dress would be on the looser side but not entering potato sack territory. Unfortunately although they seem to be trendy my body type said no ❤️ so I’m still searching for one.	episode_done:True
text:Cristophe Loiron of Mister Freedom - Inspiration Album	labels:I love Mister Freedom and own a few pieces. I’m especially fond of his Campus leather jacket and Road Champ boots - which I don’t have yet.  The shirt I have doesn’t fit me great. It’s too trim for me, even in size 42/xl.   The pants, however, fit fantastic and thread the line quite well between straight and wide. They’re high waisted fatigues with a 9 inch opening in a camo pattern of his own design that’s reminiscent of frogskin/ duck hunter camo.   Lately, the new workwear repro Labour Union (which isn’t union made, despite the name) have straight up copied his Ranch Blouse design. Fuck them.  Christophe Loiron has a personal blog where he talks about his products, his design process and his inspiration. It’s a great read if you like design and workwear.
text:I keep seeing those Labour Union ads on Instagram, so weird.	labels:The clothes appear to be well made and reasonably priced, but their marketing strategy is lousy AF. Workwear fetishism at it's finest + design theft = not a good look.
text:I wouldn’t necessarily say reasonably priced either when Gitman and stuff exist in the same price range and I don’t have to take a chance at buying an Instagram dropshipper brand haha   Edit: For shirts anyway.	labels:Well, you’re right that it’s not cheap either but we’re more into the territory of RRL alternative than Instagram dropshipper. There are a lot of things wrong with LA but it doesn’t appear to be a drop shipping site. They’re a lot like Bronson MFG, only Bronson doesn’t steal contemporary designs.

text:This. Get a cashmere cardigan and it will keep you warm. The buttons in the front give you some options for how warm you want to be, and it is easily taken off compared to a sweater in case you’re inside somewhere where the heater is on too high. Keep in mind that cashmere ranges in quality these days. Price is not always an indicator. Check how soft it feels and check the blend % (try to avoid polyester blends). I recommend trying to snag a high quality one during Black Friday sales or at an outlet.   You could also get a collared button up fleece shirt. You can wear it on top of a long sleeve shirt (unbuttoned/buttoned), it’s also easy to take off indoors, not to thick or much volume so it’s easy to throw into your briefcase/backpack, and if it get’s colder you can wear a cardigan on top of it all.   If it gets cold enough to where there’s ice on the roads and you feel like you’re freezing to death whenever you step outside, Uniqlo has some “heat tech” thermal pants that you can wear under normal pants, and nobody need notice. It makes all the difference in freezing temperatures.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:I don't think it's strange to feel that way! I tend to have a very eclectic style and enjoy trying out new unique/vintage charity shop finds, and this is something I've always struggled a little with.  This is one of these things where it just depends on whether you fit the occasion practically. For example, if you turn up to play a rugby game in stilettos, or go out into a snowstorm with just a cardigan, that's not a good idea. But is there any *practical* reason why you can't dress up a little more for drinks with friends?  With looks I'm less confidwnt on, I tend to go for practice runs first - that usually means just wearing it to the supermarket or to run errands where I'm not likely to see anyone I know, so I didn't have to worry about people's preconceptions. Sometimes I just try them on in my room and have a little dance party to some funky music, and that's still a way of getting used to seeing yourself in something!  There's always going to be someone who makes a comment about how you're 'very dressed up', or similar. These comments aren't usually even meant to be rude, but they often play into the little outfit insecurities that you already have! But the best part about this is that these kinds of comments get old pretty fast.  For every person who thinks you aren't standing out in a good way, there's going to be 10 people who admire your style and wished they could be as brave, even if they probably don't vocalise it. I can think of countless times where I saw an outfit I liked on a friend or stranger, but didn't actually say anything about it!	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls” catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your “fashion house designers” but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I’ve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.

I haven't had a haircut in almost 2 years and I'm not even wearing socks.   The worst part is that I spilled coffee on myself, so now I have a coffee stain on my chest for all of eternity.  I think it's safe to assume that I died from falling down the stairs or some shit after spilling coffee all over myself. I'm going to haunt the path outside my house because when the wind blows really hard, it actually howls down the path and it's spooky AF. I think I need all the help I can get, give the whole bathrobe situation. Though my coffee stain MIGHT pass for blood, so that's cool.  People aren't creative at all, so I'm probably going to get called something stupid like Bathrobe Witch. Or like, The Ghost of...

Plus no one needs to see the worn out hair tie, forgotten emergency tampon, fifty-seven cents, and squashed stick of gum in a flavor I don't even like that are going to instantaneously accumulate at the bottom of the bag as soon as I buy it.

text:When your personality and aesthetic don't quite match?	labels:I’m going to echo what others have said - this is *his* problem, not yours. It seems like to some extent he’s expressing that he knows what your “true style” is better than you - when more likely it’s just about what he likes best. I’m going to apply the benefit of the doubt here too... but I think you need to express to him that you’re happy with how you dress.  My partner once said early on that I dressed too colorfully for the area where we live - I was pretty firm that I was happy with how I dress and it’s never come up since then. In the past few years he’s even come to encourage my habits.   It’s someone reflecting their feelings on to you - hopefully when you let them know you don’t feel the same way, they’ll understand and their point of view will change. If it doesn’t, it’s probably not a good sign.	episode_done:True
text:PSA: Revive by Rent the Runway via Thredup	labels:I’d rather buy designer on ebay/poshmark from the seller directly, where I can ask questions and get a good sense of what I’m getting before I buy.   Anyone else think Rent the Runway/The Real Real would have been a better pairing? This kinda feels like how Amazon is trying to get into the luxury market...
text:Rent the Runway had to stop accepting new customers and pause regular customers in 2019 because their logistics are so shit. That on top of Covid, which causes all their stores to close, means they’re probably teetering on bankruptcy.  If I were with The Real real, I would stay far away from RTR from a financial and PR perspective.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Naughty or Nice?	labels:I am on Fashion Santa's **Nice** list this year! Even though I'm home all by myself and the only person who ever sees me is the Amazon delivery guy who I wait for by my window because *oh my god, I need human contact,* I'm still putting on a full face of makeup, doing my hair, and wearing spanx, a push-up bra, a sheath dress that fits like a second skin, 4" heels, and perfume.  I'm doing it for *me*, you know, because feeling sexy while I'm all by myself is much more important than being comfortable. Sure, it's easier to get coffee and cheeto stains out of my bathrobe than a 100% wool dress, but cheetos aren't sexy either.   For Christmas, Fashion Santa is going to bring me a brand new dress for every zoom event I have scheduled in 2021, because I would just die if people saw me wearing the same outfit week after week, which is definitely the kind of thing people are thinking about these days.

text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:I buy from The RealReal and sometimes Poshmark.   Poshmark has really good prices on some items, especially if I'm looking for something specific and not high-end, like a certain Express top I read about. (Ebay can be useful for this, too.) Prices on higher-end stuff aren't competitive IME, but I haven't looked for much in that range. Also be aware the shipping cost per item will add a good chunk to a cheap piece.  Prices on The RealReal are not cheap, but if you hang out a while you get a sense of what's decent, and sometimes you find something really neat for good deal. The best feature of TRR is measurements, something that's ruined me for other sites at that price point. It helps to be familiar with your own measurements and take into account materials and the shape of your body--I'm short, for example, so measurements are all well and good, but if my hips hit at the waist they don't mean much.   Caveats there: Be attentive to whether or not something is returnable; it's published on each listing. Bags usually aren't, as well as anything whose price has been marked down a lot. Also, shipping costs are $12 each way, so I eat the cost and buy several items in the same order, knowing I'll return half of them if they don't fit right. Shopping there successfully is a bit of a learning process, but I've really liked it overall.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - October 19	labels:Looking into my crystal ball, predictions for the future of fashion:  Like, 10 years from now some dumb brand is going to try to pull a Margiela on "MAGA" hats and appropriate them as part of a seasonal collection, altering them to turn them into a different piece, like painting the logo across the front so that it partly covers the text. The collection will largely be shot down as "too soon."  On the flipside though like 25 years from now I could imagine edgy hipsters appropriating them as their own form of "ironic" fashion. Ageing millennials will condemn it as inappropriate but the youth culture will only cling to it harder as being "subversive," in part perhaps because they don't fully grasp the cultural context of the late 2010s, a period they weren't even alive during.

text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I've been conscious of the impact of just buying junk for a lot of years now, but the current state of the world is just hitting even harder now and it's even MORE important to me that the things I buy are:   1. useful with what I already own,   2. actually going to make me happy longer than the "new stuff" endorphin rush lasts,   3. actually functional and as well-made and low-fuss as possible.   I just want things that I can put on, take off, wash, hang, and wear again time and time again without it being a fight. The 'YAY NEW THING' glow wears off almost by the time you get the shipping notice, so there has to be more reward in it for it to be worth it. There's more joy to be had (more long-lasting joy anyway) with finding new ways to wear old things. If I can remix a piece 9 different ways, I feel pretty baller about it! So that's my focus. If adding something new to the mix will make the remixing easier for lots of other items (a blazer, for example, that means I can wear 5 other tops to work that I couldn't before) then it's probably a good purchase. So I suppose "shop with long-term remixing in mind" is probably my biggest suggestion.  Personally I haven't had much luck thrifting but that's probably due to a champagne taste fighting with a beer budget city. Can't find treasures when the stock isn't super great. That said, we're at least stellar for used outdoor clothing and gear, so I guess I can't complain there.	episode_done:True

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.

So, every Monday is the same outfit, every Tuesday, etc...I knew that I had seen shirts before, but I had no idea I'd only seen 10 shirts total (warm weather and cold weather). She thought I was the most unobservant person ever, lol	labels:I feel like the only way to notice that is if you commonly have weekly meetings, and even then it would have to be pretty distinctive for me to actually pick up on the pattern.

I wear sneakers to work (Dr's office) and found the Reebok Man's World sneakers to have a similar look to AF1s but with a more unique vibe! I also love Saucony Shadow originals, but that's less of a trend and more of a personal favorite because they're the most confortable shoe I've ever owned.

text:I actually hate my Ruggable. I love the design, but it is horrible for a house with dogs that shed a lot. The only way I’ve found to get hair out of the rug is to get down and scrape it with my hands. Since using the vacuum with the brush (which would normally loosen hair) separates it from the Velcro and causes it to wrinkle, it’s impossible. Also, the edges are always rolling up.   Ok, end rant!	labels:Yeah the edges roll up like crazy on mine. And they are so flat, like zero plush at all. I do really like their designs though.	episode_done:True

text:What designer bags and eras do you think will come back in fashion 2021-2022?	labels:I think bags with a lot of hardware and buckles will come back. Mulberry is relaunching the Alexa tomorrow and I suspect a little bit of a comeback of big slouchy casual bags like the Alexa, the Balenciaga City and some of the hardware-heavy (literally) Chloe designs.  Small shoulder bags, Prada Nylon, the Fendi Baguette and the Dior Saddle won‘t be going anywhere.  If anything, I fear that Nylon bags are coming back with a vengeance... bags with lots of pockets, compartments... those ridiculous prada boots with the little pouches are just the beginning.
text:While I love the maximalist style...this is definitely the part I really didn't love. The Uber casual and slouchy look was something I didn't even like when it was in style before (insert sweater boots)	labels:I definitely prefer a middle ground between slouchy and structured for practicality alone. And I never look cute and casual with slouchy bags either.   It might be fun to hunt for a nice vintage bag that fits this style but with the current designer prices, I won‘t be participating in that trend 😅	episode_done:True

text:The war 100% made those things acceptable for women to wear. It also finally killed off the corset, shortened skirts, and introduced sportswear. It’s also a big reason why 1920s fashion features a lot of sportswear and more straight, androgynous silhouettes for women.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Is anyone into MBTI? Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels:INTJ. I basically wear the same outfit every day with (slightly) different colors and fabrics. Long sleeve, fitted, shallow v-neck shirt/sweater; "cigarette" style pants/jeans (or joggers while working from home/being comfy); ankle boots or pointed flats. Everything is solid color; some color blocking when I am feeling adventurous. Everything I wear in public fits well, and any structured piece gets tailored. I like nice fabrics, and the clothing \*must\* make \*me\* look good.  If I could get away with it, everything in my closet would be navy (or at least a dark color). After being accused many times of wearing the same outfit multiple times a week, I have learned to add in flashes of color/accessories to make it clear that yes I am indeed wearing a different outfit than yesterday thanks.

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.

I have all kinds of office appropriate slacks and cardigans and button up shirts in cutesy patterns, casual jeans and sensible shoes.

And the cost aren't cheaper than made in china or your amazon/walmart stuff, it's usually a bit higher. It's awkward to ask for refunds on bad stuff, they dont open 7 days a week, poor/niche selection, dress rooms are mostly closed for obvious reasons.  Small local busineses just dont have any reasons for me to buy and that's a harsh but honest truth.	episode_done:True

text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I've written about this before, but as someone who is 5'2 on a good day, I have stopped giving a shit about looking "longer and leaner."  In fact, I reject the idea that I should want to look taller. Maybe all those 5'7 women should be taking advice on how to make their legs look as stubby as mine. <--Obviously a joke but to make a point. How stupid is it that I should feel like my natural body is something to correct?  I'm an old woman, lol, and over the course of my life I have never found that my stubby legs (that I was once self-conscious about) have kept me from career advancement or from finding people who thought I was beautiful and wanted to have sex with me, so what's the freaking problem?  Fuck conventional figure flattery.  That being said, of course there are things I think look better on me than other things and I tend to wear the things I think look better in ways I think look better most of the time.  Except when the comfort or beauty of a garment is so outstanding it overrules that.  Thanks for coming to my TED talk.  There are cookies on the table in the back.

text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:I think it depends on the bag you want! If you really truly want a specific Dior bag for example but don’t want to spend $3k on it, you could probably spend about $300 on a nice rep. If you actually just want a specific shape/leather type, you can probably look at Coach and Tory Burch, or even smaller contemporary brands like Mansur Gavriel or Polene.  I’d recommend making a wishlist of bags and write out pros and cons of getting authentic pieces vs replicas, including price and how much you actually want it.  For a while I’ve been spending money on contemporary brands and a few auth designer bags, but recently I’ve been fulfilling my bag wishlist through reps and it feels liberating honestly. You can save money and still get the bag you truly want, and if there’s a bag you really like and you want to support the designer in some way besides wearing their logo/brand, you can always save up for and buy the auth.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 11, 2021	labels:2020 was probably the worst year of my life (most of the year was ok but nov/december was so awful it dragged it all the way down), but a serious silver lining was that i lost close to 35 lbs. i've been overweight pretty much all my life but not what most people would consider obese. still, it has always affected my self-esteem and confidence, and i was at my peak weight at the start of 2020, 235 lbs.  I cannot overstate how taxing it was to not see the scale budge downward for so long and always seemingly ticking up. a suit I had bought a year prior to fit comfortably after I gained weight was starting to not fit, real "ah shit here we go again" moment. at the start of the pandemic though, i lost 14 lbs in like two months and was ecstatic. i ticked another 10 or so lbs downward before I plateaued and you know, I was happy about it because I never felt hungry and I had a consistent lifestyle and it was good that I could live like that and not gain or lose weight at all. Then, I came down with food poisoning in december and barely ate for like a week and lost another 10 lbs (hardly healthy but in 2020 i'll take the good with the bad). Even after getting better and feeling good again I have kept that weight off and now weigh under 200 lbs for the first time in years. I'm ecstatic for more progress in 2021 and hopefully finally being confident enough to buy the dope clothes I want and not worrying that I look bad in them.  It's so interesting what relativity does to you. I'm 198 lbs rn, but I was last that weight when I was a senior heading off to college and felt awful about it. Now, I feel fucking great and way more confident than I was before. Funny things. The mission is 170 lbs but I'll be happy to be between that and 180. Sorry for the paragraphs but I know this forum more than almost anywhere will understand struggles like this, especially for guys.

Now, I feel fucking great and way more confident than I was before. Funny things.   I've been losing weight for the last year; weight I've carried with me for far too long now.  When I have started to plateau (normally because I'm eating too many calories or not exercising enough), I weigh myself and tell myself that I will either be really happy or really sad to see myself at my present weight again, and it's my choice to decide which it will be.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:I’d doubt that Amazon offers enough quality pieces to really redo your wardrobe.  If you’re 21 and not really making money yet I still wouldn’t look for the cheapest items and “biggest steals.”  I’d look to add pieces here and there as I go along that fit the weather/routines you’re currently experiencing.  I’m not advocating for buying overpriced pieces either, just simply stating that just because you may be able to buy a “complete wardrobe” off Amazon you may be very disappointed in your choices if your wardrobe is shot by the time you’re 23.  Good quality clothes can last forever, and the money you spend will stretch further.	episode_done:True
text:Do you name your favorite outfits?	labels:Hahahah, I love this! my boyfriend started saying “you look like a ....” and I remember that every time I wear these two outfits:  1.

text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:It’s depended on the person. In general it’s been “smart casual”, with women in mostly black dresses or black blouse and pants/skirt, and men in a button up (with or without tie) and black pants/jeans.   The last funeral I went to was for my partner’s grandfather; he was a big bold man who liked bright bold shirts and hated black. We wore the loudest shirts we could get our hands on, most were made by my MIL. True they were still button ups but they definitely shunned the traditional funeral wear.
text:That’s so cool. I love when funerals and memorial services have a distinctive dress code that honors the person being mourned.	labels:So do I, it was definitely the cheeriest looking funeral procession I’ve ever seen and we were all commenting on how much he’d have loved it. And honestly, we all felt almost *happy*, like we were celebrating his life rather than mourning his death. There were a lot of tears, but there were a lot of laughs and smiles. It’s hard to be glum when you’re in a bright yellow shirt, two sizes to big, with cacti printed all over it! It really was a beautiful way to remember him and send him off.	episode_done:True
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:Earth tones are a BIG winner if you're trying to reach outside of the standard dark tones like Black/Blues. The next ring up from White is most definitely a CREAM/OFF-WHITE shade. Grab an assortment of camel/chestnut browns too. & then find some mute shades of Green (not emerald or teal), but more like green shade that are within range of a Matcha green color....and voila! The start of an awesome color range.	episode_done:True
text:Closet Organization By Color	labels:I have my clothing organized not only by color but by similar hues and tones. Like I don't just throw all my pinks together. Light muted pinks go with light muted pinks, baby pinks go with baby pinks, and so on.	episode_done:True

text:What are your go-to basic fall tops? I’m talking long sleeve tees, sweatshirts, turtlenecks etc!	labels:Uniqlo heattech under shirts! They allow me to actually wear my lighter flannels and other "spring" items like trench coats without freezing. My style tends towards more "tailored" than "cozy" so these are super helpful, but they go great under sweatshirts as well!  Nowadays with the pandemic, I have ended up wearing lounge wear way more often than I normally would have and it's surprised me how different they can feel with longer-term wear! In the past I just kind of thought that a sweatshirt is a sweatshirt, they're so baggy anyway so what does it matter. But now I have a very clear preference. My favourite sweatshirts are definitely Roots, they retain that "coziness" for much longer than my other ones. My Forever 21 ones turned stiff pretty quickly, which wasn't surprising. My H&M ones also turned stiff and kept getting skinnier and skinnier, and I swear it wasn't me gaining weight lol. My Nike ones also got skinnier, but it didn't turn stiff or lose colour, and the zipper kept its shape well.   My favourite tee shirts are actually my old American Apparel ones, they somehow managed to get more cozy with every wash without going ratty, although the screen-print is fading. Although I'm aware that the management of AA (or Los Angeles Apparel now) have justifiably raised questions around ethics and bigotry, so it's up to the individual whether you're comfortable with their products.	episode_done:True
text:Gorpcore: How Arc’teryx Parkas and Salomon Hiking Boots Became High Fashion	labels:This style has been popular since I can remember in high school (I’m 31 now and grew up East Coast close to DC). If you had a North Face or Helly Hansen jacket back then, you were cool (and also had money). It was kinda funny seeing kids rock their NF Steep Tech jackets to class when we don’t get THAT much snow here. My wardrobe now mostly consists of Patagonia, LL Bean, and North Face. I love the retro designs from the 90s that are coming back.   I have to say, Patagonia is by far my favorite brand. Quality pieces that both look good and are practical that last for years. It’s an expensive brand but worth every penny IMO.	episode_done:True
text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:I wouldn't say I inherently hate the brand but I think Champion is an example of a brand that exploded a few years back/to now basically all because some celebrities or whoever wore it- and everyone who wears it now is most likely a ding dong hypebeast type or the VSCO type girl or whatever. Like I'm old enough to remember it being bottom tier Wal Mart level shit you'd get borderline made fun of for wearing- but now all of the sudden it's enjoying this moment. So it's just that perceived inauthenticity and collective pivot in peoples' minds to a fashion name to people rather than just athletic apparel that irks me somehow.  However though, the Todd Snyder Champion stuff is PHENOMENAL- it's not the mainline stuff. You don't see any of those assholes rocking that.

I always felt like that wasn’t me and it didn’t fit my more big busted body type. But I just took a job where I’m WFH most of the time and going into the office occasionally and I can wear whatever I want. So I’m excited to explore!!!	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 03, 2020	labels:So, it turns out “””Escape Room””” is not a genre but more akin to a quirk of spotify’s algorithm that just so happened to coincide with a handful of artists I don’t remember listening to this year. Basically they analyze not just the genre of the artists you listen to, but what also what artists you listen to together, and I guess break it down into the smallest bubble of artists that other people also listen to together and ig just give it a random name for categorial purposes...which is not how you fucking define a genre and leads to weird shit like Xiu Xiu, Aphex Twin, and ASAP Ferg being in the same “”””genre””””, but, whatever, mildly interesting peak under the hood of the machine, and my friend got “city building pop” so I guess it could be more bs  In other news, anyone else feel like beginning of the year was weighed a lot more heavily than the end?

text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I finished up grad school last year and started working full time, so I totally went through that transition. For me, I don’t have a set clothing budget, but I do have a monthly “wants” budget that clothing purchases go into. I try to be strategic and identify gaps in my wardrobe and work from there, buying things as I have the money/need for them. It has been a big change going from mostly buying secondhand to having more to spend, but I still love to thrift/posh etc. My budget now is significantly more than it was in grad school though, so I have more flexibility.   One of the more difficult parts for me was feeling like I needed nicer, high quality items for work. Those get expensive! For example I recently bought a wool dress coat since I only had a parka. I am lucky in that my work is quite casual, so most of my wardrobe works for both work and casual stuff.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 25, 2020	labels:Why do people ask if it’s ok to wear WW2 era German military garments casually? Why is this not even the first time people have asked this? Why is the reaction to being told no “well, but what about”? Are my expectations just too high or???  Like, I think choosing to cosplay as a WW2 Gerrman soldier in your free time is incredibly sus to begin with but at least that’s under the pretext “reenactment” but why do you think it’s ok to just throw on random articles of clothing from that group for going around town?

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:First for cardigans and sweaters is I either go fully wool or fully cotton. Can’t be any sort of blend, and I avoid mohair. I have a cotton cardigan from urban outfitters that’s like 5-6 years old and looks brand new, so you don’t even need to go super pricey, just look at fabric content.  Second is I wash everything on cold, and hang dry as often as possible. Heat basically transforms fabric, so using it is unnecessary. I also find that it sets pit stains instead of removes them.  Shoes I have no idea. I walk a lot and constantly wear out shoes. I find leather with a sewn in sole lasts a lot longer, but flats and heels never last that long. I’ve also had luck with shoes that have wooden soles which I’ve added a sole with traction to.  For bags, I’ve always heard it’s bad luck to keep them on the ground, but that’s more superstition than keeping it nice lol.
text:Yes! This! Also, washing them too often will destroy them quickly. I usually hang them and let them air for a day or two after wearing them, then re-wear them, and do so until they really need to be washed. Of course it only applies to outer layers, not underwear.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:This subreddit has a serious hate boner for synthetics and I will never understand why. It seriously depends on the fabric and the purpose of the garment. Not all rayon or viscose or polyester or nylon is the same. It's like you said, the Uniqlo heattech or their amazing wrinkle-free perfectly drapey rayon blouses are so good. Is all rayon wrinkle free or behave like that? lol no... Which is why you need to look at reviews or touch the material yourself. When you touch it, you can just tell it's good...  Not all "natural" materials are elegant or good either. Sometimes stuff like linen is so trash-bag wrinkly. Sometimes cotton/linen/silk really holds in the sweat and makes you stink, or forms sweat stains on your pits, whereas there's loads of moisture wicking poly athletic clothing or super expensive technical gear for hiking or professional sports which is designed for a specific purpose from synthetic material that keeps you ultra dry, ultra cool, whatever it may be. Poly is also good UPF protection from the sun. Some of my most expensive hiking gear is made from polyester. There is some clothing I own, which I can toss in the washing machine, and after the spin cycle, it's completely dry, without the dry rack.   Acrylics can be super itchy and pilly, or be super tightly woven, soft, and incredibly durable. It really depends. You can't just look at the label and put it away because "omg ew polyester 100%" you need to touch it, stretch it, scrape your nail against it to see how the fabric performs.   tl;dr There's loads of great high quality fabrics in all materials whether it's natural fiber or man-made and I don't really have any negative opinion of anything until I see it in person, and touch it and wear it and I don't think it should matter at all, so long as you personally like it

text:Anyone like wearing traditional clothing from you culture?	labels:I also love wearing my cultural wear! I was born and raised in the US, but my parents are from Vietnam. Our traditional dress is the áo dài, and I just think it’s so beautiful. It’s such an elegant piece of clothing and literally makes any girl look good, no matter what size or shape you are. I’d love to wear it as part of everyday wear, but it looks a bit formal for most occasions. I have seen some more modern versions and a bit trendier versions, so I’m trying to get my hands on that. As for now, I just wear my cultural dress to church on Sundays, which is a more appropriate setting.  But I wouldn’t worry yourself about what your mom has to say about it. If it you like it and it makes you feel good, then why not wear it? I bet you look amazing in them, it sounds so cute!

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 22, 2020	labels:Why are hooded garments almost never modeled with the hood up?   I  keep my head shaved (bald) and prefer hoods to hats. Part of my problem  is a lot of hoods don't land far enough forward on my head so I want to  see them modeled with the hood up. Most of my problem is that when I'm  shopping online about 90% of hooded garments are not modeled with the  hood up. It seems intentional, anyone know why?  Admittedly I want my hood to fall farther forward than most might, like to my  eyebrows, but most of what I order and see online, when they are  modeled, land with the edge behind the top of the forehead. I get that  this is consistent with the hat trend of wearing the edge behind the  hairline, for whatever reason, but I'm looking for function over style.	episode_done:True

text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:Hmmm ... Yes, but ...  I look at clothing as a cost-over-time  So an £80 pair of shoes that will last £8-10 years is 'par' because that's what I'm used to - a £300 pair that lasts 20 years is 50% over par at least  Likewise I have a £2 T-shirt from Primark that hasn't shrunk, pilled, nor gotten baggy after 5+ years - no other T-shirt is going to come close to that setting for par  People say you should buy 'quality' clothes that will last decades, but a £20 or £50 T-shirt will be just as ruined as the £2 one by a tear or stain, so buying 'over par' clothes can be financially ridiculous

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 21	labels:Can anyone point out wool blend differences? Seeing 60% wool with some nylon vs some wool with cashmere, some with poly and some with a mixture of all. What’s the difference between these different blends and what can anyone recommend for an overcoat ? (like a car coat). Thanks from now
text:the poly/nylon fiber is usually used as a monofilament core of the yarn which then weaved into garment.  one of the purpose is to add strength and durability to the garment at a lower cost because better wool that can be spun into weaving yarn of the same durability as synthetic blend is more expensive.  other than that, the synthetic core also adds wrinkle and shrink resistance because again, they're the core of the weaving yarn which means the wool fibers that wrap around them more or less follows the behavior of the core.  one of the negative aspect of synthetic core yarn is reduced warmth. wool fibers aren't exactly solid, it have a lot of microscopic air pockets that acts as insulator (in the same method of down filling insulates body heat). monofilament synthetic yarns don't have this, which makes it less warm.	labels:	episode_done:True

I found a really good deal on a 100% wool coat, but in men's...	labels:It'll be fine wearing it open, but it'll be tight around the bust and hips if it's closed.    Plus there might be more shoulder padding to give you an exaggerated V shape. Fine if you're intentionally going for an androgynous look, just don't expect it to look/fit like a women's coat.

I recommend everyone learn how to properly launder their clothing.

text:What’s your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:Mine is flannel so I might not be much help lol  But on a serious note - thin undershirts that are not cotton t shirts for when you don’t want to do the bulky layers thing. I have a silk weight “capilene” patagonia one for when it’s really super cold and I’ll be outside and some similar ones that tbh were army issued, so I’m sure you could find the same sort of thing without going to patagonia levels of expense. It’s kinda shocking how much warmth you get from them.   If I’m not anticipating being outdoors much, I’ve got an assortment of cuddlduds, thin modal tees off Amazon, and some bamboo ones. If I want to wear a lighter more fashionable blouse or thinner sweater or something I can put a layer underneath and still be warm without making my shirt too tight (and they are thinner/more snug/less spongy, as well as warmer, than a tee).

text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:The present always feels “neutral”. I think if you watch any reality show from the early 2010s, even as late as 2014-15, you’ll see a big difference from what was considered “no defining silhouette” then. things like just a tshirt change slightly in cut and shape over time.
text:Yeah, exactly. Like I would say the most fashionable t-shirt cut a few years ago was a v-neck with capped sleeves. Before that, a very long v-neck with longer fitted sleeves (think American Apparel). Now I would speculate that it's either a fitted cropped crew-neck or an over-sized unisex t-shirt. I'm not saying people only wear those types of ts at those times, but that's what is and was most current.     I do think that trends are changing more quickly and thus fewer people can (or bother to) keep up so wearing the exactly what's in vogue right this second is less important than it used to be.     I also think that younger people tend to prioritize being on trend more. Teens in particular are usually still growing so they need new clothes more often anyway. As you get older and spend more time around other older people, your definition of "current" changes. More formal clothing tends to be more timeless too, so once you're wearing work wear 5 days a week the definition of "current" seems to shift.	labels:>Like I would say the most fashionable t-shirt cut a few years ago was a v-neck with capped sleeves.

Oh holy shit, that's such an on point observation though! I still *have* a couple of these v-neck tshirts, which I bought in the first half of the 10s mostly. But I don't really wear them anymore, since most of my basic tshirts nowadays are boxier, more unisex like tshirts with a higher neckline.    I don't think I was even aware of this trend until just now!	episode_done:True

text:The Conscious and Somber Decision of Solid Jacketing	labels:I'm a big fan of patterned pants, and thus solid jackets.

text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I work in an office where "casual Fridays" are very casual. I'm currently wearing a yellow buffalo check Levi's shirt with jeans and sneakers. Sometimes I'm super casual (jeans and a plain t-shirt) or semi-dressy (last week I wore red kitten heels with a white pussycat bow shirt tucked into ankle length high waisted boyfriend jeans). I've also worn said boyfriend jeans with a lavender terry cloth cropped Nike sweatshirt over a white button down and brown ankle booties. Basically I wear anything I own that I can't wear to work Mon-Thurs. It's my favourite day to style because I can take some fashion risks and I love to style super casual with dressier pieces!	episode_done:True

So I took in the side seams and added darts and got it to fit perfectly, then wore it all the time, and it was probably more the confidence than the coat but my hopes about getting what I wanted with him were more than realized.

text:I haven’t shopped at Lululemon in years (seriously, probably 8 yrs) & I always loved the brand, but fell off the athleisure train.  I went online to order a pair of high rise, plain black, full length leggings hopefully slimming & the product ratings were just so bad that it surprised me and deterred me!  Do you have a specific style that you recommend?!	labels:Honestly, I think lululemon reviews skew negative bc sale styles/colors are non-returnable - unless you can convince them that there was a quality defect with the pair you received. And the easiest way to get CS to initiate a quality return/exchange seems to be leaving a negative review...   Personally I love align leggings for everyday (knowing that they will eventually pill... but for me at least, usu more like a year or two in), fast & frees for lightweight running/spin (pockets!!!) and wunder unders or wunder trains for more of a sleek compressive feel (probably the best at achieving the slimming look you’re going for?).

text:Contour is just the name of the bodysuit line from the brand! It’s more of just an actual garment instead of shape wear since the material is not as super stretch but it is definitely very slimming and hugging. I typically wear it as an easy basic top, it can be dressed up with a nice pair of high waist pants, heels, and mid length coat. I’ll dress is down with slim sweats and a long sleeve crew bodysuit and white sneakers just to look cozy comfy but still decently put together	labels:Aaah I get you!

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:I live in a small space so I try to make my pieces wearable throughout the year. I always wear a cami, jeans/shorts, and ankle boots. My open knit cardigan works all year round. You really have to be realistic and ask if you’re going to wear it in the next couple of years and how you’re going to store it. I would get rid of things that you could easily replace and polyester/polyamide (because it’s not as breathable and caused me bacne).   For the third piece, consider accessories. Belts, necklaces, bracelets, scarves, bags, hats, and earrings can add interest to your outfit.	episode_done:True
text:What’s your everyday purse?	labels:I don't really have an every day purse as I like to switch purses depending on what I need for the day, what I'm doing, and also to add an additional stylish element to my outfits.   I really like clutches (think Clare V size and shape- preferably with a wrist strap) and have collected probably 30 of them over the years in a variety of colors, textures, patterns. Very simple way to add a touch of something to an outfit. They also travel easily as they essentially pack flat, so you can bring several and use them to change up your simple travel outfits.   But if I'm shopping or doing something where I need to be hands-free, then it's a cross body. I have a few of these but my most often used is the Lo&Sons Waverly. I do like this brand and also have their laptop bag with the interchangeable sleeves. I just noticed they have a new fanny pack style... hmmmmm... gotta check that out! My other favorite cross body, which is a bit more spacious and dressier and can act as a satchel, I think is a Coach but you wouldn't know it (I hate obvious branding).  If I need room for more stuff then I've got a choice between a white leather backpack and a black leather backpack.   I don't really like totes, shoulder bags, or satchels any more. There was a time when I had a lot of those, but these days I prefer a bag that's smaller and not too heavy to carry. Got tired of having shoulder pain or wrist pain, but I'm a grumpy old middle aged woman. Rock it while you can.	episode_done:True

text:Thank all of you	labels:So a number of people are telling you not to buy a bunch of AE shoes because they are “entry-level” and that you may eventually want to move up in price. This is true, but consider that anyone saying this has become a hobbyist who appreciates and collects high-end footwear, and therefore retroactively views AE as a gateway drug that led them to discover a new hobby. This implies a linear progression from spending $350 on shoes — an amount 98% of men would find insane — to eventually spending $1000+ on shoes, which is completely bonkers to all but a very small number of people.  Definitely wait a bit and avoid buying a dozen pairs of AEs too quickly. But also consider that if AE makes you happy and your goal is to amass a rotation of multiple good-quality shoes in different styles and colors, it’a perfectly acceptable to avoid leveling up. You don’t *have* to keep buying progressively more expensive stuff, and can instead enjoy what’s in a price tier you’re comfortable with.
text:>You don’t have to keep buying progressively more expensive stuff, and can instead enjoy what’s in a price tier you’re comfortable with.  This is one of the most level headed responses on the page and something that resonates with me. Basically all of my shoes are in the $300-$450 USD range and while I like having quality shoes and want to talk about GYW shoes and raw denim and stuff, it just is unfathomable for me to spend US$500+ on shoes at this time. Maybe when I'm making $200k a year I can think about spending that kinda money on shoes but it just doesn't make sense to me.  And, truly, if you're buying even a pair of AEs. If you don't wear them like a tool box, you will have them for years to come anyway.  Some of the other brands like Enzo Bonafe, John Lobb, etc, that other people have rec'd might not end up resonating with OP. They might, but they don't have to. I can appreciate people opening OPs eyes to other high end brands but it isn't necessary to buy them.  Hell, my most complimented shoes I have are a pair of Cole Haan Zero Grand sneaker oxford hybrids that my SO made me buy.  So a lot of the time, buying the high end shoes is only gonna matter to one person, that being the wearer. So buy whatever you want. Just make sure you do your best to get it to fit right.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:Is anyone else kind of tired of posts and comments that variously try to "justify" the price of obvious luxury goods, designerwear, etc.?  Good thread on the SLP teddy, but just about nothing in there is surprising. Is it well-constructed? Duh, it's SLP. Does it have little refinements all over, compared to everyday varsity jackets? Yeah, that's kind of the point. Is it "worth" $2,000? No, obviously not.   Like...at some point we need to acknowledge that these efforts are misguided, even if well-intentioned. You're buying SLP because it's SLP (or Ackermann, or Dick Ovens, or whatever your thing is). *That* is the justification. And that's a fine justification in and of itself! An analysis of the materials and construction is unlikely to throw up surprises that'll make people go "damn, that really makes it worth the obnoxious price tag!"   (This observation does not apply to bespoke clothing, where the justification genuinely is that you get something more or less customized for you, and you alone.)  What do people think?
text:I feel one of the issues is that in this subreddit we have:  1.  A group of people who genuinely want to know why people make large purchases (people just getting into fashion, hearing about spending more to get better quality leather/materials). I was in this group for a while.  2. A group of people who are looking for the absolute cheapest way to get into fashion, they often take pride in getting things for cheap and some even get a sense of superiority for getting the same look without spending as much as "suckers" who buy designer fashion.  3. Hobbyists who have the money to spend on exact items they want.   I genuinely think that one of the issues that causes people to butt heads in this subreddit is when the hobbyists feel they need to justify their purchases when confronted with the question "why?"  Getting the exact item they have searched for is a valid enough reason, and trying to invent other reason to "justify" a purchase often causes confusion for people who are trying to get involved in fashion and are genuinely asking "why is this item worth it?" When I first was looking for new footwear, the number of times I was told that $500 boots were worth it because how long they would last was absurd.	labels:>when the hobbyists feel they need to justify their purchases when confronted with the question "why".  Agreed. It's this justification that I think is ultimately pointless, even after explaining all the little details that make it special.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:I shop a lot on Poshmark and I find it helps to think of it as “slow” fashion. I don’t expect the instant gratification of typical online shopping.   I search for brands that are typically out of my price range, that I love. I save things by liking them and wait to see if the seller will make me a reasonable offer. People sometimes give amazing deals if something has been sitting long enough.   As others have said, use those filters!
text:I've been able to get some great deals by finding a specific item I'm interested in and then doing a new search for just that item. I look through the available listings and if they're all in the same or similar condition I like all of the lower priced ones and wait for the offers to come in.  I do sometimes make offers myself, kinda depends on how much I want the item and how unique it is. Like, I'm much more likely to make an offer on something vintage that I know I won't easily find another of. I have one in my likes right now I'm waffling on but I really do want it. For offers, typically you can expect to make an opening offer around 50-60% of the list price and still be considered reasonable, especially in reseller closets. (Full disclosure I do flip on PM as a small side hustle, I mostly use the funds to buy new things for myself.) There's a 20% commission fee and the shipping discount comes out of the seller's pocket, so they generally list higher to account for these in their profit margins. If I'm lazy and just want the item sometimes I just make an offer that essentially gives myself free shipping lol, better margin for the seller so they're more likely to accept.	labels:	episode_done:True

And I'm not in love with the black-forward color scheme here. Plasma's look is also more tame than usual, no crazy colors, but the first background was... cheating, really. The long cardigan worked. And is that all color 8? And the scarf being worn asymmetrically like that is a plus for me. Tame, overall, but... really solid.  \--> /u/ngoknows <-- v. /u/chunsak \-- I'd say NGO ahs the most interesting fit here, for me, with the big, fun, scarf. I like the asymmetry in the first photo...

text:Knee-high boots, classy heels, or trendy sneakers?	labels:Well I have been wearing sneakers with dresses/skirts on a regular basis since I was around 13 or so. Typically minimal types or when I was way younger even Keds. I am 42 now so that is like 30 years.   I also like pointy flats and those are a more walkable and polished option - and have been doing so since my early 20s. I also like ankle boots and have also been wearing those since my 20s.    These 3 are the shoes I wear the most - pointy flats, ankle boots, and sleek sneakers. I wear a lot of flats - those get the most use. The other two are regulars that can be a bit more seasonal.  In the before times it would be something like 4-5 days a week with flats and 2-3 days of sneakers. And in the winter or rainy season the boots replace the flats for many days.   I do not do heels very often and have been swapping out the ones I have for block heels since they do not get messed up on sidewalk grates. I love a slingback or mule so those are the styles I get the most.   I do not do knee high boots for a myriad of reasons.

Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:To put it bluntly, 100% privilege plays a role in the way people dress because there is increased access to options (including natural fibres, so called “sustainable” clothing, tailoring, etc) that are completely inaccessible for the majority of others.
text:100% on privilege. Over the past few years, I’ve slowly transitioned much of my wardrobe to natural fiber clothing (with the exception of athletic wear - but now there’s recycled options at least!). And I know it’s a privilege to do so, now that I’m further in my career. A $300 slow fashion, locally produced w/ fair wage, pasture raised wool sweater simply isn’t accessible for most. And even secondhand, it’s not cheap by any means. This is why as problematic as Everlane is as a brand, I won’t judge someone for buying a much more affordable wool cardigan there instead of from babaa, if it better fits their financial needs.  However, trends are for sure more physically accessible now than before with e-commerce and social media, for better or for worse. It’s interesting - I’m in my early 30s, so our generation was in jr high / high school just as e-commerce was starting. We were one of the first Facebook user cohorts. I grew up in a sleepy suburb that was ~2 hours from a large city. We had an OK mall, Macy’s was our fanciest department store. Whenever a girl wore something from Nordstrom’s, everyone oohed and ahhed because not only was it more expensive, but you had to be fairly privileged to travel to the city to go shopping.   I still remember our family visiting my older brother in another major city, and he took me to an Urban Outfitters store for the first time. I thought all the clothes were _so cool_ and how awesome that the people had local access to that store?? And now it’s both visually and ‘physically’ accessible through the internets (with their problems as well). In that sense, I do think it’s great - but the trade-off is the exacerbation of fast fashion with trends cycling through and consumed at lightning speed.	labels:Wow this takes me back to the first time I went to an Urban Outfitters! Still have the graphic shirt I bought from there, now with holes and no print left on the front. Hell, even Forever21 was a brand that was intriguing to the girls in my hometown because you had to have the money and time to be able to drive two hours to the mall!	episode_done:True
text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:It seems the current census is that no brand can be trusted to keep a high quality, and 30+ year old vintage is the only way.  Brands might be lauded for their quality/price for a few years until the constant push for higher profit every year makes them produce the same disappointing clothes as all other dying mid-range brands.  I never really see quality as a selling point for clothes anymore. It might be hidden in some company statement with promises of green washing. But all brands want you to come back the next season, not encourage you to buy and use something for *years*.	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:Often all it takes to look put together is a good shoe. My daughter in her mid twenties spends very little time or money on clothes. She likes to wear whatever falls into her life (mostly friend’s castoffs); but she wears them with a nice pair of oxfords and a fun and eye-catching pair of socks and she looks great.	episode_done:True
text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I passed on buying "THE" Zara dress last summer because where I am the markup is crazy, I tried it on but ultimately decided I couldn't justify the equivalent of around €60 for shit material, and it's not like Zara's poor business practices are a secret.  Recently, I started thinking about it again, how it would be great for work/some (COVID responsible) events I've been to recently.  I figured it's almost a year out of season, people must be bored of it by now, there are no thrift shops where I am so I took a chance on eBay and nabbed it for €20, it's in the post on the way to me and I'm feeling quite chuffed with myself.	episode_done:True

I was just daydreaming of where to find more options on another tab actually.. I'm really short though so I've been shopping in the little boys section. Tuck one of those bad boys into a nice pair of pants or longer skirt and I'm living my modern Mrs. Frizzle dream.   Also love bell bottoms! Those are hard to find though for people under 5ft. lol

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:The reason why fast fashion is often seen as bad is because fast fashion is synonymous with trendy clothes that wear out within 2/3 washes and unethical labor practices.   Trends change very fast and If a shirt is $5, how much do you think each person who worked on it is getting paid?  I personally have a hard time believing in sustainable fashion nowadays because so many brands that marketed themselves as sustainable have been found to use the same practices as unsustainable ones. This includes high end fashion labels that sell a T-shirt for $2000 but pays their employees the same as forever 21.   So I think of you can get multiple wear out of a fast fashion item, it’s a win for you as an individual. More expensive doesn’t always mean better practices or quality. I’ve bought more expensive items that lasted just as long or not even as long as my Zara items.	episode_done:True
text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Disclaimer-- I know myself well enough to know that a capsule wardrobe is not for me.  When I get back from traveling, I cannot wait to wear different clothes.  Consider your laundry situation.  Having a smaller wardrobe means that you will be doing laundry more often.  If you're one in a family of 6, it may not be a big deal.  But for a single apartment dweller (pay per load), the additional costs can add up quickly.   Because I pay per load, I make sure that I maximize the capacity and only wash full loads (I'm paying the same no matter the capacity).  I am not one to hand-wash clothes in a bathroom sink.  Not now, not ever!   I do laundry roughly every other week alternating lights and darks.  (Sheets and towels are their own ballgame, and I will sometimes throw things in with them.)

text:All things K-Fashion!	labels:I love k-fashion and tbh it’s the biggest inspiration for my style. I got into Korean things in elementary school so it’s been a long time. There is (or was) a huge kfashion community on tumblr which I’m a part of. I’ve collected a list of 100+ stores through the years but some of my favorite brands are the big ones like stylenanda and chuu. When I think of kfashion, especially in the past 5 years or so, I think of very minimalistic in terms of color pallets with interesting silhouettes. What you see in most kdramas isn’t necessarily what’s trending on the style blogs and online stores.	episode_done:True
text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "How to Determine Your Body Type" and "On Dressing Your Body Type"	labels:So, I'll start. I definitely fell into the trap of both not really understanding my own body and trying to look like a tall slim hourglass all the time (which is not my body.)   Taking the time to really understand silhouettes and how to adjust them for my body was a huge breakthrough for me, as well as readjusting my thought process toward "what do I want to emphasize?" vs "Is this flattering?"   Being more thoughtful and critical about the difference between something looking good and something emphasizing the "tall slim hourglass" was also really helpful. So much of fashion that we feel is objective is actually about our eye and what we train our eye to perceive as good. Getting away from that, and training my eye to see the tall slim hourglass as one silhouette among many, really helped me wear things "I couldn't pull off."	episode_done:True

text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:Yes, I do think our age definitely affects what looks dated to our eye.   I’m noticing that some younger men are wearing some strange iterations of 80’s color-blocked track suits that to me look very Golden Girls. Also, I’ve seen shirt and shorts sets on rappers made out of wild print fabrics exactly like the ones I made for my toddler 25 years ago.  I’m older, so I’ve seen a lot of trends come and go. We are now at the point where they are starting to repeat and are designated as “Vintage”.  I have cultivated my personal style over many years (boho/western), and have seen it done well by Ralph Lauren and most recently Christian Dior in 2018(?) and enjoy the idea of wearing the beautiful things I’ve collected until the end of my life.

text:Discussion: what does your shopping process look like?	labels:Hah what a funny question.  Something I need/would be super useful: 1) Think “I could really use ___ basic”.  2) Find a suitable one that’s inexpensive, say 25 dollars, but think “Do I really want to spend money on this right now?”  3) Close tab because I decide nah I don’t need this.  4) Complain about not having basics all the time.   Something statement/impractical and pretty much always expensive.  1) See it. Fall in love. Um and ah about the price.  2) Leave tab open. Can’t stop thinking about it for 1-2 days.  3) Give in and buy impulsively.  4) The lucky part: receive item and still in love with it.   My wardrobe is 80% the latter and only 20% the former but at least I love my closet. I can only think of less than a handful of items I’ve bought and really not worn. I feel like impulsive purchasing works pretty well if you already know what makes you love items.  But damn I could really just use some more tshirts and jeans.

text:General Discussion - October 19	labels:My country went back into lockdown and so I have finally conceded to the new way of life.  Realistically, I'll be wearing homewear most days, but most of my other clothes just *feel nicer* than the cheapass sweatpants I own. So I got a new pair of sweatpants + a sweatshirt from Sunspel.

Good news is that I only buy 3 or 4 new items a year as stuff wears out (gets more holes than I can patch). Occasionally I can get stuff second hand or thrifted which is nice. In the scheme of things clothing doesn't work out that expensive, my helmet is over 600, chaps 200, other gear I wear 200, chainsaw 3000.	episode_done:True
text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:Size US11 here! Wearing heels is a breeze for me, personally, even if I'm over 6 feet tall in them! .. never thought about it this way, though. Makes a lot of sense that smaller feet would have greater strain while wearing heels. And yes, it is hell finding shoes my size. I usually wear men's sneakers. I only own two pairs of heels, and I'd say they're both about 4 inches tall.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:I've kept things like this a little longer due to people's compliments, or tried a little harder to sync them with my wardrobe in a way that I like better, but the vast majority of the time I end up donating or ceasing to wear the item in the end anyway.   Ultimately, aside from overarching situational appropriateness, other people's thoughts about my clothing choices (positive OR negative) have very little impact on my style and like you, my key motivator is my own comfort and confidence.	episode_done:True
text:Better With Age: 10 Things Better Bought Used – Put This On	labels:My vintage 80s Levi's denim sherpa is probably my favorite piece in my closet and was only like 40 USD on grailed.  Its nice knowing that it's made in the USA, better quality than new, perfectly faded and comfy for a fraction of the price of new.  Regardless, I feel that we're getting to the point where you're paying the same or more for vintage as compared to new due to the rise of vintage clothing stores and old pieces being trendy. Unless you get lucky at a goodwill or thrift store, but I find most of the stuff I find at actual thrift stores are pretty boring or not even all that old (lots of fast fashion crap at thrift stores now).	episode_done:True

text:Indochino VS Local custom clothier (HM Cole). My fair review.	labels:I would agree with the overall sentiment to get an OTR suit and tailor but I will also add, in my own opinion, to avoid Indochino whenever possible.    I purchased a suit from them that was really bad because it was too small.    Then they sent a recut that was too large.  Both had arms set at different angles by a few degrees leading to weird darts of fabric showing up on the back and the chest.  One sleeve, out of the four, was wavy all the way down instead of a straight line with a bend at the elbow.  I'm not even sure how it was possible.    Then they sent ANOTHER recut that was again too small.    My local tailor I took it to said there was little chance of salvaging any of them, given the level of complexity it would require to do so.  Not a simple pinch-tuck-hem situation.  This process took over two months and when I got tired of the shot gun attempts they were sending me, I asked for a refund and they refused.  Even though their claim is  *"Every INDOCHINO purchase is backed by our Fit Promise. If your order does not meet expectations, let us know and we will make it right."* their customer service rep told me *"Yes, using alterations or a remake to get the right fit. There is no mention of refunds, as this is not something we offer."*  Once you drop $500 on a suit, you're stuck with it.  Even if they made it so poorly, the tailor tells you they can't do anything.  Today I'm down $500 on a wonky suit that I never wore and will likely end up giving to Goodwill.  I'd strongly advise everyone to look elsewhere and just avoid the hassle altogether. It's a gamble that's not worth it.

text:Winter staples?	labels:How cold of a winter are you expecting?   As another poster said, fleece-lined tights and leggings are great for layering. I love them under jeans or wool skirts.   Make sure you get more than one pair of boots, especially if it snows a lot. Nothing worse than putting damp boots back on because the snow was taller than the tops!   Get warm socks! Wool is great. Darn Tough is a good brand for keeping your feet warm. They also have a good guarantee so if they get damaged, send them back for a replacement. I love knee high socks because you can layer them under jeans or work pants and stay a little extra toasty.   My staples tend to be pullovers and sweaters (Patagonia, H&M, anything wool, fleece, or cashmere that I can get at the thrift shop), jeans, full-length wool skirts, scarves, beanies that go over my ears, joggers, and boots.   Also, get a variety of winter coats if you can afford it. Peacoat for the kind of cold and blustery days. Down jackets rated to negative temperatures for when the frigid ice and snow storms hit. A canvas lined jacket for shoveling and other dirty outdoor jobs that is easy to show in the wash. A nice full-length dress coat for work or nights out on the town.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 05, 2020	labels:I've gotten to the point that my printmaking and embroidery work are my "part time job", in that it can pay some bills and give me spending money, and allow me to live off of less work for other people.   Typically, i do repair work on people's clothing or sell paper prints and things like installation pieces and back patches, since I never got very far making art to hang up on gallery walls (I have sold a single-digit number of pieces that hung up in a gallery, but orders of magnitude more prints online or in a table show! WTF!)  Recently I'm trying something a little new- getting old, worn out, and/or vintage garments and doing all kinds of overdyes, sashiko, embroidery and quilting to them, mostly by hand. Then I plan to auction off or make a catalogue of these pieces as one-offs to buy. One of the pieces is a 1980s japanese denim kimono that i'm sashiko stitching in the traditional patterned styles, and I'm loving how it's coming out- but it still is scary to put so much time and thread into something that has no garuntee or obligation to sell at all... it feels much riskier somehow, even though all art is risky.

text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:In this hypothetical I'd go with haute couture. In your friend's situation I'd keep looking until I found a designer I liked. Bespoke would be my last option for a couple of reasons. Your friend wants contemporary fashion, but most bespoke tailors make traditional clothes for a typically older crowd (you're in NYC though so there are some bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd; make sure you look for them specifically). The bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd don't have designs as good as high end ready to wear IMO. Tailoring and designing are different skills, and there's a reason Louis Vuittion, YSL, Dior, Gucci, etc pay their head designers millions per year. Of course some $4000 coats are worth more than others, so it would be good to know a bit about general quality.  Personally, I prioritize design over fit. I can deal with a less than perfect fit if I love the design of a piece. But I won't wear a piece if I don't love the design, even if it fits well.   The middle ground option is made to measure, or MTM. MTM for outerwear isn't as common for suiting, but it's out there.
text:Well, but bespoke tailors can do anything. They all have a house style, and maybe the Haute Couture brands do something a given house won't replicate, but unless theres' something really unique happening, you'll probably be able to find *some* house that can make you at least as happy. Probably.  The real issue with Bespoke is just the amount of time it takes.	labels:In theory, but I suspect that the number of bespoke tailors who are 1) willing to do fashion-forward contemporary designs, 2) able to understand the 'source code' and styling of those designs well enough to capture the details of what makes a particular piece special, and 3) able to procure the exact materials needed to do so is likely vanishingly small in practice.  I've seen examples on fashion fora of people asking bespoke tailors -- even talented ones -- to replicate designer stuff, and the results are usually a poor approximation.	episode_done:True

Most petites are first of all still not short enough for someone under 5 feet (like, why is 5’4 considered petite?), and second are cut narrower, which is the opposite of what I need.  I typically end up with pants with stretch so it fits at my waist while also fitting around my thighs and sweaters/tops that are a size or two too big for my stomach so that my shoulders don’t look ridiculous.	episode_done:True

They're selling those pieces "in collaboration" with the communities for $200~ like the Sarape or Poncho, but 1) those items are clearly made and mostly designed entirely by the people from those communities and 2) that kind of artisan clothes usually cost around $10-$40 when you buy them directly from the producers or on Mexican websites. I don't worry much about the price of the clothes on the website, but I do worry that they could be making a humongous 90% profit by just reselling
text:Hi! This is Alejandro, owner of Graziano and Gutierrez. This Reddit post was shared with me and as I was browsing I saw your comment and just wanted to address it! We actually don’t re-sell any clothing that is made by the artisans or in Mexico. The family in Oaxaca only hand-weaves the fabrics and then sends them to me in Portland where I cut and sew every garment, we also create all of the designs in house!   We got a tab called Artisanal Fabrics on our website where you can learn more about the family’s work and history.

text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:I think a lot of people here that say their clothing falls apart quickly aren't properly caring for their clothes. Growing up I learned to wash everything together on cold. As an adult I had to read articles and watch YouTube videos on how to care for my clothing. I recommend everyone learn how to properly launder their clothing.
text:I agree, I've never understood what people are doing in the laundry to make their clothes literally fall apart after a few washes. Washing on the hottest setting and drying high heat, maybe?  Ive legitimately never had anything fall apart in the wash ever and I dont take particular care other than cold water and low heat in the dryer (plus not chucking things like sweaters, dress shirts and leggings in the dryer at all). And I used the communal machines in my apartment!	labels:Washing clothes after wearing them only once and doing it on a high setting, I imagine?  Obviously clothes need to be washed if they're smelly, grubby, or you've been sweating in them but it's perfectly fine to wear something a few times before it needs washing.  Also: buying poor quality clothes made from synthetic materials.
text:As to your first point I pretty much only buy poor quality clothes made from synthetics as 1) I have no money and 2) I'm allergic to wool, so I can't speak to that (Holla at me, urban planet, old navy and Joe fresh).  As to your second point, good point. Other than underwear thats true I do wear everything 2-3 times before washing.  Like I do believe people when they say the qash shreds their clothes, to be clear. I just genuinely don't understand what is doing it.	labels:	episode_done:True

You could also get a decorative dress form and display it on that.	episode_done:True

text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:I’m going to agree with a couple of comments in here and say that the second experience at SuSu wasn’t *wrong*.  The outcome of getting a custom suit isn’t only contingent on what the client asks. Since a “perfect” fit is a subjective concept, each custom fit is a confluence of not just the client’s requests, but also the individual preferences of the fitter and the standard cut of the brand. That is, it’s not just about where you go; it’s about who you work with when you get there.  I’m an associate for SuitSupply myself, and we all do a lot of custom. At the shop, each of the associates design custom suits a little differently. I almost always heighten the rise on the trousers, for example, and cut my chests really close. My coworker, on the other hand, always does a full leg taper and shortens the jacket a half centimeter. I’ve had clients switch from me to someone else and vice versa for custom because they liked an individual’s fit better.  With all of those adjustment options at your disposal, it’s easy to get anxious if you’re not seeing them all getting used. Remember, though: if your suit doesn’t fit right, alterations and remakes are free, and the changes are noted so they can be added to the next suit you make. If you go back and let them know during the fitting about your prior experiences and how you want it to fit, or even bring in your original suit to guide the process.  I would give SuSu another chance. But I’m biased.	episode_done:True

text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:I think everyone looks back on their teenage years as being super cringy... not because of our style but because the fashion itself from 10, 15 or 20 years ago *can seem* really awful when we look back. 20 years ago, I was 15. I look at what teenagers wear today and I'm like "damn.... I wish I'd had that sense of style." But I did, just in my time. We wore what we wore back then because it was a great way to help us explore, create, and share our identities in the sense of a larger concept of style. But those styles change, evolve, come back around, and disappear again over time. I think I looked ridiculous when I was 15, but back then, I was cool as hell!  Honor your own sense of style and what makes you feel comfortable, happy, and the most authentic expression of who you are. Those may all change over time, but enjoy the moment you're in.  I also had a big vintage clothing phase when I was around your age and perhaps my favorite thing was hitting the local thrift store and altering my finds to fit my size and style. My senior prom dress was actually 3 vintage gowns that I'd found and spliced together. Even today I would say that about a third of my wardrobe is vintage and thrift. The best way to wear vintage and thrift I would say is to learn how to make little alterations like hemming, changing buttons, adding or removing darts, or dyeing. I loved making things my own in simple, little ways.	episode_done:True

Up to “a few thousand” you can look at TLB Mallorca, Carmina, Enzo Bonafé, John Lobb RTW, Edward Green- there are a lot of better places to spend that kind of money on shoes, and if I could’ve gone back I would’ve skipped spending on the low end with AE and Meermin until I learned about the higher end shoes I have today. It’s a deep field and an addicting one, so good luck!

It’s an entire lifestyle and subculture that you are unlikely to be privy to or even fit into if you lack the euphoria and pedigree. That’s just the reality.  You’re probably one of those people who believes anybody can be anything yada yada yada. Sorry to break it to you, but no matter how much I want to be, say, a gentlesir, it simply isn’t going to happen. I can don the wolf shirts all I want, but it doesn’t change the fact that because it isn’t who I was born, it’s something I’ll never be. The same goes for most of the people on this subreddit who, by most accounts, even detest and reject the trappings of class that can not be divorced from euphoria. It is a style of, by, and for the American lower basement class and below, and nothing you say will change that.

text:I love the idea of a weekend wardrobe! I work in an office where everybody is super casual (jeans and T-shirts) that whenever I dress up (wear a cute dress or even mini skirt + stockings in the winter), I get asked if I have plans after work or I end up feeling overdressed. So even if I do feel good when I leave the house, I feel super conscious by the time I get to the office.

text:General Discussion - January 16, 2021	labels:A dark and surreal week for me:     Accidentally went to the wrong floor for a meeting this week and stumbled across a sweatshop right here in beautiful New York, New York (the city so nice they named it the big apple), so this is your friendly reminder that "made in the USA" doesn't necessarily mean shit when it comes to ethically made clothing. Reported it to the DoL but I don't expect them to do anything about it.     In unrelated but equally bleak personal fashion news, In my search for some VERY obscure soviet-Czech trainers I accidentally stumbled across a sketchy forum of people selling battle-worn combat uniforms, complete with burns, bullet holes and blood stains. It's always fun to imagine you're living in a Blue Ant book until you actually start living in a blue ant book and life becomes very depressing! The first rule of the forum is you are not allowed to ask how these things were sourced.     Lastly the embroidery studio i work at was contacted for a large order of Rhodesian flag patches. I contacted the client to see if it was for a film or something and he was very cagey about their purpose, so I cancelled the order and refunded his deposit, which lead to me getting chewed out by my boss, who is apparently fine with making White Nationalist memorabilia if it's obscure enough to not get him in any trouble.
text:That’s whack. Out of curiosity, how do you know this was a sweatshop vs a legit workspace?	labels:super crowded, poor ventilation, a staff consisting entirely of south asian women, not enough masks to go around, really, really cold inside, and when I walked in the foreman/manager was extremely hostile about making me leave. Even in the unlikely event that everyone working there had a visa and was being paid the (frankly criminal on it's own) NYC Garment worker minimum wage of 12-and-some-change an hour, the conditions were not at all safe (for covid or just generally).  "Sweatshop" doesn't really have a strict definition but if you saw this place you would certainly feel bad about your clothes being made there. It's kind of an open secret that these places exist in NY and LA but coming face to face with one was kind of a shock.	episode_done:True

You probably have everything else you could want for layering under it. - a nice shirt, undershirt and maybe a jumper.   Sizing wise stick with your usual size, as winter jackets are typically designed to be worn over something. You wont need to invest in something too extreme as you'll be walking the streets of Paris, not an expedition on the Artic.   Do spend a little more on the scarf though, as it can be a nice statement piece and you want it to last as well as feel nice.	episode_done:True

text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I ride horses professionally and manage a boarding facility, so my daily wear has to be appropriate for riding 8 horses a day (so breeches, knee high socks, athletic shirts), getting dirty (mud boots, overclothes I don't much care about), and staying warm/dry (seven billion layers of hobo coats). Unfortunately, my personal style is more of a mix of cottagecore/Edwardian/grungy Audrey Hepburn, which as you can imagine has absolutely no place whatsoever in my day to day life. I am also a compulsive clothes hoarder (screw you, Goodwill and thrift shopping!)  &#x200B;  I got sick and tired of seeing all these beautiful clothes in my closets that I *never* wore, so I purged it completely. I have two to three outfits for every occasion, two pairs of going - out jeans, and one pair of black heels now, with the ability to mix and match in between. Since I never really go anywhere, I always feel like I'm wearing something new when I do! Most of my pieces are more or less "timeless styles," and then I try and get one new thing every season to keep my wardrobe up with the times. But I have a rule that every time I buy a new thing, I have to throw one item out, which helps with the clothes hoarding!   &#x200B;  Luckily, I have some room for fashion in my work wear. I try and get trendy colored breeches in earth tones, find complementary shirts and jackets, cool socks, etc. I also have the awesome opportunity to color coordinate with my horse *and* his tack, which most people can't say, so I'll take that over being truly fashionable any day! (Did you guys know it's actually pretty difficult to pick a color scheme that also complements the exact shade of your horses coat properly? It's hard enough to determine whether humans are cool or warm or whatever....)	episode_done:True

text:More Men Reach for Sewing Machines	labels:Mom was a nurse and so I grew up hanging around a nursing home.

One woman would even tell me not to be ashamed, that there was a football player who knit (name escapes me).

text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:I’ve also dealt with suitsupply twice and like you had two very different experiences.   In the first - a blue suit - I had a very clear idea of what I wanted and ordered it shipped to store so that I could just do minor tailoring. They took full measurements on every aspect of it, and asked what I wanted for each measurement too. Ie Do I like a wider pant opening? Or more tapered? Length of sleeves, etc. felt very much like a whole rundown of the entire suit.   The second was... bizarre if im being honest. I went in wanting to shop for a dark grey suit. I didn’t have a clear idea of what I wanted, but I was assuming I’d go the fully customized suit route and had toyed a bit with that on their website. I went in to the store to see fabrics and stuff in person before I made my purchase. I told them what I was planning and they basically took my chest measurement and then pushed me to not do the full customized, but instead buy off the rack. And for my color options, I was browsing the whole rack, but they straight up pointed me at only the grey tones they had in store at the moment in my size. When I asked about other shades I saw they basically said “yeah, we don’t have that one in your size” and stared at me. It was like the concept of ordering a fabric/color combo I liked in my size was a foreign concept to them. Measurements were weird too. They only measured and marked one pant leg and one sleeve for tailoring. I asked why he wasn’t doing the other sleeve/pant leg or any other measurements and he just said they weren’t necessary. I overall felt pushed around by the process, and rushed, and definitely don’t think the suit is as personally tailored to fit me as the first I bought.   Nevertheless, now I’m looking at getting a new blazer and again I’m looking at SS because the quality and fabrics are quite, quite good, and I don’t have many other MTM/customizable suiting options in my area.

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Capsule wardrobe is not for me. But you need to ask yourself what you want to get out of a capsule and what wardrobe issue you are trying to solve.   Do you want to have less stuff? Make it easier to get dressed? Get more higher quality stuff?  Eliminate decision fatigue? Etc.   If you are moving into to this path you want to figure out two things. Your color palette and what shapes you like. These should help you figure out the base of the wardrobe. And you do not want to trash everything and get it all at once. You’ll make mistakes and learn what you like by experimenting.    Maybe try a 10x10 challenge to get a taste of a more limited wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:At some point I wanted others to know I'm gay from meeting me, so I got a pixie cut and called it good. It was a bad haircut, it didn't feel like "me", and guys still hit on me. I've gone through other time periods where others couldn't tell my sexuality from my appearance. This was something I was proud of, due to internalized homophobia. (But other queer women always knew. It's the vibe.)  Now, I'm more comfortable with myself and comfortable playing around with masc/femme in how I dress and present. I've made a few subtle changes with my clothes. But what has really made a difference is allowing myself to use more masculine mannerisms - the way I stand, the way I talk, the way I carry myself. In the past I've felt awkward in social settings despite being an extrovert, and I've recently realized this is mainly due to the dissonance between the gender role I'm expected to perform, and what's going on internally. By accepting my androgynous/masculine side, I've started to feel free of awkwardness.  To me, queer fashion is not one thing. There are many different queer and lesbian fashion styles. Just like straight people, we have different subcultures and styles within queerness. You got your art queers, your sporty queers, your co-op queers, your preppy queers. But there's often an element of playing with and mixing masculine and feminine and androgynous, both in the clothes and the way you wear them and the way you act.	episode_done:True

text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I guess I don't really follow them because as a pear shape the advice is usually to emphasize the other body parts to draw attention away from the hips. But I like my butt, so I don't feel like I need to specifically hide it.  Also I think bootcut or flare jeans that are usually recommended just make my legs look like columns, and slimmer pants actually show that  I have slim legs and ankles (which to me looks nicer). I think a lot of this advice was based on the idea that the goal is to look as skinny as possible, so if anything is sticking out it needs to be obscured. My mom said she never wore jeans in the 80s/90s because she thought her butt was too big for them, and it's not even a particularly huge butt. So at the time the hourglass ideal was just overshadowed by the need to not look "fat" it any way (especially in the 90s).
text:Seriously, I love how skinny jeans and leggings show off my calves and ankles. And they don’t make my hips look any bigger than flares did, even now when I actually have bigger hips. I also tend to wear my shirts right at the widest part of my hips instead of above it or below it, which apparently is a pear shape no-no. Oh well.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Discussion: Clay Jewelry?	labels:I think the majority you would find would be polymer clay, which is quite different from the porcelain or stoneware pottery most people would be picturing. I’ve worked with more traditional clay, but to my knowledge polymer clay is much more lightweight, and less brittle.  That being said I think porcelain jewelry would be really cool. I’ve seen some at craft fairs, I was quite tempted.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I actually did a bit of a wardrobe overhaul right before COVID started (just happened to be around my birthday which is the only time I really do much clothing/jewelry shopping), and then promptly didn't get a chance to wear any of it, so I haven't purchased much outside of basics during the pandemic. I bought a few pieces I had been hunting down (a pair of Jeffrey Campbell booties, an embroidered "kimono") and filled some holes (fashion-over-function sandals, an easy summer dress) but other than that, I've taken the pandemic as an opportunity to focus on bulking out my basics. Finding the "perfect" undies, socks, etc and then stocking up. So nothing where I really needed to try anything on first or do returns, for the most part. All online, which isn't too much different than pre-pandemic minus the odd thrifting excursion. It's actually been nice, being on a limited income I tend to feel pressured to prioritize the clothing people can actually see. But since my "regular" wardrobe isn't getting worn practically at all, I finally have some flexibility to splurge on a nice pair of joggers or buy a couple camis specifically for lounging in (instead of having to "save" them for wearing with outfits). I'm definitely a maximalist and still get dressed up for certain meetings, but I haven't been getting dressed up "just because" mostly to avoid wear and tear on clothes that I haven't had a chance to wear anywhere yet.	episode_done:True

I want to have clothes that fit me, look great and that I can be comfortable in, but I still someone buy stuff a size too small or basically skate stuff.  I want to dress like an adult to help me feel a bit more like one. I’m 6’ 160lbs, a little bit fit, tan skin, so I would ask for any recommendations for relatively inexpensive good quality: pants (Levi’s 511 or 514?), plain t’s or v-necks, and every day shoes.   I work in an office and the setting is very casual, sometimes I got to clients houses though and I would like to appear professional when usually I’m slumming it in some basic slim jeans, blank shirt, and jacket + hat. My shoes are some skate shoes that look pretty shabby. I could just use a solid template for how to dress without looking too flashy. I mean I want to dress nicely and have a sense of fashion, but and no offense, I don’t want to look like a douche. tbh I have no clue how tf to do that. I don’t know what looks good and what doesn’t.

I was very much surprised when going through the photos today because of how good the fits are considering they're mostly from the mid 80s. These looked like styles from the streets of Tokyo & Seoul but they turned out to from the UK instead. I know in terms of fashion many countries draw inspiration from each other but I never expected the folks in London to be so in command and stylish from such an early period!      Another pleasant surprise was how similar these fits look to the current trend of streetwear, high fashion / avantgarde style in the recent 2-3 years. If I had no clue of the year these photos were taken from, I wouldn't have a problem believing that they were from recent years.

text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession). I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession 🤣
text:> beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession)  I would also add that life just...isn't fun right now. Just like in 2009, people are anxious and unhappy. People have lost their jobs even their homes. On top of that, we have an insanely fractured political environment and have been deprived of our basic need to be social & around other humans.

text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:Don’t forget to check out thrift stores. This is where I stock up on cashmere sweaters for a few dollars a piece, wool skirts, kilts, sweaters, vests, and cardigans, and amazing wool blazers and coats. I’ve found mint condition mohair and camel hair 3/4 coats for as low as $10, black cashmere sweaters for $2-3 and up, and cable knit pullovers for as low as $4. It’s amazing what people get rid of, not realizing how expensive it all is new. I also loooove wool in the fall and winter, and so this has been a super affordable way to build a dream cold-weather wardrobe.   The only thing wool I buy new are socks for the most part, everything else I’ve found at estate sales, garage sales, and thrift shops. When/if you go, definitely go through the boys and men’s departments, too. A bit of tailoring can make anything look custom like some of the pieces on Walker Slater maybe.
text:Edit: I happened to go to a local Goodwill shortly after I posted this, and picked up a full length camel hair and cashmere coat for $6!!!  My best deal yet! I also picked up a beautiful and soft black wool cable knit turtleneck, and a green plaid wool skirt. Total came to $11 for the three.   One tip... I go early in the season for cashmere. Wool lasts fall to spring, and there’s generally not a lot of competition.  Most thrift stores don’t spend time reading the micro labels for fabric content (but they do the brand) so it’s quite easy to get a high quality but lesser known brand of cashmere for the same cost as acrylic.   If you run your hand lightly down the row, you’ll start to learn to ‘read’ the better fabrics by weight and thread count... it’s like Braille for me. I can tell silk from satin because natural fibers are slightly cooler than man made fabrics etc. Same with wool vs. acrylic, and leather vs vinyl. I run my hand down the rack and let the fabric and the temperature tell me what’s there. It’s even easier now with fast fashion because the thread count makes them a fraction of the weight of property made clothes, and they don’t have the same feel. This helps the really good stuff stand out quickly.  It also means I can hit a goodwill in about 15 minutes and have gone through almost all the racks!	labels:OMG your edit.

As others have said, lots of out of date clothes in my closet but as a guy that matters a lot less. I like to look good and always dress for or above the occasion. Bright side is: I spend VERY little money on clothes because they last so long. Jeans? 10 years easily. Graphic T's? 5+ years, no problem. Buy the things you love and don't worry about the money because the clothes will outlive your memory of the cost.  Added bonus, my wife and I go places together and look like we own the place. Every night is a date night!	episode_done:True
text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:I just bought two dresses made out of waffled thermal material to wear in the house during the fall and winter and I couldn’t be more excited. Long live the house dress!	episode_done:True
text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I WFH permanently now, but when I worked in an office I wasn't able to escape dry-clean-only clothing; there are some things that just need to be dry cleaned. However, I used Dryel to great effect (awesome for things that aren't stained or stinky and don't really need to be pressed). I will also say, many many clothing items that say "dry clean only" can be washed either by hand, or in the machine on a delicate setting with wool wash or other gentle low-suds detergent. (My dry cleaner, of all people, actually advised me to start washing my cashmere sweaters rather than bringing them in for cleaning - she said dry cleaning dries out and breaks down the fibers and washing them at home would help them last longer. I am still wearing my cashmere sweaters and so far, she's been correct.) If something is very structured or has an acetate lining I never try to wash it, but I have washed other things that were poly blends or wool blends and were marked "dry clean only," and as long as you hang them up to dry, it works fine.
text:>many many clothing items that say "dry clean only" can be washed either by hand, or in the machine on a delicate setting with wool wash or other gentle low-suds detergent.  I agree a lot of things can be washed at home! Heck, I've even thrown dry clean only items into the washer + air dry because I'm cheap and bought the garment cheap and wanted to see the outcome. I wash my woolens in a sink with woolite, and put them in the washer on spin to remove the water. I recently hand washed a suit jacket with no negative repercussions, it could use a bit of a steam on the shoulders, but otherwise A-OK.  The only thing I worry about is silk, of which I own very little. I have put my silk items in the washer and air dried and they were fine but the wrinkles were hard to get out, but I'm curious what others do.	labels:You can a absolutely hand wash silk with lingerie wash. I use Soak wool wash on mine... I use that on suit pants too. I'm a tailor. Only jackets get dry cleaned, and as rarely as possible.	episode_done:True

text:Discussion - “ Odd “ Fashion Inspirations	labels:I can't get enough of the fashion from Korean dramas. I do not have the body type of many of the actresses in there, but all of the pencil skirts and floofy blouses, the blazer combos, the accessories -- I love it!  I even find myself searching for some of the accessories (earrings and necklaces) worn in some of the dramas.
text:Was just going to say, I was utterly obsessed with Ko Moon-young (Seo YeJi)'s wardrobe in "It's Okay to Not be Okay".  And then I found out how much those outfits cost.

text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:Honestly, to me it sounds like you might find alot of things uncomfortable because they don't fit properly.  Any item of clothing can be comfortable if it fits your body properly.  This is why rich people get things tailored.  I'm a grad student so I can't afford that, but I just make an effort not to buy things that don't fit, and occasionally I get things tailored.  It's hard though, most cheap brands that I can afford don't sell clothes that fit well so it's an effort.	episode_done:True

It's about 20 pieces, mainly navy, black and white with a couple of floral pieces for a statement. But my everyday casual wear I tried a capsule but decided against it. I enjoy experimenting with styles and different outfits too much. I found a capsule too limiting for my casual wear.	episode_done:True
text:Are there any actual fashion trends in 2020?	labels:we must be living on different planets.   lingerie as camisoles, fur trim everything, distressed tops, denim skirts, sweater vests, low rise pants, straight leg replacing skinny jeans, patchwork jeans, patterned tights, flared leggings, corset tops, fur lined boots, super tall platform shoes, juicy tracksuits, animal prints, tie dye, hand and leg warmers, fluffy bags, all were super popular trends last year. this has been the most trend heavy year in my memory, I could barely keep up.
text:Did you see this in real life? I’ve seen them on ig or youtube, but no one at the trader joes or coffee shop.	labels:well I wore a lot of these, so yes. I haven’t been to a lot of social gatherings this year for obvious reasons, but I have seen a whole lot of this stuff on my friends and on strangers when I have had the chance to go out.   and I don’t see why trends popping up mainly on instagram or youtube is a bad thing. during this year those have been the only real outlets for people to show off their outfits. the people posting on these sites are real people, and the brands selling those styles of clothes are making real sales.
text:I don’t think trends popping up on ig is a bad thing. I just wonder about the gap between practical real life wear vs social media. I see people wear more extreme things on social media that i seen irl.	labels:I think that’s true, but I don’t think any of the trends I mentioned are extreme. if you go on any fast fashion site you can find all of this stuff being sold.	episode_done:True
text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession). I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession 🤣

I have all kinds of office appropriate slacks and cardigans and button up shirts in cutesy patterns, casual jeans and sensible shoes.

text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I haven't been able to buy any glasses online yet. Glasses feel like too much of a serious purchase to leave in my amateur hands. Also, if I already overthink which earrings to wear to work everyday, imagine if I had to pick out glasses too??? That being said, I wear the same glasses everyday for 2-3 years until I can't stand the sight of them and then go buy something totally different, then repeat. I try out different shapes and styles (I've had square hipster, cat's eye, tortoiseshell, thick arms, and currently big nearly-clear peachy ones which are my favourite because they show off my eye makeup and are less in-your-face. What I refuse to wear are colourful glasses, because I know I'll get sick of those quirky red frames super quickly!) People get so freaked out when I show up to work with a different hairstyle...can you imagine how many irritating comments I'd have to deal with if I switched up my glasses every day? "Something's different about you today..." "Did you get new glasses?" Etc. For my own personal sanity, I could never!   Anyway, if you're feeling in the mood for a switch up, I say go for it! These are something you wear everyday so you should love them!	episode_done:True

text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:Everything eventually comes back in fashion.  Personally I would love for 2000s jeans to come back - not super low rise or the ones that were bedazzled or laced up but just normal rise bootcut and flare jeans. I have a few from that era that I still wear all the time and a couple more that I had to replace with similar ones from poshmark because I couldn't find them in shops.  I also miss 2000s makeup. Sure, there was too much body glitter and candy colors but there was also the fresh dewy look of blush and a light lip gloss - think Britney Spears in her Oops I Did It Again video, or Mandy Moore's makeup in her video for Candy. Not everything in the 2000s was horrible lol.

text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:I've taken a couple of laps before writing this comment, but up-front I think aesthetics section should be split, because I think the most basic question, which is answered aesthetically but not functionally, is what do you want your clothes to **do**? Giving off a vibe is mentioned, but there's an even more functional level of "are these clothes sensible for how I live my life?" Are you buying lots of hawaiian shirts even though live at the north pole, or buying down parkas when you live in Hawaii? Do you regularly find yourself cold and wet because you don't own any raincoats, or find that your fishnet sleeves keep getting caught on the mill in the machine shop, or that your raw denim really doesn't give you the flexibility you need to dance?   I think what the clothes do should meet you where you do what you do, and at the most basic level that's physically enabling you to do things, and you can build a vibe from that.

text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:If the heel height is graded for size the angle of the footbed should remain constant between sizes.   IME wearer weight, fitness, and tolerance for discomfort play a more significant role than anything else. I’m 176cm, IT38, wear heels more than is probably good for me, and can comfortably manage a 100-105mm pump sans platform to dinner, and 85mm or so for days at the office if needed. With an enclosed wedge or block heel style I can easily do ten miles of walking at the same height, more with alcohol ;) I’m a former rock climber and lifelong endurance athlete, so discomfort and chafing are not foreign to me. Even the worst heel is much more comfortable than trying to jam a thin crack! I have former dancer friends who report a similar experience, while other less grin-and-bear-it types find anything more constrictive than Uggs unbearable.   I drop weight in the late summer and early fall for races, and even the 2-3kg shift makes a huge difference in comfort.	episode_done:True

text:From my own experience, I'd say the best made "vintage" Andrew Marc leather jackets are better than a lot of "mall" brand leather jackets I've owned or tried like Kenneth Cole, Tommy Hilfiger, Reilly Olmes, Ralph Lauren Chaps. I have a Ralph Lauren POLO leather jacket (original MSRP $695) from 1999 made of a heavy leather that has held up wonderfully over the years and I'd say is better than the best Andrew Marc I've tried (but my experience is limited--there may be "gems" out there, like limited editions).	labels:90s Polo is kind of golden era polo, somewhat different to what we have 20 odd years later.      RL Polo iteration one happens in 67' , RRL comes in 93', and then Purple label is in 94', but over the years I think the gap in quality has really widened sadly.
text:Polo is the hardest sub-brand to place. To simplify, there are two different tiers: department store Polo and RL store Polo. If you buy it from a department store  you'll get clothing at that level -- made pretty cheaply, a lot of basics, materials aren't special, etc. I can't remember if suits are half or full canvassed  At an RL or Polo store, though, some of it is pretty good. They have runway stuff. Some cowichans that will remind you of RRL's. I don't know if they still make Polo suits in the US or Italy, but if they do, those might be fully canvassed. Maaaybe some c&j footwear, although that's still mostly RLPL. Of course, most of this stuff will be overpriced, and still not actual RRL quality.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does your language affect how you wear colors?	labels:I read an article in scientific American forever ago that discussed the way some languages are structured to center the group or the space rather than the individual speaker the way English does, which can contribute massively to how a culture's values are learned (individual gratification vs acting on behalf of the group, consuming/hoarding natural resources vs conserving/cultivating them). In my amateur  assessment, I'd say language effects our fashion choices more in the realm of what we're dressing to communicate (personal wealth, individual perspective and creativity, respect for the natural environment, etc), and in the realm of how we consume fashion (desiring to have more or better than others in our community, desiring newness, desiring to leave a smaller environmental footprint, etc).	episode_done:True

text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:Nothing is a must.  As someone who has travelled, I can attest why such pieces that are considered "musts" exist. The LBD is a considered a "must" because it's a simple piece you can take from day to night, style up or down with accessories.  If you don't need a quick or versatile piece in your wardrobe, a LBD isn't a must because you don't need it. If dresses aren't your thing, then an LBD isn't a must because you'll never reach for it. If black is actually a colour that looks bad on you, then the LBD isn't a must either. ETC.  You have to evaluate your own needs to see if you need an LBD. In general, I'd say most women wouldn't mind wearing a dress, so an LBD (it can be another colour) is something that can get a lot of use. A simple white dress in summer is the best candidate to understand it.	episode_done:True

text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Many years ago I moved from Hawaii to college in the Northeast. I would recommend 1) Buying it all there, because they'll have what's good for their climate and 2) starting out with cheaper options (thrifted, Old Navy, Target range) even if it's not quite your style. Don't spend much time, effort, and money until you see how you really feel after at least a year of seasons. Maybe you want warmer stuff than you thought you would, or realize you should invest in nicer socks, or discover you don't actually like turtlenecks, or shift to a different style when you're surrounded by a new area's vibe. Let yourself experience it for a bit without pressuring yourself to do it all right.
text:Yes! I love uniqlo's' merino wool sweaters for an inexpensive, nice wool sweater. They will shrink a bit though so watch out. They also have inexpensive turtlenecks if you want to try that look out.  I live in Seattle so it's not super cold here, but I still love wearing wool socks and lightweight wool sweaters.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is the breakdown of $ spent for various outfits you actually wear?	labels:This is a fun way to see how much I’ve spent on the hobby of dressing myself!   A lot of my stuff is secondhand so I paid a lot less for some of this. Thank fuck.   • €110~ Folk grey sweater  • €50~ APC charcoal t-shirt  • €100 Levi’s black slim jeans  • €60  Etnies grey sneakers or chocolate desert boots  • €140 minimum blue rain jacket  • €300 Vapaus Vorcut (casual watch)   = €760. But €460 without the watch.   I haven’t been in a situation this outfit wouldn’t suit in years. If anything I’m overdressed half the time.

text:Can You Wear a T-Shirt Under a Blazer and Not Look Like an 1980s Leftover?	labels:I still maintain that a t shirt with a tailored jacket is not a good look. It's a clash of formality.

text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:The beauty with fashion is that there are so many middle grounds! To venture out of your comfort zone, some ideas are:  - Wear kitten heels or pretty pumps instead of boots. Practically speaking, they'll also be more comfy than stilettos  - Try to incorporate one item of pattern or bold colour which you like into your wardrobe. Plan ahead and style it in different ways with your existing wardrobe, according to different  circumstances (e.g. casual lunch, work day, nice dinner out), and wear it when you get the chance  - Stop thinking too much about what others think and try to identify what looks and things you like instead.   - I prefer to dress for the occasion (e.g. it'd be silly to wear a little black dress with heels if I'm going for a countryside visit), but you can still look nice doing so for whatever event! In the countryside example, I would dig out some nice cable knit jumper paired with jeans, my Barbour and a lovely woollen scarf, plus chunky boots. Equally I could style that with a cute skirt instead of jeans if there's less climbing over stiles and more visits to village pubs and quaint coffee shops. (Not that there's any chance to do the above anytime soon. #bloodyCovid)	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:Great responses already. I'll rant a little bit about footwear since that's my specialty so to speak.   I think people still spend far too much on footwear generally. GYW and stitched construction is nice and all, but it's not a cheap option by any means. You get quite high quality leathers from plenty of makers in the <$350 range and there are good options in the $200 range as well depending on the type of shoes/boots you're looking for.   I'm working on a post that talks a bit more about the individual economics of owning even a single pair of "high quality" footwear. Cost of ownership is vastly under estimated by newcomers and expectations overall tend to be set too high.   I still agree that footwear has pretty high diminishing returns, but I also think that a *lot* of people talk themselves into buying stitched construction shoes that are far far too expensive for what they really want.

text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:This isn’t a direct answer to your question, but I’ve found I have a ‘hopeful’ sense of style and a ‘realistic’ sense of style.  Hopeful-me will think about buying a teal floral wrap dress because it’s gorgeous. Realistic-me knows it will sit in my closet untouched for 3 years because I don’t wear teal!   I’ve learned to differentiate between the two while I shop, at least. If I was a celebrity suddenly, maybe I would lean towards hopeful-me’s style, but for now I am normal and realistic!

text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:I don’t have an example right now but want to thank you for posting this as I have never considered this! I’m a US6 and have NO IDEA how some women frequently wear 3 inch heels. The super steep arch was so uncomfortable. This makes so much sense!
text:Seems size 6 is a 50/50 size for a lot of people given the standard size is made for bigger feet. I have a few friends that wear a US size 6 and it's basically split down the middle between if they'll find the same shoe comfortable or not.  One of my friends revealed that she is SUPER flat footed so, even 2 inch heels can give her problems as a result even if it's a thick heel or a wedge style. Some of them were also just buying low quality shoes since they didn't want to spend a lot of money and then when they got better quality pairs, their shoes hurt far less. Quality definitely matters a lot.  Something as simple as the incline (outright influences the slope steepness) is a game changer as well. Not to mention ankle and nerve strength differing between two individuals. There's so many factors into why shoes are comfortable or uncomfortable for us but, it definitely appears most are unaware of the heel slope steepness and shoe size factors.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:Not a must in my opinion.  I had some black dresses a couple  of years ago and I never wore them.   What works for someone else might not be for you.

text:Fashion Favorites	labels:Definitely wool coats—the longer the better, preferably with nice sharp shoulders and a big collar that stays up if you pop it. Blazers, too: anything with strong shoulders, a nipped waist and a slightly longer length.   Silk scarves and vintage clip on earrings—I have a bit of an obsession with both. The combination can dress up a lazy outfit in seconds, in a way that's appropriate for any occasion.  Flowy midi skirts and dresses, especially pleated or wrap-around designs. Much more comfortable than jeans, and eye-catching, too.  Blouses: button-front silk shirts, cotton Liberty prints, and anything white/cream with lace or ruffles.  And because we're still in a pandemic...silk satin face masks. I've actually enjoyed matching them to my outfits!

I just browsed Madewell because I am a big Madewell fan and have shopped there for a longtime — they have cute jewelry with most pieces falling on the lower-to-mid price range. I also looked at their ‘Labels We Love’ — which are smaller brands that have a similar aesthetic. And I ended up purchasing some stuff from the labels Tribe Alive and Year 901. So I definitely recommend starting with brands you are familiar with! Etsy is also pretty awesome, and has a large selection of jewelry. I bought a pair of medium clear lucite hoops (which are super versatile) from Leetie.

text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Some websites (department stores, ASOS) have a true fit tool where you put in your measurements, body type, and well fitting item of clothing and that information is used to recommend sizing.   It’s also a good idea to know your measurements in general if you’re buying secondhand as many sellers will list the measurements of the garment.  But overall sizing can be so wild within one brand, much less across multiple that I dint think there’s much of a rule of thumb.
text:Oh, ASOS can do that? Wow, amazing. I'll definitely be shopping there. I have all my measurements good to go.	labels:They also have a TALL section. I have a very rectangular body, bog shoulders and chest and am 5’9” and get most of my clothing from them. As others have said, great return policy but the videos of the models wearing the clothes is the best bit. You see them move and how long they are.

Perhaps it's because I can no longer pass as a youth and will no doubt get thrown into the demographic these companies sell to, but it's always painful when you start to see a trend in clothes and you hate it, and it lasts YEARS.

text:What’s something you wish you could tell clothing manufacturers to do differently?	labels:I realize this will probably never happen, but I would really appreciate it if the sizing was more consistent between brands. It can get confusing checking the size guides of each brand when doing online shopping.
text:I’ll settle for consistent sizing between different colors of the same item.  Nothing sucks more than finding the perfect fitting pant, ordering three more colors, and *none* of them fitting the same.	labels:Omg! Ordered like, 8 bras from Aerie in the same sizes.

text:Sewing your own clothes	labels:Definitely worth the time! Aside from producing clothes that you want and that fit you, you are developing transferable skills like manual dexterity, decision-making and problem-solving.   Not sure what you mean by lounge clothes, but if you mean clothing made from stretch jersey, you need either a machine that does zig zag stitch or (ideally) an overlocker machine. If you try to sew stretch fabrics with a standard stitch, you will either end up with puckering or a garment that doesn't stretch at the seams, or more likely both. If you have the right machine, it is no harder than sewing woven fabrics once you get the hang of it.
text:My mother has an overlock, I tried once and it is not easy, but I am going to persevere. I am having hard time finding some fabrics, though. Is it only possible to find jersey? I wanted to buy fabric to sew sweatpants and hoodies (I know it sounds weird). Do you think it is possible?	labels:Joanne fabrics has an extensive selection online
text:That's great! Thank you :)	labels:I always used polyester when I started out. It’s cheaper and it’s durable and it doesn’t fade or shrink. Wash your fabrics before cutting and sewing regardless tho!

text:Bruce Boyer on Finding Your Wardrobe and Sustainability in Fashion – Put This On (Derek Guy )	labels:Really good read as expected from Bruce. I know that sustainability is thrown around a lot and it can be a bit hypocritical or at least out-of-touch in regards to classic menswear. On the surface it can even seem elitist, since its a luxury, though Bruce here has shown that even he experimented and seems to encourage people to try different modes of menswear apart from trying to be timeless all the time.  I think it would be great if Bruce talked more about his taste, like why he liked George Cleverly and Anderson & Sheppard (I know he mentioned sensible lapels, etc).  I think diving into taste (or POV as it were) a bit more as it relates to menswear details would help show guys that while J. Crew suits and Meermin are fine and can last a long time with proper care, sometimes aesthetics for the sake of aesthetics win out in how we acquire clothing.
text:yeah that creeping need to want to 'upgrade' or have the 'best' is a big contributor to the unsustainability of fashion i feel like. Even though you could sell/donate the item, it may just end up being thrown away or shipped out.

text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Hi! Former stylist.  1) Pay attention to the fit of things and figure out what cuts and shapes look good on you. Paper bag pants and some joggers have similar fits. Some mini skirts and shorts hit the same place on your legs and can have the same waist height. Find your sweet spot and don’t be afraid to buy multiple things in silhouettes that work for you.   2) Get some statement pieces that you would die for. If you are wearing a pair of jeans that fit well and a t-shit purchased within the past 3 years with some awesome earrings you going to look and feel great. If you are wearing an amazing dress and simple white sneakers you are going to look and feel great. Don’t overthink things but try and wear at LEAST one piece you are excited about at a time.   3) Don’t buy things just cause they are on sale, you saw your friend wearing it, or you feel like you “need” something in your wardrobe. You should love everything in your closet in its own special way unless it’s workwear and you hate your dress code for work. Something as simple as a T-shirt has so many different factors like cut, material, neckline, sleeve length. Purchase what feels good and don’t bother with the rest.
text:Point number 3 is the best !! But how do we stick to it ? Isn’t it very difficult to wait and buy the things that we absolutely love ? I’m myself trying to follow it but it takes a lot of effort and time and I give up. Any advise on how to actually make it work	labels:Once you hit a certain point in your wardrobe you just need to keep reminding yourself you don’t necessarily “need” anything. I’m also not saying don’t shop and buy stuff! Just don’t buy stuff that after a couple wears have you reaching for your old favorites because you feel the best wearing them. I used to have 5 different tshirts but I would go digging through my hamper for one specific one even if it was dirty because it looked best. That’s what you want to avoid. Similarly, if a brown shoe is on sale but you never wear brown don’t buy it. It will sit in your closet and aggravate you unless you go and buy some stuff to wear it with. Pay the extra for the black and rock them right away. Use per cost is a real thing.	episode_done:True

text:What are your 2021 Fashion / Style Goals?	labels:i’m definitely trying to declutter, i still have clothes in my closet that i’ve had since high school (i’m 24 now) and haven’t touched for years. I also am focusing on buying more quality pieces that will last for a long time. Like rather than having several white button downs that i’m not in love with, finding the perfect one and sticking with it.	episode_done:True
text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:I sniff test everything (except underwear, which is one wear/wash) and I just purchased a wool sweater for the first time and I was *so suspicious* of the care instructions telling me not to wash it lol. I scoured the whole internet looking for something to tell me that this information was fake and that my suspicions were correct. After an overwhelming amount of evidence telling me I would have wasted $100 if I don't listen to people smarter than me, I begrudgingly made a deal with myself to give airing out only a try and I would wash it if it so much as had a hint of a stink.  Four months later and the sweater is going strong! That'll show me. In hindsight it makes sense that wool is water and scent wicking, because sheep have it "on" all the time, it was just a big adjustment for me since I had never really had natural fiber clothes before.	episode_done:True

text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:What kinds of styles do you gravitate towards that you don’t feel are appropriate?  And I’ve found that I just sort of develop 2 wardrobes, my work wardrobe and my casual one. Some pieces are interchangeable, some aren’t. But I still find a way to blend my personality into my work wear. It’s just a different part of my persona that’s represented.
text:My work dress code says "black and fashionable", and my natural state is color color color. I'm very eclectic in my preferred styles though: like ethereal/fairy-esque (which it all depends on the color), military chic (which i can sometimes get away with), Gothic/steampunk inspired... theatrical is probably the best way I can describe it.  I guess I've kind of done the same thing, but I think there's just a bit more pressure right now to look the part of the adult vs my natural state of being.	labels:I’d look at the items you have in a bright color and look for something similar in black.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 03, 2021	labels:Done a lot of thinking about my wardrobe and the amount of clothes I own and I think I’m gonna go through and pick a bunch of clothes to donate tonight.   I think it’s time I let the thrifting and g r a p h i c t e e life go for a bit. I own way too many band shirts and shit that I just don’t wear anymore. I need to suck it up and start investing in my wardrobe to get it to a place I want it to be instead of buying a ton of shitty bandaids for 8 bucks a pop at thrift stores. Time to be a big boy and learn to go for a few expensive pieces instead of a ton of cheap ones.   Wish me luck lads.
text:I started doing around the beginning of the pandemic. There are several vintage/thrift shops near me, and for like two years they were my go-to for outerwear and the occasional shirts and pants. But it's so easy to start picking things up just because they're cheaper, and not be happy with them just a couple months down the line...  I've got maybe three or four real gems that I still wear from vintage hunting, but everything else has been donated or sold. I'm much happier with my wardrobe now, especially since I started to invest in nicer stuff. I'm wishing you all the best through that transition!	labels:I have gotten a ton of cool shit from thrifting but it really is so easy to grab something for grabbing something’s sake. Especially going to the cheaper places in NYC like L train. Soon you’re taking back like 2 or 3 pieces a visit, that shit adds up quick.    Thank you!!!
text:Definitely. For me, I went to some of the shops enough that I'd chat with the owners when I stopped in. For sure I value the idea of supporting local businesses + building relationships with people who are hustling hard, but it also made it much harder to leave without picking something up haha	labels:Oh that’s what I do 100%. I’m friends with like 3 of the vintage boutiques’ owners and employees around me lol	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 02, 2020	labels:Thanks heaps to /u/dai_due' for selling me one of his Uniqlo +J hybrid down parka! finally received it and love it. Can't believe size XS actually works on me (normally medium in uniqlo stuff). Still has enough room to layer and somehow still has that oversized look. Amazed!  Also, after about 6 months of wear, I can confidently say the Auralee seamless tee is my favourite one that I own. I immediately knew it was gonna be my favourite as soon as I received it but I wanted to see how it was after many wears. One of the best features about it is that it's so soft but still drapes so nicely. And any wrinkle it develops after being folded in the closet basically straightens itself out after being worn for about 10 minutes. Shit! now i'm looking for more in different colors. A bit expensive at retail price but I've seen them on sale for around $50 which is doable for me.	episode_done:True

text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:I'm hoping those "Is it Wine o'clock?" shirts (or anything involving  women drinking wine to deal with life) you find at any mall store/Target directed towards adults.   Perhaps it's because I can no longer pass as a youth and will no doubt get thrown into the demographic these companies sell to, but it's always painful when you start to see a trend in clothes and you hate it, and it lasts YEARS.

text:I have a lot of swing dresses that help me get through size fluctuations.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:The Future is Made to Measure	labels:For some reason, I thought Trunk Tailors was much more expensive.  Yeah, MTM is one of thos places where... although machines not ever really overtake the hand, efficiency from machines is eventually going to complement handwork to make something very good very cost-efficient, and then Bespoke and RTW will both be struggling to compete.
text:I think MTM is more of a long-term threat to bespoke rather than RTW. The technological improvements, which will theoretically make it possible for software to draft a pattern indistinguishable from one drawn up by a human, could eventually make it very difficult for bespoke makers to compete on fit. The market could shrink to basically just the guys who want to be able to say they bought bespoke for sentimental reasons.  RTW will likely always exist just because it’s cheaper and easier to mass produce clothes in standardized sizing. Maybe the higher-end RTW market shrinks, but  at the bottom I don’t see a future where Zara only stocks M2M suits ordered online in advance.	labels:This article was about bespoke, but there are a lot of businesses taking mtm from the other angle -- not only making it cheaper, but making it such a cheap marketing hack, using it to reduce dead stock  using it to reduce return rates... As it gets better, it's going to get more efficient through multiple dimensions and eventually, rtw is going to feel some pain too.	episode_done:True

text:Hats - discussion	labels:I don't know anything about "hat energy" but I know that hats, like hair, look best when they're shaped, colored, and styled in a way that suits your face and outfit.  The bolder the hat, the more obvious it may be if you don't know what you're doing, but even with a more understated hat, a clumsy choice is going to be pretty obvious.  I mean, it's *on top of your head.*  I wear a lot of hats and I've been told I wear them well, but I dress in vintage style so I have outfits that are made to be worn with hats, a pretty good frame of reference in terms which hats to wear with which outfits.  More recent maintstream fashion is really not styled to be worn with hats, so fitting a hat in there requires a bit of crafty innovation, and it probably requires reducing your range of hats to the most basic casuals; floppy sunhats, berets, cabbies, beanies and baseball caps.  Each of those styles has an existing set of visual conventions:  While you don't necessarily *need* the whole tweed jacket and oxford shoe getup to pull off a cabbie, for example, taking some queues from that genre of style will help contextualize the cabbie in a way that makes it less jarring to look at.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 27, 2020	labels:Hot take: speaking from experience, fetishistically optimizing the most basic of basics (e.g. "the best plain white t-shirt") for maximum imagined value is not a meaningful nor worthwhile exercise. Your wardrobe is not more interesting because your white tee is better than another white tee, and by the time you've found the 'perfect' piece either the prevailing trend or your own preferences will probably have changed.  'Perfect tee' threads are usually highly-upvoted, but the answers have drawn from the same pool for the last goddamn decade:  - *Vintage/workwear (generally heavier, boxier, shorter):* 3sixteen, Buzz Rickson's, Lady White Co. - *Streetwear (generally lighter, slimmer, longer):* Reigning Champ, wings + horns, John Elliott - *"Normal" (somewhere in the middle)*: Naked & Famous, Arket, American Apparel when they still existed - *Edgy goth shit:* Rick Owens mainline for lighter and DRKSHDW for heavier, Kazuyuki Kumagai Attachment, Voidthebrand when they still existed - *Budget*: Muji, Uniqlo, Everlane, Bella+Canvas, etc., but no one really cares  It's functionally a solved question. You can pick one from the applicable list for your style, and it'll be *fine.*

text:The side cutouts are giving me flashbacks to those awful homecoming dresses from 2012. Who thought that needed to be brought back?!? "You know what women like? Exposing the excess fat on their torso so everyone can see it!" I never got into the cold shoulder trend, but at least I didn't feel like that was displaying the least flattering parts of my body.	labels:That sheer skirt black dress is also giving me 2014 flashbacks.

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I got my first fancy bag after calling off my wedding lol I figured it cost around the same amount as the dress I wouldn’t ever wear so why not? The woman at the LV store thought I was on drugs ... “are you celebrating something?” And I’m like as a matter of fact, yes, yes I am. I just lost a ton of money on a wedding but I dodged a bullet and left that POS. All she said was “well you can always make more money” anyway, I’m getting a Chanel bag for my next milestone birthday. Not sure which one but it’s gonna happen soon.
text:I bought a Tory Burch bag on inpulse after my divorce. It was so liberating to know I didn't have to explain the purchase to anyone. Not as much of an investment piece as LV but I still use it to this day!	labels:Haaaa! I bought a ring that I love	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:<rant>  If I said "Wear cropped jackets so you look taller" I'd be laughed out of the room but somehow "Short people shouldn't wear long coats" is a valid thing?   Also what's defined as short? If someone is 5'7" do they get to wear long coats? What if they're 5'7.5"??  It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering". If you care so much about these gender norms, masculinity and being ~ flattering ~ then sack up and wear the clothes you like.   That whole thread is just people saying that someone else told them they couldn't *wear a coat* so what should they do? Oh idk. How about tell them to fuck off and wear the damn coat.  </rant>
text:Ironically, the only things that actually make you look taller are... things that literally make you taller, like heels or wedges.

text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:Well, I decided that becuase my current round of clothes is on its way out (bought three-four years ago, beginning and end of fifth grade) I’m sewing everything I can of the next one, and buying what I can’t custom (gloves, a scarf). Durable, in colours and materials I want, cheaper, and shouldn’t need replacing till the end of highschool (I started this year.). Added bonus is that I’ve never had a single store bought item fit before I altered it (I’ve altered everything I own at this point.) while stuff I sew fits first try. I posted my working list on r/capsulewardrobe recently.	episode_done:True
text:Japanese winter fashion trend 2020/2021	labels:Like the look but I would really like to see these brand push away from traditional fleece to something more environmentally friendly.

text:[Inspiration] Jewelry	labels:Nice album OP. I've been into jewelry for some time. I've always liked bracelets and such, but lately I've been into rings. Just wish I had the guts (and budget) to start wearing them. It's one of these things that I like seeing others wear but I feel that wouldn't be able to pull of.  I might start to wear bracelets again and go from there.
text:Honestly the pandemic is a pretty cool opportunity to switch up your style/wear things you usually wouldn't in the comfort of your home (assuming you're not leaving the house much) by the time you start leaving your house more hypothetically you'll feel much more comfortable wearing things like jewelery because you've actually been wearing it for weeks	labels:Agreed, but my coworkers are in for a shock when they see me over a year later having completely flipped my style and looking like some sort of Harry Styles / Ramones hybrid with zero context.

text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:I actually went to a swap last weekend! We did it outside in a yard.  The host had hung up clothes lines between a bunch of trees and when we arrived, we put our stuff on the lines.  That way everything could be displayed, but we could also wander around while maintaining some distance.  Where I'm from, at the end of the swap, the host donates the left over clothes to a women's shelter.  I've gotten some hits and misses from swaps, but overall it's fun.   It helps if the host invites people who are similar sizes or makes sure to invite lots of people with a variety of body types so no one is really left out.
text:I really like that outdoor format.  Did you bring anything home?	labels:Yeah! A Hawaiian shirt, pajama bottoms, a hat with a marmot on it, a fleece, a t shirt from the arizona sonoran desert museum, and an REI shirt for my man.  It wasn't a very "high fashion" swap haha
text:Nice!  With the exception of the Eileen Fisher sweater my scores haven't been high end either but several have been workhorses.   I remember I got 2 pairs of pretty decent skinny jeans, a workout tank, an olive H&M blouse that was work appropriate when I needed more, and a pair of black cropped pajama pants covered in tacky martini glasses that I adore.  I also got some guitar tab books and several novels, and a work mug.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop for specific things without google clogging up with items from fast fashion? Or.

They’re both very light on smaller brands though so it’s only useful to an extent.	episode_done:True
text:Is anyone into MBTI? Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels:INTJ here...

text:Women who have moved for extended periods of time on 1 or 2 suitcases only, how did you do it? Here's the beginning of my process	labels:How permanent is the move? If it's only a couple of months then you could also just bring a couple of basic items and leave space in your bag to buy new clothes in your destination. This is what I did when I studied abroad for a year. The clothes are then also a nice souvenir for yourself.   If it's a long term or permanent, again just bring the things you absolutely love the most then buy things there. You can also have your other closed shipped to you in a parcel if you really can't do without them. Obviously if it's a permanent move the issue of fitting everything in a suitcase to bring home isn't really an issue.   Depending on what climate your moving from and to you might find you don't have enough clothes for said climate. For example, I moved UK to Japan, and I absolutely did not have enough clothes for the hot, humid summers here.  The same goes for culture. Many of my friends ended up having to throw away all of their tanktops and lowcut blouses because they're not culturally appropriate here.   It's also really common to change size when moving to another country because of diet and lifestyle changes. So you could find that all the clothes you bring no longer fit you after a few months.  The only longterm move situation where it's better to bring everything is if it'll be difficult to find your size where you're moving. For example if you're 6' and moving to east asia you'll have a hard time finding clothes
text:It's a year now but might become two (Depends on the opportunities pending over there) but buying clothing where I'm going can be quite expensive, and shipping would be really expensive too since it would be from one side of the world to quite literally the other.  I don't think it'll be difficult to find clothing my size for emergencies I'm pretty average size 8/10 5'3. But I'll keep the size change in mind, I do tend to fluctuate weight and I hadn't considered that at all. Thank you!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Can the stain of forced and child labour be removed from cotton?	labels:Interesting article detailing the extreme difficulty of being able to accurately track cotton sources.  My one quibble with the article, and media in general surrounding issues like this is their sugar coating it. Call it what it is. It's not forced labor. It's fucking slavery.
text:It did directly compare it to American slavery, but yeah, I get your point. I guess they do that since when most people hear slavery they think of chattel slavery, which was incredibly brutal. What's happening now is a bit more iffy. Not only is it a lot less brutal, people aren't really owned 24/7, like a slave. People in Uzbekistan are (mostly were these days, as you read) forced to work at certain times of year, so they're temporary slaves, which just sounds kinda odd.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Canadian Tuxedo: A Denim-On-Denim Inspo Album	labels:I thought this was a sh!tpost at first and I'm hoping its not and that I'm not making a fool of myself by admiring it, lol.  This is an amazing album!!! Love the amazing range and inclusivity of styles and shapes and colors and EVERYTHING.  I love that some of these styles are very deliberate and polished, especially one of the first ones with the girl with yellow heels, a stellar high bun, and the cropped twisted top. I'm equally a fan of the sweatshirt/jean vest jacket, relaxed fit bottoms, and sneakers. I feel like I could pull that off on my 90s grunge throwback days. I already have all those silhouettes. I'm unsure if I could pull off the double/triple denim in the more fitted pieces.	episode_done:True
text:Arc'teryx Radsten Parka (2020) Review	labels:Nice review! I often discuss the brand with some clients in my store, especially when they wear it, as I carry Norwegian Rain.

Appreciating the Arc'teryx brand very much btw, thanks for the shared info here!

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:In my experience, lower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose) and spending more tends to lead to a more noticeable improvement in quality up to a certain point. That's painting with a broad brush though... leather dress shoes and boots scale much better than sneakers or sandals, where mid-range options are going to be good enough for most people.  T-shirts, dress shirts, denim, and accessories in low-to-mid-range are generally good enough from a quality perspective IMO and I've only really paid more in those categories for a design I like rather than because I think I'm getting something higher quality. There's nothing wrong IMO with buying something because you like the way it looks even if a similar quality alternative exists at a lower price, but that's harder to do if you're shopping on a budget.  I'll also add that for all of the above, your dollar goes a lot farther if you're willing to shop used. Sites like Ebay, Grailed, reddit/styleforum B/S/T threads, etc. have made it a lot easier to buy preowned clothes without having to set foot into a thrift store.  TL;DR When shopping on a budget I'd focus first on having a high quality pair of shoes and jacket. Consider buying used clothes to stretch your budget further.
text:> ower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose)  Also because of the cost of raw materials like wool or leather. A $100 wool coat will always be thin and flimsy because wool isn't cheap and you need a lot of it for a coat. The only way to make that $100 coat is to use less wool, either by replacing some of it with polyester or by using less of it.  (Which, in this specific example, leads to people buying a cheap woollen coat and a cheap down jacket and wearing them both at the same time. Which does make sense for a lot of people, but I can't help finding it a bit funny.)	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I know “fashion” but people of minorities are always forced to try better. Some Insights	labels:As a black man I'm not surprised by this at all. I don't think I'm as affected as most because my clothes are overtly fashionable and often feminine, and that tends to disarm any preconceptions of "dangerous" and "violent". But I see it all the time, and I do notice a difference on the rare occasions I just dress plainly. Before Covid, if I walked home from the gym at night in sweats I wouldn't put my hood up or my hands in my pockets because I walked by one of campus police's favorite sitting spots. We only need to look at Trayvon Martin for confirmation. One note about the study:  > While it is tempting to tell individuals that how they dress can evoke negative biases, this avoids addressing a bigger issue … In fact, directing individuals to change what they wear places the burden of mitigating stereotypes and associated prejudices on the wearer. Instead, we need to consider how we can change the perceptions of those who hold and use such stereotypes in harmful ways.  I agree and I appreciate the sentiment, but I'll be dead before we change racists' perceptions on this. It's not a burden I or any other black man should have to carry, but realistically it's a lot easier for me to change my clothes than for a racist to change their thinking.  ETA: Black women have it way worse. They get to have racism **and** misogyny!

text:The suit looks dark grey to my eye, though monitor may be misleading.  If it is indeed dark grey/charcoal, I would not recommend navy pants, I'd suggest a lighter grey with no pattern that is very noticeably lighter than the jacket. Agree with the above poster that the goal here isn't to match, but to contrast in a... Controlled... way, especially since you're planning for a funeral.  White shirt, simple/plain tie in any dark color (black or grey would be traditional for a funeral, but dark blue, burgundy, or dark green would be fine as well).	labels:I think navy is the right bet.

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:Hi! As a stylist I get this question ALOT. For starters don't get rid of too much before buying replacements. What ends up happening is we get rid of everything without establishing what pieces we actually need.   Start with establishing your personal style. What do your want your closet/style to be? What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping! Now that you have a moodboard and list of things you need you can shop to fin in the gaps and more importantly you can shop with intention!   &#x200B;  I hope that wasn't too much and was helpful haha. I'm always happy to help.
text:That's actually really helpful! How do you suggest finding my style? I feel like I have such a wide style that I wear (minimal, to punk, to cutesy, etc). I feel like I love all of my clothes but some go months without being worn.	labels:I think it’s fine to have multiple styles and even clothes you don’t wear that often. Maybe be more conscious in your purchases about how often you’ll wear something but if you already own it and love it there’s no rush to get rid of it just because it’s not an everyday piece.	episode_done:True
text:Can we talk sleepwear?	labels:I was very into this idea as well and invested in some Lunya PJs...but that elegant person I invisioned didn't magically appear. I still had a big messy bun, acne patches on my face and slept with my mouth wiiide open. I didn't feel as comfortable in those PJs and that fantasy I had didn't come true, ya know? I don't want to discourage you, just my two cents as someone who had a very similar thought process  I went back to tank tops and sweatpants and I find I appreciate them a lot more now. I make sure they fit properly and don't have stains or holes so I still feel reasonably put together.
text:THIS. I have been working on a lot of \~self improvement\~ this year and part of making my goals for 2021 has been distinguishing "the person I aspire to be" from "the person I am willing to be" from "the person I can afford to be."   I too have been on a journey to live a budget life of luxury especially when it comes to things like matching lingerie all the time and sleepwear and what I've realized is that I'm not actually interested in luxurious sleepwear. I'm actually interested in being the person that has two hours to unwind every night, takes a warm bath in a massive tub with a v expensive lush bath bomb, does a full face care routine, brushes her hair out, has little tinctures on her vanity to apply just a bit of perfume, puts on a silk gown, lights a candle, reads in bed, and turns out her lamp at a generous 9:30pm.   The truth is that the desire for the sleepwear is really a desire to have more silence, more time spent on me, and more time doing things that look and feel good simply because I like them and not because they serve any kind of real function.   I have moved away from using old t-shirts because I like the idea of dedicated sleepwear but I usually just go with a solid color cami / tank top / shirt and either some shorts or some sweat pants depending on how cold it is. They're cheaper but still look thoughtful.	labels:This is so beautifully articulated that it made feel things.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 23, 2020	labels:Not to bring up the cape thread again, but something really has been stuck in my craw. It was some comment about how people who basically wear cowboy shit are “attention seekers.” This was very clearly framed as a bad thing. Western wear aside, I feel like the subtext of the comment was basically “if you’re not wearing something to fit in, you’re seeking attention.” Isn’t the pursuit of dressing better/more fashionably inherently attention seeking? And why is that a bad thing? I don’t understand what seems to be the lurker notion of “wanting to dress better to blend in better.” If wearing the shit I wear labels me as an “attention seeker,” then I’ll wear that badge proudly.   Sorry for the rant, this really just got under my skin
text:Lurker concept of dressing better is dressing “good” in a mainstream sense. Something that is restrained without being flashy. Something that other guys will say “cool jacket!” But won’t be scary to wear.   It’s how the basic Bastard came around. Inoffensive but still good.   It’s hard to talk to my friend who clearly wants to dress better and cooler but just can’t. He loves all the stuff I wear cause it’s cool and preppy (he’s also New England born and bred) but he’s in the more jock/frat category than I am (engineering nerd/artsy) and I think the idea of stepping too far out of line will be met with ridicule. I don’t really notice that stuff cause I’ve been doing it for so long, but for him even a new jacket or sneakers is really stretching it and he’s hesitant to step away from normal guy stuff.	labels:Yeah, I think I fall into the trap of dressing like this for so long that it’s sorta second nature at this point. So what is out of the norm for some people feels comfortable for me. I understand the fear of stepping away from the norm, and also understand that’s where most lurkers are. But I don’t understand the mindset of different=always bad. Idk maybe it just boils down to simply wanting to fit in

text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:Hot take: nothing is really original anymore, and most everything has been done before or inspired by someone or something else. For the luxury brand to automatically claim ownership simply because it's *designer* is bullshit imo.  We all know that quality differences will be present. A $3k coat isn't going to be on the same level as a $100 one. If someone wants to spend the extra money, cool. If someone likes the look but wants polyester instead and can only spend a lot less, cool. If the designer coat is really that great, there will be a market for it. If tons of people are buying the knockoff and no one is springing for the expensive version... Well, maybe you misjudged your market or overpriced your item.  I don't have a problem with knockoffs because they appeal to different crowds. Not everyone can afford a multi-thousand dollar handbag. Why should a struggling single mom who likes the design of something be relegated to a plain black bag? If she finds a similar style at Kohl's, she should be allowed to buy and enjoy it. I feel holding designer items as being superior, and then looking down on knockoffs, is classist. End of.

text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:Honestly, I think if an item brings you joy, fits your budget, and you’re sure you’ve got things to wear it with then it’s ‘worth’ whatever the price is.   I try to spend more on things I’m sure I’ll wear over and over. Like my fake leather jacket I’ve worn every cool day for eight years finally started cracking on me so I decided to throw down the money on a good real leather replacement that will last me a long time. Same thing if I wear through a favorite pair of jeans or have a specific style of top I know I love wearing. Those things are worth the extra cash.   But for a trendy thing I just want to experiment with? I see no harm in tossing out $20 on it, seeing just how often I wear it and then buying a higher quality version later if it starts to wear out. I try to limit these purchases so I’m not wasting money on a closet full of trendy stuff I never end up wearing but I still spend $20-$30 on a new “it” item to feel like my wardrobe is getting refreshed each season.   Tl;dr life is short, value is subjective. If that cheap forever 21 cardigan is calling your name then get it even if you know it’s not gonna last forever. So long as you actually wear it and enjoy it then it’s not money wasted.

I’d also pay attention to the content of the compliment. “That’s a cool sweater” is NOT the same thing as “you look great in that sweater”, KWIM?   Sometimes people are appreciating the design or color or novelty of an item and not the big picture of how it works for you.
text:>I’d also pay attention to the content of the compliment.  This is so interesting, but this is kind of hard too, sometimes. I had thought that maybe the novelty of the color was the reason for most of the compliments, but I have had several people who know me well also tell me that they like the color because it looks like it is natural and not like I dyed it (which, I guess is true since it is the result of a botched lightening job and not actual dye?).  Then again, these people also told me for years that they liked my bangs ... maybe they're all just benevolent liars. Unfortunately my hairdresser quit during the pandemic due to having a vulnerable family member so there's no one now I trust to tell me the truth about my hair.	labels:Well, I think it’s also important to recognize that people have different tastes and preferences. Lord knows I would never let my husband, who I love dearly, choose my clothes.   It’s also possible to have multiple things be true simultaneously. The color is unusual, it looks natural on you *and also* it’s not what you wanted (I’m guessing, based on “botched lightening job”).  Hair color is tough because it doesn’t lend itself to the “well, I’ll keep it in the closet and see how often I actually wear it” compromise that most of us make with clothes that we’re iffy about.

text:Revisiting Tim Gunn's List of 10 Style Must-haves	labels:To me, this is “wardrobe staples if you have a traditional office job with a business dress code” tbh. I do, so I own a version of most of these, but that kind of work environment is less and less common, and I think a lot of women no longer have much use for blazers, trench coats, dress pants, etc.
text:I was actually coming here to say just this. I don't own or need over half of this list for my lifestyle. I work in an office that is fairly casual so I'm not sure what I would do with dress pants or a blazer or even a "classic" white top. I also think that having a trench coat really depends on the weather where you live. I need light jackets that keep me dry not long coats for fashions sake.	labels:I live in California, so almost no one I know has a wardrobe like this. (but not LA)  Our list would be something like:  flip flops that you can wear to the beach or to lunch  casual dress you can throw over a swimsuit or go out in  jean shorts or crop jeans  Patagonia jacket lol  The outfit for whatever sport you're into whether that is cycling, tennis, etc. You wear this when you've done your sport and are then running other errands.  Big fat down coat for when you're complaining about the weather dipping below 50   Trendy workout clothes for going to the grocery store   Bunch of boho tops  1000 beanies   Fin.	episode_done:True

text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I work for the local parks department in the summer and as a baker in the winter. So my summer job has a uniform and my winter job I have to wear more grungy clothes that can be in a kitchen. This winter I decided fuck it, I wanna look a little nicer at work so I have been wearing clothes that are a bit nicer for me and making sure I always have an apron over them. Otherwise I just have a lot of stuff that will rarely get used. Before covid I loved dressing nicer to go out to dinner or a brewery or even to a friends, but now when I’m not at work I mostly wear sweats and leggings. Just waiting for covid to end so I can at least look nice out and about again because I never will at my jobs haha	episode_done:True
text:Dr. Biden's embroidered Oscar de la Renta Dress was beautiful - What's your favorite brand that utilizes embroidery? (or your holy grail embroidered piece)	labels:Vivetta.

While I haven’t worn those items in a couple years, I regard them as true works of art, and I will keep them in my collection.

text:Cyberpunk and Fashion | A Video Essay | 40 Minutes	labels:Great video and i am myself a fan of the Cyberpunk genre.  However i think that because of all the raised environmental awareness i don’t believe synthetic fabrics have any future but rather organic fabrics such as a cottons or wool etc.
text:I think synthetic fabrics are definitely here to stay and evolve tbh. They’re engrained in general fashion because of its military heritage. But, I notice some techwear fits overlook a lot of good organic fabrics. They’re classics that work for certain climates just as good as synthetics, or tech clothes. Well made Wool clothing is the best, and has great properties. Wool is a very technical material that’s been used for a LONG time. Cotton is alright for hot days, it’s major disadvantages are how much water it absorbs, and in really cold environments it’s dangerous if wet, or when sweating.	labels:Yes synthetics are here to stay for sure and i can totally see the military wearing uniforms made out of cheaper materials etc...  But synthetic fabrics havn’t been around for that long and it has already caused major environmental pollutions. It had it’s break through in the 1960’s so in this short amount of time it has caused a disaster already. Every time we laundry polyester or synthetics micro fibres releases and polluting our ocean water, so the fish get it in them which we eventually get back in our bodies again when we consume fish for example.   So even if it’s here to stay i’m longing for it to be taxed to the degree where it is not profitable to produce it anymore.   And absolutely yes! Wool is defenetily the best way to go. It keeps you warm as it releases steam from the body which keeps the wearer in a better state. While synthetic clothes on the other hand causes a ”thermos” effect which forces the wearer to compensate with more laundrying and tons of parfume because of all the sweating.   Cottons is for sure not as good but it still ”breathes” in a way that synthetics doesn’t and can be made in many different ways depending on which season. Brushed to turn it into cozy flannel or corduroy for colder climate or denim or percale for warm weather.   My overall feeling tells me that we will move towards buying more consiously and less clothes of higher quality (since synthetics will be taxed too high anyway) in the future but to take better care of what we bought and therefore the trends will slow down a bit and leave people less anxious to feel constantly outdated and forced to buy the latest all the time. Which is ridiculus when you think about it.	episode_done:True

I regret nothing! If you have the disposable income to pay up front and wait for the refund to be processed, I highly suggest getting all your options so you aren't left wondering if you really have the right size or ordering another pair to try on.    Edit: as /u/fartymcfly22 pointed out, you might want to check that the company doesn't just throw away their returns before ordering duplicates like this!

text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:Depends on what it is. Engagement ring? Probably not gonna be able to wear that, might as well sell it or have it reset into a different piece.   One of my exes is the son of a jeweler and I got some extremely nice pieces in the 5 years we were together. There is no way I would have parted with any of it (unlikely to buy pieces at this price point for myself) but I did return the engagement ring since it was his mother's diamond. Everything else is still in rotation.
text:That's very interesting! One of the pieces I'm struggling with is, in fact, a ring, although not an engagement ring. Did you find you had a hard time detaching the relationship from the pieces you did keep, or not so much?	labels:I didn’t ever really feel weird about it because it was all stuff I really really liked. I did get rid of the one piece I wasn’t thrilled about (a watch, I don’t wear them and he didn’t listen - shockingly part of why we’re not together!) but kept the ones that I could see myself wearing. It took me a bit to wear any of it after the breakup but I told myself the relationship was what sucked, not the jewelry. 😂
text:Ha, I love it! I really like 2 pieces in particular but think it's gonna take a bit to wear it, as you say. I never really wear a lot of jewellery, especially now that we can't go anywhere, so it still feels very connected to those few times I did wear them which of course was with the ex lol.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Plants and Fashion: A Marriage of Obsessions	labels:There's definitely been a HUGE resurgance of botanical love in the past decade! Monstera print got big during the heydey of cool Tumblr bloggers, and we all know Millennials love having plants of all types in their homes. Having tons of greenery in your home is still super trendy to this day. So I can definitely see why botanics have gotten big in fashion and beauty design + marketing. For me personally, I love botanics in fashion!   That said, I enjoy botanics in fashion when the colors, prints, and fabrics are unique. I'm not a fan of old-fashioned or twee pastel florals, or overdone flowers like roses, tulips, sunflowers, or daisies. I love to see olive leaves, clementines, ivy, vines, fresh sage, lemons, and interesting flowers like baby's breath, poppies, hyacinth, orchids, honeysuckle... These all look so beautiful printed on jewelry and clothes – especially when done up on silky fabrics, printed in unique ways (asymmetrical, VERY large, VERY small, etc), and done up in really interesting colors (cream, fiery orange, poppy red, olive green, sage green, bright sky blue, eggplant...).  I think, given the popularity of greenery and eco-consciousness with Millennials (and now Gen Z), that botanics in fashion will definitely continue as a trend! But, like I said, they'll have to stay ever-evolving and modern. The bright green monstera and cacti and banana prints of 2010-2015 are out, and muted olive leaves and sage leaves and clementines are in!

text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:Definitely misogynistic and sexist, but it’s also the 1950s so that makes sense. I’m sure Marilyn herself didn’t realize that she was unconsciously being sexist and contributing to the problems that she (and other women) were facing. It’s kind of sad in a way when you think about it.
text:I think Marilyn was very conscious of what she was doing here. She carried a folksy persona, deliberately catering to working men and women, and had that "What do you mean by suspecting I'm dressing sexy by wearing dresses so tight they have to be sewn on, I can't help that I'm CURVY! It is those who think it's on purpose that are truly lewd!!"-vibe all the way through.   Basically, she tried to be as sexy as possible, but because that wasn't really allowed due to misogyny, she tried and mostly succeeded to pass it off as pure innocence. Here she is saying "I just want to please you guys, it's only natural - why do you judge me for being feminine? Men like feminine women bla bla" in an attempt to make the media be less judgmental about her livelihood.   She wasn't treated respectfully even though she was a huge star, because even though Holywood wanted a woman who was first and foremost sexy, they also judged and shamed the stars for trying to be exactly that. No wonder she was defensive about it - she lived up to the ideal the most, so she also had to be the spokesperson and defender of it. She was very much aware of her image.	labels:I think I didn’t properly explain what I meant. Her saying that “only women criticize what I wear” is very similar to the things that “oh I’m not like other women”  or “I only hang out with the guys” type of women say. Women like this tend to have internalized misogyny that they are not conscious of, and they continue to contribute to this societal problem by trying to put down other women while elevating themselves.   It’s sad because she suffers from exactly the problem that she is contributing to. I don’t think she had some “evil” thoughts or “connived” behind the scenes - in fact I believe from her personal life (and from people that knew her), she was a very sweet girl who was quite naive (which you can kind of tell based on how her relationships often went).   Also I don’t believe she had control over what she could wear while on set or that very famous JFK dress. Her stylist probably styled her and she had little to no input into her outfits.
text:That's funny, I have also read an absurd amount of litterate on MM, and I have the exact opposite thoughts of her. I think she was a very smart business woman, who knew how to play the game - I don't think being sweet and naive would carry you to the top in 1950's Hollywood. Especially not when she started off as an orphan with nothing to her name.    That being said, I don't think being conniving when you work in the entertainment industry, is evil or anything. I think it's really hard (actually impossible) to project an image as consistently as she did, without being incredibly self aware. She could have internalized misogyny, but she could have also played the "cool girl" in order to win approval.	labels:She definitely knew how to play the game and did it pretty well for a while.	episode_done:True

Ideally I like to return in store, but I have found a lot of the stores near me have closed this year so that is a more annoying option.  I also hate that so few brands include shipping labels, I do not have printer so that means I need to go to Fedex to print, and then drop off at UPS or postoffice. It is annoying (printing at UPS is too expensive).

Then I just started searching for fashion influencers on Instagram and YouTube. Check out Lindsey Albanese, she is so chic and gives lots of practical tips on how to tap into trends but also finding staple pieces as well. (I would recommend her YouTube channel.) I also really like Miss Louie on YouTube too with her capsule wardrobe videos especially. Hope that helps get you started! :)	episode_done:True

text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:I’d agree that personal comfort is the big thing.    I’d also pay attention to the content of the compliment. “That’s a cool sweater” is NOT the same thing as “you look great in that sweater”, KWIM?   Sometimes people are appreciating the design or color or novelty of an item and not the big picture of how it works for you.
text:This - many people tend to compliment things that catch the eye or are a change from the norm. They may be noticing the item itself or the alteration (e.g., from long hair to short), but this doesn’t necessarily mean it works for you. (Also, with friends/family, they’re likely to compliment any changes to be nice, even if it’s not an improvement.)   I agree with OP’s stance of focusing on how you feel over how others react. I love jumpsuits, and lots of friends tease that I look like a mechanic in one I own, but I like it and wear it anyway. Similarly, I get a lot of compliments on a sleeveless dress that makes me feel like a frumpy MIL, and that dress has since been retired.	labels:	episode_done:True

It’s cheap crap made by underpaid and exploited workers so we can wear it for a month and be thrown in a landfill. It drives me crazy that influencers constantly advertise clothes from cheap retailers because I know they are getting the outfits for free/are getting paid to post about them. The loungewear sets are thin and warp when you wash them. The dresses are paper thin. Bathing suits feel like they’re going to fall apart. But they say “omg look how cute!” for a buck.   They also advertise the Walmart delivery service saying “omg, ordered this from Walmart 2 hours ago and it’s already here!”   If they were advertising quality clothing from sustainable companies that’s a whole different story.	episode_done:True

I only show cleavage in a loose top. I have a chiffon skinny strap flowy top that I love wearing all seasons with or without a cardigan or denim jacket. I also have linen long sleeve top with bell sleeves that is very cleavagey in a flattering way.    Hope this gives you some inspo!

I have one that's dark blue, so that's alright, but there are no pockets, which I miss. I like it because it's lightweight and versatile, you can easily wear it on its own (in the springtime/summer), but because it's oversized it also looks good with a lot of layers underneath. It's my favorite jacket I've owned so far (apart from a lightweight bomber) and I find it both stylish and useful. I also love long jackets.  edit: I did not see which sub I was in sorry. Nevermind me! it's still a good coat though.	episode_done:True
text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.

Not sure about the chinos as they are much roomier than I am used to but have a pair on the way from Brooks Brothers too so will wait to compare them.
text:Are they roomier across the seat? That's where my LE chinos let me down - far too much fabric.	labels:They are a little but not detrimentally so. It is more that my current and past chinos are reasonably form fitting. These have a more classic cut. Not sure how much I like it. Once my other pair arrive I will probably end up doing fit check pictures.	episode_done:True
text:How many pairs of jeans and pairs of shoes should you own?	labels:I think it's interesting that you hone in on "needs" when for many people fashion fills a hybrid function of both hobby and utility. Both shoes and purses seem prone to being "collector's items" moreso than other garments (leggings, sweaters, etc.) and it makes sense to me as a fashion hobbyist and collector that people would have more than they "need" or use regularly. Also, as people age they typically gain more buying power, space to store things, and access to various occasions (business events, formal events, lifestyle changes that may necessitate a wider variety of things to fulfill a wider variety of functions).   Furthermore, I haven't found this sub's focus on "purging"/closet cleaning reflected in real life--while people do obviously consign or donate old clothing, it's pretty common for people to keep things or simply put things in storage as their use wanes. So on that note, it seems unsurprising that people have a handful of things that see constant rotation and a handful of things that are rarely used but are still enjoyed, so there is no reason to get rid of them.

text:Married dad-of-three wears skirts and heels to work ‘because he can’	labels:Based on everything I've ever heard from women, I don't know why you'd ever voluntarily wear stilettos. But whatever floats his boat I suppose.
text:Yeah. I low key hate this. Not for the gender non-conformity, but for perpetuating the notion that uncomfortable and restrictive clothing and high heeled shoes are aesthetically desirable for anyone.	labels:They're aesthetically desirable for the people who like them. There's an unfair pressure on women to wear them, but that's not the case here. This man is under no obligations to wear them; he does so for no other reason than he likes them. I also wear restrictive clothing and high heeled shoes. They're aesthetically desirable for me because I like how they look. But my wearing them doesn't obligate anyone else to, and I'd argue that a man wearing them doesn't contribute to the pressure on women to wear them (and that's the only pressure because there isn't one on men). There's no victim in this case, at least not the way you're framing it.	episode_done:True

I rented from Avis and it was a bit expensive, about $450 (I purchased extra insurance). When I went to check on the rental, it said that the insurance was now $3,500 a day instead of $35 a day, so the rental would be more like $7,000. I was able to cancel the extra insurance, but wtf? In no way should it be legal to charge 14X the estimated price. The worst part is, no customer service agent was able to tell me why the charge increased, and the option for extra insurance just popped up at $35 a day.

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:I have moved to different climates many times. My recommendation would to not purge or change anything until your move is complete. The reason is, you definitely get climatized, where what would consider "warm" in the winter to you now will feel chilly enough to wear heavyweight items you hadn't expected would work once you are climatized. A lot of items that you think will/won't work end up being the opposite, etc. You mentioned having less storage, so it sounds like you will need to offload/purge at some point, but I'd wait to do it once you get there and put it off for as long as you can to truly see what items work. I'll never move to a cold climate again but even moving to different warmer climates, I will wait to do any paring down/purging until I can get a little climatized and adapt.

text:I have made a realization that, apart from school uniforms, I only ever wear polo shirts	labels:I think as long as you avoid the synthetic fabric blends and look for high quality pique or sweater knit styles, polo shirts make an excellent staple.   I would explore polo shirts that have minimal branding and instead explore visual interest with contrast ribbing, or through muted sweater patterns.
text:Yeah it takes a little effort but a polo can work. I've been wearing them a lot lately for work from home since the collar is enough to make people think I'm not just lounging in my PJs but more comfortable than a button-down.  Pay attention to the fabric, like you mentioned, and the cut and put a little thought into what you wear it with and it's easy to overcome the retail employee connotation IMO.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:Hello there I am new here in this subreddit 😅  Anyways I have been eye-ing for a shoe that I have been interested for a while now, that particular shoe are the "Nike Cortez Leather" (Red And Blue Varsity) which I very have grown accustomed to. I have researched this shoe and even watch certain reviews for it that I conclude that I want to buy it.  However in my case getting this variant of this shoe and to my proper size has been quite a challenge for me. It's availability is quite rare in my Country (SEA) and all the shoes that I have found are either fake knockoffs and well soldout ads for other shoe websites.  Recently within my dedication to get this shoe, I thought of just buying the "Basic" Variant of the Cortez, and dissapointment follows as I picked the wrong size for my shoe (in my haste to buy the shoe) I measured my foot and it is exactly 26cm and and alongside with the confusion for the knowledge of the older shoe that I bought which is US 12 and EU 44 "World Balance Freeman" it confused me and well....... I bought a Large Shoe 😂 (specifically I bought the size 12 Basic Cortez). Although I placed an exchange size for an US 11, I might be in a pickle since it will still be big for me lol.  Now anyways to finally ask my question, If by somehow the exchange US 11 were still too big for me, Can I wear a WOMANS "Nike Cortez Leather" instead???? For that I will also need advice for the sizing and basically an expert knowledge in this situation. In my case all that is available for this shoe are for Womans Shoe, and within my research I read that Nike Shoes are Unisexual (but for now I need an Experts Advice on this matter) really in a pickle, so pls help ma dudes.	episode_done:True

Like I wouldn't wear a sequined micro mini or ballgown to my office job, but I would absolutely wear a velvet suit and a bunch of brooches. I have also noticed that when I wear pieces that I love, my confidence increases throughout the day. Sometimes I have moments in the day where I look down and think "dang, this outfit is cool and I feel cool!" Those moments just give me a boost of confidence all on their own. The last thing is that people are generally too busy with their own lives to notice what you're wearing. They're doing them, so do you and have fun with it!   edit-words

text:What’s your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:I’m from Minnesota and I can relate to the winter fashion struggle lol. I’m a huge bargain hunter because I’m on that college student budget but I find winter outerwear to be one area where you mostly get what you pay for, although there are deals to be had. Layers are your best friend.  A pair of straight leg or mom jeans will probably leave you enough space to wear a pair of fleece lined leggings underneath to keep you toasty. Wool or cashmere sweaters in tight knits as opposed to more open weaves, with a tight long sleeve tshirt or long underwear shirt underneath. Riding boots with enough calf space to wear long wool socks underneath if you prefer skinny jeans/pants or dresses/skirts. I thrift a lot of this stuff or buy it at outlet stores (Nordstrom Rack, Marshall’s, etc).  A high-quality wool coat in a neutral color is definitely a worthwhile investment if you don’t like the look of down parkas. I got mine from a local outlet for $80 (90% off!) and it stands up really well to cold weather. I have a really good sized collection of winter accessories (hats, gloves, etc.) and I buy some cheap stuff in trendy colors/styles from Marshall’s once a year. I’m keeping an eye out for some faux leather gloves in a fun color for this year! That said, I think decent quality leather/faux leather gloves lined with a wool or cashmere blend and a hat and scarf in wool or cashmere are also good to have. They definitely keep me warmer than the cheap stuff. I have good luck at Sierra Trading Post (same company as Marshall’s/TJMaxx but focused on outdoorsy stuff) for that kind of thing.	episode_done:True

text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:I don't think there's anything wrong with preferring dresses and leggings and it doesn't inherently signify that you are somehow unworthy for pants or "letting yourself go".   The thing is, historically speaking, dresses were actually far more practical for a woman's body due the cyclical changes we all experience, from menstrual bloating/cramping, to minor weight fluctuations, to pregnancy and breastfeeding (historically there wasn't much choice about the last two but obviously now there is), cuz you could cinch up or let out your dress depending on how you were doing.   It's only now that stretchy fabric is truly mainstream that pants have truly become as practical and cost effective in that they can tolerate a lot more cyclical size changes, which are *normal*.  Edit: not to mention all the times people would gain and lose weight due to the availability of food.   I'd say I have a pretty confident mindset and 90% of my non work wardrobe is dresses and skirts/shirt combos. I wear undersummers in the spring and summer, leggings and sweater tights in the winter and I've gotten SO MUCH MORE USE out of my dresses... They lasted me up until my 8th month of pregnancy, I barely had to buy maternity clothes.  I have been able to wear the same knit dress/leggings combo at 180lbs prepregnancy and later at 210 lbs post partum and still look cute.  What pair of pants could pull that off? Almost none, I tell you.  Saved me a lot of $$$.   No matter what I weigh, I always have a bit of a belly, so most pants dig into that anyways, which isn't comfortable. Only truly high waisted stuff feels ok, but I don't want to wear that in the summer.   It sounds like disordered thinking is creeping up on you, and you may have to consciously remind yourself that there's nothing wrong with enjoying comfy clothes that don't restrict your abdomen.
text:I cannot thank you enough for this! I’m a huge history buff,and I’m really interested in fashion and costumes, so the whole historical explanation really resonated with me.  I hope I’m paraphrasing correctly, but I really like what you said about separating your preferences from body image,because ironicly, my fellow adhd-friends who have the same anti-pants sentiments as me are all pretty petite and thin. Also on another ironic note, I definitely have been the fittest i’ve ever been when I’ve let myself wear what I want and feel best in, it’s hard to have the motivation to work out and eat for your body when you are so dang uncomfortable!

Are you a student, or professional? do you go to a lot of fancy restaurants and the like in your free time (pre-covid obv), or are you more outdoorsy? This may seem kind of obvious but you'd be shocked at how many people don't think about these things when they dress, and your lifestyle is really important for creating outfits that you not only like, but will wear often! Pinterest is great but it can also be a little unrealistic sometimes. After you consider practicality its much easier to put together outfits and find things you like that match the occasion. Also, congrats on getting out of your parents' house, and good luck with the search!! you'll do great :)	episode_done:True
text:Speaking to the LGBTQ-owned label whose kilts were adopted by Proud Boys	labels:I understand discontinuing the kilts to disassociate with them, but why not just keep selling them and continue to give all profits to charity? Yes they’re still using your clothes, but you’re letting them shoot themselves in the foot by getting them to contribute to the exact opposite of what they stand for. It’s a win-win-win situation.

text:Sewing your own clothes	labels:Whether it's worth it or not completely depends on what you personally value in your clothes.  Economy? If you just compare any shirt to any shirt, it's often not cheaper to sew it yourself. Fabric is expensive and if you use patterned fabric, you're going to have a lot of scrap pieces due to pattern matching (if that's a priority to you, it's often not a priority in cheaper fast fashion clothes).  Fit, style and comfort wise? If you get good enough at sewing, you can customize the fit of your clothes, choose the fabrics you like, and sew them in a way that you feel is comfortable, without itchy seams, bulk, tight shoulders, excess fabric pouting or whatever.  They're going to be perfect for your taste.  Quality compared to the price? Here sewing your own stuff will definitely be worth it. You can choose a good quality fabric, prewash the fabric to ensure a good fit even after washes, have a proper pattern that suits you perfectly, and then cut the pattern out of fabric that you've pattern and bias matched perfectly, which also means no further twisting after washing. Basically, clever and good pattern matching is going to take the garment from looking 20 bucks to 200 bucks.  There are many more factors to include, like time and labor and interest etc, but basically, if you like it, see it as a hobby that will provide you with clothes that most likely are going to last better than ready made clothes for the same amount of money.

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:The company already made money off of the original purchase of the shirt, so you buying second hand doesn’t really benefit them in any way. If you really want the item, buying it second hand is probably the most ethical choice you can make. If someone asks where the piece is from, just say you don’t know so they won’t be tempted to buy from the brand lol
text:But the second question is where to buy second hand from? For example near me we have the Salvation Army and a church thrift shop. I used to live next to a giant Salvation Army donation center and loved it, but after learning about their philosophy and some of the shady things they’ve done I no longer feel like I can ethically support them! Then supporting the local church thrift is also problematic given their stances on social issues! When I lived in California I was able to find some thrift stores that actually gave to causes I support (out of the closet etc) but now that I’m in the Midwest there aren’t any of these! I just want like a thrift store that donates to something like education or food banks without the religious/social aspect.	labels:In my part of Canada, basically the only two thrift stores are Value Village (for-profit company which donates a portion of its proceeds to a diabetes charity), and Goodwill By Salvation Army (non profit/charity I believe? With a history of discrimination against LGBT community and poor treatment of workers with disabilities)   The most common reaction I get, when people say "where did you get that sweater" and I say "Value Village", is  "ewwww, didn't you know that's a for profit company! You're wasting your time buying used, you're so foolish thinking you're a good person when you're just supporting some *corporation*, that's so gross, you're just as bad as me so don't pat yourself on the back for shopping there, you capitalist!"   And like... Really?? Wtf is up with that response? I'd rather support a for-profit used clothing store, than a for-profit new clothing store like Walmart or Forever 21. Isn't doing something better than doing nothing? Or, as the saying goes," don't let perfection be the enemy of good?"    (especially when my only alternative to value village is... Pretty much the last charity I'd want my money going to)	episode_done:True

text:Fashion trends	labels:Platform heels, low rise jeans, I will never give up my skinny jeans ever, Uggs, sandals that aren’t Birkenstock’s or Chaco’s, shirts that aren’t cropped or 4 sizes too big, and summer tops that can be worn with a regular bra, those are surprisingly hard to come by these days, apparently fashion companies think people don’t have boobs anymore.
text:They never have. It just used to be that visible bra straps were "taboo", so most summer shirts were built for people who would like to cover the straps. As people have gotten away from covering them as a rule, that's opened up a lot of new styles. Plus, the new bralette styles have made it more of a fashion vs what would have been considered a lack of covering.   Still doesn't mean I love having few options that cover a decent amount of boobage.	labels:Do visible bra straps look frumpy unless it's a cute lacey/strappy bralette? I tried wearing my regular black going-out bra with a black top... i think it looked weird because the plain strap didn't look intentional. Not sure what the trends are but i'm tired of trying to figure out how to wear cute dresses/tops with a bra underneath
text:Personally - I just don't like the way visible bra straps look on me.  To me, it's kind of akin to wearing low rise jeans and a visible thong pulled up in the back.  Just kind of tacky I guess.  However - people should wear whatever they are comfortable with.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:As someone who dresses like an absolute nut job I have learned that generally speaking as long as your outfit is overall appropriate for the situation, you can get away with murder. Like I wouldn't wear a sequined micro mini or ballgown to my office job, but I would absolutely wear a velvet suit and a bunch of brooches. I have also noticed that when I wear pieces that I love, my confidence increases throughout the day. Sometimes I have moments in the day where I look down and think "dang, this outfit is cool and I feel cool!" Those moments just give me a boost of confidence all on their own. The last thing is that people are generally too busy with their own lives to notice what you're wearing. They're doing them, so do you and have fun with it!   edit-words
text:This is exactly it. One of my close friends dresses extremely colorfully and pretty much every day she is wearing something glittery, bedazzled, studded with rhinestones etc. But it matches the context she’s in well— work, dinner date, beach, hell she’s even got sparkly athletic gear when she’s on a run. She does get noticed for it, but even at her job (when she was going in person) it was just kind of known and accepted that she had a funky style and it was appreciated as part of her personality and beauty.	labels:I completely agree - context is everything. I like wearing a lot of jewelry and bold colors, but for my style choices shifts to match the context. I end up looking like a sparkly librarian for my office job. So I’ll wear shiny rose gold flats and statement jewelry with a toned down dress.	episode_done:True

text:I actually hate my Ruggable. I love the design, but it is horrible for a house with dogs that shed a lot. The only way I’ve found to get hair out of the rug is to get down and scrape it with my hands. Since using the vacuum with the brush (which would normally loosen hair) separates it from the Velcro and causes it to wrinkle, it’s impossible. Also, the edges are always rolling up.   Ok, end rant!	labels:Same experience here. We got a Lorena Canals instead and it’s much more plush and comfortable as well!	episode_done:True
text:Using Pinterest to Help Find Your Style (or: how to tell Pinterest it is no longer 2012)	labels:Thank you for the in depth breakdown! I actually use Pintrest for most of my fashion finding needs and I've been in the habit of reworking my algorithm often. As soon as I start getting recommended a bunch of things I don't like I start unfollowing boards and abusing the hide button like crazy. I also went through and organized all my boards with the new subcategory option to combine a lot of my boards together.   Another note that might help people is if you can't figure out why your still getting recommended out of date pins, go back into your boards that your feed recommends from and delete the older pins that you no longer like. I went back into all my fashion boards and went to the pins I'd pinned when I first got into Pintrest (in like 2012) that were definitely no longer my style. Once those were no longer there to draw from my feed changed pretty dramatically.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:I have an extensive jewelry wardrobe, I love it. It’s all fine - real gold, real diamonds, real gems, platinum, silver etc. I switch up jewelry daily (pre-covid when I actually went to the office and out of the house) including my wedding jewerly. I have my original diamond & platinum set, plus an eternity band in yellow gold that I wear when I’m wearing yellow gold jewelry and an emerald cut eternity band that I wear when I wear my emerald cut three stone right hand ring.   My birthstone is emerald so I have several pieces with this stone. My son’s birthstone is sapphire so I have both a blue sapphire ring and a yellow sapphire ring.   Casual jewelry is yellow gold usually - hoops in various sizes, bangles, gold chains & pendants, my Tiffany bold T ring in 18k is one of my fave pieces to wear for a minimalist look. I also like the Mejuri slim dome ring for this as well.  I do have pearls - a vintage strand that was my grandmother’s and I have matching pearl studs plus black pearl studs.   For earrings I mostly always wear hoops. I have yellow and white gold hoops in all sizes small to large and diamond hoops in mid size and large. I have one pair of 1.25 carat total studs that I never ever wear.	episode_done:True

For example, today I look like what would happen if the staff at Rick Owens got laid off and had to tone it down and work office temp jobs.

text:FAQ: What are the different use cases of boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes, and loafers?	labels:For me, the simplest distintiction would look at it in terms of the casual vs. formal.  Obvious with the name, boat shoes and driving shoes were originally designed for people who wanted stability/comfort when operating a boat or vehicle. But nowadays, boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes are all meant for casual outfits when you don't want to wear sneakers. They can be worn with tees and jeans, casual button downs, chinos etc for just a regular night out or weekend errands.  Loafers on the other hand, have a large variety (ie. penny loafers, horsebit loafers, chunky lug sole loafers that are trendy right now, unlined Belgian loafers, etc) that they can go from casual to formal. I would even argue that velvet slippers that people match with tuxedos would fall into the loafers category too. The popular look this summer had been pairing Weejun loafers with Patagonia baggies for a more casual look but the loafers on the higher-end price points (Gucci loafers, John Lobb, Baudoin and Lange, etc) can easily be paired with suits and tuxedos.
text:To add on:  The formality of a loafer is (generally) determined by a few things:  Leather: Smooth leathers in darker colors are more formal. This is opposed to leathers with a visible grain, or with a nap (suede).   Stitching: If the stitching color contrasts with the leather, it's more casual.   Outsole: Lower profile, darker midsole with a dark welt finishing is more formal. A formal loafer will also have a raised heel, a flat heel is casual.   Styles: The more plain and sleek, the more formal. Beefrolls, bits, tassels, heel pinches, and other such flourishes are *generally* less formal. However this is sometimes a point of debate, and most people won't care or notice.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:I’d agree that personal comfort is the big thing.    I’d also pay attention to the content of the compliment. “That’s a cool sweater” is NOT the same thing as “you look great in that sweater”, KWIM?   Sometimes people are appreciating the design or color or novelty of an item and not the big picture of how it works for you.
text:Yeah, speaking of novelty, I'd say 75% of compliments are basically "I noticed this". People aren't going to lie (Compliments, especially unprompted are going to be genuine), but saliency is the key feature.	labels:> I'd say 75% of compliments are basically "I noticed this".   Exactly! It’s for this reason that (in most instances) I usually prefer people not notice my clothing enough to compliment any specific item.   As an example, I can wear a bright coral sweater and receive many compliments on it — but that’s because coral washes me out so badly that the sweater is all anyone notices. Or I can wear statement earrings. They’d utterly overwhelm my face, but I’d surely get comments and compliments.   A neutral grey sweater is a much less exciting item and is less likely to attract attention or compliments on its own — but I know that grey  makes my skin and eyes/hair pop in a way that make *me* look good as opposed to the clothing.
text:This is such a great way to describe it! I reminds me of the idea of you wearing the clothes vs the clothes wearing you, with the latter in my experience being true for whenever I wear a loud or fashionable piece that maybe isn't the best suited for me but might be really nice on its own.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:I always have to alter jeans myself.  Apart from being too long most of the time they are always loose around the knees and ankles.

The head chef is the owner and he managed to keep most of his staff employed with this concept. Pretty nice and the food was as outstanding as we know it from this place.  The good part about taking everything home is that we can lick plates and scrape pans without shame. I need to work on my plating skills though.
text:That sounds so lovely :)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:Find actual boutiques in your town/nearby cities etc. Either use Google maps, try posting on reddit/facebook pages from those nearby towns or cities.  Then check if they have a website. I would expect the contact details to have their actual street address (verifiable on google maps and street view, or a drive past), contact details (call them up and ask some questions) and their refund policies etc.    Most of the actual boutiques I know of - their photos (Instagram especially) are all taken in store, in front of the store, or nearby. They typically use the staff working there or regular customers as models - you tend to see the same faces.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:This goes for any size, but I think the oversized/shapeless trend is done well with styling.  Perfectly tailored items, luxe fabrics, and generally styling yourself to look polished (hair, makeup, jewelry, whatever your thing is) really helps avoid looking or feeling sloppy.  I really enjoy loose tops, and find if they have a nice drape it helps. I'm short, so I try to offset the volume up top by wearing something slim on the bottom.	episode_done:True

text:Can You Wear a T-Shirt Under a Blazer and Not Look Like an 1980s Leftover?	labels:This look working is dependent on a couple of things. The fit of the shirt and the jacket has to be on point.

But I will be wearing the boots with a Medium Blue or Navy Suit. * I am a minimalist with two pairs of black skinny jeans. My shirts are all Navy Blue or Black. One exception is an oxford shirt with Army Green color (no patterns, I am boring). * I got two winter jackets. One is leather, chocolate color. The other is very dark navy blue, almost black.  Which color do I get? I will have to buy a matching leather belt either way.  * If I get the Burgundy, I will have to change my two skinny jeans into Gray. But will the Burgundy shoes match well with my chocolate leather jacket? The leather jacket is my only concern if I choose the Burgundy boots.   Otherwise, I am leaning towards Burgundy.	episode_done:True

text:Guidance organizing a suit for my fiancé for his father's funeral during lockdown	labels:Navy slacks without a pattern and white shirt (tie is not my area). Mismatch of fabric is critical in this case because you are not building suit, but rather classical sport coat and slack combi.
text:The suit looks dark grey to my eye, though monitor may be misleading.  If it is indeed dark grey/charcoal, I would not recommend navy pants, I'd suggest a lighter grey with no pattern that is very noticeably lighter than the jacket. Agree with the above poster that the goal here isn't to match, but to contrast in a... Controlled... way, especially since you're planning for a funeral.  White shirt, simple/plain tie in any dark color (black or grey would be traditional for a funeral, but dark blue, burgundy, or dark green would be fine as well).	labels:My monitor leads me to mid greyish.... if it's on a darker spectrum, probably black slacks could do either, although depends on the colour of a pair of shoes.
text:Yeah, my point is that navy slacks + grey jacket generally isn't a good look (although I'm sure someone somewhere can make it work). black slacks with a grey jacket would also not be my first choice, but agree it would probably work better than navy and would be easy to find in a pinch.	labels:It's not a *bad* look, it's just... kind of unusual, that's all. Because the navy blazer is such a classic, gray/navy flipped from their classic roles is... kind of like a peanut butter and honey sandwich.

If you aren’t familiar with them they’re traditional Irish knit sweaters with the intricate designs woven into them. I was hoping someone might have some more experience with them than I do, especially since it looks like I’ll have to buy online. I’m looking to buy from an actual Irish shop if possible. Would like to support small business. However, I’m in the US.   1) first, Is anyone familiar with a good place to buy them? I was looking at Aran Sweater Market and they seemed reasonably well priced at around $100 USD. I know you can go all the way up to $700 for a super fancy one but that’s not really an option for my budget. I could probably go as high $200 if it’s something I know will be worth it.   2) Any recommendations on the fit? When buying most shirts I have a problem with getting the right size with a shorter body (about 5-8) and a larger chest. I’d say for a normal shirt I’m right at about the lower end of large, can usually get away with a medium if I don’t eat a lot of salt. But with these I obviously want something a little more loose but not sure if XL would be too big.   Would really appreciate any help on this. It’s been a long year and this is my Christmas gift to me, so I want to make sure I get something nice. Thanks in advance.	episode_done:True
text:Can You Wear a T-Shirt Under a Blazer and Not Look Like an 1980s Leftover?	labels:I still maintain that a t shirt with a tailored jacket is not a good look. It's a clash of formality.

text:I also just don’t understand the inclination to “push it” when just about every guy who owns a tailored jacket also has a closet full of collared shirts.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 17, 2021	labels:Heya, I am updating my wardrobe to be a little more “clean” and  “modern” as I get a little older. Previously I have almost entirely shopped vintage/thrifted my wardrobe but it’s just gotten bloated and unfocused. That being said I don’t know a lot about clothing brands. Here’s what I’m looking for:  -Ideally US made, or at the very least ethically produced. I want to avoid exploitive fast-fashion. This was a big reason I previously only thrifted.   -Decent quality, I don’t have the money to buy super high-end but I am fine with paying a little more for something that will last.   -specifically looking for some solid color cardigans and button-ups, a sweater or hoodie or two, black chinos and black jeans, and some decent priced white tees. I found that I almost always wear black pants + white shirt + black/navy/olive/beige top. I’m pretty happy with that formula right now, just looking on ways to riff on it endlessly.   -Previously I have liked Everlane and Los Angeles Apparel, if that’s any kind of frame of reference.

text:Coveteur: An Ode to the Striped Shirt	labels:My god - try getting away from stripes when you have to wear maternity clothes!! Bloody hell!! I like a good stripe pattern on my clothing (as much as the next lady), but they pretty much forget that there are other pattern choices, when it comes time to wander around to the Maternity section.  It’s actually killed off my love of striped shirts, somewhat.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:I like a fitted piece with a looser piece. Two looser pieces look sloppy and too many fitted pieces look try hard to me. So slim trousers or skirt with a looser fitting top for example.   I like to mix stripes with patterns in similar colours and fabrics.   I wear sundresses with Sandshoes in coordinating colours all the time in summer. I am trying not to surrender to the need for little coordinated cardigans with using a nice denim jacket I’ve had for years.   In winter I love capes and wraps over either dresses or trousers. I don’t love jerseys and sweaters as the weather here changes all the time.	episode_done:True

text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I think those would look really cute! I've always admired people's glasses. I actually made a big jump last year. I always had dark rectangular glasses, because I thought I needed them to balance out my "round face". But I fell in love with tortoise glasses, they looked so soft and pretty. I bought a pair and I haven't been happier!  I do see my glasses as being part of my appearance in a more permanent way, like my hair. I think as I've gotten older, I feel less angst about what I like and how I look.	episode_done:True
text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:Growing up in a small town and then moving to a bigger one, fast fashion was a whole magical thing to me. After a few years I learned more about how terrible it is and shopped there less, but that's hard to do when you're poor. I discovered thrift shopping and have been addicted to it ever since, although I realize I'm privileged in that I'm easily able to find my size at any thrift shop. Now I'm a little less poor, but still unable to afford local fashion so I keep thrifting. I support local designers when I can by going to their sample/warehouse sales and recommending them to others.   I find the hardest part to be shopping for basics. When I need a plain black tank, I go to Target because I know exactly what I'm getting.	episode_done:True

text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:I have found people overwhelmingly wear clothes a size too small (like speaking to friends and whatnot). My sister, for example, buys the same size leggings as I do despite her hips and waist being 5-6 inches larger than mine, and then complains about them being see through. I have strong suspicions that this is the reason people find thongs horrifically uncomfortable as well.	labels:I did not wear jeans until I was 15 because every pair I owned was apparently too small.

text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:So, look, I don't want to tell you _not_ to do this, but if I've understood correctly you're looking at creating a bloodborne-inspired victorian/traditional wardrobe. There are elements of that style that have mainstream appeal today, high-waisted wool trousers being one example. However, when you take them in context with the more "interesting" elements you picked out it gives off serious cosplay vibes. Perhaps you should take the fact that the only places offering this sort of clothing are Etsy/cosplay stores as a hint that you should reconsider this idea.  You might be thinking, _what about the cyber goth vampire Rick Owens fits I see on this sub?_ It's a valid question. The key difference is that the style you're going for here has _such_ a strong association with cosplay and videogames and so little mainstream appeal that the number one association people are going to make is that you are cosplaying. Doubly-so if you're wearing cosplay-quality clothes from cosplay vendors. While the Rick Owens aesthetic may not have mainstream appeal it _is_ very accepted within fashion circles and _doesn't_ have that strong cosplay association.  So with that said my advice is to take what you've got and tone it down. Treat it like a high-fashion runway show and take inspiration from it instead of trying to recreate it 1:1. High-waisted trousers, great. Gaiters? Maybe just get some actual boots. Bloodborne-style woolen collars/scarves/hooded shawls? Wear a regular scarf that has an interesting shape or texture, or a shirt with a more exaggerated collar. Maybe the fact that you can't find retailers selling this kind of stuff is the limitation you need to make it work in the real world.  Or maybe I'm just talking complete shite and someone smarter than me can help you more. I hope that I've at least broken the ice and said what needed to be said so that people can try to constructively help you.
text:I agree with you 100%. The sleeve thing, gaiters, and video game style collar things are a recipe for disaster. Maybe the aesthetic is possible to pull off, but it would require very high quality pieces and someone who is really good at this kind of thing. It's one of those, if you need to ask for advice, there is no way you could pull it off scenarios. As terrible as it is, I'd probably chuckle if I saw someone wearing any of those accessories at a bar or something. I'm just picturing someone alone at a dive drinking some shitty (or very oddly expensive for the bar) single malt whisky alone approaching random people and trying to talk about outdated philosophers. Even just the high rise pants look seems very intimidating to me. I'm always very impressed by the people on MFA who pull it off. It seems like one of those things where if you pull it off you look incredibly fashionable, but if you fuck it up just a little you end up looking  wholly ridiculous.	labels:What is an "outdated philosopher"?	episode_done:True
text:Deceptive Marketing Practices by Fashion Companies	labels:Interesting! Other than making it hard to cancel, I legitimately had no idea this was considered deceptive marketing. I thought trapping people like that was considered perfectly okay, since otherwise surely this would be illegal or something.

text:Have you used it yet? You're investing in your future	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How many pairs of jeans and pairs of shoes should you own?	labels:I think it's interesting that you hone in on "needs" when for many people fashion fills a hybrid function of both hobby and utility. Both shoes and purses seem prone to being "collector's items" moreso than other garments (leggings, sweaters, etc.) and it makes sense to me as a fashion hobbyist and collector that people would have more than they "need" or use regularly. Also, as people age they typically gain more buying power, space to store things, and access to various occasions (business events, formal events, lifestyle changes that may necessitate a wider variety of things to fulfill a wider variety of functions).   Furthermore, I haven't found this sub's focus on "purging"/closet cleaning reflected in real life--while people do obviously consign or donate old clothing, it's pretty common for people to keep things or simply put things in storage as their use wanes. So on that note, it seems unsurprising that people have a handful of things that see constant rotation and a handful of things that are rarely used but are still enjoyed, so there is no reason to get rid of them.
text:Fwiw I know at least two men who own a ton of shoes and hats. As in 50+ pairs and a store rack worth of hats. One of them collects sneakers as a hobby while the other just likes his shoes and hats to match every outfit. I would guess it's similar for women who own a lot of purses.   I personally don't like purses at all so I only have one for when I absolutely have to (dress codes at fancy events, weddings etc). With "nice" shoes it's hard to find any that are remotely comfortable, so I see a lot of women buying various pairs of torture devices in hope of finding the perfect ones, only to end up with a ton of impractical footwear that never gets worn. I myself own 3 pairs of ballet flats that give me blisters and I haven't got rid of yet. But then if I'm invited somewhere I won't have any nice shoes and idk if I should keep the toe blisters ones or the heel blisters ones or the ones that fall off my foot every other step.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:I’m 40, so here is an old’s perspective on this. I do think that certain super-trendy looks which work on a 25-year-old can look silly on an older guy, particularly if he seems uncomfortable. But at least he’s trying! What’s far more common is older guys whose shopping habits don’t change at all between age 25 and 45, and they’re still wearing band t-shirts to most social functions and showing up to weddings in a suit they bought in 2005 when they were 30 pounds lighter. Here, age is negatively impacting their look, not because they’re trying to look too young, but because they’re stuck in the past.  From a younger guy’s perspective, when I was 25 I remember feeling frustrated that my social circle wore nothing but hoodies everywhere, and my lifestyle didn’t really afford me many opportunities to dress up. While I totally agree that dressing well doesn’t mean dressing up, I’ve always liked to dress up. And I was a little annoyed that I couldn’t wear a blazer out to a dive bar without someone making a joke about my yacht club membership. This is an area where as I got older, my lifestyle changed so that I had a lot more opportunities to wear tailoring and other more “adult” clothes, both at work and in my social life. At least until COVID. My 25-year-old self would have enjoyed wearing a lot of the stuff in my 2021 closet (maybe with some tweaks to the fit!), but he would have had nowhere to actually wear it.	episode_done:True

text:Good quality men's jeans?	labels:I've had one pair of jeans tear in the crotch in my entire adult life (it was a silly pair of Burberrys I had been gifted). I always wonder what people do that they get crotch tears so often. Rarely washing jeans also seems kind of meme-ified? They're just clothing; wash when necessary!   As someone who also favors slim-skinny jeans, chinos, etc., Rag & Bone is my absolute favorite "everyday" denim. The denim comes, or at least used to come, in different weights with a nice amount of stretch. Good range of colors as well. Fit 1 verges on being too skinny, but Fit 2 is perfect. R&B is always a bit overpriced at retail, but pretty easy to find on sale.   Saint Laurent during Slimane's tenure put out the sleekest, cleanest jeans and I love the pairs I have from that time, but I have no idea what the current offerings are like.

text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:I haven't worn jeans in over a decade, but i still do wear trousers.  When i buy them, i have to cut about 4" off the leg and hem them, so they aren't ludicrously long.  I save that fabric, and when the inner thighs get worn down i patch them from the inside.  The trousers i buy are already 2 layers on the seat and inner thigh, so once i'm down making the patch i carefully cut away the outer fabric layer that is fraying, exposing the 2nd layer with the patch all the way on the inside.    It's not perfect, but it gives me a couple years extra out of my work trousers.  The pair i have on now needs the patch installed, and i recall buying these 5 years ago.	episode_done:True

After the expensive ring experience (maybe due to me worried i'd lose the ring so much) I started really caring about quality and it really makes a world of difference and gives each piece you receive/buy for yourself a lot of meaning.	episode_done:True

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:kind of all of them? It seems like you have to pay pretty steep prices now to get the quality of clothes that mid-price mall brands had in the 1990s and early 2000s. It seems that most stores have switched to a model of selling poor quality pieces at huge markups with the expectation that they will sell most of the stock at clearance prices. The GAP used to have quality staples, and J Crew was "fancy." Now GAP is really the same quality as Old Navy, and don't know what J Crew is anymore. The quality has certainly dropped, but I also don't get what is up with the designs since you can't even get a reasonable women's suit there these days. Madewell is not made well. Anthropologie used to sell unique pieces with really good construction, now it's roughly the same as other fast fashion, though I do appreciate that they added petite and plus sizing and carry some high end brands too. Levi's main line is terrible now, and to get the heritage quality, you need to get the Made and Crafted line, which is really expensive!  I mostly shop secondhand because I can't afford the stuff I like. When buying new, I try to wait for sales and avoid buying anything "final sale" or with complicated returns unless I know it will work. Clothes that I used to get at Anthropologie, I now get from Sezane, Ulla Johnson, Doen, and Samantha Pleet. I started buying vintage jeans over Madewell/Levi's or expensive craft brands—my 1980s Chic and Gitano jeans were probably sold at K-Mart/Target but are better quality than anything I have gotten from Madewell. I don't wear jeans/denim enough to justify craft denim prices. Patagonia is still very high quality technical wear; I just scope out the Tyler sport outlet and secondhand for deals. Shoes are hard because I don't like to get them secondhand. I switched from Adidas to Veja and Diemme for sneakers (you can find Diemme shoes for huge markdowns on Yoox during the winter and summer sales—I don't think they are worth retail price).
text:I use TheRealReal for pretty much everything now! They have great prices, especially if you narrow down by size/category and brands you like. They have Rag+Bone jeans which have great longevity, they take great pics (unlike poshmark and others), and they detail the fabric in the listing so you know what you are getting.      So far, I've gotten: a missoni dress ($50), reformation midi dress ($40), J Brand light biker jacket/blazer ($40), Derek Lam work dress ($20), Rag and Bone work dress ($20).

I also found myself wanting to break my own clothes in, for authenticity, but I'm loosening a bit on that.  My favourite second hand pieces are a pair of corduroys from Orvis, a vintage The Gap shetland sweater made in Scotland from the 80's and a nicely patina'd pair of paraboot chambord shoes.

I'm so over the handwringing, guilt, and joylessness about fashion in this sub sometimes.

text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:Yeah, I shop a lot because I'm usually sad and it feels like new items will fix that somehow, or make people miraculously like me more. I'm aware that it doesn't work like that, but I love dressing up as a "new me" every day and I easily get bored... but that's just mental issues :/  With autism and me identifying as queer and all, I'm not exactly popular and there isn't one version of me I'd consider the real me, which makes it even more difficult. "The real me" fluctuates day by day, and so do my outfit preferences. I often buy things impulsively that I WILL love for quite some time, but never on two subsequent days, for example. I've been mocked for this, but I've still found I'm happiest like this, with my crazy big wardrobe and tons of different styles.

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:This comes up here a lot, but many of the outdoors brands have turned into mostly fashion brands, and the quality has dropped as a result. The North Face, with the exception of a few of their collections (e.g. Summit); Columbia, and Mountain Hardware which they bought; and Marmot are some of the more famous examples.  Patagonia, Arc'teryx, Outdoor Reaearch, Fjallraven, and Kuhl are currently good alternatives, but I like to check the ultralight / camping subreddits for the most up to date info.	episode_done:True

But you shouldn't have to sacrifice looking fashionable over comfort! They can go together hand in hand! My style is generally long and flowing Korean-style fashion paired with open-toed sandals or other flat shoes and not only do I feel and look good in it, I also feel breezy! I think the tip here is to choose clothes that are not only cute but should go well with your body and ones you feel you can be active and move around with without any fuss! :D Also look for clothes made in natural breathable fabrics like cotton, linen or silk are always great because they breathe well and allow sweat to evaporate more easily unlike synthetic fabrics like nylon and polyester.	episode_done:True
text:Winx style, a nostalgia trip	labels:I loved that video. My partner has never seen anything Winx in his life but after seeing a picture of Flora we both realised that they could have literally just recreated an even more pastel/2000s version of Moon's look from Cobra Kai on a Hispanic actress. It’s baffling how wrong the remake is.	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:My partner shops in the men's section and hasn't had any issues, to my knowledge.   Brands that have worked include Lucky brand (especially for jeans), Banana Republic (boxer briefs and button-downs), and I think American Eagle (t-shirts, maybe shorts I think). I'll try to think of others.   They've also had a lot of luck at a certain local thrift store that carries a lot of menswear, which admittedly can be tricky to find and is especially challenging during a pandemic. That's a great way to find out what brands and styles work best for your body though: try out a ton of different ones.   Consider if there are any ways to access hand-me-downs from friends for this, too - my friends had a lot of clothing swaps in the before times and lots of my queer friends wear or used to wear men's clothes. If not your friends, there may be groups in your area that share or trade clothes. And on that note, regardless of your own identity, you might find some other ideas online by looking at queer fashion resources online.   Regarding the brands I've mentioned above, my partner's physique is relatively long and lean, so take this advice with a grain of salt if you are plus sized and/or generally have curvier proportions. For example, I'm close in size to them or possibly even a bit smaller right now, but I am smaller on top than on the bottom. That's pretty inconvenient for men's clothes, so I would probably need to shop a bit differently. There are definitely plus-sized and curvy queer bloggers out there who look awesome in menswear wardrobes, so hopefully you can find some inspiration about how to make menswear work for your shape.   Finally... If you have the funds, there are definitely custom options available. My partner got a custom suit for our wedding, including some tailored shirts. You can also get off the rack clothes tweaked by a tailor, which is probably something I would want to do.	episode_done:True

text:Just how revolutionary is Harry Styles’ Vogue cover?	labels:The article hit all the points I was thinking except one. Why Harry? Why do we all look at Harry Styles when talking about revolutionary men's fashion when there are so many others who've done it before and are doing it right now. Just a thought.
text:My theory on why Harry is this: playing with gender in fashion isn't new as you pointed out, eternal icons like Grace Jones have been there and done that. However, Harry's instance is unique because we have seen in a highly publicized way the evolution of how he sees his gender. He started as a (sorry fans) generic white musician with bland style and has since sort of aggressively redone his look. I'm sure he's been called "brave" in numerous articles documenting his steps towards this moment. Similar pretty boys like Ansel Elgort and even people like Post Malone have played with gender, but none in an as aggressively pursued and marketed way as Harry did. I also think people see that he has an X-factor because of his sexual identity. Billy Porter being a publicly queer person is sort of expected to do these things. Yeah his gown moment was highly publicized but it certainly didn't "break the internet" and spawn discussion like this did.  edit: also exactly what u/Anthraxistaken said	labels:I was thinking that too about how it was all because we've seen his growth and I couldn't have summed it up better.	episode_done:True

text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:My boyfriend tells me not to do this, his words are "fuck them. They don't matter. Dress how you want to" The one thing I'm massively insecure about is over dressing. I've been singled out for this a lot and it's frusting. I just want to look good. I'm not wearing inappropriate for the situation clothes either. It's more like I'm the only one in heels to dinner because I like them. And dinner like a nice place with drinks after not an ihop to a pool hall. The most picked at are a couple form fitting casual tshirt dresses I have. I love them them with some boots in the fall. But my casual clothes are not casual enough for everyone else? and they have to make comments about it. I get so anxious about it now I just sit naked on the floor for like 30 minutes staring at the few clothes I have left while my boyfriend checks in on me to see how my progress is going so we can leave finally.   But when it's just me and him going somewhere there's no problem at all. I'll wear anything confidently and feel great about it. But make me go to some kind of party or events where I know people and I just freak out and cry.   I want to look awesome. My boyfriend wants me to look awesome. Why are we trying to tone down our awesome because of how people want to be buttholes and judge us? For looking good. How are you going to let someone shame you for something you aren't ashamed of? Doesn't mean much comming from a girl who panics about going to dinner with friends but I try to remind myself of this all the time. I shouldn't have to dress down because it makes other people feel uncomfortable.
text:This sounds crazyyyy! Not you, but people who comment negatively on you looking nice!? Now that you mentioned it, I remember that someone in my social circle does this. “That’s a really fancy dress. Are you going anywhere else after here?” Or “That’s awfully nice looking for just a game night”. I usually respond to her with “Yeah, I like dressing up”. Having a thick skin helps.	labels:It's wild because I have a pretty thick skin, like I've tackled felons and taken them to jail all while they trash talk me trying to get me riled up. But something about being criticized for looking good really messes me up.   I've had a lot of really negative experiences with it. I don't see any of those people anymore but I've heard women talk about other women so much I know I'm being talked about too. And I'm basically friendless now so I've been actively trying to get new friends. I feel like I can't look too good or I'll just be judged as a snobby attention seeking homewrecker and no one will want to be friends with me. And I body build so I've got a less common shape that gets talked about too. I love my body and I'm so proud of it but I don't feel comfortable around people. Everyone just looks at me. I've had people move tables entirely when I've sat down. I end up going alone to a lot of conferences and events and that's a hard blow when I'm just trying to be friendly and I can't fit in.	episode_done:True

text:I wish bolo ties would come back into fashion. I'm in the northeast but spent some time living in the southwest as a student in the early 90s so I bought a couple of them then. Plus I used to make beadwork jewelry and accessories before my arthritis got so sucky and I made several bolo ties of my own beading around gemstone cabachons.   I wish button covers would make a comeback as well since I have a button cover set made by a Navajo jewelry artist that are sterling silver with designs etched on them.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:It’s 2021. A vaccine for the virus has been made widely available and businesses may operate at full capacity, including bars, clubs, salons, etc. How will this influence fashion?	labels:People will go ALL OUT. This sub usually salivates at the thought of athleisure taking over and killing fashion (and fast fashion) but that 100% wouldn't happen. Almost every woman I know is bloody sick and tired of not getting to dress up, not being able to wear lipstick, not having places to wear heels and vacation outfits. People would literally go crazy and it truly would be the roaring twenties. Dresses of all types, miniskirts, sparkle and glitter, heels for days, fun fabrics, bolder colors, leather pants, blouses with impractical sleeves, statement earrings – women would really be dressing to the nines *and* wearing bold lipstick colors to compliment.
text:I totally agree.  I work a fashion company and last week, our website sold 12 units of our new $600 sequin blazer that just dropped. I was really surprised!

text:Agreed. I’m 31 and I LOVE some of the current trends out there. I just style it a bit differently to fit the needs of my job/life and comfort level.

I also bought a few clothing items that is taking forever to ship though. I might cancel some of them and wait out the rest. I mean, 30ish bucks for dresses/jumpsuits and 40s for cashmere is a pretty good deal, and it's not like Everlane's style is gonna change much. They sell the same shit year in and year out.

text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:A huge chunk of my wardrobe is built out from Amazon. I add everything to a list, and wait until Amazon's algorithms decide they need to sell it for $6. They also offer Tall sizes on quite a lot of items, which is great for having sleeves that fit.  Uniqlo for jeans, Amazon's Peak Velocity brand for Tshirts, and Goodthreads for everything else is what I would do if I had to start from Scratch.  If there's a certain type of item your looking for, feel free to ask for recommendations and I can send you a link to what I'd look at.
text:Thanks for sharing!   Items I'm looking for:  \- White sneakers - preferably leather   \- Jeans - Slim/skinny light blue, navy, black   \- Jackets - from bomber jackets to other non-bomber kinds  \- Sweaters or sweatshirts I can layer under my jacket  \- Long sleeve shirts/henleys  \- boots   If you've come across any of these on amazon that you think may be decent purchase I'd love to check it out	labels:White Sneakers - Stan Smiths. Watch FrugalMaleFashion, got mine for $40  Jeans- Uniqlo is the best bang for the buck imo. Their selvedge lines are much more durable than Levis to me  Jackets - Check out Goodthreads. I got a french terry hoodie & bomber that i'm pretty impressed with for under $20 each  Henleys: Check out the Peak Velocity athletic henley.  Boots - I don't think you're going to find anything too great below $100. You can grab some Golden Fox boots, but i'd rather save up the extra $75 and get Iron Rangers seconds from Sierra Trading Post or elsewhere.  &#x200B;  I'd recommend poking around some sites like Dappered, or Primer.

text:Let's Talk about hats	labels:There is hat etiquette from the days of yore. Here are some of the conventions that were adhered to:  A lady does not remove her hat when indoors or for the national anthem. This is in contrast to men, who are to remove hats when indoors and for the anthem. However, if you‘re sporting a baseball cap at a ballgame, I would remove it for the anthem, whereas if you were wearing a more formal outfit with hat then I would not remove it.  A hat is a daytime piece in most cases not suitable for evening wear. The fascinator is an exception to this rule, but is more of a Commonwealth/British thing.  A lady does not wear a hat in her own home, ie when receiving guests, and as a guest in a friend’s home a lady would remove her hat.
text:Cool. That answers a question I had but never thought to look up.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:It's really dependant upon where you are. In South Florida, business casual is golf slacks and a polo, or a wrap dress with sandals (and this isn't the entirety of business casual in South Florida, I'm just pointing out things that would not generally be seen as such elsewhere.)   The best bet is to go online, find this group's Facebook or Instagram accounts and look at what people are wearing at their events. I doubt very much that anyone is going to bat an eyelash at you wearing a skirt, and I'm sure that your work clothing is absolutely appropriate for whatever events you're attending.

No glitter, no metallic thread. I like it on other people, but on me it makes me feel like I’m wearing a costume. Sequins and paillettes only on formal evening wear (for me).  No dolman sleeves (for me). I don’t like how they look on my busty inverted triangle shape.
text:As a card-carrying member of the itty bitty titty committee and the owner of slightly too-wide shoulders, I love dolmans and find a dolman shirt with a nipped-in waistband incredibly flattering and comfortable, but I know I'm in the minority.

When she passed I was able to go into her closet and take what I wanted before her kids donated everything to Goodwill, so I have all these gorgeous coats and blouses of hers...that I have no idea what to do with. I need to alter pretty much everything if I’m going to wear it but I am terrified of ruining anything of hers...so currently it’s all just hanging in my closet making me miss her whenever I see it, which is probably the worst of both worlds.

text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:I'm from Japan and a male in those age categories, would likely dress quite differently.  Japan is a land of 'Uniforms'. many spend much of their grade school to high school in a uniform.  when they go out and get a job.. they gotta wear a 'uniform'.. either a suit and tie, or some company uniform.  College is usually the time for experimentation, but because people have such a strong hard-on for fads and trends, they end up being in a uniform again.  maybe in 2017-18 ish. the trend for college age men was a wool chester coat and a hoodie underneath (a mix of very casual and slightly formal).  fast forward 2-3 years later, it nearly completely fell out in favor of oversized fleece jackets, or North Face Nuptse and other similar puffers.. usually in black and yellow.  guys 30s to 40s stop dressing like that  guys 40s and up tend to focus more on brands to flex their income and status, but often wear ill fitting stuff.. as well as strange color stuff (likely went to a Ralph Lauren outlet and could only afford that bright yellow shirt that was on sale because no one would buy it)  People often judge you by what you wear as they think it reflects your occupation or status. For example some one wearing shiny black with a lot of accessories is perceived to be involved in the night industries and probably of lower education or culture.
text:Thanks for your reply. I see what you mean. Here in the UK people in Primary/Secondary school wear Uniforms, and most workplaces, but in College and University they wear anything, back in college and University a few years ago people usually wore jeans and hoodies etc. Sometimes I feel people wear things to reflect the event they are at (e.g. college or a party) instead of how old they are.  And I notice a lot of celebs wear things to make they Unique, and really stand out. Like a bright white hoodie and white trousers. I guess it's probably whilst they perform and they change afterwards? But its interesting as people within their age group wouldn't always wear the style they do.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:Something I haven't seen mentioned here is clothing swaps. My friends and I are in the habit of having them at least a few times a year, and everyone walks out happy. If your friends don't do this, offer to host! We even had a Halloween costume version where we all traded outfits we no longer wanted.   Today I found success on Etsy. I was looking for tops that were ethically made, vegan, not culturally appropriative, affordable, and from a Black-owned business. I found lots of incredibly expensive brands on Google, but on Etsy I found smaller artists. So no slavery concerns (most likely), and it meets all my requirements. It only scratches the surface, but it's a place to start. It's about being intentional within the constraints.  I'm fortunate to be able to afford more expensive pieces, but wow is it hard to even know where to go. I don't shop a lot, so I really struggle with vintage and second-hand stores that only show clothing on mannequins. Before the pandemic, I never shopped online, but I also hated shopping in person because I struggled to find stores that had things I liked. It's so much easier to go into Urban or H&M or Loft. And we think of places like H&M and Forever 21 as the pinnacles of fast fashion, but I assume the worst of basically any major brand. Victoria's Secret, Gap, even luxury brands like Gucci or Prada, I assume they cut as many corners as possible.   Trying to find clothes within all my constraints helped me discover some amazing pieces that I am so excited to buy. They're incredible statement pieces that I never would have found without being more intentional in my purchases.	episode_done:True

The name certainly brings to mind someone who lets the clothes wear him rather than the inverse, but a combination of clear personal preferences and a practiced aesthetic sensibility are ingredients that elevate an eccentric over a try-hard.

text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:I think it's pretty outdated, but I don't see anything wrong with her saying she dresses for men, if that's in fact what she was doing. There are bits in here that aren't that different than what I hear people say/read on a regular basis:  > I don’t think I could dress like the illustrations in the high – fashion magazines. For that you require what is thought as a Vogueish figure , and is, I believe, a boyish type figure and I don’t have a boyish figure.   Pretty similar to the idea that women with straighter figures can wear clothing or particular shapes that aren't traditionally feminine, but curvier women need to wear clothing that shows their curves or end up looking fat.  > You have to be friends with your clothes if you’re going to dress for men – no too tight zippers or unnecessary doodads to make you uncomfortable! Sometimes their acceptance is just in their response, but the response tells me I am right.   I've heard this often enough: (straight) men don't appreciate complicated clothing, they don't like clothing that isn't "flattering" but might be aesthetically interesting.   I think a lot of the article's pretty silly from a modern perspective and has some eye-roll inducing lines about women not liking her clothing. However, it's not like (some) women don't dress for men at all any more. I don't think her opinions are that unusual, she's just putting them in a way that doesn't sound right for modern readers, especially because hardly anyone actually *says* they dress for men, even when they do. I don't care to dress the way MM did, and I don't share her opinions, but I also think she's conscious of playing a role here.
text:It’s fascinating that there was and still is a binary of “dressing for men” and “dressing for yourself [and other women]”. Which is a heteronormative and exclusionary way to put it, but I’m having trouble articulating everything. Both sides feel like they’re rebelling against the other, when for the most part people tend to participate in both. Both being, dressing for oneself and an audience that appreciates style without finding it sexually appealing and then the other side of dressing in part to be found sexually appealing by the group that you wish to attract. I agree that a lot of similar feelings towards what is considered “flattering” come up a lot here and it’s uncomfortable to try to get to the root of why that is.  I think a lot of her language doesn’t sit right with us because it’s assumed that every woman wishes to attract a man	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "A Primer on Materials"	labels:I think the guide goes into just enough depth to present the main pros and cons of various fabrics well without being overwhelmingly technical, but as it's currently organized they're all throughout the guide.

They can look good, but the colors and fit need to be... just perfect, and the effect is still visibly casual. They're a street sneaker, so you need... You need a certain overall vibe to make it work.  If I were you...

text:Unique brands/boutiques in your city?	labels:Some nice places around Europe:  * Switzerland:    * Geneva: on weekends, there's a flea market around the park near Patek Philippe Museum. I loved it especially for vintage fashion magazines and books but also clothes and jewelries.    * Lausanne, Boutique Etat d’Ame: kind of elegant garments with a twist. I love especially their shoes, they have elevated designs of classic types of shoes.    * Lausanne, MANIAK Boutique: this is a really fun and weird boutique where you'll find: some second-hand items, leather jackets and corsets, costume stuff, urban brands like Dickies and Carhartt, vintage dresses, etc. It's a really fun, quirky mess of everything. Every time I went there I bought something, it's one of my favorite shops ever.    *  Zürich: There's a nice flea market in Stadthausanlage on weekends.    *  Zürich, Fizzen: part second-hand, part regular shop, it has some nice designs similar to MANIAK in Lausanne. Also in Zürich, Barbar Vintage usually has a large selection of SH jeans and on Bleicherweg there are some more high-end vintage stores near the offices of consulting companies (what a coincidence). * France, Annecy: there is (was? maybe temporarily cancelled because of Covid-19) a quite large monthly flea market on the last Saturday of every month. I went there once especially for this and it was amazing. * Romania, Bucharest: some local boutiques are Ioana Ciolacu (designer items), Ana Urbana (shoes), Gazzelle (shoes and bags), Diana Cojocaru (unique porcelain jewelry, doesn't have a regular store but regularly hosts exhibitions around Bucharest, worth checking her Instagram account), IONA (lovely gold jewelry), Malvensky (also nice gold jewelry), Iutta (handbags and shoes with traditional motives).

Add rock climbers and mountaineers and gymnasts and you've probably got about the functionally fittest group of people and they're rarely "jacked".

text:Crazy theory here - but has anyone noticed that sometimes stores say the item is now sold out? I’ve done this a few times only to come back and the item is gone. But when I sign out it magically is there. I feel like there are a few retailers that use this as a tactic to not “wait too long.”	labels:The "almost gone! Only two left but three people have it in their cart! Sale ends in 01:03:29" types of messages are in fact just marketing. They're designed to create a sense of urgency and fear of missing out, which then triggers the impulse to buy without further evaluation.   Remember how you used to see furniture stores with "going out of business" sales that never seemed to actually go out of business? It's the same thing: people think they have a limited time to take advantage of a "deal" that might never return and are more likely to buy. That particular problem was so pervasive that U.S. law changed to ban that as a bait and switch/false advertising scam.  There are tons of ways that businesses use psychology to entice consumers.

text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:What made a HUGE difference for me was slowly starting to separate what I thought was cute and trendy, and what was actually realistic for me. Like a lot of others I started with lots of pinterest browsing. I made two separate boards, one for a "capsule" wardrobe and one for a "wow thats cute". The capsule is in a color pallet that I like and fits my lifestyle (darks,neutrals, a few colors that look good on me and I'm comfortable wearing), where as the other cute board is just things I enjoy on others. There's TONS of styles out there that I adore, and might one day adopt parts of, but just because I aesthetically love and appreciate it doesn't mean it'll work for me and my lifestyle. For example, I love the super feminine, flowy light vibe. Its beautiful, looks amazing on other people, but on me it feels out of place and isn't a very good fit for me specifically. This goes on the cute board! I know I love it and can identify that now, while still realizing that its just not for me right now.   Visually splitting up /why/ I liked a look or outfit really helped me better understand what I was looking for in my own wardrobe. Maybe that could be a good starting place for you too!	episode_done:True

It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.

text:Guidance organizing a suit for my fiancé for his father's funeral during lockdown	labels:I'm going to be real, he needs a new suit jacket if he can afford it. A 10 year old budget suit from high school is the opposite of high quality.  Do you live near a Suit Supply? They are a Dutch company so will probably have high quality clothes that fit him. I'd suggest getting an entire outfit from there. They have EXCELLENT customer service and will handhold him through the process in as pain free a way as possible.
text:The problem is that we are in full lockdown (and will be at least through January). Also I want him to get a good-quality and well-fitting suit for our wedding. If he gets a suit now (however rushed that would have to be), he would insist on wearing that to the wedding – I agree with him that it makes no sense to own two suits with our lifestyle.  We are in Europe/	labels:Where in Europe are you? I'm in the UK and have recently found an online retailer that caters only for very tall and lanky (or slim as I'd like to refer to my build). They have clothes for guys starting at 6`3 and go upwards to 7'  I can pm you their name/link if you'd like  Edit: they do international European deliveries for very reasonable prices I've just seen

text:Where do you get good quality, legit wool sweaters that won't rip/shrink after washing?	labels:Here in NZ we have fine spun Merino wool jerseys (as we call them) that can be machine washed without shrinking. Reason being that the wool is pre- shrunk at the plant before they knit them up.  I went on a tour of a plant some years ago and it was super interesting.   anyway having said that i always hand wash my wool jerseys.   The thing that shrinks them in the machine, or if washed wrong is not the hot water but the agitation . This stretches the fibres out and then they bounce back even tighter, if that makes sense.   So even when hand washing you don't want to agitate or rough them up much, just soak, then squeeze gently.  No spin drying natch.    i did find a merino fine wool jumper on ASOS a while ago, it was mens but a pretty coral pink.	episode_done:True

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I WFH permanently now, but when I worked in an office I wasn't able to escape dry-clean-only clothing; there are some things that just need to be dry cleaned. However, I used Dryel to great effect (awesome for things that aren't stained or stinky and don't really need to be pressed). I will also say, many many clothing items that say "dry clean only" can be washed either by hand, or in the machine on a delicate setting with wool wash or other gentle low-suds detergent. (My dry cleaner, of all people, actually advised me to start washing my cashmere sweaters rather than bringing them in for cleaning - she said dry cleaning dries out and breaks down the fibers and washing them at home would help them last longer. I am still wearing my cashmere sweaters and so far, she's been correct.) If something is very structured or has an acetate lining I never try to wash it, but I have washed other things that were poly blends or wool blends and were marked "dry clean only," and as long as you hang them up to dry, it works fine.

text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:Linen, silk, hemp, organic cotton, wool, cashmere. Natural is always better, generally speaking (excluding rayon/bamboo which is a natural derived synthetic, but including tencell which is eucalyptus.) And construction matters too, as does fabric weave. It’s so hard to judge quality online! I usually judge by touch and fabric hand and stitching quality. I have a degree in fashion design though so touch is the easiest way for me to identify a fabric! Personally I avoid nylon or polyester and consider it cheap. It is rarely high quality unless it is a high performance weave or treated, and even then it gets stinky easily. I only wear it for technical outdoor gear, like for hiking or swimming, for everyday wear, natural is always worth paying more!	episode_done:True

text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:I think you have to have one element that “fits.”  Like of you have the oversized thing, pick one thing that fits a little slimmer (e.g a straight pant over a wide pant).   Or make sure the shoulder fits for that oversized top - vs a drop shoulder - if the whole outfit is looser.   I also think you can be intentional about revealing a little bit of well chosen skin. Wrists, ankles, calves, collarbone. So you are not just overwhelmed by fabric.   And of course you can always just wear what you want and not worry about it.	episode_done:True

There is definitely stuff I avoid, but honestly, reflecting on it right now, that might be more my personal style at play than my age. I avoid anything too tight or clubby, and I  tend to go for block heels or pumps over stilettos or platforms. There was a whole going-out-top-nice-jeans trend in the 2000s that makes me avoid anything satin- or lace-based. But I think that Vans/Converse or crop tops/high-waisted jeans are definitely still in play if you're 30. And if that changes soon, I'd guess it's because the trends change rather than what is appropriate age-wise!

As others have mentioned glasses are pretty cheap nowadays so getting spare shades is the way to go. At the moment my back up pair is transition. Oh and no one will ever notice or care that your glasses are transition, and people don’t actually have an opinion on them. Also— when you’re inside they’re completely clear like regular glasses.
text:No for sure, you are right it definetly is wroth it I think  It's just for me, it came down to look, if I get transition I had to go 1 size up, so I could have sunglass look, but when it turns white it would look kinda big on me indoors and I didn't want that as I am more indoor than outdoor  If I got my size, then transitions as sunglasses would look small on me outdoor, and would give me this Matrix Morpheus look, plus taking photos - not always do I want shades, I want my eyes to speak  &#x200B;  but yeah if you have big frames already, and mostly plastic, transition would work, but I decided I will either make my old glasses as tinted sunglasses or buy new aviator sunglasses from cheaper online place (just gotta figure out which one is good, I did buy from Firmoo before) - idk what else is good  &#x200B;  but for you - I suggest lookign up at different transition models - there is one xtractive or something that gives more tint when behind the wheel - they got many models for different needs, times and so on	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I’m 27. My style changed a lot when I was around your age, lots of fast fashion and forever 21 type stuff. Went from a hot topic emo in the mid 2000s to an “indie” girl in high school. I was always overdressed at school which I enjoyed because I like to stand out.   Early college I had a little vintage pinup phase and would wear a full face of makeup with super coiffed curled hair. Later in college my style really started to solidify and has been the same since around 2015.   I like le cole des femme clothes a lot too!! I’d say my style now is a little bit school girl/uniform inspired, and the really typical “french girl” jane birkin type stuff. I don’t buy fast fashion anymore and I’m finally in a place where I can get investment pieces and shop small. My typical outfit is maybe a pair of levi’s with some sort of thrifted blouse and mary jane heels, or a tennis skirt with tights and a sweater and loafers. I wear very light makeup now since my skin has cleared up in adulthood, even after wearing black cat eye liner for probably 15 years straight. It’s nice to look back and see how my style has stabilized and matured.

text:90s/00s Bollywood Fashion	labels:This is so awesome lol. Fantastic job.  The time period covered in this album is also a near-exact overlap with the liberalization (along broadly "American" capitalist lines) of India's domestic markets, as well as the West's own hamfisted attempts, after the fall of the Berlin Wall as well as the USSR, at a kind of liberal multiculturalism (of the "United Colors of Benetton" variety).

There are a lot of reasons people don't dress up on a daily basis anymore, including:  * women aren't relegated to being homemakers anymore * a woman's value is no longer solely attributed to her appearance * people's lives are a lot more complicated and multifaceted than they were before * people move around a lot more than they did before * people face greater economic pressures that before * lifestyles and social values, in general, have changed  While there will always be social/cultural expectations that dictate what is appropriate to wear in a given situation, it is generally a good thing that we now have more freedom of choice in what to wear on a daily basis.
text:Yeah definitely society’s views have shifted in the past  7 years or so. What strikes me was the comments responding to the article more so than the article itself. I’ve only looked at this subreddit for the past year or so but the attitude seemed so different, where for before they downright agreed. Now people mainly keep to themselves and try not to cast judgements on what people wear. Which I certainly feel is much more freeing. Thanks for the response.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:Very similar to you, fashion was an escape for me. Teenage angst and insecurity, and a smaller town, fashion was so unlike anything in my day-to-day. And there were so many ways to escape and so many facets of the industry to jump into! It was exciting to be passionate about something that always changed. About being able to put on a flappers inspired dress on Monday and go punk on Tuesday.  Teen Vogue’s website used to post weekly snippets about fashionable teens, which is how I found most fashion bloggers in the aughts/early tens. Sea of Shoes, Rumi Neely, there was a girl in SF who was one of the first to start shredding her t-shirts (Children of something???), etc. They then led to other online communities, like The Fashion Spot, the ONTD offshoot, tumblr in its heyday. So many different people who dressed in so many different ways, but all loved what they wore and showed it!	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Fashion AITA	labels:I am fairly well-known in my community for my unique fashion sense, ropes of pearls, zebra-striped roadster, and two-tone hair. A woman I knew from my school days has a lot of spotted dogs. When I commented that they would make a beautiful coat, she became offended! AITA?   Edit to add: My husband is a furrier, if that helps your decision.  Edit again to add: I may also be a lot older than the woman with the spotted dogs and have a red and black roadster and no husband, depending.
text:Maybe controversial, but ESH. Obvy she's crazy to be triggered by such a flattering comment, but the fact that you'd wear spots when your whole look is based on colour blocks is really just bad taste IMO.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 29, 2020	labels:Just finished Legend of Korra and it was really good. The first season was good, the second was meh, but seasons 3 and 4 were fantastic. I went into it super skeptical but I think it was a worthy successor to Avatar, although I don't think anything can top that show (it was the only TV series I followed as a kid and I've rewatched it a ton since).
text:I liked it and I think the art style and music match the pace well, however, my only two problems were:  * not nearly as relaxing and soothing as Avatar. Avatar has really nice nature connections that are kinda lost in the city setting The filler episodes in Avatar are relaxing and nice looks into either the nature of bending/human-nature relationships or the friendships/personalities of the characters.   * Korra never learns anything. Aang learned how to solve problems without using his powers and Korra just hits stuff until it’s fixed. Aang had to grapple with his moral code constantly. Korra just gets the major issue of the end of the first season solved for her with out doing anything. It seemed like an interesting dilemma for her character and she gets out of it with out changing at all or even a hint of self reflection. Plus her villains are all way more interesting and actually have some nuance and personality.	labels:Yeah, I do think that they really missed out on developing most of the characters. Very few of them had an arc similar to Zuko, Sokka, or Katara. They went with more characters with less development, which is just a different approach IMO. I do think she really doesn't show much growth in S1 and S2, which is one of my main complaints. She consistently loses in fights and never really seems to change anything. I also could have used like 100X more meetings with Aang, I think Aang had more time with Roku than Korra had with Aang.	episode_done:True
text:Fashion trends	labels:Platform heels, low rise jeans, I will never give up my skinny jeans ever, Uggs, sandals that aren’t Birkenstock’s or Chaco’s, shirts that aren’t cropped or 4 sizes too big, and summer tops that can be worn with a regular bra, those are surprisingly hard to come by these days, apparently fashion companies think people don’t have boobs anymore.

I think of a dated formula that lacks originality. When I see someone rock different types of colors, I think, wow, that person *knows* how to style themselves.   Black goes with everything except very dark brown and very dark navy. Wear a black purse with red shoes. Easy. Simple.	episode_done:True
text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:Easiest way to sort out the crap - filter by fabric.   I always filter to only look at clothes with cotton/linen/silk/leather/wool. Sometimes low-quality blends pop up (Forever 21 makes clothes with like 2% cotton, which to me is just a waste), but in general you get better quality, more unique pieces.	episode_done:True

text:WEEKLY DEALZ	labels:I am still reeling from the Nordstrom rack sales on Everlane items. They are so good. The sneakers are really good quality for 19 bucks, and I do see sizes come back, if you check daily. I bought a pair for myself and a pair for my friend.  I also bought a few clothing items that is taking forever to ship though. I might cancel some of them and wait out the rest. I mean, 30ish bucks for dresses/jumpsuits and 40s for cashmere is a pretty good deal, and it's not like Everlane's style is gonna change much. They sell the same shit year in and year out.
text:is it main line stuff or items created specifically for Nordstrom rack?	labels:It's main line stuff. My guess is they are dumping stock due to covid. If you look at their sale section, some of it is the exact same stuff as what's currently at NR, only more expensive. I'm actually a little pissed because I bought the Day Heel Mule when it first came out, which was just after covid hit, and I haven't worn them since. Now they're $40 (!!!) and Nordstrom Rack.  That said, I've come to hate Everlane after hearing the horror stories from @ex.wives.club on IG. Kind of pulled back the Oz curtain a bit for me, tbh. If you look at any of their marketing, they're just so up their own ass, which just isn't going to fly anymore in a post-covid world, imo.	episode_done:True

text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:I love this thread! I was homeschooled by religious, conservative parents for much of my childhood. For a brief period of time, I was only allowed to wear modest dresses, and the rest of the time, I dressed like a stereotypical homeschooler, because we were poor and I wasn’t allowed to wear much.   By the time I was in middle school and earning my own money babysitting, I started to dabble in thrifting. By the end of high school, when I went to public school and eventually had a full time job shortly after graduation, I really got into it. I spent so long learning to be okay with looking different from the status quo that I eventually really learned to embrace it. I’m thirty now, and I love standing out and wearing things that other people say they could never pull off. I also have a body that the fashion industry loves, so that part was easier for me to feel like “I fit in here” (to its discredit- I fully believe it should be inclusive and celebratory of every body).   Really, it’s been a place of refuse where I can feel belonging while still embracing my “weird kid” roots.	episode_done:True

text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I was gonna say now, but I actually I had a pretty good idea of what I liked around 16.  I was low key obsessed with J-fashion, specifically Gothic Lolita, most my friends were all emo/alt, as was I, and I was reading a lot of Vogue, so I had good trend awareness, and balancing all those things to make outfits that worked was a lot of fun.  I had two distinct phases after that.  The first was that kind of aggressively flattering/appropriate style that a lot of people develop in their early twenties, which was a compliment magnet, and was also a lot of fun.  After that I had a phase that wasn't really so much a style as it was having a retail job and no strong preferences.  I wore some fun items, but there wasn't much cohesion, and it eventually made getting dressed feel like a chore.  I got tired of that in 2019, did the big chop, started my closet overhaul, and pretty much got down to writing myself a rule book, since I knew what I liked and wouldn't get sick of wearing. (Also, I tend to forget anything not written down.)  Turns out, most of that was based on what I liked in high school, and the handful of things that stuck since then adapted to my life now.  I genuinely like black, and am fine with only a handful of other colours I can wear head to toe.  I like a simple, compliment magnet of a shoe.  I enjoy a fun print or a ridiculous statement item- just in a limited colour palette.  I had my exploratory phase and didn't particularly care for it, so outside of life changes or new fashion loves, I don't see any drastic changes in my future.	episode_done:True

text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:As someone who dresses like an absolute nut job I have learned that generally speaking as long as your outfit is overall appropriate for the situation, you can get away with murder. Like I wouldn't wear a sequined micro mini or ballgown to my office job, but I would absolutely wear a velvet suit and a bunch of brooches. I have also noticed that when I wear pieces that I love, my confidence increases throughout the day. Sometimes I have moments in the day where I look down and think "dang, this outfit is cool and I feel cool!" Those moments just give me a boost of confidence all on their own. The last thing is that people are generally too busy with their own lives to notice what you're wearing. They're doing them, so do you and have fun with it!   edit-words

For example, if  Person A wanted to be perceived as confident, they would ask themselves if the article of clothing or whatever fit inside the "confident" bubble.  I found that idea to be useful. So the first step is choosing your keywords, and then considering them when you shop or dress yourself.

text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:Personally I’m still somewhat new too this but I’ve had many different fashion phases and have done many different looks throughout my three years of personal fashion experimentation. I feel the biggest thing that’s helped me is sticking to a sort of color scheme.    It’s definitely not for everyone necessarily but it’s helped a lot as I have grown my wardrobe, slowly adding more colors. It makes things very easy to match. I started with three colors ( I know that’s extremely little however) now I’m up to six!  I feel accessories ( not just jewelry necessarily but belts, hats , bags etc. ) are also very important to obtaining a certain look.   I feel organizing ones closet can also really help. There’s no specific way I’d necessarily recommend I organize mine by grouping items article then group them by color , as I mentioned color and matching things is very important to my personal style so that’s what makes sense for me.   Hope this could help some! I’m new at this too as I mentioned lol!

text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:Everything eventually comes back in fashion.  Personally I would love for 2000s jeans to come back - not super low rise or the ones that were bedazzled or laced up but just normal rise bootcut and flare jeans. I have a few from that era that I still wear all the time and a couple more that I had to replace with similar ones from poshmark because I couldn't find them in shops.  I also miss 2000s makeup. Sure, there was too much body glitter and candy colors but there was also the fresh dewy look of blush and a light lip gloss - think Britney Spears in her Oops I Did It Again video, or Mandy Moore's makeup in her video for Candy. Not everything in the 2000s was horrible lol.

text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:This isn’t a direct answer to your question, but I’ve found I have a ‘hopeful’ sense of style and a ‘realistic’ sense of style.  Hopeful-me will think about buying a teal floral wrap dress because it’s gorgeous. Realistic-me knows it will sit in my closet untouched for 3 years because I don’t wear teal!   I’ve learned to differentiate between the two while I shop, at least. If I was a celebrity suddenly, maybe I would lean towards hopeful-me’s style, but for now I am normal and realistic!
text:Yes this! I call it “ideal style” and “real style”. My “ideal style” involves a lot of flowy, Christy Dawn-style dresses. My actual, “real style” is way more simple - in my free time I wear a lot of plain t-shirts, sweaters, and jeans/shorts. I’ve bought a couple of absolutely lovely dresses over the years that I never wear, but will reach for my favorite Everlane t-shirts and comfy sweaters over and over again.	labels:I call it clothes for my fantasy life, Think shoes I can't walk in or stand in for too long.

text:Do you feel the black Friday sales better or worse than usually this year? Is it worth to buy clothing you won't wear until next year?	labels:The sales are about the same as last year.

Looking forward to never having to replace these black tights ever again.  I’ve been in the market for a camel coat and black leather jacket for a couple years, but haven’t found the perfect one to pull the trigger on either yet.

text:No (New) Jawnz January: 2021 Edition	labels:When I'm really hyped up over a new garment I just found online, I ask myself this armor-piercing question: *Do I already own this?*  It forces me to shift gears out of hype mode and take a mental stock of my wardrobe. While I may not own an exact copy of the garment I'm considering buying, I probably own a piece that fulfills the same purpose already (with regards to utility or aesthetics), and if the comparison is too close with the new item then I know I should wait a week and see if I still feel the same attraction to it. In most cases this allows the glamour of novelty to fade, and I've saved myself money and a potential redundancy in my closet. It's helped me a lot over the years.	episode_done:True

text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:When I was in my early 20's, my first priority was to look "cute" or "hot". 5 inch heels were just what I did. I had no money obviously, so it ended up being most anything I could find on clearance.   I'm in my mid-30's now and I simply don't wear it if it isn't comfortable. Not to say I live in sweatpants (well, pre-pandemic anyway), but I prioritize my comfort, looking relatively pulled together, and not tragically out of style but still not necessarily trendy. I don't wear heels.   I don't shop clearance anymore. If it's a well made item that I want and I've taken the time to think about it, I buy it. Otherwise, I do a lot of thrifting and wear what I like of that and sell the rest.	episode_done:True

text:Guidance organizing a suit for my fiancé for his father's funeral during lockdown	labels:I'm going to be real, he needs a new suit jacket if he can afford it. A 10 year old budget suit from high school is the opposite of high quality.  Do you live near a Suit Supply? They are a Dutch company so will probably have high quality clothes that fit him. I'd suggest getting an entire outfit from there. They have EXCELLENT customer service and will handhold him through the process in as pain free a way as possible.
text:The problem is that we are in full lockdown (and will be at least through January). Also I want him to get a good-quality and well-fitting suit for our wedding. If he gets a suit now (however rushed that would have to be), he would insist on wearing that to the wedding – I agree with him that it makes no sense to own two suits with our lifestyle.  We are in Europe/	labels:I'd say when the time comes, suitsupply would be a good place to get a new suit for the wedding. Their best value is their suits, but if he needs anything else, you might as well pick it up from there. The staff know what they're doing for the most part and will be able to pair things well, rather than having to combine things from other places. Since your fiancé isn't a fan of shopping, it'll be easier to get everything from one place.   Feel free to ask again about the wedding once that gets closer!

text:Is Chanel going to be better off without Karl?	labels:I feel like Karl Lagerfeld's legacy & tenure really glossed over his last decade or so of design. Sure there were some good shows in the 2010s, but a lot of it was just....   Virginie Viard is always going to come up short because she's Lagerfeld-esque and has the misfortune of coming directly after Lagerfeld. Lagerfeld was good at making his name and Chanel synonymous so that if you see a tweed jacket - you immediately think of both. As Viard tries to draw upon Chanel classics & house standards, it's seen as copying Lagerfeld (and failing) rather than her being referential. She hasn't really presented her point of view, separate from Chanel or Lagerfeld, either, so it's really hard to pick up on the specific aspects of her designs that are *hers.*
text:It seems she has spent her whole career under him, that she hasn't had a chance to spend her wings and develop her own point of view. The question is will she get that opportunity at Chanel - or will she need to leave to find it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Anyone like wearing traditional clothing from you culture?	labels:I love me some Mexican embroided shirts as well!

text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:Everything eventually comes back in fashion.  Personally I would love for 2000s jeans to come back - not super low rise or the ones that were bedazzled or laced up but just normal rise bootcut and flare jeans. I have a few from that era that I still wear all the time and a couple more that I had to replace with similar ones from poshmark because I couldn't find them in shops.  I also miss 2000s makeup. Sure, there was too much body glitter and candy colors but there was also the fresh dewy look of blush and a light lip gloss - think Britney Spears in her Oops I Did It Again video, or Mandy Moore's makeup in her video for Candy. Not everything in the 2000s was horrible lol.

text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:For light colored clothes:  - Persil laundry detergent. It’s gotten stains out of things that I never thought possible - Keep a few Clorox wipes or a tide pen in your bag for random spots that may occur  - Carry a scarf in your bag to sit on, I always do regardless of what color my pants are  With new clothes, I’ll wear them around the house for a bit to get comfortable in them & make any adjustments to the outfit. IMO it’s a great time to listen to music, maybe have a drink/tea, relax, and enjoy the process. Invoke the feeling of getting ready for a Friday night out with your best friends.   Then it’s time to for the outside world. My lizard brain chose these beautiful clothes, it’s time to embrace them.

text:Deceptive Marketing Practices by Fashion Companies	labels:Speaking of deceptive marketing practices, I just got this email:   Notice of Class Action Settlement  If you purchased any Coach Outlet Merchandise discounted from a “MFSRP,” you may be eligible to receive a payment from a class action Settlement.  If you purchased any of Defendant Coach, Inc.’s (“Defendant” or “COACH”) outlet Merchandise[1] offered at a discount from a “MFSRP,” you may be eligible to receive a payment from a class action settlement (“Settlement”). The lawsuit against Defendant alleges that the “MFSRP” statements on the tags of the Merchandise offered at a discount from a “MFSRP” are misleading because they included the price of its retail goods, creating the false impression that its outlet store Merchandise was once sold in COACH’s full-line retail stores and was of the same quality and workmanship as merchandise sold in COACH’s full-line retail stores. Defendant denies any and all wrongdoing of any kind whatsoever and denies any liability to Plaintiffs and to the Settlement Class. The Court has not decided who is right. Both sides have agreed to settle the dispute and provide an opportunity for payments and other benefits to Settlement Class Members. The case is called Marino, et al v.

text:Do you think that designer brands will no longer be as sought after in the future?	labels:No. Like Borowitz said someone has to buy designer items in order for it to end up on the secondhand market.   There will always be a market for designer/luxury rtw, handbags, shoes & accessories as long as rich & wealthy people exist. The luxury market is not trying to appeal to everyone; they don't have to work hard to do so. I think that's reflected in FFA being repulsed by logos while not really being aware that for the most part LV, Balenciaga, & Gucci have been focusing on Asian markets and it worked.	episode_done:True

text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:Yeah, I shop a lot because I'm usually sad and it feels like new items will fix that somehow, or make people miraculously like me more. I'm aware that it doesn't work like that, but I love dressing up as a "new me" every day and I easily get bored... but that's just mental issues :/  With autism and me identifying as queer and all, I'm not exactly popular and there isn't one version of me I'd consider the real me, which makes it even more difficult. "The real me" fluctuates day by day, and so do my outfit preferences. I often buy things impulsively that I WILL love for quite some time, but never on two subsequent days, for example. I've been mocked for this, but I've still found I'm happiest like this, with my crazy big wardrobe and tons of different styles.

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Addressing the body change: I too gained a decent amount of weight in my mid twenties due to getting an office job. One of the biggest breakthroughs I had in terms of my style was accepting my new body/silhouette and figuring out what cuts work for my new body. With that extra weight, I ended up loving the way I looked in long, dark pencil skirts paired with a tucked in top. Additionally, I stopped caring about the number or the size of the garment. Sometimes I needed a size M, sometimes I needed a size XL. Once I got over that mental hurdle, shopping was so much easier.   &#x200B;  Addressing the lifestyle change: Not sure if this is the advice you wanted to hear, but this is what worked for me. My younger self's style was not office appropriate at all. I was into short sundresses and plunging necklines. My big "ah-hah" moment was realizing that I can have two styles. At work, I'm a walking advertisement for J.Crew and I feel so confident. Outside of work, I'm in a short dress and high heels. The trick for me was realizing that my body can pull off different silhouettes depending on the style. I enjoy form fitting outfits in my office wardrobe. Conversely, I enjoy flowy outfits in my non-office wardrobe.

text:MFA Theme WAYWT: Layering	labels:I love layering so much. My personal favorite obnoxiously layered combo is Henley -> Flannel button down -> Cardigan -> Chore coat.   Not sure how it feel about the fits with vests over a sportscoat/jacket. Especially with the jacket lapel pulled up and over the vest.
text:Hey! The vest over a sportsjacket is me! I too thought it was a bit bold — but I have seen it in some lookbooks before and decided to try it out. Without the lapels rolled over, it looks pretty atrocious, the parts of the jacket that stick out below the vest look misplaced. With the lapels pulled out there’s a little bit of continuity and the vest doesn’t dominate the upper body.   I definitely agree it’s not an everyday look, but for a layering challenge I thought I’d take a leap.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:There are some clothes that look good when fitted at the right place and good when not fitted at the right place. It's all about the place. A flowly dress looks amazing when the fit is right around the tiniest part of your waist. Meanwhile, a bodycon is fitted all over the body and it really looks trashy in my opinion. And since it's fitted everywhere, you look wider around your waist and basically, you just look like an oversized banana. I am very critical of bodycon kinds of dresses.	episode_done:True
text:"Can people just hate fashion again" - Synecdoche When Talking about the "Industry" Discussion	labels:I don't have much to do with High Fashion, mostly because I choose to live within my means.

I don't, for the LIFE of me, understand why Target, Gap, and all the other stores where normal people shop don't hold their own runway shows. Why don't they "show" at NYFW? They're more relevant to my life than Gautier is.
text:Cuz fashion week is purely for marketing (which regular consumer brands don’t really need help with) and it’s EXPENSIVE.

text:I want to be that bada*** biCTH (Ik it's spelt wrong, it's meme bro lol sry. Plus idk if we can swear, I don't post) tl;dr at the end cuz I tend to rant :)	labels:I'll start with #2. I started shopping for my own clothes around 16/17 . My family don't really care what clothes I buy with my money as long as my closet wasn't bursting at the seams.  I sometimes get the "are you really going to wear that/buy that" when they see me in something new. I remember buying a pair of wide legged, long jeans, and wearing sports bras as tops. Maybe it's because they saw how happy and comfortable I was in them that they didn't try to put me down for wearing stuff like that. What I buy is with my own money anyways, which does give me more confidence in some ways and probably helps them accept it too.  I know you mentioned ripped jeans -- I know some ripped jeans can cost, like, $150-$300 a pair. My advice would be to buy it with your own income (if that's possible, I know you aren't even 18/21 yet) and purchase things that you want to wear AND feel confident in wearing. It really sucks to spend money on items that sit around collecting dust.  My story with #3 is that people around me are either 1. creative energy or 2. dress with a similar vibe to me. I try to play a game -- if I'm going out in something "basic"/very messy, it's to blend in and likely not to talk to anyone that day. If I'm going out in something I love wearing, it's because I love it and I want to share it with the world. So I welcome the stares (and the questions). I try to match what I'm wearing to a purpose or mindset for that day. I value my own productivity more than how I'm being judged for something so shallow: my outfit. So my advice would be to find a purpose for what you're wearing, a purpose that is strong and way more important than how others might judge your outfit.  Honestly, I found that finding and building my style (which is really just a collection of stuff I will wear often) was a combination of having some financial independence and buying pieces that I loved to wear. Best of luck to you!	episode_done:True

text:For the parents of girls	labels:Mom of two little girls - 4 years old and 20 months old. The four year old dresses herself in whatever she wants. If it is not weather appropriate, I make her adjust (like a long sleeve shirt under a tank dress). She rarely matches but I think it builds independence, confidence, and creativity. She hates it when I ask her to wear something specific (like for a holiday) so I just try to buy special outfits we will both love. I let her pick out some of what I buy for her (give her some options to pick from). We shop mostly online so it’s easy for me to have some control over what she can choose.   The 20 month old pretty much wears hand me downs lol and I mostly pick what she wears but she’s starting to prefer to select herself (she’ll tell me “pick dress” in the morning to tell me she wants to choose a dress). I will let her pick her clothes more and more as she becomes more independent.   I imagine over time my girls will start to put together more and more fashionable outfits as they become more aware of style and what their peers are wearing. I will always let them choose for themselves and only intervene when what they want to wear is truly inappropriate for some reason. And even then I will continue to give them options for alternatives and let them choose. It’s their body after all!	episode_done:True

Because we weren't any of us born knowing how to style.
text:I love dusty pinks and mauves.  I cannot express how badly those colors look with my skin. I've had *strangers* ask me if I was ok because they assumed someone who resembled a corpse that much must be actually nearing death.   I love heels and very sleek business casual as well as what I can only call ho-fits. I have bad ankles fr from working on concrete floors too many hours, and take public transportation. It's too much of a risk I could sprain my ankle from how much I walk, and I can't afford another sprain. My office is not business casual or sleek, but a no fuss "just don't wear t-shirts with slogans or anything" type of place. I am decidedly over my ho phase, despite my continued love of the clothes.   My fantasy of wearing heeled booties with a structured fashion blazer over a mauve dress is not any less real just because I have the common sense to not go through with it.

text:Thoughts on Shein?	labels:Controversial opinion, but, they aren’t that bad.   Let’s have some empathy for a moment: it is an absolute privilege to be able to shop at a sustainable store and/or to be able to buy secondhand. Imagine being someone who hasn’t bought new to them clothing in years because they can’t afford to and then fast fashion prices are waved in their faces on clothing that fits them and is their style. I’m not going to tell someone to not buy clothing from a place they can afford. I’m absolutely not doing it.   People demonize fast fashion because they look at it as black and white and don’t understand that, if you’re shopping at SHEIN, you likely can’t afford the more sustainable sources/you can’t find what you’re looking for secondhand. I’m plus sized. I can’t fit into and afford a lot of the sustainable brands out there. And, people buy out the “fashionable” plus size items in my local thrift stores to sell on Depop, so, I don’t blame people for shopping on SHEIN.  I’ve bought SHEIN secondhand and I’ve had items for years and I haven’t had any issues. I haven’t bought first hand from them in a long time but when I did, I never had any long shipping times or anything, either. I found the same defects I’d find at Target, like, a long thread here or there that I can easily snip off.   This goes for fast fashion in general—if you take care of your clothes and wear the appropriate size, you can make them last. It’s not like they spontaneously rip apart, you have to do something to make them do that. Steam your clothes to get out wrinkle. Tumble dry, hand wash, etc.
text:I would agree. I already commented but there's a huge market gap for plus sized women that Shein fills. It's beyond obvious most people posting and commenting on this sub aren't plus sized or are on the smaller end of it like me, size 14/16. Shein accommodates women up to size 24/26 or so and those women are more likely to need inexpensive clothes (obesity/poverty correlation, it sucks but its true). Most people on this sub can afford or have the option of a huge variety of ethical and sustainable clothes that are not Shein either due to being straight sized or having enough disposable income. If you're committed to ethical and sustainable fashion and you're avoiding all new clothes, fast fashion, and mall brands, sure, I'll listen to your critique of Shein, but please realize most American women don't really have that privilege. If you're out here buying Zara and Express, you can kindly shut the fuck up with your hypocrisy.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:As I wait to hear if I have to evacuate due to CA wildfires, here’s a hypothetical I had to do: you have time to prepare before your evacuation and pack up your car. What clothes do you bring and why?	labels:I just packed up my family and home in the Santa Cruz mountains and I brought: 2 tshirts, a pair of carhart pants covered in paint splatters, a pair of rubber Birkenstocks, a striped tank top, a cashmere pullover, no jeans at all because I forgot them (!!!) also no underwear because also forgot, one negative underwear bra I am wearing because it’s amazing, a pair of Isabel Marant booties that I love, a dress that I once wore every day for a week on a trip to Manhattan, a flannel shirt, a pair of cutoff shorts, my Isabel Marant white leather jacket that I almost never wear because white leather, another cashmere sweater, one of those jackets that kind of looks like a military-ish flak jacket, and my black wedding dress. So random.	episode_done:True

Fuck that place and that HR lady in particular.

text:Are jean shorts on men really that bad?	labels:I don't think they look bad, I just find the concept weird.  It's summer, it's hot so you're wearing shorts, but the shorts are made from denim which is a hot and sweaty material. It's an oxymoron to me, like have you got your legs out to stay cool or have you got the denim on to stay warm? What's going on here?
text:Also, for travel, denim sucks. I have been to 40ish countries, so I am somewhat open minded about different cultures, but one area I have unguarded, unabashed chauvinism is in the supremacy of American dryers. Dealing with crappy unvented combo washer+dryer units, or waiting 2 days for jeans to air dry in a hostel is no fun.	labels:The clear problem is that you've chosen to wash your denim rather than live in the muck	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: What is the environmental impact of different fabrics?	labels:Linen is quite amazing in that regard :  \- it doesn't have many natural predators so doesn't require a lot of pesticides, if any.  \- There's no need to water it AT ALL if you've chosen the field's location well, as natural precipitations will be enough.  \- Little to no chemical fertilizers are used, since they actively destroy linen's quality by making it lay on the floor.  \- Requires much less energy to weave into fabric than most other fibers, and is beautiful un-dyed.  \- It's a natural fabric, so recyclable.  \- Finally, since it wicks humidity and doesn't retain odors under "normal" conditions, you don't need to wash it as frequently, and since it has a "wrinkly" nature that is embraced by connoisseurs, you can get away with not ironing it.

text:Lately she is my pandemic designer. I love all of her patterns and pattern upon pattern and her comfortable to the max looks. And the shoes! No reason to suffer heels now. Even though restricted to the house and yard and sometimes a quick trip to the market I still get dressed as creatively and colorfully as I can. It lifts my spirits as well as the spirits of my family. We are a three generation household. My 13 year old granddaughter gave me the highest of compliments last week when I came downstairs.  "Wow, I wish I was an old lady so I could dress like that"! I told her that one of the benefits of being my age is that I can wear whatever I want. I'm retired and 76 but I still love looking good and I love fashion but I no longer worry about or want the latest trends. I know what they are and can work around them to get the look that I want, not what Madison Ave. tells me is IT.	labels:	episode_done:True

How to remove and put one on in public (which you may have to do, for example in restaurants). There’s hat etiquette which varies in different eras and places, but I go with not wearing a man style hat while eating, and during times of remembrance/commemoration, and when in doubt. I believe ladies hats can be left on indoors.  The other thing is, WIND. If it’s windy, you’ll need a chin strap or have it snugly on. A blown off hat is annoying.	episode_done:True
text:What is your 2021 style resolution?	labels:Focus on quality rather than quantity.

text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:I’m in your boat and have been for several years now. I was usually between 140-160lbs and a solid hourglass until I was around 23-24 thanks to a combo of PCOS, hormonal birth control, and wedding planning-induced stress eating. These days I float between 220-230lbs and most of my weight hangs out in my belly so I look pregnant lol. In my thinner days I liked form-fitting pin-up style clothing. These days I tend to go for loose, flowy blouses,flannels, and sweaters.   For pants I discovered the joy of stretchy paper bag style pants over the summer and in the fall/winter I do anything black and high-waisted. I still refuse to give up skinny jeans though as I detest anything flared. I swapped H&M out for Torrid and I still get most of my clothes at Target as they usually have decent options for work clothes. I’ve recently discovered that Old Navy makes the best fitting, AFFORDABLE jeans for me.	episode_done:True

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items are my Native American Turquoise jewelry and my cowboy boots. Just purchased a huge $900 squash blossom necklace and have worn it constantly. My boots range from $30 for a secondhand pair to $750 for custom made and none are worn more or less than the others.  When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was “saving for good”. Ironically, “good” apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I’m just out running errands.

text:How would you style or rebuild your wardrobe around your holy grail fashion piece?	labels:Pear shape with a big arse - I want Lauren Bacall style wool trousers. Fluid, full, and fitting just so on the waist. Styled classic for work with an equally full and fluid washed silk shirt, rolled up sleeves and tucked in with a patent waist belt. For brunch dates with a bateau neck tee that fits like a second skin, and for evenings with a low backed long sleeved version of the same. A chunky, cropped length fisherman’s jumper if theres a chill on casual strolls

text:What pieces would you love "backups" of?	labels:This is pretty uninspired, but I have a lot of basics that I wish I had bought in duplicates, but didn't buy in duplicates, because I figured they were basics and I could always just get more.   Alas. The styles changed just a bit, and now I can't find the plain white tanks and tees I want because the sleeves and the neckline and the length are all just a tiny bit off. Thank you for reading along, this not-a-real-problem is very frustrating at times.

text:Fall Fit Battle - Final Four - Discussion	labels:**NgoKnows** vs Chunsak. I'm a little bit let down by Chunsak's colour palette, whereas Ngo rocks it in this department. I'm also giving points to Ngo for the better trousers-to-footwear transition. Notably, both did a cheeky thing with showing a little bit of a white sock, but this too is nicer in Ngo's fit. Clear winner for me.  8888plasma vs **Rariora**. I'm a little bit let down by both fits (but I am coming into this with extremely high expectations). Rariora feels like a rehash of last week (and last week was a better execution of this concept, maybe). plasma is committing to "very cool textures", but aside from this nothing about the silhouette or palette or other French fashion words excites me here. Besides the cool texture clash, I don't think that sweater and trousers work particularly well (tho the belt is cool).
text:Yeah, I do agree with your assessment of my fit - it's somewhat of a rehash. I unfortunately ran into the problem that my wardrobe simply isn't deep enough for the specific context of a fit battle, as I rarely experiment with texture or silhouette in any meaningful way (I tend to stick to a fairly narrow range in those regards). Also, on a day-to-day basis I tend to wear a lot of conventional black basics in combination with my more interesting clothes, which severely limited my options after I had used all my interesting clothes in combination with each other lol  I did have one interesting fit saved for the finals though (on the off chance that I made it to them). In retrospect I probably should've used it here!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Sorry you feel that way. When I wrote it, I tried to convey that I didn't put much thought into what I wore. Perhaps I could have said pajama bottoms with RRL cardigans. I don't have a perfect description for it, but I do think that the style Andrew is wearing there is a lot more coherent. I think there are ways to do that style thoughtfully, and not randomly. I didn't write this with the intention of making people feel unhappy with their current wardrobe.

text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ?

I have a pair of bright turquoise patterened mules which I wear with a neutral outfit. I also have a bright red/orange pair of heels which tie in perfectly with a pair of formal paperbag trousers which have the same colour running through. Personally I like to bring in colour from one accessory - whether that's a scarf, bag, shoe, or jewellery.  I like to play with juxtaposition and so if I wear a very feminine outfit I like to pair it with some tougher shoes like Doc martens.	episode_done:True

text:"Which Sports Jacket Office Are You?" – Permanent Style	labels:Good article with some nice outfits. I've always been someone into tailored clothing and classic menswear, and honestly the odd jacket / trousers combination is absolutely the way to go. I own a single full suit, which I love, but generally it's a functional piece to be worn when a level of formality is *required* -- and therefore not as much fun.  Meanwhile, I have lots of different blazers / sports jackets and tailored trousers, and not only are they more fun to style and mix up, they're just that much more versatile that they become my go-to combination for what is basically my every day style. You can play around with the shoes, whether or not you have a tie, or a hat, and all of a sudden you have so many more options!  My suit simply doesn't have the same versatility, to the point that (when social functions were a thing) I probably wore my black-tie dinner suit more often.

They handle outerwear for labels like Cole Haan, Karl Lagerfeld, Levi’s, Tommy, and quite a few others. The quality is going to be low to medium at best.   I wouldn’t pay much for it.
text:THANK YOU! This is precisely the kind of info I'm interested in.  When I look at the quality of recently made Andrew Marc... I'm underwhelmed. Then go to their site and see. They'll have garments with a so-called MSRP of "$695" with a discounted price then a promo price reducing it to $295". So really, that original price tag is nonsense and not indicative of that level of quality.	labels:All of this should have been the first sign that it's garbage.
text:And your comment helps... how?  This article is focused on the vintage Andrew Marc. Have you owned one? The leather is terrific quality for the price, if you know which style releases to look for. The fact that recent production is a notable drop in quality means you can find "gems" in older releases.

Everyone is busy looking at, thinking about, critiquing themselves.  So wear what makes you happy! Try new things!   Edited for concision.

I now wear a ring which will look good with my fits, but feels really weird being just ... there on my hand, all the time now.  They vetoed me posting pictures (we have public facing jobs, these pictures are all over social media, too easy to reverse image search etc.), but they wore a Rick Owens dress (that I picked out) while I went full minimalism with a collarless shirt with onyx studs, a sleek blazer and cropped trousers. I put this together from my existing wardrobe, since we didn't want to spend a lot. Covid measures made things a bit weird, but the court officer made a real effort into making it nice, which was great. (edit: just so nobody thinks we are totally irresponsible: it was literally just us at city hall, no guests, no party. We'll catch up with that after vaccination.)

Also great to have a nice wrap coat/cardigan that is good for spring, summer, fall (can be worn closed or open). A good winter coat, better to invest more in something stylish and long lasting than to have several that are not great quality.

text:FAQ: Why/ when/ how do you cuff jeans?	labels:**Why:** to make the hemline higher, to provide a visual break between your pants and your shoes (useful if they're a similar colour), or because they are raw denim that will bleed on your shoes excessively if you don't. I suppose some people also cuff in order to flex the selvedge ID, but why condemn yourself to a life of fruitlessly hoping that somebody will notice your selvedge ID?  **How:** idk, you just kind of roll them up. Usually a width of about an inch looks good, but experiment with wider or narrower cuffs as well as with the height of the hem and see what looks good.

text:The Terribly High Cost of Cheap Goods	labels:Most of this conversation is sadly ignorant of how global development works and prioritizes people in wealthy, developed countries over those in developing countries that need manufacturing to raise their standards of living. Since the post-colonial period there has only been two ways that any countries have significantly increased their economic development level, resource extraction like oil (which just isn't an option for most countries) and becoming a low-cost manufacturing center.  Countries that are now flourishing like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan were only able to do so because they became hubs for cheap international manufacturing, which enabled them to transform  into thriving, world-class developed economies.  Slave labor or child labor should always be unacceptable, but the idea that you are helping anyone except those who are already wealthy on a global scale buy strictly buying goods made in developed markets is ignorant.

text:I highly recommend thrifting.   I was in a similar place. So I started hitting up my local thrift spots a couple times a month and just browsing through their selection. It's pretty fun and you can get some really cool stuff. Even if it's just some shirts in a more exciting pattern or some boomer pants.	labels:thirded	episode_done:True

I'm trying *really* hard to not get wrapped up in the hype, especially since some stores keep extending their sales for "just 12 more hours" for literal weeks on end...having said that, I'll probably at least do a look through Nordstrom's stuff, as I usually give myself a little birthday shopping spree there.	episode_done:True
text:How do you wear square scarves?	labels:I tie them around a purse strap or if they’re long enough, use them as a belt - it looks really cute with jeans. I’ve seen a few girls wearing them tied around a ponytail too and want to try that, as it’s a cute look.	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I moved from a place which has four seasons but it often grey and overcast to a place just a little north of the tropics with a lot of heat and sun. I still favour similar shapes but now in much lighter fabrics. The biggest difference has been the amount of colour in my wardrobe. I’ve gone from a mainly navy and blacks colour palette to wearing such a variety. I find myself often wearing seasonal colours as if I’m trying to create seasons which simply don’t exists in the weather!	episode_done:True

Anyways, I have the hardest time finding nightgowns that aren’t made for the elderly or aren’t lace nighties. I just want a cute and soft night gown! Until then I’m also in the oversized T-shirt camp.

text:Dashiel Brahmann Fall/Winter 2020	labels:This is really cool stuff. To me this seems like a much more accessible version of a lot of Rick Owens’ looks- how to not look like you’re wearing a costume.
text:Hot take everything is a costume.   Most people wear pants designed for mining (jeans) with shoes designed to be used for athletic purposes (sneakers) with a top designed to be underwear (t-shirt) the only reason this doesn't look odd to us is because of slow societal acceptance and popular people in our society helping speed this up (James Dean wearing teeshirts and jeans Thom Brown bringing the slim fit suit back).	labels:I feel like we’re talking about two different things. I don’t see anything wrong with distinguishing between more day to day wearable pieces and much more outwardly avant-gard looks, even if they’re from a designer such as Rick who is acclaimed and popular to people who have familiarity with high fashion.  If I understand you correctly you’re talking about how functional items have become fashionable or are used beyond their original purpose (like jeans or like a leather biker off of a motorcycle) but that isn’t really what Rick is? He’s not starting from a functional utilitarian perspective. I only meant that this looks like it straddles the line better between more “normal” casual looks and full “high fashion” looks in an interesting way.
text:My whole point was that calling something costumey is a poor/negative description of avant-garde/high fashion, because at it's essence your saying that those people aren't dressing true to themselves (they are wearing a costume) and your not describing anything about the piece.  I agree with you though it definitely hits a nice middle ground between totally high-fashion and more traditional clothes.	labels:Oh I see what you’re saying now, thanks for explaining. I certainly don’t mean this in a negative way to describe how someone chooses to express themselves at all, and certainly don’t mean to say dressing avant-garde is inauthentic. At the same time, I don’t think those things are mutually exclusive. This sub is full of people half-joking or joking about capes and cloaks, and every so often someone asks about a long duster or the like from Blade Runner or the Matrix or something. You could still be dressing true to yourself and look a bit out of place.  I don’t think people advising someone to not dress like a movie character are impugning how that person wishes to express themselves as inauthentic. Rather, the perception of the layperson of some person dressed as Neo would be “costumey” I think the same could be said for someone in full Rick- it doesn’t change the layperson perception just because one of those two people choosing to dress outside the norm knows more about fashion than the other.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 12, 2020	labels:I ordered a new saddle for my bike.  Immediately after ordering, I saw a promotion for 15% off my first order.  I sent a request within 5 minutes for that promotion to be retroactively applied (processing change, price adjustment, partial refund, cancel and reorder, whatever), and they basically said "no".  Returns are free.  I am going to ship this goddamn thing back across the Atlantic and they are going to lose out more on shipping than they would have just giving me the discount, plus the cost of a sale.  EDIT: I should be naming and shaming, it's Brooks y'all.

text:When did skinny jeans go out of fashion?	labels:skinny jeans haven't been on trend since at least 2015-2016 imo. that's when mom jeans became all the rage.  That being said, skinny jeans are pretty much staples for most people. They go with a lot of outfits and make a lot of looks.   Just because something isn't currently on trend, does not mean it can't be stylish.
text:Skinnies fit inside knee high boots (which I know they aren’t currently on trend either) but I’m in the PNW, and we currently have 12 inches of snow and counting outside, so I do not care what’s in and what’s out. So long as it keeps me  warm and dry and isn’t hideous, it’s good enough.	labels:Wait, knee high boots aren't on trend? If so, what boots are and where do I go to find this out?    I thought there are tons of knee and OTK boots being sold in various retailers that last year or so... and the taller boots mentioned in a lot of casual fAsHun blogs?

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 23, 2020	labels:**I trust you. Please tell me exactly what to get, from bottom to top.**  I'm a 23 y.o. student at Zurich,  Switzerland. I've always dressed kind of decently, but always felt like I  had no style. (no accessories, no colors, outfits matching in color but  not style)  Whenever I try to work on this I get overwhelmed and my brain shuts down, so now I come to you.  I am 1m82, average build, unkempt hair that is a bit longer than average, slightly feminine facial features.  Stores  that I can afford in Zurich are: H&M, Jack & jones and others  in the same price range. Black Friday is coming so that might give some  flexibility.  I don't know what  style I exactly want, but I know that I don't want something too  "clean". I want something memorable, somehow cool, but not too much  either. A necklace and bracelets would be nice too.  Sorry for potential grammatical mistakes, and thank you very much for your help in advance!	episode_done:True

I sort of knew this, but now it's something I'm conscious of, and will definitely be conscious of when I shop for new clothes.  I also realized a connection between the styles of visual art, music and architecture I like, and the kinds of patterns and colour schemes I like. So that's neat.

The back-to-back liquidation sales and the understandable lack of need for more formal wear for WFH have me worried. I thought I saw them reply that they'd be ok in response to a comment on their IG post announcing the suit liquidation, but I can't find that anymore.
text:Just my personal observations but I think they're trying to pivot a little bit, and moving some deadstock to consolidate their inventory. They just released a field jacket, two winter parkas, and the most knitwear I've seen from them this season. I'm guessing they're trying to hit a bit of the smart-casual demographic instead of relying solely on suits.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:Women will pay more for their clothes, and pay more for nicer clothes than men will. Supply and demand, baby.
text:True, but I think people also need to be smarter about where they shop. OP seems to be shopping at either crap brands like H&M or way overpriced/luxury brands, or she doesn’t know what sales are. Because I can find cashmere sweaters from luxury stores like Bloomingdales or Bergdorf Goodman year-round for $100 or even lower.   Edit: I did a quick search for women’s cotton sweaters at Nordstrom and they have many 100% cotton styles on sale in the $20-30 range...	labels:I can't remember if that is one of the brands that is made by forced labor (Uyghurs) in concentration camps (western China).

Everyone is busy looking at, thinking about, critiquing themselves.  So wear what makes you happy! Try new things!   Edited for concision.

text:Let's Talk about hats	labels:Assuming you’re American, the formality in clothing has drastically dropped in the last century. Hats (aside from baseball caps and beanies, like others mention) are so rare there’s not much expectation at all. They get cool points just because you have an unusual accessory. I think people assume you’re confident just because you’re rocking something unusual!
text:My experience with them is you may feel awkward at first but everyone automatically assumes you’re extremely confident and put together. It’s very relieving!	labels:thanks!	episode_done:True
text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:This style is surprisingly attainable for me after several years of hardcore minimalism. Once I got to a place where my basics are both on point and super pragmatic, then I have been able to incorporate a few Tibi and Tibi-like statement pieces into my rotation. I’m no longer a minimalist in terms of style - I like buying a couple “big impact” things every year to jazz up my clothes, especially oversized  or dramatic drape or “origami structure” on tops and coats. A single piece really changes an outfit and you don’t need many pieces in rotation to suddenly change your style. Amy Smilovic appears to do a similar thing - keep several things “basic” (neutral color, solid/no pattern, uniform texture, unadorned (no bling or fringes etc) and the play with one thing (her thing seems to be oversized fit and pleats).  The only reason I bring up minimalism is because I cannot emphasize more how much the basics being “just right” makes my dramatic pieces work. Especially with oversized, it’s a thin line between slob and stylish. Those big pleated dad pants Amy Smilovic wears? The rest of the outfit should be sharp or you look like you simply don’t know how clothes should fit. Not everyone needs to first develop an “unfashionable” base before reaching for both fashionable and pragmatic, but I did.   As for Tibi, I know them most for silks and for their origami shapes. GoSilk is a great option for patterned silk and Roksanda has the shapes. Ganni and Comme Les Garcons has some of the quirkinesses and oversized looks. But none of them are cheap either unless you score a good sale. If you can identify exactly what you like about Tibi, we can make more recommendations.
text:Thank you for this thoughtful and helpful answer! I come from the opposite end, full closet, constantly shifting from boho to grunge and then to sporty again until I was fed up with the whole "I don't know what to wear" thing - I never understood what exactly I liked about a clothing piece or style.  I ended up with some good quality basic pieces, not boring, functional, versatile and now I try to build from there. What I am really looking for are clothing pieces, in which an idea, a thought was invested - meaning there is something deliberate about it, interesting cut, texture, print. But I also want them to work together with other things I own.   Thank you for recommending Gianni and Comme des Garcons, I have some things from them and they are more affordable for me. I also like COS for good fabrics and robustness, but then again it is quite popular where I live and many people shop there too. Arket is even cheaper, but it is a little bland for me. There are also some european brands like Closed or Baum und Pferdgarten, Essentiel Antwerp, however it always depends on a particular season/trend whether I find something there or not.	labels:> Baum und Pferdgarten  Ohhh I love them, my local boutique has finally started carrying this and it’s so fun!	episode_done:True

Although I still pay the $33 from thredup because I feel so guilty about buying new clothes.	labels:Sellers on ThredUp can adjust their items’ prices, and some sellers just jack their price up to the maximum allowed.

text:Women who have moved for extended periods of time on 1 or 2 suitcases only, how did you do it? Here's the beginning of my process	labels:I'm an Australian who moved over to the other side of the world to London in January, and I was only limited to a 30kg suitcase, a small cabin suitcase, and a backpack.   I'm not much of a minimalist person either, but I brought all my basic t-shirts, a few skincare products that I couldn't live without (I'm a skincare junkie, and my skin breaks the fuck out when I'm stressed so that was important to have for me), and I also brought my summer clothes over. Why? Because Australian winters are quite different to UK winters, and I didn't think my Australian winter clothes would hold up in a UK winter, and I figured that buying winter stuff in London would be better than buying winter clothes in Australia and bringing it over to the UK.  The UK isn't as cold as I expected, but I don't regret buying my winter stuff in London. If I was gonna blow my money on new clothes, I'd rather spend it on winter clothes than summer clothes, since the UK doesn't really have long summers.  I also brought a couple of shoes over: black heels, black flats, my Docs, one pair of fashion sneakers, and my running shoes. I ended up buying Chelsea boots in London for work, and a pair of sandals during summer.  Try to make sure your stuff is as versatile as possible when you first move, because chances are, you'll be too busy to shop in your first week of moving!
text:Shoes are one of my biggest problems because of space. So far I'm taking white sneakers, docs, point-toed booties and a pair of sandals. I'd travel in my docs for space and weight, but the other boots are just as heavy and I they're my favorite pair of shoes (too hard to put on and off for airport purposes).   I'm moving from 6months of winter to 8months of summer, so I won't have to have a huge division between summer and winter clothing. I'm finding hard to adapt the way I wear clothing with layering, color scheme, etc.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:Honestly I think you have to give way more detail on your old pair and what you’re looking for.  In my mind the biggest hurdle to perfect jeans is the fit, and since every body is different this is highly individual. Some people might prefer stretchier denim for a more forgiving fit, while others look for stiffer fabric, and have less leeway.   Personally I still struggle to find a high rise, non cropped, fits my thighs and waist, plain dark wash, straight/skinny, 90% or more cotton, pair of jeans. But hopefully I’ll find it eventually!
text:Have you tried Dear John jeans? I'd never heard of them before but got them in a wantable box recently. They're either 92 or 98% cotton, high rise, skinny, and flexible.

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:I am a sewist with just over 1 year if experience, and my handmade clothes are without a doubt better quality than fast fashion store bought, comparable or better than mid-range (ie I always fully line things, I use French seams or bias bound seams and hand picked zippers rather than overlocker seam finishes as you get in almost all store bought clothes) and I wouldn't know about high end because I don't shop anywhere that fancy. The difference for me is I now spend the money on high quality fabric - organic cotton, 100% sandwashed linen, hemp and bull denim, tencel and lyocell blends etc. Often even mid to higher end clothes are not made with the highest quality natural fibers and it really makes a difference in wear and tear. I also use good quality thread which makes a big difference. Because I only sew for myself, I can take as long as I want doing beautiful seam finishes, fitting garments correctly, and more. My home sewn clothes get worn daily and I have to admit its really ruined shopping for me, even op shopping, because now my standards for fit, fabric and finish are quite high. I'm in no way a professional, simply someone who loves to sew and feels she deserves the clothes of her dreams. I do treat my clothing kindly though - I wash less, hang dry and repair or repurpose what I can.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have any visual guides for how clothes should fit	labels:I really appreciate this question/thread. I didn’t grow up seeing anyone in my family or circles wearing well-tailored clothing or professional attire in general so i genuinely don’t know what a good fit looks like. I struggle a lot with having a curvier body and a loud personality but not wanting to feel like a pinup girl caricature if my clothes are too tight or fit a certain way. I’ve never really thought about what i would and wouldn’t consider a good fit on me, besides my Levi’s 721s. I really need to have myself a think on this!	episode_done:True
text:Elk IV Parka from Wuxly Movement	labels:I gotta say tho, 600 for synthetic is really steep.   You could have gotten a really nice down for that, or a much cheaper equally good synthetic.
text:This is unhelpfully reductive and doesn't really address the issue in a way that makes sense. Down vs. synthetic is a tradeoff based on use cases, not a simple matter of one being better for everything.	labels:If one wants to make an ethical argument, thats up to them.  But down in a parka that has a waterproof shell is never going to lose against synthetic. Especially down which has been treated to not absorb humidity.   In sleeping bags, or for technical layers, there are more tradeoffs. But the OP already put themselves into the bucket of style/weight where Down is going to win across the board.   Synthetic can win on price (and get close to matching other considerations). But not $600 synthetic.	episode_done:True
text:Can we talk sleepwear?	labels:I like to let my body breathe when I sleep. I usually just wear a bralette (Aerie have some nice DD+ ones) and nothing else. I get my luxury fix with my sheets & blankets.   If I'm out of bed I'll wear sweatpants and a big cardigan open with my bralette underneath. I feel sexy and cozy. I really like the combination of knits and silky pieces and it looks luxe if you keep all your sleep/lounge wear in the same color palette.	episode_done:True
text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:From a logical perspective, it makes a lot of sense and this system would work for most people. I think everyone naturally has a different idea of what "on par" means to them given their budget and taste and there's a saying that the value of a piece is what the buyer is willing to pay for it. Sometimes there will be those pieces that just speak to you regardless of the price and while those are a rarity, I would like to see that incorporated into this system. This is more true when you start going up the scale where fashion becomes more of an art form instead of "clothes". For me, I would pay $1000 for a Craig Green jacket because I love his work and it speaks to me on a deeper level like a '97 Honda NSX would; to me the experience is worth the money. While the numbers are important, to match your golf analogy, it's still a game to have fun.
text:Absolutely this. While quality is something I think about, especially when going into the triple or quadruple digit price range, it isn’t always my guiding factor. Plain black tee? Yeah sure I’m going for par quality. I’ve never understood people who need a Margiela plain black tee. But I do understand people who want Margiela tabi boots. I’m sure you can get boots that out quality Margielas for half the price. But they won’t ignite that flame and if I’m not ignited by a statement piece them I’m not having fun.   I guess this whole discussion will just be people fighting for *how* and *why* they dress. Some people want solid brown boots to last 20 years. Others want boots that make them feel a certain way or say a certain specific fashion statement. Regardless we’re all one fashion fam. :)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Do you name your favorite outfits?	labels:I, too, have been bequeathed outfit names from my partner...some examples.   ‘Amazonian Office Warrior’: Leopard print shirt rolled to 3/4 sleeve, black leather pencil skirt, multi strapped black heel, hair with a feature plat, makeup at full blast (which he also calls my ‘war paint’).  ‘80s Candy Store Assistant’: Beige linen shortalls, multi coloured pastel fluffy crew neck sweater, white sneakers, ankle height scalloped lace socks.  ‘Karen’s Kracken’: high waisted Tommy Hilfiger jeans, tucked in white tight tshirt, black leather belt, black Birkenstock sandals, oversized sunnies, hair in a top knot. I wore this once while having to give ‘life advice’ to some ass who was hoarding stuff in covid supermarket stashing days, the name just stuck.   He is quite the creative.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:In my experience, lower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose) and spending more tends to lead to a more noticeable improvement in quality up to a certain point. That's painting with a broad brush though... leather dress shoes and boots scale much better than sneakers or sandals, where mid-range options are going to be good enough for most people.  T-shirts, dress shirts, denim, and accessories in low-to-mid-range are generally good enough from a quality perspective IMO and I've only really paid more in those categories for a design I like rather than because I think I'm getting something higher quality. There's nothing wrong IMO with buying something because you like the way it looks even if a similar quality alternative exists at a lower price, but that's harder to do if you're shopping on a budget.  I'll also add that for all of the above, your dollar goes a lot farther if you're willing to shop used. Sites like Ebay, Grailed, reddit/styleforum B/S/T threads, etc. have made it a lot easier to buy preowned clothes without having to set foot into a thrift store.  TL;DR When shopping on a budget I'd focus first on having a high quality pair of shoes and jacket. Consider buying used clothes to stretch your budget further.
text: >TL;DR When shopping on a budget I'd focus first on having a high quality pair of shoes and jacket. Consider buying used clothes to stretch your budget further  I volunteer in a charity shop (thrift store/op shop etc) and good coats, jackets and shoes come in *all the time*. Men either look after their clothes or destroy them. Womenswear tends to be more "worn but wearable" (but we easily get five times as much of it donated).   Shop in a slightly more affluent area and you'll find nicer things. Quite often there are a few shops catering to different markets and people (subconsciously?) donate according.   I've got a 1970s sheepskin coat from a charity shop that I'm expecting to last another 50 years at least and a pair of Timberland books that I bought for the change in my pocket eight years ago - they just needed new insoles.	labels:Just to piggyback on this, Timberland quality is shockingly bad these days.

text:Dressing for “housework” vs “working from my house”	labels:I've been a SAHM for 12 years now, and I learned early on that it was easiest for me to get up each morning like I was going to work, shower, and get ready for the day (do my hair and makeup). That means I'm prepared in case of an emergency or something unplanned. My uniform is jeans and a "cute" top. Right now, my kids are doing virtual learning, so I'm running around helping them, plus fixing their lunches and snacks, in addition to my normal chores and errands.   My favorite shoes are Gabor loafers, which I have in several colors. And I just purchased a pair of Dansko Nora loafers. They are super comfortable, lightweight, and have great support. I typically go barefoot at home (which is why my Bombas wear out), but I walk my dog every day and these are great for that.  I really love having a uniform, and I have several pairs of the same style jeans, and multiple tees in different colors and styles. If I have to leave, I can throw on jewelry, grab my bag, and I'm ready to go. I was a teacher previously, and having a system works for me at home.

text:PSA: Revive by Rent the Runway via Thredup	labels:I'm a frequent thredup buyer and seller but I do so with lots of caveats.   &#x200B;  1) I don't buy higher end goods from them because a) I don't trust the authenticity and b) they charge wayyyyyy more for more mid-level and up 'designer' or higher end brands. I'll just use Coach as an example. Vintage full leather Coach bags on thredup will sell for 50% or way way more than that same item on eBay from a random seller.   2) The level of use of their garments can really vary and the quality control is lacking. I've ordered items that were supposed to only be gently worn (they shouldn't really be selling anything that's more obviously worn), and gotten those items only to see that they are covered in animal hair and have obvious odors. But again, this isn't a constant issue and I don't buy final sale items from them so I can just return them.   &#x200B;  All of that having been said, I won't buy RTR items from thredup. I don't trust that their pricing will be reasonable secondhand market value nor do I trust the quality of the items.	episode_done:True

text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:I've always been chubby growing up, and because of my insecurities I use to cover myself up from head to toe. Hair down, baggy shirt with long sleeves showing no chest, tall jeans with no holes, knee socks below the jeans, and a pair of old sneakers. I use to wear black a lot as well because it was slimming. I never owned dresses, shorts, tank tops, or sandals because I believed they were to revealing.  Nowadays, I am a lot more confident in my appearance. I partially contribute that to my weight loss, but my friends now also helped in boosting my confidence. I'm now able to wear jeans with holes in them, I still don't like sleeveless shirts, but am able to wear more fitted clothing and show some skin. I no longer wear knee high socks and sometimes just go out in sandals or some heels. I love playing with colors now and feel as if I'm on the path to finding a style which truly suits me. I also recently bought my first pair of shorts since I was a child, so that's exciting 😗	episode_done:True

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:I have no idea if this is a good idea but it’s what I’m trying out.

text:What designer bags and eras do you think will come back in fashion 2021-2022?	labels:In terms of fashion, I think colors and maximalism will come back, after an entire decade of minimalism.   I was watching Twin Peaks, and what amazed me about the 80s 90s fashion in that show is the vibrancy of colors and patterns. We are already immersed in 80s and 90s revival now, esp in terms of oversized and dramatic fits, and I think gradually crazier colors and patterns will become more mainstream.   Bags - I suppose the more dramatic the better, and we are already seeing crazy shapes and colors now. Celine might start with crazier designs as well, with Slimane at its helm.
text:I think so too. The mom-jeans on trend is often more 80s then 90s. And I've seen shoulder pads, and shoulder "wings" comming in.  I hope for a V silhouette.

I've never seen so many designers and brands across several "genres" all thriving so well.  Saying something isn't "in fashion" just seems wild to me right now. Because honestly I think what's "fashionable" is exploring your own personal style and aesthetic. Being yourself is what's currently cool, and I think that's dope.

text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I started in 2017 and just finished this year and I am very happy with how my closet looks now!  First, I got rid of everything. I was transitioning from a cheap college wardrobe to a semi-professional one (I teach kids). I wanted to strip my closet down to the bare bones, keeping only what I truly wanted, and then building on top of what I had. I did a Marie Kondo type thing, almost. I kept a few things that were of higher quality or that I really liked, and donated the rest.  Then I got the absolute basics: a few neutral blouses, jeans and black pants, replaced some of my most worn out shoes that "went with everything." Then I built from there.  After that, then came the dirty work. Hours upon hours of Pinterest-ing, reading style books, saving money every month and then teaching myself to be ok with spending that money, successful and unsuccessful shopping trips, plenty of thrifting, scouring online sales, swapping with friends, cataloging everything and building outfits via the app StyleBook. I did a lot of online shopping this year and there were some truly awesome sales so I was able to truly round out my closet for much of this year. I finally have it in a good spot.  My style skews very classic and preppy and timeless, so a lot of what I have in my closet will be in style for years. I couldn't be more happy with how it looks; it's easily mixed and matched and because I spent over three years building it slowly, much of it is also tailored and bought thoughtfully. I will add little things here and there, but for now, and for the first time ever, I am content with it!	episode_done:True

text:One thing about them is that their clothes have _heft_. Everything, even t-shirts, are way thicker than a lot of other low-to-middle end stuff.

text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:I literally just spent a lot of time picking a “wedding guest” dress and one thing I tried to take into consideration was the fact that I don’t go to a lot of weddings, so I tried to nab something that will fit me through weight fluctuation since I plan to rewear it to weddings in the future. I also tried to aim for the middle ground between “covered enough to wear to a conservative wedding” and “not so dowdy I feel 30 years older than I am”. A wrap dress to the knee ended fitting this bill for me!
text:Agree with you on buying for weight fluctuations--the dresses that have lasted me through the years tend to either tie at the waist or are designed to be looser in the waist area. In my 20s I definitely gravitated toward more form fitting dresses and while I don't regret buying those at all, they are long gone... however if I found a sleeker fitting piece today for the right price and the right specific event, I probably wouldn't pass it up. But for future events TBD I definitely play it safe.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I did a complete wardrobe overhaul and at first was going to buy my items from regular online shopping like at J Crew and Banana Republic, but then I realized I could find those same items secondhand through Depop. I usually find online shopping to be a pain, but being able to search for specific essentials I need for my wardrobe and also scroll through and find unique vintage pieces made the process really entertaining. It turned out that I enjoyed this way more than regular shopping in stores!   The way I tackled it was I searched for specific items I needed that were essential to me (e.g. black velvet square neck top) and did my best to avoid fast fashion items that I knew weren't built to last. If I needed help visualizing a piece, I asked for a try-on pic, measurements of the bust/waist/hip/length to make sure it fit my body the way I wanted it to, and material content. It's nice too that I'm supporting a small business and oftentimes messaged with whoever I was buying for a bit to ask questions about the item and maybe haggle a bit, that social aspect was nice. Essentially 90% of my closet is secondhand from depop now after shopping over the course of a couple months and I love that I'm in love with every piece that I have and was able to curate each one to suit my needs.  It definitely takes some patience and a good eye for pieces/what materials are best, but I think that's far better than how I originally used to shop and has taught me a lot about how I'm allowed to be picky and absolutely love and enjoy my items, instead of buying things just because it's on sale even though I'm only lukewarm about it. You can find some really good deals and unique vintage pieces while saving money and saving clothing from landfills!	episode_done:True

Real leather lasts longer, faux leather is just plastic and I find it cracks and/or scuffs usually within a couple years. Granted, I haven't bought any luxury faux leather so maybe that would last longer. Also on the sustainability side I feel like real leather is better (although I'm sure it depends on processing and where it comes from)
text:Leather production is really terrible for the environment too, but since it lasts a looot longer and afaik is waaay more degradable, it's still by far the more environmentally friendly choice unless you purchase a whole lot of it.	labels:To add to this, there are places that offer vegetable dyes and make sure that the tanning process isn't bad for the workers and the environment.  You can also try to find brands that use recycled leather or use secondhand leather to lessen the environmental impact.   And ultimately, it will eventually biodegrade which is something I can't say about my peeling, sad faux leather jacket that I've only had for 3 years!	episode_done:True

text:BoF: J. Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:i just feel like their price points are so high and the quality can be kind of mediocre. they’re stuck in a weird place where their pricing is too expensive for the average consumer who’s trained to expect bargains and too cheap for someone who buys luxury or higher end pieces.   even with their random extra 50% off sales, it’s still above what people expect to pay. but then again, madewell is thriving. (though i think that has more to do with being able to capture an on-trend aesthetic.)
text:The wildest thing to me is that Madewell has really consistent sizing and I'm able to order online with confidence about what will fit. I have ordered a bunch of things and haven't needed to return or exchange a single one. By the end of last year, J. Crew was the most inconsistent sizing of any brand I think I've ever encountered. I could take 15 items of the same size into a dressing room and all 15 of them would fit like shit in totally different ways. It means online shopping is essentially unavailable to me - in this economy, no less. They've maintained those price points while spiraling out re: their supply chain.	labels:I feel like JCrew *used* to be more consistent. I used to have faith that a size 6 Perfect Shirt was, indeed, a perfect fit for me. I owned three of them in white alone. That hasn't been the case in recent years, and it's a shame.   Besides inconsistent fit, there's also just been some bizarre merchandizing decisions. Last March, right before all this (gestures at 2020) went down, I went into a JCrew looking for work pants. I did not find a *single pair of full length pants.* I mean, I can understand gearing up for spring, but ... no pants? at all? Some decisions just don't make sense.
text:Yeah, I went in there looking for a classic, flattering suit a couple of years ago, which was something they used to do really well, and they didn’t have a single normal suit. They had some mess with an oversized double-breasted jacket and Capri-length pants, another with a ribbon on the jacket that you were supposed to tie into a bow instead of buttons.

text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I'd get a really nice piece of outerwear, either a coat in a quality material like wool or a leather or shearling jacket. If you live somewhere with colder weather during part of the year, outerwear is something you'll be wearing all the time so it's worth investing in a piece that's great quality, keeps you warm and makes a statement. I think an amazing jacket or coat will elevate even the most basic outfit, whether it's a more classic piece, something utilitarian like a puffer jacket or something more extravagant. Personally I think Acne, Chloe and Tibi are brands that make great high-end outerwear in a variety of styles.
text:I second this! My aunt gifted me an all saints leather jacket as a graduation/first job gift and it’s been amazing to have in my closet.

text:Bruce Boyer on Finding Your Wardrobe and Sustainability in Fashion – Put This On (Derek Guy )	labels:i wish articles like this avoided the "expensive clothes sustainability" trope. the systems that lead to people being able to drop several thousand on a suit are inherently not sustainable, and i would love to see more discussion like that in the last question where consumption itself is addressed. imo the answer will involve more people taking responsibility for the origin of their own clothing with a focus on local labor and materials
text:Maybe this theme isn't foregrounded as much as you or I might like, but Boyer is clearly aware of it; he knows he was lucky enough to buy many of his clothes when they were modestly priced and that "decent ready-to-wear clothes are now available in  such a profusion of styles, quality, and the price I can’t imagine it  necessary to spend one’s whole salary on outfits. ... \[Besides,\] it’s just been in the modern age, an age of corporate commercial  consumerism, in which we’ve turned our backs on the idea that the world  is finite. ... we must examine and re-think the relationship between democracy and capitalism to encourage more sustainable lifestyles."	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it’s typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it’s a bottom, they no longer “stay up”. This usually happens with leggings or panties after about 5 or more years of regular wear with caring for the items properly.  I also had a faux leather jacket wear out after 6 years of regular wear. The faux leather ended up “peeling off” or something like that.
text:I just had a jacket peel like that. I'm bummed bc it was one of my favorites. I'd like to try and stop the peeling if I can so I've been hanging on to it and not wearing it!	labels:Honestly there's no way to really stop the peeling short of sewing a patch over the entire affected area so nothing rubs against it (I've had a lot of jackets/pants that did that and nothing seems to work). It will still peel in other places eventually but you could get a bit more time out of it that way.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: What is the difference between off the rack (OTR), made to measure (MTM) and Bespoke?	labels:/u/blackstrider has a great TL;DR but I'll add a bit more detail to MTM and Bespoke.  MTM: The pattern/style is generally pretty fixed, often there aren't fittings, and you make adjustments by changing standard measurements like "I want to add 0.5" to the leg opening". Pretty flexible format but I find it takes a couple of garments to really figure things out which can be tough.  Bespoke: Often a pattern is created for *you*, there are multiple fittings (in-person). This is where you can get really specialized tailoring looking at the pitch of you arms, how much you round your shoulders, etc. Bespoke tailors/cordwainers will also have styles that they specialize in so don't go to a tailor that specializes in structured "English drape" if you're looking for a casual unlined jacket or something.
text:The pattern is fixed, but the style... isn't, it just isn't. Maybe there are some style options you don't have with some MTM shops, but quite a few give you almost all the style options you could want.  You don't have fittings, but, to be fair, you have remakes, and that's not all that different.	labels:I think we're just off a bit semantically. OTR/MTM/Bespoke can vary a lot depending on who's doing it. Especially with MTM. You're right that most MTM shops will let you customize quite a bit of things and have lots of options. But there are some that don't.   If a company for example doesn't offer ghurka pants then you can't MTM that into the pattern. There can also be limits on what measurements you can change/adjust.
text:Right, I'm not saying the styling options are infinite. I just don't think it's right to say that styles are "fixed." I mean, even the range of fit options you have available to you would make for a bunch of differnt styles. But I mean... Every MTM suit shop I've been at, and every online service I've looked through. lets you pick SB/DB, lapel style, buttons, pleats, side adjusters... That's the low end, and that's a lot of styling details. And a lot of MTM shops *will* do Ghurkas, if you ask nicely.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:WDYWT ? (Why Did You Wear That?)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:Pretty much all my shoes are either black or white. When I do wear more statement shoes, I either match them to one of the colors in the outfit, or wear only neutral colors with the shoe being the pop of color.	episode_done:True
text:Thank all of you	labels:So a number of people are telling you not to buy a bunch of AE shoes because they are “entry-level” and that you may eventually want to move up in price. This is true, but consider that anyone saying this has become a hobbyist who appreciates and collects high-end footwear, and therefore retroactively views AE as a gateway drug that led them to discover a new hobby. This implies a linear progression from spending $350 on shoes — an amount 98% of men would find insane — to eventually spending $1000+ on shoes, which is completely bonkers to all but a very small number of people.  Definitely wait a bit and avoid buying a dozen pairs of AEs too quickly. But also consider that if AE makes you happy and your goal is to amass a rotation of multiple good-quality shoes in different styles and colors, it’a perfectly acceptable to avoid leveling up. You don’t *have* to keep buying progressively more expensive stuff, and can instead enjoy what’s in a price tier you’re comfortable with.
text:This I think is where I am and thank you for the thoughts.   I need at least six pairs of shoes for daily wear. With that requirement I will soon have one pair of shoes that’s even the right size. So buying a stable of AE’s to get started seems reasonable.   I doubt I will ever really be a collector, and the idea of spending $1,000 for a pair of shoes still feels insane. But owning a base line of shoes that don’t hurt sounds well worth replacing my current shoes with AE’s even if there are other good options out there.	labels:check out preston on elegant oxford where he links a ebay sellar who lists AE for a fraction for what you would pay in store. Look secondhand since there is plenty of options there which are barely worn.	episode_done:True
text:Fashion Favorites	labels:Definitely wool coats—the longer the better, preferably with nice sharp shoulders and a big collar that stays up if you pop it. Blazers, too: anything with strong shoulders, a nipped waist and a slightly longer length.   Silk scarves and vintage clip on earrings—I have a bit of an obsession with both. The combination can dress up a lazy outfit in seconds, in a way that's appropriate for any occasion.  Flowy midi skirts and dresses, especially pleated or wrap-around designs. Much more comfortable than jeans, and eye-catching, too.  Blouses: button-front silk shirts, cotton Liberty prints, and anything white/cream with lace or ruffles.  And because we're still in a pandemic...silk satin face masks. I've actually enjoyed matching them to my outfits!

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 18, 2020	labels:Recently got some Cole Haan bit loafers. Usually wear an 8 1/2 dress shoe some 81/2 wides and 9 1/2 running shoe. Tried them on and I have to use a shoe horn to get them on and could not wear them sockless only with socks. Not sure if it's cause I need to go a size up to a 9 or get 8 1/2 wide or stick with the ones I got and maybe they just need to be broken in. I still feel a lot of room between my toe and end of the shoe though, the heel is the only part that rubs once I put it on and walk in it, it feels a lil tight top to down wise too kinda like a glove like feeling. I attached some pictures of the fit, my toe hits at that rounded lip line near the end so about .75 of an inch or so of space so I don't think going a size up would help. What do you all think?

text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:Good personal grooming-  neat hair, clean teeth/breath, “nails covered by at least clear nail polish” etc, Clothing- tailored, looks neat (no wrinkles, lint, excessive pilling, etc） Bags / shoes- I think these can really elevate an outfit, but remember even if your bag is $$$$ it still needs to be neat/ not too visibly worn out.  “Walking with confidence” is also important.   I think that Aly Art and Merriam style are good sources for finding your style.. Anna Bey’s channel I think is good for learning about modern elegance and at the very least self confidence, “living life to your fullest” and self respect even if you aren’t preparing to have formal dinners with a kind every evening or having an expensive lifestyle. I don’t know of other sources for “modern elegance”..   Knowing what lines and colors look good on you also makes a difference in your appearance.	episode_done:True

Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:i just feel like their price points are so high and the quality can be kind of mediocre. they’re stuck in a weird place where their pricing is too expensive for the average consumer who’s trained to expect bargains and too cheap for someone who buys luxury or higher end pieces.   even with their random extra 50% off sales, it’s still above what people expect to pay. but then again, madewell is thriving. (though i think that has more to do with being able to capture an on-trend aesthetic.)

text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:I tend to purchase from Old Navy, Target, and various mall brands most often. I get pretty good longevity out of most of what I buy. I especially like to get athletic wear from Old Navy. My current supply of compression shorts/leggings from Old Navy are from 2016.  These are some of my longest lived items from fast fashion.  Fleece fall coat from TJ Maxx - 2012 - This was my go-to coat for chilly weather for several years. Now I just wear it for an extra layer on cold hikes, but it's still in really good condition. Has a couple of burn marks on the sleeve from bonfires though.  Running shorts (Nike knock-offs) from Wal-Mart - 2012 - I bought 2 pairs when I started running back then and 1 pair finally failed on me this past week (thread came out of the decorative piping). These have been a godsend during my pregnancy this summer (comfy elastic band for my growing stomach) and I've actually bought 4 more pairs off Poshmark to keep them in my rotation.  Navy blue trouser slacks from New York & Co. - 2014 - I bought these shortly after starting my first job after college. Wore them a lot at that first job, not as much at my second since I could wear jeans instead.	episode_done:True
text:Favorite brands to thrift?	labels:Not really about brands, but I love going through the outerwear section for both men and women.

The stuffs from these brands before 2000 have the coolest colors and fits. Fun designs sometimes too	episode_done:True
text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:Organize & clean everything I already own before I buy.   For example, if I want to buy another pair of jeans & a top, I do my laundry and put it all away and have my closet looking uncluttered. Often I just want the feeling of something clean & new. It also helps me purchase items I might actually wear more often because as I put items away I think about how much I enjoy/wear them and why	episode_done:True

Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.

text:Thank all of you	labels:Do not do what you are thinking about doing in the last part of your post. You are experiencing the beginner's high; you found something new and exciting and want to replace everything with it. One common rookie mistake for people that are new but not limited to fashion is to throw everything away and buy a completely new wardrobe only to regret it down the road because when the high went down, they realize they did not really enjoy some of the pieces.  You need time to process and enjoy your first part of AE. Let the initial 'honeymoon phase' calm down and see if you really like shoes. If you do and want to spend money, there are thousands of great shoe brands ($$-$$$) that you can read up on /r/goodyearwelt. AE is just a starting point.
text:As I mentioned to another poster I am going to give it some time to make sure. But at this point I am less trying to go ‘all in’ on AE than I really never want to put on my old shoes again. I wear dress shoes to work every day plus a few evenings for work commitments. Assuming the ones delivered are as comfortable to wear as the ones in the store my choices would be keep wearing painful shoes most of the time or spend a bit on AE’s.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I often buy multiples of items I love. I bought several of the same cardigan after I realized that I wore it more than any other sweater I owned. It's great!  Another thing I do is, when I see an item I like, I mentally run through my closet and see if it will mesh with what I already own. If it works, I get it. If I'd have to buy several new items to make it work, I don't. For this reason, I don't own many t-shirts, but I do own lots of sweaters and dresses.
text:That’s the biggest life lesson I’ve carried on from one of my high school teachers - if you find you truly love an item of clothing, it’s worth the time to go back and get it in every color (that’ll fit your wardrobe).

Those are some clues to your style.   2 - if you follow fashion bloggers or general fashion posts, ask yourself why you follow them. There is a likelihood that you follow them because you like their look/style.    Now, with more insight into what style you currently have and styles you aspire to have, you may get closer to defining your style. Don't feel too bad if you can't explicitly name it (ie: preppy, vintage, casual, etc). Your personal style is more nuanced and probably a combination of multiple categories.

text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:Volume (a lot of items) and access (lots of designer things) doesn't create personal style. Personal style creates personal style, and it is a huge spectrum of things. There is no "one up" in personal style when it is authentic and your own. You'd simply appreciate all the style around you as its own, and appreciate and focus on your own style and look. Most people on social media have tacky, pointless style. They're wearing clothing, etc. for likes and clicks. The problem with this is that it means you're always cycling through what generates likes and clicks - not what is unique and stylish about you. You don't need new clothes. You don't need to change. You need to recognize your style and own it, and find the validation in it how it comes versus mirroring/measuring it to someone who is operating for validation and attention.	episode_done:True

I am definitely not planning to wear low rise anything again, but I would wear boleros, the mod influenced stuff, shiny and space print fabric, and bootcut jeans with tunics again. I don't want to dress like or be 2004 ModestMalka again, but I feel that I can dress like a woman my age would have dressed at that time instead.  You're 23 though, that's the perfect age for this stuff.

Viridian goes with mustard. Pink goes with mustard. So on and so forth. Some colors will look good on you, and some won’t, so, the best way to incorporate colors is to just try colors on.

text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I don't have a prescribed budget that I stick to, but I try my best to ensure I max out my generous 401k match and other accounts provided from my employer. I have a certain amount I keep stashed away as an emergency fund if I can't work for several months, some for paranoia from being raised lower-income and some for the fact that I live in a HCOL area. Other than that, I am super flexible with how I spend my money, which is ~dangerous~. Luckily, fashion and food are my only pricey hobbies. I'm really privileged to be in this position with a rewarding job and understand that this is not the norm for many.  I got a substantial promotion and raise this last summer, so I definitely have been overspending this year as I try to ramp my wardrobe back to my ideal self, rather than my more practical self; I was also purchasing a limited number of pieces since I was in a client-facing role making half as much. I moved from buying clothes on the more affordable spectrum (mainly pre-scandal Everlane, and KOTN) to buying pricier pieces, usually in the pre-owned designer spectrum (mainly bags, shoes, and outerwear ranging from $200-$3000). I'm finally scaling back by having a curated wishlist and aiming to resell any unused pieces (easier said than done).	episode_done:True

I usually spent at minimum 1 month and maximum 6 months, it’s usually 3 months.   When I pack I only take 2 weeks worth of clothes. I like you and NOT a minimalist. But when I pack I make sure things are all mix and match, sort of a capsule. That doesn’t mean I don’t have a few louder pieces, I just make sure that it will go with a few other things. Like a crazy top can go with pants, a skirt and the jacket. I always have a scarf and hat.   Look into extra baggage from the airline. I often check luggage for work, in excess to my personal luggage. Work pays for it. I’m taking west coast US to India, west coast US to eastern Africa long flights. It is usually around $200US, which is a lot, but for a year it might be worth it you. Also you can ship things via UPS, DHL etc. they do less expensive freight options. I work with people who will ship personal things ahead of them.

text:Is anyone dressing up this year for Halloween?	labels:I usually go to my local goth club on Halloween, dress up ridiculously and dance all night. That is absolutely not happening this year, so I have opted to dress up ridiculously and drink for free at home.    2020 has been a complete wash as a year, but I haven't put on makeup or heels in 8 or 9 months. I'm hoping dusting off my vanity will cheer me up at least a little. Last year I wore a very involved angel costume, but since I'm not going out I'm just going to put on my much more comfortable bunny costume.
text:I completely agree with you. This has been the pits.  I WFH most of the time and I have started to get dressed up, make up, and a few times have even worn heels, to bring some normalcy in to the picture LOL  I also haven't seen many places pushing Halloween costumes and other gear like previous years. I bet they are all hurting too. Which really sucks.   Love that you are going to be in a comfy costume. I just found out that a few friends of mine are having a virtual Halloween party.

text:General Discussion - December 20, 2020	labels:what's on ya'll's mind
text:I'm so young compared to the average MFA poster. Like we got people with careers and families on here and an awful amount of you are older than my dad while I'm on Christmas break from what would be high school in the US just fucking around with my unlimited free time.      Also it's crazy that there's people desperately trying to keep in touch with the youth (e.g. marketing departments) while I'm part of what LITERALLY defines what it means to be in touch with the youth. In 40 years they'll be looking back on today and I define what it is they look back on. It'll be really weird to have people my age in positions of power and I'll probably be constantly jealous of everyone cause they'll have done more with their time.      Also also I wonder if designers are gonna reference the youth culture of now in the future. Like Raf and Undercover have made punk and rave influenced clothes recently, will some future designer make DIY thrift-flip skater and e-boy/alt girl influenced clothes 30 years from now? Will that Celine E-boy collection be an important relic of this era? Are those IG brand album artwork 1 of 1 tapestry shirts gonna be in a museum some day? Is some designer gonna bring back the skinny jeans longline tee 2015 Kanye aesthetic as a deliberate callback?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Best way to buy clothes locally?	labels:In the Before Times, my family made a habit of attending the local fairs and farmers markets, which was a great way to find local jewelry and something I really miss.

It's also worth hitting up wherever Main Street/the old part of your city is.  It can be pricey sometimes, but it's a good method of finding local sellers.	episode_done:True

If anyone know’s what brand this is pls let me know!! thank you :)	episode_done:True
text:Future of fibers?	labels:Personally I don’t find it very difficult or expensive to shop for clothing made with natural fibers — if anything it’s gotten even easier to do so with online shopping and websites showing fiber content right in the product description. I don’t have to seek out brands that specialize in natural materials either — my clothing is mostly from Madewell, which doesn’t really market itself as being all that environmentally conscious or sustainable, and is definitely not a high end brand, but they have tons of options for clothing made of cotton, silk, etc.   I will say it’s gotten harder to find sweaters made of 100% wool over the years, however. I have several wool sweaters from mall brands that I bought just a few years ago. I gained some weight since then and have been looking for replacements from the same exact brands and it seems like they don’t even bother with 100% wool anymore, all of their sweaters are now made with acrylic, nylon, polyester, etc. That’s the only natural fiber that I feel has all but disappeared from the mainstream for some reason.   I will also add that I don’t think man made fibers are necessarily “cheap”, either. We’ve come a long way from man made materials of the 80s and 90s. When I think of man made fibers of today, I think of technical clothing and gear such as outdoor or sportswear. Patagonia for example is the poster child for environmentally friendly brands, but most of their clothing is made from man made materials, and their products are far from cheap. Partly because it performs better for its purpose, and partly because it’s supposed last a lifetime.  Which leads me to my last thought — IMO man made materials aren’t necessarily bad for the environment. It’s really our habits that are bad, and the industries that cater to these habits. If we all bought a few items of clothing that were all man made and lasted our lifetime, that is arguably *more* environmentally friendly than if we were constantly buying and throwing away natural fibered clothing.
text:I think there's a very good reason for 100% wool sweaters being harder to find: wool is a very weak fiber, difficult to care for, and itchy. Cutting it with other fibers makes clothing that is more wearable, increases longevity, and minimizes all those negatives.	labels:That makes sense. Unfortunately for me synthetic fabrics in non-technical clothing tend to make me incredibly sweaty. Wool works better at regulating my temperature while being breathable and moisture wicking.	episode_done:True

If you get rid of all your meh work clothes would you be stressed out over buying a new wardrobe when you're called back to the office? If so, just go the purge-n-store route.

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:I had an accident earlier this year and now have a slow-healing wound on my knee that won’t close up. I have to wear a dressing on it, so tight jeans are a no-go. I got into the habit of dressing down every day, at first because of the pain, which was unpleasant for the first few weeks, and then because I felt down about the injury (and Covid-life in general).  It was a bit of a revelation when I realised some of the more interesting trousers in my wardrobe are perfectly fine to wear, as they accommodate the dressing. It’s been reassuring to know that even if my body isn’t moving in the same way as before, I can still get dressed up if I want to. There’s definitely some restorative power in pulling on a decent outfit from time to time.
text:I had a similar no jeans allowed dilemma! I have a medical problem that makes tight pants/denim not an option (except the occasional legging day). At first that meant I had wear the few pairs of androgynous-looking joggers which is a fun style but started to make me feel really frumpy and sad having to wear them every day. Now I’ve built up some trousers that look more put together and have a loose fit and conveniently usually an adjustable waistband, which has worked great for my recent weight gain. As a result I’ve also become much fonder of tight tops to balance out the looser pants.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Hi! Former stylist.  1) Pay attention to the fit of things and figure out what cuts and shapes look good on you. Paper bag pants and some joggers have similar fits. Some mini skirts and shorts hit the same place on your legs and can have the same waist height. Find your sweet spot and don’t be afraid to buy multiple things in silhouettes that work for you.   2) Get some statement pieces that you would die for. If you are wearing a pair of jeans that fit well and a t-shit purchased within the past 3 years with some awesome earrings you going to look and feel great. If you are wearing an amazing dress and simple white sneakers you are going to look and feel great. Don’t overthink things but try and wear at LEAST one piece you are excited about at a time.   3) Don’t buy things just cause they are on sale, you saw your friend wearing it, or you feel like you “need” something in your wardrobe. You should love everything in your closet in its own special way unless it’s workwear and you hate your dress code for work. Something as simple as a T-shirt has so many different factors like cut, material, neckline, sleeve length. Purchase what feels good and don’t bother with the rest.
text:For 1. What pants do you recommend for people who are thin but carry a bit more weight in the core (stomach and butt) instead of their legs and thighs.	labels:It’s hard to say. Even for people who put on weight in the core does it go “out” or “sideways”? Everybody’s body is so different. It’s hard to tell what looks good without trying on different things but usually people are a pretty good judge of what “works” once they find it! Just keep an open mind and be willing to take stuff into a dressing room. A big butt or rounded stomach/hips can be sexy! If you are looking to “hide” something however a good trick is to split it up -ie. layering or accessorizing with a belt, jacket, longer necklace etc.	episode_done:True
text:Fall Jacket Recommendations	labels:A great all season jacket that fits a lot of different styles is the Lawson trench coat from aritzia! Not cheap, but lasts a long time, drapes nice. They also have cute shackets if you want something more casual.
text:I've been lusting over the ganna shacket for like, ever. I'd love to find it secondhand since the price is just a tad out of my budget for something I probably wouldn't wear every single day.	labels:I’ve seen some on Poshmark before! I know, it’s so cute, they made a long version this year which I loved too and it seems to be not on the website right now so I wonder if it sold out immediately	episode_done:True

text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:Not a lot of people still wear hats, but I keep hearing that many people *wish* they were still stylish to wear... so please feel free to help make hats fashionable again!  Typical etiquette for hat wearing is that if it's a very small decorative hat--something that stays close to the head--you may wear it indoors, but if it's a larger hat, you take it off indoors.  With something like a cloche or beret, which isn't exactly tiny but also isn't oppressively huge, it follows nearly the same rules as a coat:  If you're just popping by on an errand, it's fine to keep it on, but if you're planning to stay a while, you should take it off.  This is especially true if you're visiting a place of hospitality--a friend or relative's home, for example, or a restaurant--where somebody is offering comfort and relaxation, keeping your hat/coat on might be seen as a rejection of their hospitality.
text:I knew that about decorative hats. I’m not brave enough for something like that! Hat pins seem fiddly also.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:Honestly I think you have to give way more detail on your old pair and what you’re looking for.  In my mind the biggest hurdle to perfect jeans is the fit, and since every body is different this is highly individual. Some people might prefer stretchier denim for a more forgiving fit, while others look for stiffer fabric, and have less leeway.   Personally I still struggle to find a high rise, non cropped, fits my thighs and waist, plain dark wash, straight/skinny, 90% or more cotton, pair of jeans. But hopefully I’ll find it eventually!
text:Levis premium 501 high rise skinny (99% cotton with the button fly) - the cut for this season is more straight than truly skinny despite the name. I picked up 3 pairs in the sales recently. Immediately trying them on they look a bit loose in the lower leg and a bit tight in the hip & thigh but after wearing for one day they've relaxed and conformed to my body and look perfect. I do advise sizing down - the size chart said 28 for me but I had to exchange for 25 (25" is my actual waist size if that helps).	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 17, 2020	labels:Do you think Flannel shirts are a must? And if so why??  I'm a 27 year old guy, mostly wearing hoodies, since, well it seems to be the only thing that i can wear without looking weird, but i noticed nearly everyone has a flannel shirt.
text:Definitely not.  That said, if you are 27 and you think hoodies are the only thing that doesn't look weird, that's on you, not other people. A flannel is a perfectly good completely casual shirt that an adult man can wear. It's of the same level of casual as a hoodie. So maybe try it out!  Edit for autocorrect	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What’s your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:Lace trimmed camisoles under V neck sweaters, warm tights, and realizing that if you arent using public transportation you arent usually outside and trying to look cute for more than 5 minutes at a time. I stopped doing a lot of layering and just got a couple of coats for the various weather to put over things I like to wear inside. Being sweaty inside your coat is the worst.   Dressing to wait for the bus/train is a different story.

text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:I don’t plan to save any. Sounds terrible but after the pressure I got from my mom and MIL to wear some of their own wedding stuff I am just going to live my life and let my kids live theirs. Sure they might miss out on some vintage stuff but there’s no guarantee that my stuff will become cool again, that my things won’t be damaged by mold, bugs, yellowing etc. in decades of storage, or that they will be the same size as me
text:Fair enough. With Asian weddings there are often multiple events and clothes are so expensive that no one in my family has gotten rid of them. Also, Pakistani clothes are pretty much always tailored so they're bespoke too. But this means that you can usually upcycle something and reuse it to suit new fashion which I get isn't as much of an option with Western wedding dresses.	labels:I had both an Asian and a Western wedding. Western dresses can be tailored too but it didn’t need much tailoring to fit me, I just didn’t like the styles or fabric at all. Super Shiny Satin TM was very in-in the late 80s😅
text:In my experience Asian clothes can be totally remade or at least the expensive neckline with beaded work for example can be reused, the lenghaa can be reused, the kameez can be altered to suit the fashion and paired with something different whereas a white wedding dress is probably always going to be a dress.	labels:Sometimes people use lace generational wedding dresses to make veils or accessories - it's less common but still very possible! That could be an option for someone whose mother wore a lace monstrosity lol	episode_done:True
text:Dr. Biden's embroidered Oscar de la Renta Dress was beautiful - What's your favorite brand that utilizes embroidery?

The costume designer was very deliberate about the choice of using texturized and embroidered fabric as an embodiment of the world-building. If you’ve seen the costuming you’ll see what I mean!	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I used to get heaps of stuff at the men's as well. Some  pieces are much nicer when made for them, don't ask me why.  Just go there and if you feel uncomfortable you can always say you have to try them on in order to see whether it fits your husband/partner/boyfriend/etc.   I actually did this many times, including for my dad, bc I knew how it shd look on me in order to fit them (sleeve length, shoulders etc).  Staff shd not really care, I guess -?   Imho, trousers are a bit trickier but I have bought men's shorts and pants as well, you just have to check them out and see....

I love it because it’s a pretty tiny bag— perfect for me since I don’t need to carry any makeup around because I don’t wear it! I couldn’t focus at work with all that cake on my face, I don’t know how those other girls do it. they probably aren’t hitting their performance targets like I am!

text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I’m Op but I’ll share mine -  At around 14 I had a quick phase of really liking the very early sort of e- kid bright and trendy fashion. Hot topic forever 21 sort of edgy stuff. Skinny jeans only. Small wardrobe. Didn’t look great and got bullied a little for my new look. Lowkey wanted to look like a gorillaz character. Still kinda do though lol.  Then there was a transitional trendy masculine street wear phase from when I was late 14 to late 15 . I only really wore ripped jeans, graphic tees , always a belt , with vans or converse that matched the shirt. I started getting of compliments on my style from peers.  I then had an art kid style phase late 15 - 16 years old . Very similar to before but I started adding different style jackets and pants. This was an important phase because I started adding different accessories like print socks and hair stuff.   Really quick 90’s inspired phase. I tried dressing like 90’s Britpop singers lol. A small step back I’d say.   Late 16 to current ( I’m seventeen ) changed my style over quarantaine . Asking questions here changed everything. I realized how much I loved my more dressy clothes and fell in love with the l’ecole des femmes clothes. I stopped following trends and went for mature more romantic and currently Victorian styles. Man repeller slightly masculine inspiration too. I wear skirts, tights , blazers, dresses, hats, neck scarves and blouses now. I also sold my years worth of converse and vans to buy oxfords and heeled dress shoes. Though my peers understand it a little less I have never been happier. Very confident in my style currently.    [Quick note - It may seem crazy to change my style so quickly but when your young you tend to go through clothes more quickly as you grow and teens tend to be more rough on clothes ]   Thank you for reading : )
text:>I also sold my years worth of converse and vans to buy oxfords and heeled dress shoes.  Without sounding like I'm generalising, I really admire this! It's probably not common for that age group but IMO it's a great move towards the current style you speak of, not to mention quite sophisticated.  Are you a fan of the brogue style? And for the heeled dress shoes what kind of style/height have you started off with?  Incredible journey with more twists and turns to come I'm sure!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your tips for dressing a big chest!	labels:As someone in a similar position, I avoid collars that are super high necked or super low. When I worked as a host and had to wear a lot of blouses I wore ones that were a size or two up (mostly to avoid button holes popping open) that could be styled in a French tuck with a tighter jean or pant. Similarly I’ll pair a tighter legging with a loose sweater or sweatshirt, so it’s not entirely frumpy but I’m not wearing something super tight across my chest. Lately I’ve been enjoying layering a nicer fitting cardigan or flannel over a half turtleneck, which doesn’t feel as oversized but the layering also takes some of the focus away from my breasts. When I don’t want to wear a tight pant I’ll wear high waisted sweats or joggers with a looser crop top, so even though it’s all loose comfy clothing it doesn’t feel as frumpy. For dresses I favor ones that are just a little loose but also come in around my waist, so there’s a bit of an hourglass shape to help seem proportional, but again it isn’t super tight.	episode_done:True

text:Guidance organizing a suit for my fiancé for his father's funeral during lockdown	labels:In this case, you're not going to be able to find an exact match for the jacket fabric to turn it into a suit, so we're looking at a somber odd jacket w/trousers look.  To keep things somber, a dark, muted, monochrome palette would be my choice. I'd recommend a white shirt, dark matte grey tie with minimal pattern (could be a grey Glen check if you can find that).   For trousers, I'd avoid navy since it doesn't work that well as an odd trouser colour. Go with a pair of grey trousers a shade or two distinctly darker or lighter. Try a pair of charcoal or mid-grey wool flannel trousers, and pair that with black shoes. He'll get a ton of use out of those trousers in the future since they'll go with almost any kind of jacket as a blank slate. The jacket should be ok — any shininess will contrast with the flannel trousers, but that's actually what you're looking for with an odd jacket/trouser combo.   I applaud you for thinking and planning in advance for him; you seem like a great fiancée.

Buy less clothing and go to the gym instead." He was right.
text:That's probably the single most recognizable quote of his outside diehard avant-garde fashion circles. It needs some contextualizing though. Like everything else, you have to consider where the speaker is coming from. Rick is addicted to working out. He's on steroids. His addiction is understandable because before he got into working out he was doing drugs and was, by his own admission, on a very unhealthy path. His wife got him into working out instead. But he's effectively swapped one addiction for another. Working out is generally one of the best things you can do for your health, but not when you're pushing 60 and regularly taking steroids. When it comes to that Rick quote, it's worth knowing that he's not speaking from a well-balanced position.  All that is to say, the general spirit of the quote is solid advice. But Rick Owens is probably not a good authority on moderation, which as with all activities, should be a part of your workout routine.	labels:Can I get a source on that?

text:The joy of cordovan—and how to wear and maintain it	labels:Cordovan is an Instagram dream - it’s lustrous and has a ton of color depth. Unfortunately I find  actually wearing it is a different story. It’s extremely stiff and inflexible, especially during the first 20-30 wears. It’s the coldest leather I’ve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I’ve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I’m glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there’s no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.
text:Spotting is certainly a common complaint and I can see how it diminishes people’s enjoyment of shell boots. I live in a place with 250 days with rain per year and wear mine in all weather conditions (except old snow as I’m afraid of the salts). I have some semi-permanent spots on faded ravello, but have accepted them as part of the patina. My color 8, black and cigar shoes all deal really well with rain and mud and I find them much easier to clean than calf skin/cow hide boots. Now that I think of it, maybe there’s so much rain here that they now have ’even‘ stains. Shell shoes can be enjoyed as heavy beaters, I believe.	labels:	episode_done:True

I’m not exactly going out anywhere, but I try to wear clothes that make me really happy to be awake and doing things. And I’ve been consuming a lot of fashion media, history, shows, etc because some clothes—including a lot of these!—are so engaging even just over the screen.
text:Interesting. I’m exploring nostalgia to the nth degree this year. I love the past reimagined for today. I love making and wearing looks that remind me of ones I dreamt of as a kid, but reinvented for today. I don’t agree that nostalgia is inherently bad or backward thinking.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I work in an engineering office, where the men usually wear a dress shirt + pants Mon-Thu and khaki + polo on Fri. My interpretation of “casual Friday” isn’t necessarily dressed down, but showing more of my personal style. I usually wear neutral coloured blouse + skirt, and on Fridays wear the same type of outfit but with a brighter colour and/or louder pattern, with bolder accessories.   Eg. Thursday is blue striped button down shirt and black pencil skirt. Friday is buttoned up Kelly green cardigan with a panda brooch, and shorter houndstooth a-line skirt.	episode_done:True

Enough of that this time around and the trend will cycle to something else.  signed,  someone who dealt with many, many ripped jean legs.
text:I vividly remember wearing my too-long-baggy jeans on a rainy day, during a late night out with friends. They ripped all the way up to almost my knee. The next day I used a line of safety pins to hold that pant leg together and thought it was  socool because there were similar pants at Hot Topic.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: Let's Talk About Purses	labels:I make ten million dollars a year at my wall street job BUT I only have one purse from madewell because I like to be humble unlike certain women I see with multiple fancy expensive purses (no judgement!! just not the way I was raised :)).  I love it because it’s a pretty tiny bag— perfect for me since I don’t need to carry any makeup around because I don’t wear it! I couldn’t focus at work with all that cake on my face, I don’t know how those other girls do it. they probably aren’t hitting their performance targets like I am!   I also love that it’s vegan— I wouldn’t want to do any harm to my fellow living beings! anyway gtg, I have to go sell bets on the value of someone’s family home :).

text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I have three or four distinct styles. Most of the time I like wearing dark, edgy punk-inspired clothes. However, I’m a style chameleon. If I need to be professional, I have a whole separate wardrobe of high-quality suiting. Take out my piercings, and I’ll have anyone fooled that that’s the realest me. In the summer and family gatherings I often wear more earthy boho and beachy surfer looks. Fashion is a great tool for self-expression, matching the mood, and setting the mood.
text:I'm convinced that there's something deeper than just boho styled, edgy, punk, professional styled etc. that we find ourselves liking, that creates our style.   Like music. There's something deeper than simply genre that makes me like a song. It's not genres that define my music taste. It's a combination of all my songs I like that creates my taste.	labels:I agree.  I generally like solid colors, for example (for each individual thing, not necessarily the whole outfit).  That can go with a lot of different styles though.	episode_done:True
text:Reigning Champ Hoodie: 2 months later	labels:I have 3 hoodies/crewnecks from them + 4 tees and they've last 2 winters already. The tees get most wears and has some pills (mostly because I put them in dryer) but the collar is still in perfect shape.  I'd say you most likely beat it too hard or snag it somewhere.

If not then could anyone reccomend a good brand that won't advertise my nipples?

text:Jewelry trends for 2021	labels:I feel like delicate, minimalist jewelry in general is here to stay for a while longer among the general populous (I personally think minimalist gold jewelry is timeless). It's easy to maintain and it goes with any outfit; can be a day and night piece.  Might just be me, but I feel that high fashion is always trying to promote the big, bold, statement jewelry, which is fine! The way you describe your style mixed with the beautiful pieces you like, it sounds like it fits you to a T. Just not sure if it is trending that direction though. But I think that you should shrug off today's "standards" and wear what makes you feel happy and confident!
text:It’s also literally timeless if you are buying 14k/18k jewelry - it will last for years with the right care! Which also makes the delicate style more attainable in that regard - less gold material ($$$) needed.  I do think there will be some post-recession/depression like trends that will start emerge in 2021, but only to one or two items in an outfit. Like for some, it may be adding fun, costume jewelry and for others it might be reflected in flouncier dresses or statement bags, etc. It’s tough to predict and may not happen until after the vaccine reaches the majority, but I’m here to see it!	labels:Be careful about certain pieces, though. Some wear down over time and you can actually lose your stone/diamond (you should get your ring checked every couple of years if it has a prong setting).	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:In college I still shopped the juniors section and never imagined outgrowing it, taste wise.

text:What’s on everyone’s Black Friday wishlists?	labels:I had one item on my Black Friday wishlist and picked it up yesterday when the sale started-- a Fitbit Charge 4.  I bought 2 cute bands for it on Amazon and now I can't remove the OG one (there's a way, I just need the patience to figure it out).

text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:For the last few years I started tracking all of my spending. I then make an educated guess for what my budget should be for the upcoming year, based on past averages and predictions about what type of life events might be coming up that year.   Each paycheck, I set some money aside to my Girly Savings. This way, when I do a bunch of shopping or find an expensive item, it's not just coming out of my general spending money.   Currently I'm setting aside $400/month to my Girly Savings which includes clothes, makeup, skincare, hair and accessories. I buy most of my clothes in large batches in the spring and fall so it helps me to have an accumulated stash of cash.	episode_done:True
text:Recent Purchases - November 08	labels:A full yohji outfit. Hakama, long shirt, and all. Now to garner the courage to actually wear it in public lol.	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:Honestly, it started as a teenager because I don’t see myself as physically attractive, and so I felt like I could never pull off a simple look like jeans and a t shirt to feel pretty. My peers were developing and looked cute in anything, even gym class and I knew I was plain and uninteresting. So I thought if I had a unique sense of fashion people would pay attention to my clothes as my “appearance” rather than my looks.   Another piece was that growing up we couldn’t afford clothes for fashion (vs function) so I felt embarrassment when all my classmates had new clothes after the holidays and I was wearing the same thrifted clothes. Now that I have a solid income it’s something I am trying to cut back on, this compensating for my childhood complex lol. I have more than enough clothes (and love thrifting now) and donate regularly to charity and to friends who are interested.	episode_done:True
text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I have three basic outfits I go towards for casual Fridays depending on the time of year and plans:  * Long flowing maxi-dress with a longline blazer. With comfortable shoes. * Fitted Midi-dress. With comfortable shoes. * High waisted jeans, a dressy top/knit jumper depending on the weather and oversized blazer. With comfortable shoes.  All of the above are a marked improvement on my usual silk shirt, midi skirt, blazer and heels combo. I will note that I'm more inclined to go with either of the first two options. These are my preferred silhouettes.  I also go slightly bolder with my necklace choices. Instead of my usual gold Common Era necklace (which I wear every day), I go with my more colourful Lizzie Fortunado options.  My goal is to be my more colourful self, just a very polished version. With comfortable shoes.	episode_done:True
text:Trans-friendly fashion and brands?	labels:I'm not coming at this from an ethical perspective, so it is fast fashion. but I've had really positive experiences at Aerie (also transfem, not really passing). employees have been really helpful and no one bats an eye	episode_done:True

text:How has your style grown/changed since before quarantine?	labels:Months of not being seen by anyone has helped me become more confident in whatever I want to wear - regardless of what anyone thinks. I stopped thinking "what will so-and-so be wearing" or "will I look too dressed \[up/down\]" and started wearing what I actually felt like. That has spilled over into the "not lockdown" part of my life and I feel amazing, because I broke a bad cycle of caring what anyone thinks. Because of this, I feel like I've finally figured out what my style is.	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Let's talk about Fall!!!	labels:I put on my Doc Martens. If there aren't any crunchy leaves yet, I put coffee beans or dried pumpkin seeds in my boots to feel the cronch.    Doc Martens are useful since you can be the sexy witch and the crochety grandpa in them, depending on what you put on.

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:Capitalism has made us believe we can always buy our way out of problems--that consuming differently will fix the consumption problem. The true antidote, like others have said, is buying less and taking good care of the items you have and like (ethically sourced or not). I don't think there is much difference between Forever 21 and J Crew, just the price. No one is going to advertise "buy less", "wash your stuff gently!" because...how do you make money doing that?

text:I love heavy knits, I have way too many. I hear you, even though I'm in Southern Ontario.  It's 8 degrees (46) here, and all my windows are open so I don't sweat too much in my North Sea Clothing Diver.	labels:I have a lot of knits too. Cardigans, crewneck, turtleneck. I even recently got a 10 ply SEH Kelly crewneck that was said to wear only on the coldest days... It is shit that the temperature keeps rising over the years. :(
text:Woah that 10ply is insane. Please let me know how you like it! im tempted to save for one.	labels:I received it todat. Damnnn, it is SOFT. I would say it is probably close to cashmere in term of softness and how smooth it is. The knit is tight, and dense. It isnt as weighty as inverallan or so but i started to sweat 15 seconds after putting it on. I am on the bigger side of size small so size S fit slim on me. Up one of your usual size if you want a relaxed fit. The color is very hard to capture, i even thought the green look brown looking at the website but it is more green in real life than on picture, especially under the sun.

text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:This subreddit has a serious hate boner for synthetics and I will never understand why. It seriously depends on the fabric and the purpose of the garment. Not all rayon or viscose or polyester or nylon is the same. It's like you said, the Uniqlo heattech or their amazing wrinkle-free perfectly drapey rayon blouses are so good. Is all rayon wrinkle free or behave like that? lol no... Which is why you need to look at reviews or touch the material yourself. When you touch it, you can just tell it's good...  Not all "natural" materials are elegant or good either. Sometimes stuff like linen is so trash-bag wrinkly. Sometimes cotton/linen/silk really holds in the sweat and makes you stink, or forms sweat stains on your pits, whereas there's loads of moisture wicking poly athletic clothing or super expensive technical gear for hiking or professional sports which is designed for a specific purpose from synthetic material that keeps you ultra dry, ultra cool, whatever it may be. Poly is also good UPF protection from the sun. Some of my most expensive hiking gear is made from polyester. There is some clothing I own, which I can toss in the washing machine, and after the spin cycle, it's completely dry, without the dry rack.   Acrylics can be super itchy and pilly, or be super tightly woven, soft, and incredibly durable. It really depends. You can't just look at the label and put it away because "omg ew polyester 100%" you need to touch it, stretch it, scrape your nail against it to see how the fabric performs.   tl;dr There's loads of great high quality fabrics in all materials whether it's natural fiber or man-made and I don't really have any negative opinion of anything until I see it in person, and touch it and wear it and I don't think it should matter at all, so long as you personally like it
text:You make a great point about quality variances across all fibers. Even though I prefer natural fibers I have definitely eschewed linen pants from target because it's low quality, see through, and scratchy. I also hate how sometimes a cotton tee warps after washing because it wasn't prewashed prior to being cut and seen but that has more to do with the production of the garment rather than the fiber content, but it's still an example that not all natural fiber items are great (if not made well).	labels:	episode_done:True

I’m typically an avid leather jacket-wearer in the fall and winter months so I’m excited to incorporate the material in a different way this year.  Also just mixing and match different textures is something I love doing this time of the year considering I live in a relatively cold place (Colorado), so layering a bunch of different cozy fabrics is something else I’m excited for!	episode_done:True

Where should I be looking at getting new clothes from?  I'm looking for something that's fairly well fitted for someone that works out quite frequently and ideally something that is eco friendly. I am based in the UK.
text:The most eco-friendly thing is to thrift.  The best way to get a good fit is to:  * Get clothing bespoke (expensive but amazing)   * Get clothing made to measure (quasi-bespoke) * Get clothing that kind of fits and have it tailored.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:I feel this! I’ve grown up obsessed with stories like little women, Anne of green gables, and a little princess, so I’ve always had an affinity for feminine, old fashioned styles. They are so wholesome and pretty 🤩 I’m a little afraid to dress that way in public since it’s not the norm, but I have some flowy night gowns with lace and ribbons and such, and I wear them to bed. I also have bloomer shorts with lace that were custom made for me. They’re so pretty. I’ve been buying more flowy dresses with little floral detailing lately. I don’t have a lot of money to spend, so I mostly buy from online stores, but you can get lucky finds at thrift stores, some unique pieces from Etsy, or from a specialty shop that specifically sells vintage clothing. A lot of those types of stores are located in downtown stores, so I’d look there!	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I know my clothes weren't made with slave labour?	labels:As others have mentioned--you don't. The best way to avoid it is by thrifting since you're not adding to the demand for clothing production. A thrifted item could have been produced by slaves originally, sure, but your purchase of it doesn't contribute to that.  Also, contrary to what you might assume, in many cases companies that have gotten into trouble for abusing slave labor in the past are actually safer now. They overcorrect and invest in auditing to avoid the issue happening again. This only applies to companies who care about their brand in this way though, like Target.	episode_done:True

text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:I've found that cotton is best, with up to 5% spandex. It's not a sexy look, but cotton flannel pyjamas are very comfy and cause no skin issues for me. I also have a couple pairs of cotton-stretch joggers from Amazon for home wear, and a pair of truly ancient 100% viscose leggings (they're basically see through now, which is probably why they're so soft). Honestly I usually wear a cotton dress around the house though - I find anything tight-fitting on the legs can cause trouble.  For tights, Falke has always been more comfortable than average for me. I buy a size up, which seems to reduce the pressure and itching.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 16, 2021	labels:A dark and surreal week for me:     Accidentally went to the wrong floor for a meeting this week and stumbled across a sweatshop right here in beautiful New York, New York (the city so nice they named it the big apple), so this is your friendly reminder that "made in the USA" doesn't necessarily mean shit when it comes to ethically made clothing. Reported it to the DoL but I don't expect them to do anything about it.     In unrelated but equally bleak personal fashion news, In my search for some VERY obscure soviet-Czech trainers I accidentally stumbled across a sketchy forum of people selling battle-worn combat uniforms, complete with burns, bullet holes and blood stains. It's always fun to imagine you're living in a Blue Ant book until you actually start living in a blue ant book and life becomes very depressing! The first rule of the forum is you are not allowed to ask how these things were sourced.     Lastly the embroidery studio i work at was contacted for a large order of Rhodesian flag patches. I contacted the client to see if it was for a film or something and he was very cagey about their purpose, so I cancelled the order and refunded his deposit, which lead to me getting chewed out by my boss, who is apparently fine with making White Nationalist memorabilia if it's obscure enough to not get him in any trouble.
text:Really hope the labor board does something about it. What borough was it in?   People are fucked. My friends and I (mostly me) do deep dives on weird/fucked up forums and there is some heinous shit out there. Like, ACTIVE forums talking about wild shit.   My friend’s dad is from what used to be Rhodesia. I wasn’t aware that it was a WP symbol. Thanks for the head’s up. Nother thing to look out for.	labels:It was in the garment district. And yeah, the surface web is underrated as a truly vile place. This forum in particular I forwarded to bellingcat since it seems like there's probably several war criminals active on it. Your friend's dad is from Zimbabwe? or does he consider himself a "Rhodesian Expat"? If it's the latter, that's a pretty big red flag (even though a lot of white "Rhodesians" were genuinely not racist people and mere victims of circumstance and the extensive media blackout by Smith's government, anyone who identifies as a Rhodesian is sus to me). Rhodesia is an insane (and totally depressing) story, but yeah the Rhodesian flag has been rising in popularity over the last couple years as a white nationalist symbol, specifically because of its relative obscurity to the general public. I'm a conflict history/general history nerd and one of my obsessive hobbies is tracking right wing extremism around the world, which is the only reason I recognized it when the order came in.
text:Yeah he says he was born in Rhodesia rather than Zimbabwe but I’ve never heard him wax poetic about it or anything. Both of his parents are older white folks and grew up in apartheid era South Africa/“Rhodesia” so I wouldn’t be surprised if they were pretty questionable politics wise.   Kudos to you for keeping track of right wing hate symbols. Might need some tips. I’ve got a Fred Perry store near me and I see some boneheads walking around pretty constantly. Should probably keep my head up looking for other signs too. Keep fighting the good fight man.	labels:	episode_done:True

The range of styles and silhouettes presented here serves as a great reminder of the truly amazing variety we see in this community.   So c’mon, have a scroll through the album! Maybe not all the fits are your cup of tea, but they don’t have to be! Before you type out “why would someone even wear that,” just think maybe they like the way they look. Seeing as this is a collection of the users’ favorite fits from the year, I’d wager they really like the way they look. And, at the end of the day, if you feel good, you look good.   See y’all in 2021.

We're all super worried about him cause it looks like hes going through some stuff and is desperate for attention.  So word of warning is: maybe don' copy wholesale these looks that 18 year olds who post on the interent are doing and instead take some inspiration.  /r/malefashion has lots of soft boy, avante garde, e-boy, archive adjacent looks that are less specifically "18 year old," but convey similar ideas.

text:What are your 2021 Fashion / Style Goals?	labels:I'm going on a super low buy for 2021.  There's a chance that I have to move at the end of the year so I want to pair down my stuff (less boxes to pack).  I'm allowed one item per month in the following categories (with exceptions carved out).  This is one item PERIOD, not one shirt and one lipstick.  I can either get the shirt or the lipstick.  Makeup, clothing (including bras, underwear, and socks), accessories, shoes (can replace only worn out athletic shoes), tech including headphones/charging cables (can replace my laptop or phone should they die), books, craft supplies (unless I get a custom Etsy order and need something for it), stationary/office supplies (I can only buy a 2022 planner).    I'm really trying to fast-track the "financial goals' portion of my budget and I'm hoping this low-buy shifts my habits and diverts money from "wants" to financial goals.	episode_done:True
text:Style rut: Pinterest vs reality	labels:Okay, so people are heckin' rude. What inspires us can be unwearable on our particular bodies, and we're not obligated to wear it. Or maybe we don't want to wear that exact item, but some part of it excites us. It's okay to translate what you loved in a picture into something you feel fits into your everyday life. What gives with your "friend"?  Now, if you find yourself unable to do that -- you're STILL okay. And if you need help, obviously that's why Daily Questions etc exist. Because we weren't any of us born knowing how to style.
text:I love dusty pinks and mauves.  I cannot express how badly those colors look with my skin. I've had *strangers* ask me if I was ok because they assumed someone who resembled a corpse that much must be actually nearing death.   I love heels and very sleek business casual as well as what I can only call ho-fits. I have bad ankles fr from working on concrete floors too many hours, and take public transportation. It's too much of a risk I could sprain my ankle from how much I walk, and I can't afford another sprain. My office is not business casual or sleek, but a no fuss "just don't wear t-shirts with slogans or anything" type of place. I am decidedly over my ho phase, despite my continued love of the clothes.   My fantasy of wearing heeled booties with a structured fashion blazer over a mauve dress is not any less real just because I have the common sense to not go through with it.  Fashion fantasy is still a valid form of participation!	labels:I have gotten around that a bit by having decor in colours I look bad in. I definitely have some dusty pink throw pillows.

RtR has a discount shop for the clothes they don't rent out anymore but it seems like they had even more inventory lying around and they handed it over to ThredUp to sell even steeper.  Add to that the great stuff happening on Postmark, Depop, Etsy, and TheRealReal, and it's awesome to be a thrifter right now. I'm glad its all expanding.  I've been doing slow fashion for a few years and a lot of my closet is now second hand which makes me happy. Idk what the trigger was for other people but when I found out that fashion is one of the biggest polluting industries in the world, it changed my whole perspective.

text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind?

I just want to enjoy my life to the fullest and use all my nice things. I think watching killing eve, I realized how closely I identify with Villanelle’s attitude towards possessions. And they are here to be used.   The only big difference is now I work in fuzzy slippers. Something’s gotta give.
text:I feel the same - life is short and it’s always odd to me that people buy investment pieces but are then too afraid to wear them. I understand not wanting to ruin good clothes, but if you never wear them, what’s the point in owning them at all?

text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:I came to the following conclusion a few years ago:  >I am able to wear essentially anything I want anywhere I want.  However, **every single person I meet with functioning eyes** (whether they are aware of it or not) will pass judgment on my appearance no matter what I wear, and some of these people are in a position to materially affect my life based on their opinion of me.  I think it's unrealistic for most people to "wear what you want, screw the haters!" because appearance-based judgments happen constantly.  Is that a problem?  Heck yes.  Is it illegal?  When it comes to clothing, usually not.  The balance between "what I like" and "what won't get me ostracized and unemployed" is going to be very personal and will probably change several times in your life.  The trick is figuring out who you can't afford to *not* please (being realistic, of course), then figure out what is needed to please them, then figuring out where your creative freedom lies.   Most people have substantially more creative freedom in their off-work hours.	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:Moving to San Antonio encouraged me to explore my summer style! I'm into linens, rompers, light fabrics, and sleeveless/short sleeve button shirts. Its been a lot of fun. I used to rely on layering to complete my outfits. Now, I look at accessories (mostly earrings, scarves, and belts), textures, and shoes to tie everything together.	episode_done:True
text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:I have a few what I would consider to be housedresses in this definition. They are simple in shape - two pieces of fabric, sleeveless, usually no dart, no waist, hemmed - lengths ranging from above the knee to down to the ankle. I've certainly worn them to work and otherwise in public, so they're not just "house" dresses. They're comfortable in the summer in non-A/C environments, like my home office, or the previous place I worked (also no A/C). You can throw on a little sweater for A/C environments, or where sleeveless is not 100% appropriate.  I'm wearing one right now.   I have never bought one new - they're always purchased at thrift stores. Since the sizing is pretty free with these, I may not even bother to try them on. Used, I'd say that they range in price from ten dollars on down.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I haven’t made myself any rigorous challenges, but i have tried to be more mindful about purchases.  In my opinion, a bit of self awareness goes along way.  If i am thinking about an item i write it down on my wishlist. I dont buy anything that hasn’t been on that wishlist. If I come across something online, even if it is a flash sale, just put it in the cart, on the wishlist, and chill. I come back to the list periodically, and see what i still want, what i still think about, and what ive either forgotten or don’t really want anymore. The time waiting on that list should be directly related to the price.  Don’t succumb to the FOMO. For me, not filling my life with extra stuff i might not actually want is far better than missing out on a deal. If i only thought about it because of the sale, i can afford to wait for the next sale.   This has been effective for me. There are plenty of things that I would probably enjoy, but most often, after thinking it out over time, it’s clear that I wouldn’t enjoy them significantly more than things I already have. If i had implemented this technique from the start of my clothes interest, I estimate id be about $2-3k richer now. The only thing i can think of now which ive consistently been interested in for a few years would be some guidi boots, but honestly those are too far out of my price range to make happen	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 18, 2020	labels:Men's equivalent to Yoga pants. Hear me out. I wear a uniform all day 5+ days a week. I tend to work out in the morning (0445 ish). But when I get home, I still have stuff to do (take the kid to the park/play, go to the store, chores, etc...), so I can’t just slip on pajamas and call it a day (as much as I'd like to).  So, I’m looking to find out the men’s equivalent to yoga pants... that is, active wear that I can chase after the kiddo, and/or run to the store and not look like a total schlub... and maybe get my ass checked out periodically, lol.  If it helps, most weekends, I’m in jeans and a button down, maybe hiking pants and a technical shirt.  Thanks!

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls” catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your “fashion house designers” but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I’ve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.

text:Yep, I also have this same issue. I literally pick up whatever pants are strewn across the floor and then go grab a top that somewhat matches the bottoms. I also have this thing where in the evening, I imagine all these cool outfits that highlight my style and utilize all the shit I've bought trying to curate my wardrobe. However, when morning comes, I just want to be comfortable and wearing the leather mini-skirt with the 4" heeled booties I imagined the night before sounds unbearable. If I didn't have to adhere to at least a business casual dress code at work, I'd probably wear leggings and massive sweatshirts everyday.	labels:This is why I used to love packing for a business trip, because I'd plan every day's outfits (and throw in a few extra black things, because.)	episode_done:True

I usually reserve patterns for pants/skirts so a nice geometric print always makes me feel good.  Always earrings and rings.

text:Books on Fashion	labels:A little esoteric, but *Subculture: The Meaning of Style* by Dick Hebdige is an amazing piece of writing on how clothing and style is a form of resistance. You might be able to find a PDF of it online, it's fairly short but definitely worth looking at.   Nora Waugh's *The Cut of Women's Clothes* is more of a historical costume reference book, but the first hand accounts from women's letters and journals about clothing is so universal it makes my heart sing. Also an excellent survey of how the fashion industry and construction methods changed over time.   *Women's Work: The First 20,000 Years* by Barber. While not fashion specifically, it is a *incredible* deep dive into how clothing was first "invented" and how integral women were and are to the creation of thread, fabric, and clothes. It is remarkably well written and a part of history that was completely new to me. I was unable to put it down, so good.   *Fashion-ology: An Introduction to Fashion Studies* by Yuniya Kawamura is heady, but worth it. It's a sociological look at how fashion works as a mindset, industry, and construct. It hits a lot of the themes that pop up in this sub, including the moral and technological debates that occupy a lot of 21st C thought.	episode_done:True

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:I associate Gen Z fashion with crop tops and sweatpants, so yeah it makes sense that people in their 30's buying expensive ethical clothes aren't going for the sporty spice look.
text:Totally.  To me, Gen Z is a lot of clothing that isn’t work appropriate but super fun. A lot of crop tops, bra tops, spaghetti straps, usually some tummy showing, and then some baggy pants. Lots of thrifting and also cheap fast fashion. Doc Martens and other platform shoes. Very 90s/early 2000s. Long acrylic nails, false lashes. Really fun and can be a really “hot but trashy” style   Millennial fashion is more professional/better quality/structured. Linens, trousers, heels, sandals, etc. Frankly I think it has to do with millennials having more money. Low key hair, nails and makeup. Neutral colours and patterns. It’s a more mature style   I’m 25 so I get to do both 😎 woohoo	labels:I agree. Millennial fashion is put-together and professional, while it’s cool for Gen Z to, for example, wear clothes that are obviously from  the thrift store (generalizing).   I think it could partly have something to do with the larger influence of digital “aesthetic” pics on gen z. I’m on the cusp since I was born in 98 and i was really influenced by aesthetic tumblr and instagram photos growing up. like in 2014 i had a huge black-and-white grid, arctic monkeys, lana del rey, black-and-white striped turtleneck and black skater skirt tumblr phase and even though it’s not my style anymore, looking back on the aesthetics of that now, it makes me feel so nostalgic. that style for me is more about feeling dreamy and nostalgic than it is about looking good/attractive for other people. i’ve noticed that people younger than me will take that kind of thing further. an outfit creating nostalgic vibes is more important than it looking professional and presentable.   I also think that Gen Z style is less afraid to be matchy-matchy (which is such a taboo for more effortless, elegant Millennials). I think this also has to do with Gen Z style that is meant to achieve a certain aesthetic/vibe/fantasy.  I also think that growing up, Gen Z was more saturated with images and marketing, so being unique and original is more valued.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 30, 2020	labels:I’m invited to a New Years indoor house party. This might seem simple and stupid for most, but I’m at a loss as to what I should wear.    I usually dress business casual, and I stand a lot. The pants I have aren’t very comfortable for rolling around in, or sitting casually (raw denim, tucked in shirt, etc) - to which at this party there will be food and drink, and lots of floor space to sit or lay (they have no furniture, and people usually just sit on the floor). Pretty casual, however I don’t want to look like a slob or over dress.   I know this is probably obvious as to why anyone would care if the environment is this chilled, but there’s a standard im trying to keep myself to.   Any suggestions - thanks.
text:I would think that the business casual you describe is very appropriate for a NYE party under normal circumstances. That being said, unless you live in New Zealand I can't help but think you'd be better off in sweats on your own couch this year.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 20, 2020	labels:Any recommendations for sweatpants or joggers with tight cuffs/small leg openings? I like when having my pants slightly raised and tight on calves when working out.  Budget up to 100USD per pair, no material preference.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys find your style if you can’t try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:I feel like before this started I had a good sense of what brands/companies I like and my size in them. I’ve stuck to them rather than trying new brands.	episode_done:True

text:Would you prefer people throw away their old clothes when they are done with them?	labels:Ah yes, because there’s absolutely no middle ground between throwing away an item that’s still got some life left and being a vulture and re-selling it for multiple times it’s original value when it could have been purchased at a thrift store by someone who truly needs clothing and can only afford second-hand

text:Yearly Aesthetic Goal Setting	labels:Organizing Pinterest boards by year rather than like "dresses" or "fall outfits" is brilliant tbh. Far less tedious than manually deleting pins from my closet inspo board as they no longer suit me.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:I try to think about my outfit as a balance beam. There has to be equal parts light and dark (unless it’s a special or formal event). If I wear a monotone outfit, I go with a contrasting or neutral color to support. if I’m wearing black slacks, I try to wear a top with pops of color in it. Then, I chose my shoes based on the color and complexity of the top. For casual wear I apply the same rule, but also take into consideration the style of bottom I’m wearing (I.e skinny jeans, yoga pants, boot cut, etc) and where I’m heading in the outfit. For example, a pair of yogas and a t could go with vans slip ons OR a pair of trainers. If I’m heading to grab lunch, I’ll wear vans. If I’m heading to the store, I’m more likely to put on the trainers.	episode_done:True
text:Givenchy SS/2021 by Matthew M. Williams	labels:I’m very mixed about these. Some are knockouts imo - 8 and 14 especially.   Some just look so gaudy late 80s over-the-top they seem like a joke (that may be the point). 7, 10, 11, 15, & 16 (the last two...)

Oh, to have the confidence and life wisdom of a 24-year-old man.  There's nothing inherently wrong with sharing/asking for your partner's opinion about your style or wanting them to like how you dress, but it has to be something that you've both agreed you enjoy, not just one person offering unsolicited opinions. It also helps if they actually know what they're talking about.	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:I think that if they are a NICE pair of BLACK jeans paired with a very nice shirt, it’s acceptable. But looking like you are going to a mall is just poor taste and a little insulting.   I had a friend who wore bright red skinny jeans, a brown “Domo” tshirt and black converse to a friends mom wedding. We all dressed up and she could have too. I’ll forever shudder at the thought of someone dressing like that for my wedding one day	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I wear a lot of dresses, skirts, and wide-leg flowy pants during the summer. I almost never wear shorts because I've always hated them. Breathable fabrics are important especially with humidity; you'll be a lot hotter in polyester than in cotton. Also thigh chafing is a thing, so I like to alternate between days I wear a skirt and days I wear loose pants.   I do tend to carry a lightweight top layer for air conditioned buildings. But it doesn't need to be something super warm; mesh or a loose weave is fine. I tend to like that layer to be something that won't wrinkle so I can toss it in my purse.	episode_done:True

text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:Slightly related - one of my resolutions for 2020 was to give people - women and men - compliments more often. I didn’t get a enough chances to follow through with the near-non-stop quarantine situation where I live, so I’m keeping this resolution for 2021, in hopes I can follow through.
text:I made this effort a couple years ago and it was life changing. It started with me silently observing and thinking nice things about people, but then it turned into me telling total strangers they look baller and it just brings so much joy into the world. Even if you just do the silent-to-self thing, it alters one’s outlook and I think makes one kinder.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I (M/39) just bought some bright yellow, women's, terry loungepants from August November. What wonderful "non-female" fashion items have you purchased recently? Do you ever dip into the men's section?	labels:I always look in the men’s section for tshirts, hoodies, and flannels! Men’s flannels are so much better than women’s flannels
text:Yes!! My husband and I compared flannels at the store the other day. Same brand, same price. The men’s flannel was 100% cotton and the women’s flannel was a 50/50 cotton-poly blend.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Kibbe System and Body Inclusivity	labels:I got to the third question and couldn't answer it. My arms are very long and thin but my legs are short and thick so. That isn't an option I guess lol.  Like most body typing quizzes I think its pretty much BS. This one is just complex BS lol
text:I felt the same thing! Like none of the answers felt right and all of the resulting body types were very idealized?	labels:They also, frankly, overuse the word flesh.

text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:Right now, a lot of people's best intentions are devolving into "old lounge wear" because we haven't anywhere to go. Or when we have, it's running errands. Australia just got out of lockdown, I know Germany is going back in partially, the UK's going back in... and America is still a chaotic mess, but a lot of people are still working from home. So part of the answer may be "wait unti the world is different for you".
text:Yeah, if we don’t go out we slump and slouch watching tv eating food. That’s a great way to ruin some special pieces. If i’m out then i’m fine with standing straight and not being reclined. I need to plan some events so I can wear those pieces.	labels:	episode_done:True

I know #aeriereal is just marketing, but it really did made me feel comfortable going in there and buying and trying on nice sweaters and cardigans.   We're under strict lockdown again in my area, so I'm sure there will be even more stores gone once malls open again. I really do miss physical stores - my sizing is weird, so it really helped to be able to try things on without going through a cumbersome returns process.	episode_done:True

text:Tips for easily looking more modern/in style?	labels:I've heard the advice to buy 5 low-cost pieces of clothing that is in fashion per season to keep up with trends. Obviously if you see something more expensive that you love then feel free to go for it but my main point being that it doesn't have to be an entire new wardrobe of high priced clothing, it can literally be £50-100 at H&M 4 times a year buying pieces that slot into your existing wardrobe (e.g. a top or a coat or a pair of shoes). If a certain style becomes precious to you then you can always upgrade that piece.  Like for example skinny jeans are not quite the fashion of the moment but you'd still look pretty current if you paired them with a puff sleeve top. Sleek white trainers are not as on trend as some of the chunkier clunky dad styles in white but they'd still look OK with your slightly frumpy prairie dress.	episode_done:True
text:What’s your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:I'm waiting until we get to the part of the baggy jeans trend when people learn about the ripped, soggy backs of their pant legs that come from the jeans dragging on the ground. Enough of that this time around and the trend will cycle to something else.  signed,  someone who dealt with many, many ripped jean legs.

Buy less clothing and go to the gym instead." He was right.

text:Bodysuits better than skims (important)	labels:Good to know! I have been interested in SKIMS but it is pretty pricey. So I’m assuming you would say this one is worth the cost? Also, how’s the sizing would you say it’s true to size or size up?
text:I’ll chime in here, I LOVE everything I’ve bought from Skims. Such high quality, I have shapewear, bras, undies and pajamas from them and I love them all !	labels:Would you say the shape wear is true to size??  I’ve seen people post about it saying they got their size and it’s tiny! But obviously it’s shape wear and molds to your body I’m assuming?
text:Hi ! Sorry for the late reply. So I sized up in a couple things and then for others got my regular size. Feel free to DM me and I can tell you what worked for me !	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Some websites (department stores, ASOS) have a true fit tool where you put in your measurements, body type, and well fitting item of clothing and that information is used to recommend sizing.   It’s also a good idea to know your measurements in general if you’re buying secondhand as many sellers will list the measurements of the garment.  But overall sizing can be so wild within one brand, much less across multiple that I dint think there’s much of a rule of thumb.
text:I second this! I made a note in my phone with all of my measurements and it's saved me a lot of time and money. Before I buy anything I compare my measurements with the websites size guide (I do it for each individual item) and select whatever size *they* have listed for my measurements.   These are measurements I keep personally:  Height Bust Band Waits Hips Hollow to Hemlines  Hollow to floor  Inseam:   For some of these (mainly bottoms) I jotted down my true measurements using a tape measurer and also took measurements of jeans that I already had that fit well.	labels:I did that too, but I don't have all of these.

text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:I follow her too and am interested in the answers. I love the way she styles herself because she looks effortlessly cool to my eyes. The clothes mostly wouldn‘t work for me because I‘m only 5‘1, so lots of things are too big. Anything ‚oversized‘ just makes me look a little childish. I still try to incorporate some of her tips. There are brands like COS that do similar things with cool shapes and ‚different‘ basics.  ETA: Do you like the pieces themselves or her style philosophy? Because occasionally I think the clothes she presents are.. pretty ugly, tbh
text:I am whole 5'4 but I love oversize, especially now having workliveexisted at home for so many months, I cannot bother with uncomfortable clothes. I even started to look into men's section for interesting prints and roomy clothes. I love Amy's tips on how to look comfortable on different occasions but still put together, not sloppy.   Now when you asked, I think I really love the philosophy even more than clothes themselves. I love the suits, the knits, some of the tops. However I absolutely cannot wear the shoes, neither a sandal nor an "ironic" furry shoe because of practicality, dress code, weather. So yes, I think I am really looking for brands who share similar philosophy of creative basics.	labels:I agree, her tips on looking put together but still stylish and chic are great!

text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:People usually compliment clothes and items that stand out. It's usually not something that looks good, at least to ourselves.   I remember Karen from Karenbritchick, who often looks amazing in her clothes and designer items, talk about her most complimented item, and it's not the designer bags, cool clothes that she owns, but some wack, elaborate guitar strap for her bag.   So, our own gut feelings are important. Also, what looks good might not feel good.
text:I have an almost-completely sheer white jumpsuit with embroidered flowers on it that is super cute but when I wear it I feel like I’m wearing a clown suit. Wide legs, low crotch, etc. But inevitably when I wear it (with a super annoying bodysuit underneath because you can See Everything without it) it’s a total head turner, random people off the street tell me how much they like it, etc.   It’s a beautiful piece of clothing, but I’m self conscious and irritated by it when I wear it.

text:Alexander Wang accused of a history of sexual harassment - fashion in a year of reckoning?	labels:I work in fashion and feel that the rage and “do the right thing” mentality only lasts as long as everyone sticks together (during a moment like #metoo or the protests after the murder of George Floyd.) A lot of people working in fashion are on a gig-by-gig basis so it’s Everyman for himself as far as success goes. People will turn a blind eye to the wrong doings of companies if it means that they themselves can get another paycheck or take a step up the ladder. It’s not that they themselves are immoral but it’s a hard industry to make it in and you can feel powerless when you’re not at the top. When you are on your own, which is most days, you will lose sight of the bigger picture of an ideal future.  For example this summer I read that FreePeople implemented racist practices within their stores. I added them to a list of companies that I didn’t want to work for (I’m freelance.) A month ago I was offered an opportunity to work with them and even though on principal I didn’t want to, I still considered it because I need a paycheck and the name would be good for me to have on my resume and would lead to more work.  Until their are unions to protect freelancers the fashion industry will remain corrupt. Everyone is afraid of being blacklisted and/or broke.

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:Go on Pinterest and pin things that catch your eye. Once you have a board try and find similarities between the pins (for example ruffles, silk, strappy backs etc) and start searching up those things at stores that are within your price range.  In terms of comfort, look for materials you like and what silhouettes you’re into. If you tend to do tighter tops with more volume at the bottom then look for dresses that match that for example. If you know you like cotton blends look for those.    Also look for stores that carry petite sections or find a tailor in your area  Don’t go crazy trying to push yourself too far out of your comfort zone. Look for things that are your style but that you’ve never worn before.
text:Similarly, I often look at tv and movies to see what I like - whether it’s a piece of clothing or a general look that character has, it’s a nice starting point to see what you like and don’t like and the aesthetic you might want to go for.  I am 5ft and I find that certain types of clothing are more likely to fit at non petite sizes, like skinny jeans (since they can scrunch up at the bottom a bit and it doesn’t look wierd)and tighter skirts.

text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:Color: navy or charcoal. Maybe some subtle pinstripes but nothing flashy. 2 button, single breasted. Don't wear a  vest. If it's cold, wear an overcoat, inside should be warm enough for just a suit coat. Suit coat should come down to about your knuckles. I usually opt for a white shirt and a tie with a conservative pattern.  Honestly, I got my interview suit at Macy's for just under $300. Needed a little work in the sleeves but otherwise wasn't terrible. It's your first job, people don't expect you to have a bespoke suit, but you shouldn't look like you picked it up at Goodwill either. You can usually find something at Men's Wearhouse or any of the major department stores, and then get the pants and sleeves hemmed to the appropriate length. The stores should all have modern slim fits, but don't get something that scrunches up if you button the top button.
text:Yep. Men’s warehouse or department store is fine for first suit. Just make sure to get it tailored. A lot of people will try to bash, but a properly tailored suit from either of those places will work great.   Also I’m big on charcoal for first suit. Every man should have a charcoal suit.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:I buy 90% of my clothes from Poshmark and ThredUp.    Poshmark: has a much larger inventory than ThredUp.  You can communicate with sellers and can often bundle items for discounts and ask for more pictures/measurements.  ThredUp: easier to search for a type of item (e.g. white cotton t-shirt) and save that search, which I find really helpful.  Much easier to find a specific fabric.  For example I love linen and there's no way to find linen clothes on Poshmark besides just searching "linen" and hoping the seller looked at the fabric.  Each item is shown on a mannequin, which is nice but sometimes it's difficult to see the details (hem, pattern, etc.).	episode_done:True

text:Can I see your casual natural-fabric outfits?	labels:I have been only buying natural materials this year as well. I'm not sure if denim gives you a sensory issue but I have found that a lot of men's and boys jeans are still all cotton. Depending your sizing and preferred fit, you could look for those. Otherwise I like linen pants a lot (pantsfessional on IG has some great looks). My other suggestion is to look in thrift stores, a lot of women's clothing used to be all natural materials so I have had more luck there with donated items.
text:It's not hard to find cotton jeans for women, either, I've got 100% cotton jeans from H&M, Old Navy, Levi's, Asos, Mango.  There's a pretty big difference between men's and women's cuts, not a lot of women have the shape to wear men's pants.	labels:Not all cotton jeans are created equal though. I was excited to find a pair at H&M a few years ago. They fit me perfectly at the store. Unfortunately after wearing for a few hours, they bag out like crazy. I swear they went up at least a size if not two. They’d shrink back down after washing, but it didn’t do me much good to have jeans that were only wearable once after washing and would look baggy by the end of the day.   Meanwhile I’ve got some Levi’s and LL Bean jeans (both vintage/thrifted) that hold their shape perfectly. Not sure I’ve ever washed either pair.	episode_done:True

text:I recommend going to proper glasses store and talking to the product experts.  > a bit of curve so that I am shielded from the sides.

text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:I think you can still look fashionable while ignoring heels etc.   I agree with you on heels, and my foot shape finds them quite uncomfortable, so unless they’re a platform or quite chunky (like with most booties), I just don’t do them.   Now, I personally love high waist (the higher the better, gimme that steve urkle shit 😂) but lower waist, softer fabrics, or even high quality leggings (like faux leather styles) will look much nicer than sweats.   Well-fitting basic t’s look great. They just need to fit properly across your shoulders and chest. Plenty of flat shoes exist that look nice. Vans, leather or leather-ish ballet flats, nice sneakers (e.g. New Balance or similar) with a well-tailored outfit.  Honestly a lot of it comes down to the fit of clothing, the FABRICS (I mean, put on anything pilled and it looks 🥴 immediately), and other styling elements like hair. Hair thrown into a ratty bun with sweats and uggs? Yeah I look sloppy. Straightened hair with joggers and vans? Now I look stylish! Ha.  ETA: that unfortunately body type also comes into play here. There have been quite a few posts detailing how basics look “timeless” and “stylish” on thin frames, and sloppy or unstylish on larger bodies. I thought I would throw this in there just in case, although I think most of my comments still apply regardless of body size!

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:The company already made money off of the original purchase of the shirt, so you buying second hand doesn’t really benefit them in any way. If you really want the item, buying it second hand is probably the most ethical choice you can make. If someone asks where the piece is from, just say you don’t know so they won’t be tempted to buy from the brand lol
text:I partially agree with you. But the company still benefit from second hand purchases.   The second hand price is based on supply/demand, buying the unethical brand even second hand shows demand and increase public perception of the brand then prices go up. That’s why some brands are still more expensive than others even in thrift store.  Yet if you like an unethical brand, like you said, buying second hand is better.	labels:It depends on where you shop. Your local charity thrift shop is not giving a kickback to the first buyer, but a consignment store is.
text:No matter where people buy, buying a certain product increases its demand which in turn increases the price and perception of the product.  So even if the shops don’t give brands any money, it stills benefits them overall through better perception and free branding.	labels:I agree with this, and think reformation is a great example on Poshmark. So many people are buying from reformation with immediate intentions of reselling it at full price. I feel like buying from their brand secondhand would still be supporting them in this case.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:Okay I am totally in the same spot as you. So tired of wearing grey, I want to rid my closet of the colour. The best solution and not to rid your whole closet is to buy colourful accessories or go to a consignment store and buy statement pieces to wear with your basic wardrobe that would be at discounted prices compared to online retail like Free People and Anthropologie  (I recommend not going to thrift stores because that's more basics typically). I also have a rule that if a t-shirt or any article of clothing hasn't been worn in the last 6 months its time to donate it, that's at least 2 seasons of wearing it not being utilized. As for up-cycling your own old clothes you can buy fun iron on patches that can be added on plain hoodies or t-shirts for a pop of colour much like the brands Comme de Garcons and Scotch and Soda.  You can also embroider shirt collars, or the pockets of jeans.	episode_done:True

The good news is that there are some great options for getting high quality sweaters at low prices if you're willing to shop secondhand.

She ended up being a super emergency c section, and I’m still processing how scary and unexpected that was, but she is super healthy and doing great.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:I'm in a ambivalent state of mind right now. For a like over a year now I have been into streetwear. Baggy, oversized clothes with lots of prints and branding. This was my first period of taking clothing serious and feeling "fashionable". But one can only see so many of the "same" outfits.  I grew really tired of streetwear in the last couple of weeks but I'm scared to leave my comfort zone. I'm 20 years old but feel like dressing like a teenager. I really really like graphic tees if the prints are well done and If I would imagine dressing like lets say Tim Dessaint for example, who is not into graphics/"crazyness" at all, It would feel too "mature" for my age if that makes sense.  But at the very same time, I feel like im dressing too childish when wearing cargo pants + graphic tee.  Am I overthinking this?
text:Do you feel like your current clothing no longer represents how you want to be seen, or do you just feel a bit uninspired right now? The former is what pushes people to change styles; my current wardrobe has almost no traces of my previous interest in streetwear. The latter might mean you're feeling a bit stuck but still want to keep doing streetwear, in which case I would recommend looking at brands such as OAMC, Noah NY, Cav Empt, Fear of God, Awake NY, or Brain Dead, all of which are "streetwear" but are doing really cool things to present a distinct vision.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are "iconic" items that you should know about, and their basic history? What items can singularly be identified as "starting a trend"?	labels:I actually really like this idea to track certain articles of clothing not just for their originality but also having relevance today and keeping the "essence" of a style, or statement about the wearer. (a great example to me is Ralph Lauren creating the image of distilled American privilege, opportunity, and style by copying clothes from Brooks Brothers) Actual pieces I think fit the trend starter though:  Penny Loafers- GH Bass' Weejuns  Jeans- Levi's 501 Button Fly  Biker Jacket- Schott Perfecto  Oxford Shirt- Brooks Brothers button down	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:The present always feels “neutral”. I think if you watch any reality show from the early 2010s, even as late as 2014-15, you’ll see a big difference from what was considered “no defining silhouette” then. things like just a tshirt change slightly in cut and shape over time.

And I've never really attached myself to any particular fit aesthetic or color palate in building that closet. I'd like my professional attire to say some things, and I'm exploring sleep/relaxation as a theme in casualwear, but I still kind of just buy... Not just stuff I like on sale, anymore, I'm a little more careful... but still not anything quite that directed.  Thanks for the reminder that being more methodical pays off. Great guide, buddy.

Plus my boots - purple, cow, silver I'm looking forward to wearing. Also some velvet sweatpants and flares, my scarf collection, my chunky handknit socks, oooh I love autumn/winter clothes. Its always been my fave season for dressing.
text:While sunflowers are thought to have originated in Mexico and Peru, they are one of the first plants to ever be cultivated in the United States. They have been used for more than 5,000 years by the Native Americans, who not only used the seeds as a food and an oil source, but also used the flowers, roots and stems for varied purposes including as a dye pigment. The Spanish explorers brought sunflowers back to Europe, and after being first grown in Spain, they were subsequently introduced to other neighboring countries. Currently, sunflower oil is one of the most popular oils in the world. Today, the leading commercial producers of sunflower seeds include the Russian Federation, Peru, Argentina, Spain, France and China.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What clothing items have you reverted back to since WFH/quarantine?	labels:I've really been embracing dressing more youthful. I'm in my early/mid 20s, and now that I've worked a couple years at the same place, I'm wearing more what I want than boring professional. I also started caring about what I wear and planning my outfits. Velvet shoes, corduroy overalls, rainbow prints, sequins, bold colors. Who cares? I've been called out for dressing "fancy" before, but I've stopped giving a shit in correlation with my confidence in my abilities. I'm a teacher...if anything, I'm showing the students it's okay to be yourself and take risks.

text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:Decent homewear. Especially robes that aren't bathrobes nor these dainty fragile satin/chiffon thingies.

In loungewear there's apparently four types with no middle ground: For mothers-formerly-known-as-women,  for girls, for seduction purposes only, and Jeff Lebowski.

With these suits I’ve tried them on a few times and they’re super boxy and wide and while I like them a lot, I think you’ve got to be super tall to make this look work. I couldn’t even imagine how goofy I’d look in a DB suit that’s cut like that.	episode_done:True
text:What work for my boyfriends taste and body type?	labels:I’d recommend going to a suit store and having him measured. Buying clothes is much better when you know your measurements, especially online shopping. Wearing clothes that fit right helps my self confidence a lot. For his build a tailored/athletic/muscle fit would probably fit best (talking about shirts), possibly a slim fit depending on the brand and the size chart for it.   I’d recommend learning his measurements because finding what he likes and what works best for him will help him develop his own style. It also makes online shopping so much easier.

text:There is no unmarked woman	labels:I think in my personal experience as  fat woman working in an image heavy career path (entertainment) everything is so stacked against me in terms of job opportunities that I automatically try and appear marked in a positive way. As I am very much an  'other' at work and stick out like a sore thumb anyway, i tend to peacock. I love bright coloured suits and dresses, purposeful makeup (as in, bright eyeshadow or lipstick) and I tend to over match in what is arguably an unfashionable way, according to FFA. It makes me feel good, and I think you can get away with more daring choices in hot climates. I am also very influenced by my recently passed grandma, who had an incredible amount of clothes and always looked impeccable- and very matchy like me!  However, since corona has struck and i've had my livelihood dwindle to nothing....I have take a pedestrian job for a year. The day I purchased my bland 'work wardrobe' of elasticated trousers and black jumpers I felt incredibly sad. I understand that I have a new role now but I just feel unattractive and basic in all the wrong ways.	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:No one has ever bothered me, I’ve even had a female sales clerk agree with me that men’s shirts are more comfortable.  I typically only buy men’s tops, tees or hoodies or sweatshirts. I don’t try for fitted, only loose, and usually go for second hand since I mostly wear it as loungewear.  Pants I haven’t had much luck with. If the waist can be cinched small enough, that means the hips barely fit or they are way too tight when I sit down or bend over. A medium is too large and can’t be cinched small enough.  Board shorts/basketball shorts are ok, the leg is loose enough to accommodate the lady hips, regardless of the waist size. I generally don’t like the look of these on me, but you may have different preferences.	episode_done:True
text:What clothing items have you reverted back to since WFH/quarantine?	labels:Sweatshirts that are 2 sizes too big and yoga/workout pants. Essentially, it’s my college wardrobe which works since I’m only 3 years out of college.

text:What fashion trend/s have you been obsessed with lately?	labels:1) Blazers, truuuly obssesed with them. It went as far as not wearing coats as freezing as it was outside because I wanted to wear a blazer instead and I do not liking putting a coat above the blazer 2) wearing a shirt over a thin turtleneck. I saw it a few days ago in someone's instagram and I think it's amazing you show your cute shirts but you don't get a cold in the process! 3) Accessories. I went through all the accessories obsessions, it started with earnings, I would change them daily (I need to wear always earrings), then it went to rings and I felt like a influencer. I do not know why wearing rings made me feel like such a badass it would give me like I do not why as if I had my life together and with a cute manicure wow.... but I am not that constant so I started forgetting changing earrings and putting rings. Then I started with multiple small necklaces and as with earrings and rings, oh and purses, I stopped doing it and nowI just wear the same three necklace always... so... now I am obsessed with belts, I promise I have tried with all my strength to go out of my house without a belt, but I really can't I would say that it is as if I was going without a bad but I do that a lot ....but without a belt puff I can't.	episode_done:True

text:Knit Tie Inspo / Lookbook	labels:I picked up a black knit tie and a navy knit tie at the same time. While for normal woven ties, I'd usually reach for a navy over a black, with the texture of a silk knit, somehow the black knit tie just looks better than the navy knit in so many outfits.   This might be a function of bias because I've read articles extolling the virtues of the black knit tie, but I think the texture of the knit helps to offset the starkness of the colour

text:what are your fashion flaws?	labels:I simultaneously buy things I like regardless of having the occasion to wear them and also have a tendency to "save the good stuff" for these nonexistent occasions, which has resulted in a practical overabundance of clothes that are just a little too dressy for my lifestyle, and that this year I have literally had no reason whatsoever to touch...  I also don't know if it's just me but I'm constantly hooking parts of my clothing (belt loops esp) on cabinet handles?
text:Yes!    Pre COVID, I modified my shopping to focus on stuff that I can wear to my casual office (even if it’s on the dressy side), and I wore that shit all the time.   Now I wear a bunch of super casual/slob clothes bc I’m trying to keep cool/warm while minimally running the A/C or heater.

text:I got two black pairs of Uggs a couple Christmases ago. One pair is the classic length and one is the shorter ankle length. Both incredibly comfy and versatile with my mostly black wardrobe. I went through a phase last winter where didn't wear them because I read this article that basically shit on adults who wore Uggs. My parents spent a good deal of money to get me them and I asked for them, and let a random bitter writer shame me out of wearing them. This year of the pandemic has brought about a new side of my personality that's just like "fuck you, life is too short and fragile to not wear what I want and be cozy AF" and I do not regret it.  I'm not hate wearing my Uggs, I'm spite wearing them.	labels:	episode_done:True

How do you get it back?	labels:Read the Curated Closet if you want to really hone in and define a personal style and how to wear it. Great tips about how to buy clothes purposefully, how to accessorize, how to identify quality, etc.   As far as the aging thing goes - I’ve found I just become more myself. I don’t buy into trends now. I know I won’t wear a color that isn’t navy so I don’t bother buying it. No velvet. No shorts. Etc etc. I just have less time for navel gazing and bullshit. Maybe because I’m a nurse in a pandemic who is also in perpetual grad school. Or maybe because I finally have money now to buy what I really want? Either way. No real advice but just a question to think about what you actually want to wear for who you are today. Not an imaginary person who doesn’t live your life with your budget and your body and your friends, ya know?

text:Best way to buy clothes locally?	labels:There are websites that feature many different “local” boutiques that you can shop at with one click, so to speak. I use Trouva and Avocadostore to buy from different sustainable boutiques across Europe for clothes and home wear. I can even narrow my search to just my particular city. Even though I use one online site, I have to pay shipping if shopping from different stores. There is an incentive to shop at one place though, like they give a discount on shipping or something.   I know some local boutiques use farfetch as well.	episode_done:True
text:The Conscious and Somber Decision of Solid Jacketing	labels:great read (and viewing, impressive album!)! I detoured to the Balloon Ring Jacket article halfway through, it's a gorgeous piece! The practice you mention of styling a fit directly from inspo to avoid defaulting is a great idea, need to do that more.
text:Haha it is a great jacket! I sometimes wonder if I came to this topic because I wanted an excuse to wear it more ;)  But thank you! I'm glad you understand how I approach "not defaulting".

text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:I'm a Sagittarius with a Taurus moon, so my formula is just abject chaos but make it luxe (ie. I wear a flat gold herringbone chain, gold or tortoiseshell earrings, a little gold watch, and a gold signet ring + my engagement ring at all times, even if I'm wearing leggings and a sweatshirt to play Stardew Valley all day).   More seriously, my jewellery basically never changes (see above), so I guess that's my formula? I wear that combo whether I'm wearing a dress and heels to go out (in theory, who even remembers going out?) or jeans and a sweatshirt to go to the grocery store (in theory, we just do pick up orders now). I did just get a new big-girl job, so maybe this will change as I'm able to better afford the wild 1940s wardrobe of my dreams?	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 18, 2020	labels:Men's equivalent to Yoga pants. Hear me out. I wear a uniform all day 5+ days a week. I tend to work out in the morning (0445 ish). But when I get home, I still have stuff to do (take the kid to the park/play, go to the store, chores, etc...), so I can’t just slip on pajamas and call it a day (as much as I'd like to).  So, I’m looking to find out the men’s equivalent to yoga pants... that is, active wear that I can chase after the kiddo, and/or run to the store and not look like a total schlub... and maybe get my ass checked out periodically, lol.  If it helps, most weekends, I’m in jeans and a button down, maybe hiking pants and a technical shirt.  Thanks!

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Lifestyle and body changes will take place and impact your wardrobe and style needs a few times over the course of your life, and 20s is sort of when most navigate this for the first time. The most important thing to determine is what if anything in your current wardrobe can work for you now, including your work looks, and what look you want to have with your style for work. This should fit into your industry and be appropriate, but it can still be 'you' (your vibe, etc.), it just takes some thought and planning. Clothing is 100% the wrapper so to speak we all wrap around ourselves, and can reflect who we are, where we are at in our lives, how we feel about ourselves, and alot of other aspects about yourselves. Aim to tie it as closely to you, and what your life needs are. That is how it has been effective for me here. If you want to share some workplace appropriate looks you like, we can help further!	episode_done:True
text:What are you looking forward to buying for "pandemic life" this summer?	labels:Every spring I say I'm going to get some interesting spring/summer clothes, and then I just buy more polos.  I had a baby last year and form-fitting shirts just don't look good on me anymore. But I couldn't find anything else that worked so I spent the warm months wearing t-shirts. (Which turned out to be fine since anything I wore ended up covered in spit up anyway)  So I'm really hoping that by summer at least, pandemic numbers are low enough that I can actually go out and try new clothes on and find stuff that works for me. Otherwise... I guess it's t-shirts and jeans again. :/	episode_done:True

text:My Gucci Addiction: Vanity Fair editor Buzz Bissinger's essay about spending $638k on clothes	labels:The line in the piece that stuck out for me was when he said he was on medication for "mild bipolarity."  The out-of-control spending, the hypersexuality, the losing a job due to temper outbursts...I'm not a psychiatrist, I just play one on the internet, but all of that put together  sounds like, at the very least, untreated hypomania.  To pass it off as only shopping addiction or "discovering himself" seems like underplaying some serious mental illness.
text:Regular people have mental illness.  Rich people have *glamorous* mental illness	labels:Exactly. Regular people are hoarders. Rich people are ✨eccentric
text:I’ve seen people say this, but tbh hoarding is something completely different from eccentricity. Rich or not, if your living space is unsanitary because you have too much crap in your house or your spending addiction damages your life, then you’re a hoarder.  If you just have unconventional style or make whimsical choices (like carefully curating an unusual collection) then you’re eccentric.

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:I associate Gen Z fashion with crop tops and sweatpants, so yeah it makes sense that people in their 30's buying expensive ethical clothes aren't going for the sporty spice look.
text:Totally.  To me, Gen Z is a lot of clothing that isn’t work appropriate but super fun. A lot of crop tops, bra tops, spaghetti straps, usually some tummy showing, and then some baggy pants. Lots of thrifting and also cheap fast fashion. Doc Martens and other platform shoes. Very 90s/early 2000s. Long acrylic nails, false lashes. Really fun and can be a really “hot but trashy” style   Millennial fashion is more professional/better quality/structured. Linens, trousers, heels, sandals, etc. Frankly I think it has to do with millennials having more money. Low key hair, nails and makeup. Neutral colours and patterns. It’s a more mature style   I’m 25 so I get to do both 😎 woohoo	labels:I don't really associate millenials clothing with that. I mean I try to dress ocasion-appropriately, so if I have to work I'll dress more professionaly, but on my free time I dress how you described. The only thing I have found to be different is that maybe they are bolder (?) brighter colors, shorter pieces... I've found myself buying clothes I've have been too afraid to wear 10 years ago, maybe people were more concerned about other's opinions and that's it (?)	episode_done:True
text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:My steel toes are Irish Setter. I got them from Red Wings. I like having the higher boot type (above abole bone), but that's just me. Good shoes for what I need them to be.	episode_done:True
text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:I have a pair of beautiful caramel taper-toe Dex riding boots that my mom bought in 1970 with her first paycheck. She gave them to me when I was in high school in 2007 and I wore the soles out from wearing them so much. I paid $30 to have them re-soled with leather in 2012 and my mom was so shocked because that's how much she paid for them in the first place.  But these boots are so special to me and not a single thing could ever persuade me to get rid of them.	episode_done:True
text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:Don’t forget to check out thrift stores. This is where I stock up on cashmere sweaters for a few dollars a piece, wool skirts, kilts, sweaters, vests, and cardigans, and amazing wool blazers and coats. I’ve found mint condition mohair and camel hair 3/4 coats for as low as $10, black cashmere sweaters for $2-3 and up, and cable knit pullovers for as low as $4. It’s amazing what people get rid of, not realizing how expensive it all is new. I also loooove wool in the fall and winter, and so this has been a super affordable way to build a dream cold-weather wardrobe.   The only thing wool I buy new are socks for the most part, everything else I’ve found at estate sales, garage sales, and thrift shops. When/if you go, definitely go through the boys and men’s departments, too. A bit of tailoring can make anything look custom like some of the pieces on Walker Slater maybe.

text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:This is a place for discussion, so.. In my opinion, true womanhood is not tied to certain behaviors. What would those behaviors be, do you mean? How can you behave in a way that makes you less of a woman?  Being womanly isn't tied to wanting to doll up for men. Are you also saying that women that don't feel like they have to doll up in front of 10000 marines are lesser women because of it?   In my opinion, all of this is based on sexist views that once again, men are the true judges of what's sexy, what's a true woman, and what a woman should dress like and act like in order to be a real woman. You say this, but with different words, when you describe how men appreciate something that's more true than what women appreciate.  Can't we just appreciate fashion and clothes without having to *be* something?   Marilyn Monroe grew up in a man's world. 2020 is *supposed* to be 50/50.

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I wear a lot of stuff from Rickis, RW&Co, and INC International Concepts. It's all fairly inexpensive, holds up well, and is machine washable.  "Dry clean only" is almost always a lie though. Clothing manufacturers are required to put care instructions on garments, dry clean only is an easy way for them to avoid responsibility if the garment gets fucked up while being cleaned.   Almost everything with a dry clean only label can be put in the washing machine in a mesh bag. If something seems really delicate (sequins, glitter, delicate mesh) then you can almost certainly hand wash it. Just avoid heat and you should be fine. At this point the only things I would dry clean would be items with sculptural/3d elements that would break down if they got wet.  I thrift most of my clothing, so I'm really daring about putting things in the wash, because if it gets wrecked I'm probably not losing more than $10. I've put dozens of dry clean only items in the washing machine and I don't remember the last time I wrecked something by doing so.	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Zara | January 30, 2021	labels:twice, I've coincidentally lived right next to a Zara (like a 2-3 minute walk). As a result I often popped into the store and bought a few things.  My experiences were hit and miss, mostly misses  Hits:    Faux suede stuff.  They look and feel nice. I've often get compliments on it. I don't like dealing with actual suede, so the faux stuff is nice.     Sizing. so far sizing for tops has mostly been consistent so its easy to order online and know what to expect  Returns. super easy either online or in person.  Sales. Here they go on sale immediately July 1 and Jan 1.  You can get good deals on many things such as a faux suede jacket for roughly 20 USD, a long coat for roughly 30, etc  Style.  I think thats the reason many go here.  The styling looks really unique and interesting. although yes, there are really strange stuff there too  Blazers/sport coats.  Fits well and looks nice.  Miss:  Stitching. Like some one said earlier, its really bad. things are always loose, buttons fall off, even buckles break. more than half of the Zara items I've bought had some major stitching issues within the first half year.   Jackets. although they are cool, I've had all kinds of problems. A bomber jacket where all texture threads became loose and made a hole.  A linen moto jacket where the buckle just broke off and fixing it costed more than the jacket. My Faux suede sherling denim style jacket looks great and new but all the button stitching around the button holes have all frayed.. and i hardly use the buttons since there are zippers!   Knits. unravels, pills quickly etc  all Bottoms. discolors easily. pills easily. tons of loose threading  when I was a college student it was nice. the sale items are cheap and you can look cool  but after graduating, having more disposable income, etc.. I've mostly moved on.	episode_done:True

text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:No, I don’t think it’s tone deaf that fashion houses or designers are releasing collections that, like oconorris mentioned, were designed a year+ in advance.   As cities and *other* countries begin to re open people will begin to adapt to the new norm and resume their day to day activities so that will present more opportunities for them to go out and wear new clothes. I’m in America so don’t expect to relate any time soon lol  Having said that, there’s something for everyone. There’s quite a few brands that offer natural fibers, minimalistic looks, but no guarantee that greenwashing isn’t involved or that they aren’t treating their employees like shit.   The world doesn’t revolve around America so I’m not sure that more affordable brands will drop whatever collections they had designed for 6+ months just to adapt to whatever image people have in mind during this pandemic.
text:I do wonder about how fashion will acknowledge the recoveries of different countries.  Like Wuhan's throwing pool parties now, so--you know, it's a different vibe.  The fact that China also consumes a lot of luxury goods also complicates things; and I wonder if the Chinese consumer would be interested in some of the more drab utilitarian offerings I've seen trickling in.  On the whole, Chinese consumers don't exactly get excited about dropping big dollars on depression chic (and does anyone really?).	labels:This entire sub does lol

text:Has consulting a stylist really been a revelation to you?	labels:A few years ago i was feeling badly about myself following the end of a 4 year relationship. I decided to find a local personal shopper to go through my closet and help me decide what to keep/donate. She also provided me with ways to wear what i already had. From that, she created a list of things she thought i would need to add to my wardrobe according to my lifestyle and wants/needs. We then went to the mall a few days later and she brought in tons of things to try. The rule was that i had to show her everything, but i had the final say as to what i wanted to get. This was great because it also provided me with an opportunity to get more styling tips on items i don’t currently own but might consider moving forward.  Since then, i have felt so much more confident in how i dress and i constantly receive tons on compliments. I would 10/10 recommend this to anyone who wants to change their style or learn more about what looks best on them. I figured the $400 i spent on her was equivalent to how much money I’d spend on items i would never actually wear, and in the long run became an investment :).

text:All-time favorite cold weather pieces?	labels:I’ve preached the gospel of cashmere here more than once, but I’ll do it again.   CASHMERE!   So light, so soft, so warm.   I’m a winter-hater in CT, don’t enjoy being bundled up in piles of layers.  A cashmere sweater over a tank top usually does it, and a fleece or puffer vest over it for super cold days.     I know you’re on a budget, but it can be done!   Literally all of my cashmere is either thrifted or bought on clearance, so the max I would have paid for a sweater is around $35, with the low end around $12.   I wash it in the machine (cold, gentle cycle with baby shampoo) and dry it flat on a rack.	episode_done:True

text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:Actually, this is a great time to address this. Once you come out of the pandemic, people will have somewhat forgotten what your normal is so you can set a new tone. Dress it up the first few times you see people and it will set the tone for a new normal. No one will even think it's weird because I bet everyone is sitting at home just wishing they would wear anything other than sweats. So, for the first couple of times at least, make sure you dress up. After that it'll be your normal. I kinda dealt with this too. I live in the bay area, the most people wear here are jeans and a tee. I hate it so will go with dresses and other things often and feel really overdressed. I realized that for me the best way to not feel weird about that was to dress down my shoes. So wearing ankle boots was the fanciest I would go with shoes and that was only on rare occasions. Most of the time I would pair sandals or sneakers with my outfits and look like I fit in again.	episode_done:True

text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:This has happened to me a few times with AE and Guess jeans. Based on my experience, it's not worth it to try and mend it.. the solution will not be long-term and can end up costing a lot of money for nothing. Also when you try to stitch it up it just makes the area more tight which again, will only lead to more issues than the road. I would rather buy new jeans.	episode_done:True

text:My incomplete guide for buying less in 2021	labels:I cleaned out and organized my entire closet earlier this year. I sold what no longer fit and things I haven't worn in a while. I use the money I make from selling my old clothes to purchase new items. I put my entire capsule wardrobe onto a Powerpoint, so I can see what items I need or would like to add. Then, I shop around for the pieces I want and save them to my Shoptagr extension in Chrome. The extension keeps all my wishlist items in one place, and alerts me then they are discounted. This keeps me from impulse-buying just because something is on sale, since I know these are things I have been wanting for a while.  I also unsubscribed from all newsletters, but I follow the brands I like on a website called Milled, which is a search engine for email newsletters. It lets me follow all the brands I typically shop at, but because the newsletters don't go directly to my inbox, I'm not as tempted to purchase. It's also helpful to look back through the brand's emails, just to get a sense of their sale patterns.	episode_done:True

text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:I would get:  - a knee length/mid-calf black, brown, grey, or navy dress (good for anything and you can pair with colourful accessories for a wedding if you want)  - a flowy maxi dress (good for outdoor weddings in hot weather)  - a fun one that is still appropriate.   Avoid:  - excessive cleavage  - tacky rhinestones  - white dresses and anything close to white.  - completely red dresses   - black dresses can be a bit somber but I think can work if accessorized properly. Try to make sure it isn't too funeral-looking.   Things to keep in mind:  - at least one dress that covers your shoulders might be a good idea for any more traditional/conservative weddings.  - keep the length classy  - look for timeless styles, dresses you can wear in almost any decade and look good. Your fun one you can have fun with and have it be a trend that might not work 5 years from now.  - don't buy a dress you don't have the undergarments for/don't plan on buying undergarments for. Eg. Do you have massive boobs, and can't wear strapless bras? Don't get a strapless dress.

text:How do you feel about vegan/faux leather?	labels:There is no such thing as vegan leather.  There's leather, and then there's plastic that has been manipulated to immitate leather grain.  The latter has its uses--it's cheap, it can be made in literally any shape,  it can be made waterproof and insulating, and it certainly isn't *ugly*\--but it's certainly not leather.  Personally, I try to avoid it.  My reason are as follows:   1) It doesn't have the durability I need--it  loses its shape easily, it hardens and cracks easily, and unlike leather it is almost impossible to repair once damaged.   2) It doesn't have the sustainability I want--sure you spare an animal's hide, but you could wear out ten pairs of PVC shoes in the time it takes to wear out one well-made pair of leather shoes.  Now you have ten pairs of PVC shoes floating in the ocean killing sea turtles and the cow ends up on a plate regardless.  3) Aesthetically... it is cheap plastic.  And it looks like cheap plastic.  There are some styles that can accommodate or even luxuriate on cheap plastic items, but mine is not one such style.  There is simply no replacement for the depth of color and texture given by leather.     4) Chafing oh god chafing     That said, I've seen some folks look really good in PVC.  I used to look really good in PVC too, back when I was more wild and reckless.  But now that I've become the sort of person who gets her materialist thrills out of vintage copper cookware and exotic tea blends, I find I am also someone who really loves the beauty and comfort of leather.

text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:The question I will pose is: Are you dressing with your shape or are you dressing against it?  The reason I ask is because when I was younger, I soooo badly wanted to dress in a style that was more suited to completely different body shape. I bought clothes that didn’t fit right trying to make myself look like a different shape and obviously it didn’t work. It also made me feel like a failure and that my features were undesirable. When I stopped fighting my shape, I found more clothes that fit better and made me feel more confident.     But they only fit better, so I have my clothes altered to fit correctly or alter them myself. I mostly buy secondhand and go for things that are high quality, so that alterations are a possibility and worthwhile. It’s much easier to make something smaller than to let it out.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 15, 2021	labels:# How acceptable are tailored shorts really as you get older?  I am reconsidering my outfits for my planned summer vacation in Italy.  I had planned for the daytime white, light blue and light pink slim-fit polo shirts, paired with light blue, pale red, and pale yellow tailored shorts. Boat shoes and Espadrilles for footwear. Basically my tried-and-true combos for hot weather vacays.  But as I reach the tail-end of my late 30s, **I wonder if shorts are appropriate at all anymore**. I always strive to look extremely put together, rarely wear anything without a collar, no denim, etc.  Shall I just wear my night-time outfits (pants and long-sleeve button-down shirts, both in linen or linen-cotton mix, in white and light pastel colors) during the day also?

text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:You're asking a couple of different questions  1) how do I build a style without much time or money?  Pinterest is a good way to do that.  Everytime you do have time and see a look you like pin it.  Pin whatever pleases you visually.  Can be other things besides fashion too.  Then when you have a bunch of things pinned look for a common thread.  Maybe it will turn out that you're a person who never knew she loved organic, flowing shapes in blues or graphic designs and structured fabrics.    2) figure out how well what you like goes with your body type or coloring and if there are ways to bring the two together.  I have a big butt so I may be able to wear some of the things i like and not others.  I also look like crap in orange but can get away with coral so I'd go for coral instead or tiny bits of orange print on a background of a color that does flatter me.  3) Yes there are staples that are classic.  black or navy or gray or for some people brown pants however if you're not a black or navy or gray or brown person you might be better off figuring out what you like first and then what would be a staple for you.	episode_done:True

text:How do you tell when discounted items were never full price?	labels:I don’t have any great suggestions but it seems like this is a problem technology could solve for us (ala CamelCamelCamel) but for some reason it hasn’t?!? I have zero technical knowledge on this, but suspect retailers must be actively doing something to prevent consumers from tracking prices (beyond, like, manually tracking one product at a time by checking the website every day) so that they can run these fake 20% off sales. It’s slimy. If anyone knows of any way around this, sign me up!	episode_done:True
text:Wolf vs Goat Fonzie Goes to India t-shirt Review and Fit	labels:I’ve been looking for the perfect white T-shirt for a while. It’s almost an obsession at this time.  Right now the only T-shirt that checks all the marks, except for price, is Velva Sheen.  Wolf vs Goat seems too gimmicky to enter the list as of yet I tried these brands:  Velva Sheen — perfect but too expensive. Not very soft but I don’t really mind it since it holds its shape/fit is the perfect thickness.  Everlane heavyweight cotton — good but too long.  Naked and famous — too long and expensive ($50)  Uniqlo Supima cotton — too thin, shows my nipples  Taylor stitch heavy weight — too thick for the summer  Taylor stitch hemp cotton blend — too thin, shows my nipples. Nice fit though   Random Amazon heavy weight cotton — too long and loose  Next one one on my list is Kuwalla because they have the same barrel stitching construction as Velva Sheen but much cheaper at roughly $25/tshirt, and it will likely be the last one before I bite the bullet and go full Velva sheen for my tshirts.  Edit:  Just noticed WvG is based in DC. Going to give them a try.

Nevermind the fact that an eco-conscious "organic cotton" t-shirt from H&M still costs less than 15$.	episode_done:True
text:The joy of cordovan—and how to wear and maintain it	labels:Cordovan is an Instagram dream - it’s lustrous and has a ton of color depth. Unfortunately I find  actually wearing it is a different story. It’s extremely stiff and inflexible, especially during the first 20-30 wears. It’s the coldest leather I’ve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I’ve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I’m glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there’s no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.
text:My experience has been different with shell, though it varies by manufacturer.  My Alden and Allen Edmonds shoes were all comfortable out of the box, and I wear them in all temps comfortably (always with relatively thin socks).  Ditto my Carmina plain-toe-bluchers, though admittedly these were purchased second-hand.  My Meermin longwings have always been very stiff.  Five years and they haven't loosened a single bit.  However, they are comfortable.  Then my favorites, the Truman captoe boots, have been pretty soft since day one.  They've weathered a lot over time (due to conditions and general lack of care), but still very comfortable.	labels:Love to see some pictures of the Truman.	episode_done:True

text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:When to start saving clothes for your children?   Never. You don't know:   1. If you'll have children 2. If you'll have a girl or and trans child who would find it appropriate to wear your clothes 3. If they'll even have the same fashion sense as you 4. If they will be the same size as you 5. If your clothes will hold up to the ravages of time   I come from a family of hoarders. I have some hoarding tendencies of my own which I'm dealing with. I'm also in the midst of cleaning out my mum's home after she died almost 2 years ago. I go over every weekend and spend a few hours clearing out her stuff. I've been doing this for going on 18 months. I've spent hundreds of dollars trucking stuff to the dump. I learned the hard way that it's not worth holding onto stuff, *just in case*.  My mother held onto every piece of baby clothing and toddler and children's and a lot of teen clothing I wore. And all of her clothes. And all of my grandmother's clothes. And all of my brothers and sisters and father's clothes. And some of her sister's stuff, too. And you know what it looks like now? Most of it has disintegrated, some chewed up by mice, others damaged by moths, and a lot damaged by mold. Anything that hasn't been destroyed by time has gone to charity. I love my mother, and I have memories from my mother, I don't need her moth-eaten, moldy, brittle leather jacket from 50 years ago. And neither do your kids. Give your stuff away to charity to people who need it now, and don't leave behind boxes of crap for your kids to have to deal with after you're dead. Cleaning out my mother's home is teaching me to be a minimalist.    Put money aside, and use it to buy things your child actually wants. And donate your unwanted clothes to charity to people who need it now.   e: don't even get me started on toys, old school work, books, records, VHS tapes...    e: This is coming from a 41 year old who never had kids (even though she always thought she would).

text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:Zella is a one of Nordstrom’s private label brands that they develop themselves; the Live in Legging (which I’m guessing is the legging you know and love) is a replenishment item that they continually carry inventory of year round and increase their purchasing quantities to support the increase in demand going into the NSale, meaning that you’ll find a mix of inventory that was in their network before the sale started and inventory that flowed in to support the sale. Usually with replenishment items you’re not likely to see a shift in quality or production since the sale is a long planned for event and margin is built in across the year to support the promotion during the sale. Special items that are just purchased for the sale, or for any off price retailer, then yes - absolutely, you’re likely to be getting a lower quality product since buyers and vendors have margin targets they still need to protect so they need to make compromises somewhere when they’re planning to sell the bulk of the units at a discount.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I often buy multiples of items I love. I bought several of the same cardigan after I realized that I wore it more than any other sweater I owned. It's great!  Another thing I do is, when I see an item I like, I mentally run through my closet and see if it will mesh with what I already own. If it works, I get it. If I'd have to buy several new items to make it work, I don't. For this reason, I don't own many t-shirts, but I do own lots of sweaters and dresses.
text:That’s the biggest life lesson I’ve carried on from one of my high school teachers - if you find you truly love an item of clothing, it’s worth the time to go back and get it in every color (that’ll fit your wardrobe).

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:You can find quality items + tailoring for less than $200. Make sure to read what expensive clothes are made out of - just because a shirt costs $200 doesn’t mean it’s good quality. You can also thrift good quality vintage clothing for less than $20.   I bought a blazer almost 5 years ago for around $150, tailored it, and it fits perfectly to this day. Pair that with a white 100% cotton t-shirt from The Gap ($15 max) and a real gold necklace ($$$$$) and you have yourself a business casual outfit for work. My dress pants and jeans are also all tailored.   I would say statement pieces - jewelry, shoes, bags - look cheap if they actually are cheap. Invest in quality leather shoes, an expensive watch, and gold/silver jewelry. I find that some tops and jeans from Forever 21 and Zara don’t look cheap if you tailor them and know how to style them. However if you buy cheap $20 shoes and a $5 fake gold necklace, an expert eye can tell and you’ll look quite tacky.   Just my 5 cents!  ETA: you don’t need to buy $200 items of clothing, but you also can’t buy $10 clothing. You need to find something in the middle. Don’t shop at stores like  Primark, but you can still find a decent blazer or pair of dress pants at Zara or H&M. My personal favourite for work clothes is Banana Republic. Their dress pants are less than $80 and they frequently go on sale. However, do NOT buy statement pieces at these stores as I mentioned before.	episode_done:True

text:Balmacaans are having a moment right now, but they quite as loose, long, or flowy as vintage stuff. Which arguably makes the new stuff more practical, but yeah	labels:I’d argue that the long/loose makes them more practical and utilitarian, as it can provide more warmth and protection against the elements. However it has an older look which may not be what you want. I wear my 40s one with crewnecks and jeans/sneakers and I think it looks fine, even more high end!  But yeah u/eon_of_love a few brands make them now in updated cuts. I don’t know off the top of my head but try Abercrombie, Suit Supply, and Jcrew.

And for less woo woo advice- type of fabric makes a huge difference, the cheaper stuff usually isn't worth it. That's probably applicable to a lot more than women's clothes though.	episode_done:True

I have also noticed that when I wear pieces that I love, my confidence increases throughout the day. Sometimes I have moments in the day where I look down and think "dang, this outfit is cool and I feel cool!" Those moments just give me a boost of confidence all on their own. The last thing is that people are generally too busy with their own lives to notice what you're wearing. They're doing them, so do you and have fun with it!   edit-words

text:Where do you find inspiration for your Outfits?	labels:I follow small stores and artists on Instagram that take my breath away. It's sort of a double-edged sword because then I feel like there are more things I would like to have, but it definitely has helped me feel more decisive about what outfits I feel comfortable and happy in.   I also get inspired by colors in nature, like in certain panoramas or animals, and from music that I like.

text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:They offer a "from scratch" option on the website. Don't start from anything, have them measure you and make that jacket. They're being firmly lazy with you, you have to be firm and demand a good fit.  The store I walked into, the guy promised that their new "custom - from scratch" option included things like armhole size, shoulder slope etc. So that has to be the way to go.  Contact Black Lapel and see if they can do that. If not....  Where are you? Kent Wang MTM offers a *ton* of options, but it's NYC only. There's Spier and Mackay, Imparali... What's your budget, around $1200?
text:Thank you for this!  As an update, I spoke to SS HQ this morning. They canceled and refunded me. The representative told me that MTM is no longer in existence. I told them it still says it is available in select markets on their website and they stated that what they offer now is call, "Advanced Alterations" internally and is branded, "Custom Made".  I clarified that with them because it was a shock to me.  My prior suit was purchased under their true MTM program which no longer exists.  The new advances alterations platform does include armhole height, sleeve circumference, waist, chest, shoulder so it doesn't seem like much is being lost. My feedback to them was that the rep should still measure you and should customize every measurement because what are the chances that I happen to be exactly the same waist, chest and shoulder as your 42" pattern. She thanked me for the feedback and said the experience should still include full measurement, but something has been lost in translation as they roll out the new platform.   For a suit I can go $1200, but I'd like to get a blazer done under the SS price of $650.  The most I've ever paid for a suit is $1500 and that was Alan David NY.  I loved their work, but they get expensive fast when you start looking at nicer fabrics. I'm still considering going to another SS and getting properly fitted via this program because I like the totally unstructured shoulder for this more casual blazer.   Does Kent Wang travel or do I have to come to them?	labels:Traveling tailors are hard to find on even a $1500 budget... This would be easier if you could tell me what the nearest city was.
text:Orlando. I flew to NYC for Alan David and willing to do so again, but that turns a $1500 suit into a much more expensive one, obviously.	labels:Yeah... I don't know many shops in Orlando. Supply and Advise is a great store in Miami, next time you're there, but I'm not sure if they do anything MTM.  For NYC... You could always just go and get measurements on file at a few places. Kent Wang, black Lapel, the Armoury, Mr. Ned, Martin Greenfield, Imparali, et cetera. And visit No Man Walks Alone and Turnbull and Asser and Meermin and Carmina and... We've got a pretty large number of menswear stores worth visiting.  Buuut I wouldn't fly up for just one jacket. Get a tailor to measure the shit out of you, tip him $10-20, and keep those measurements on file, they're yours, you won't lose them like SS did. Then try to get a shirt mtm online (Spier and Mackay, Proper Cloth, Luxire, Black Lapel, Alton Lane...) And see how that goes for you. Online MTM suiting is trickier, but you know... Give it a try.
text:I like the idea of a trip to NYC and getting measured at a number of places...thanks for the advice. I'll check these places out.	labels:Don't *just* go for the menswear though. There are plenty of great restaurants, bars, museums, and parks there too. Make the trip count!

text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:I agree with the comments that suggested thinking about how often you’ll wear it, more so than the price. I used to prioritize price, but ended up with low quality clothes that just didn’t last. Now i find myself passing on some items even if they’re really cheap, just because it seems like it won’t last. I try to pick clothes by their fabric composition and pay attention to the details (stitching, closures, etc). For jeans I look for as high % cotton as possible. I like linen, rayon, modal and cotton for other pieces. I usually avoid nylon-y and thin, fast-fashion pieces. Then I think about whether that store usually has sales, if so, I wait. I very rarely get anything full price because there’s always some sale!   I’m usually willing to spend more on “core” pieces that I’ll wear all the time, like a coat, jeans, or work pants/shoes. For statement pieces or trendy shirts I usually wouldn’t spend that much. I think it just depends on how many ways you can style that item.  As for a&f and hollister - I have personally found really great quality clothes there. For a&f i love their linen pieces, jeans, pants and sweaters. They also have awesome sales. As an example, in september i got 2 sweaters for like 15 each, jeans for 40, and pants for 20ish from there, all really good quality, and I wear them often. For hollister, it can be hit or miss since it’s more casual, but I have blouses and jackets from there from several years ago still look new, but they weren’t expensive. Sorry for ranting lol!	episode_done:True
text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:I think it doesn’t make a lot of sense to think of resale value for an object that gets worn and is subject to a lot of wear and tear with usage. How would you feel if you stain or rip or stretch out some garment you plan to resell later? It doesn’t make a lot of sense to me!  But the clothes you like and wear them. When you no longer like them or they not longer fit, pick a sustainable way to dispose of it then.	episode_done:True

text:Your Go-To Tee Is Actually a Turtleneck	labels:Not tried turtleneck tees but I own a couple of turtleneck sweaters (a thin merino from uniqlo and a thicker one from H&M) and even the thinnest one is too warm. I only wear them as an alternative to a scarf if I know I'm going to be outside all day and it's freezing cold. As soon as I go inside it's just _too_ hot, I feel like I'm going to pass out. It's like wearing a winter jacket and scarf in a sauna.
text:I've had similar experiences with wool turtlenecks, which is actually why I own a lot of turtleneck tees instead - they look almost the same as wool but are much less suffocating.	labels:did you have issues with turtleneck tee collars stretching too much?
text:No, not so far! I have only had them for a couple of years so it's possible this could change, but the collars haven't stretched out noticeably at all. These are the uniqlo soft touch turtleneck tees, for reference.	labels:oh thats good!  I have a uniqlo merino wool turtleneck sweater, and after like 3 months the collar stretched like 40 centimeters.  so now its lightly hugging my neck.  i prefer it that way but worried if it'll stretch even more, by which case it'll be a limp collar and then weird.  was wondering if the tees hold up better since its more tightly knit	episode_done:True
text:How many distinctly different outfits do you have?	labels:I don’t think you should have to change unless you wanted to:) You sound like you have a fantastic wardrobe that works for you and brings you joy. I also love neutrals, wines, and forest greens and I don’t think there is anything wrong with it!   Perhaps some people might not notice, but the same people may not notice even if you had a diverse wardrobe because they may not be too interested in clothing in general. So please don’t let that discourage you.  I think it’s lovely how you pick clothes that have details that set them apart from others, and I think the people you meet often or people who enjoy style and clothing may notice and appreciate the differences.   There is also quite a large capsule wardrobe community these days so you might find that interesting. Everyone does it a little differently so you might want to browse around a bit to find someone who does something similar (some are more rigid than others), but capsule wardrobes tend to have focus on quality over quantity, and appreciating the smaller details. Maybe you’ll find some inspiration without any pressure of having to drastically change your wardrobe;)	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 13, 2021	labels:Bought a little too big wool coat recently. Would it work to shrink it by putting it in the washing machine instead of tailoring it?
text:You shouldn't. It probably won't shrink evenly, especially not something as big as a coat. Shrinking in the wash is basically always a bad idea.  If it's just a little too big, it might also look fine. Big coats are in right now.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 02, 2021	labels:I'm proud to say that I was successful completing my new year's resolution from 2020 of not purchasing any new clothing. I had made the exception of new socks and underwear, but I purchased a bunch at the end of 2019 and they managed to last me for the year.   I chose the goal initially to try and cut down on my waste. I'm a very impulsive person who makes very impulsive purchases and a lot of what I was buying was going practically untouched. I had also seen the patriot act episode regarding fast fashion and that was the final nail in the coffin. The beginning was the hardest—especially once the spring/summer sales started. I found that after a couple of days I'd forget about the sale and eventually I stopped even looking at clothes online and hunting for sales.  The effects from the resolution carried over to other aspects of my life. I found I was more conscientious of other products I was buying. I spent time researching environmental effects and labour practices of all sorts of different companies. I have been a lot more mindful of where my money is being spent. I cancelled my amazon prime subscription and have opted to shop locally as much as possible, but if not, spending my money at small independent online retailers.   At Christmas I did purchased my dad a new Reigning Champ sweater from NRML, an independent store in Ottawa. I made this exception  because it sets up my 2021 resolution—the only new clothes I can buy are slow made, or made in Canada/USA. I think this embodies the spirit of my 2020 resolution but doesn't restrict me from supporting smaller designers.

text:What are your favorite outfits to wear with white booties?	labels:I like wearing bold colored dresses or wide legged blue jeans with white booties. And no, I don’t think the white shoes thing is a rule anymore.  I kind of regret mine though, even though it was a super deal so I wouldn’t be losing much money, it’s harder to keep clean than white sneakers and for some reason (maybe the shoe shape or how I walk) keeps picking up black and grey marks. I guess my white leather sneakers still have an inch of rubber sole wrapped around it for minor scruff protection but my booties are all white leather all exposed =[
text:Do you use nail polish remover on the marks? It works for me.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items are my Native American Turquoise jewelry and my cowboy boots. Just purchased a huge $900 squash blossom necklace and have worn it constantly. My boots range from $30 for a secondhand pair to $750 for custom made and none are worn more or less than the others.  When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was “saving for good”. Ironically, “good” apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I’m just out running errands.
text:I really love the southwestern, Native American traditional styles and bohemian, cowgirl styles. I grew up/live nowhere near the southwest USA and don't have that particular lifestyle, but I'm trying to incorporate into my personal style nonetheless. I am starting to build a collection of silver and turquoise jewelry. It's nice to hear that you appreciate your turquoise jewelry too!	labels:I’ve loved that vibe since I was in college and I’m older now so the draw of that style has never gone away, just become more refined over the years. My wardrobe is awesome now, having been curated over several decades, and I look forward to wearing it right to the end.⚰️	episode_done:True
text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:T shirts and jeans are a great staple and can be totally changed up. I basically only wear t shirts and jeans too, but I’ll change it up a bit with different shoes - Chelsea boots, sneakers, timberland boots, loafers.   Also, different Jean types, tops and jewelry can change up your look while still maintaining the “t shirt and jeans” style.   I love to wear (and make) chunky gold jewelry that are cool accessories to laid back looks.	episode_done:True

text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:Here's the best advice I've ever heard in my life: No one is looking at you, thinking about you, critiquing you as much as you think they are.  Everyone is busy looking at, thinking about, critiquing themselves.  So wear what makes you happy! Try new things!   Edited for concision.

text:[Inspiration] Sculptural Jewelry	labels:FAQ:  * "Why did you make this album?" I saw u/mcqueenofthehill's jewelry album yesterday and decided to share mine. His is practical wearable everyday jewelry, mine is all over the top extravagant absurd cocktail jewelry.  * "Are you stealing this format from /u/cdot5 and u/mcqueenofthehill?" Yes.  * "Why is this on a sub for men's fashion advice?" This album is inspiration, not advice. I'm not suggesting anyone wear this if they don't want to. This stuff isn't for everyday wear or even traditional men's cocktail attire. But if your style is out there you can make it work on occasion. I plan to get a couple of these eventually (if the artists ever reply to me).  * "It looks ridiculous/like a costume. No one will take you seriously." The necklaces in particular are **really** out there. But I wouldn't wear any of this to work or anywhere I need to be taken seriously. But if I'm going to a party or a play and I want to dress up, something like these pieces would be fun.   * "But this is women's clothing!" Yes. I wear womenswear. I combine it with menswear. You don't have to if you don't want to.  * "This may be cool on the runway, but nobody would leave the house like this!" I would.  * "Who makes these?" Orr, Cheryl Eve Acosta, Sara Barbanti, Wendy Yue, Leyla Abdollahi are the ones who have functioning web stores and/or stockists.   * "Is this a comprehensive compilation?" No. But this kind of stuff is really hard to find.

text:Can we make a thread of everyone posting their all time favorite Halloween costume they wore? 🎃👻	labels:What’s keeping you from dressing up for Halloween?

You can still dress up at home and have fun with those you live with or just by yourself.	episode_done:True

text:As a Canadian I refuse to get rid of my skinny jeans. Half the year is spent surrounded by snow, slush, and gritty slime. I have to tuck my pants into tall boots. I remember when flares were super in when I was a kid/young teen and all my friends and I would be wandering around with these sopping wet pants slapping around our ankles. Never again.	labels:I remember my too-long flared jeans wet and tattered in middle-school. I’ll invite the devil in and make him tea before I go back.	episode_done:True
text:Let's Talk about hats	labels:There is hat etiquette from the days of yore. Here are some of the conventions that were adhered to:  A lady does not remove her hat when indoors or for the national anthem. This is in contrast to men, who are to remove hats when indoors and for the anthem. However, if you‘re sporting a baseball cap at a ballgame, I would remove it for the anthem, whereas if you were wearing a more formal outfit with hat then I would not remove it.  A hat is a daytime piece in most cases not suitable for evening wear. The fascinator is an exception to this rule, but is more of a Commonwealth/British thing.  A lady does not wear a hat in her own home, ie when receiving guests, and as a guest in a friend’s home a lady would remove her hat.

text:For those who define their style as "classic-traditional" (tailored, fitted, matching, sleek), what are your typical outfits for work, on the weekends, date-night, running errands or lounging around?	labels:I’ve pretty much been something along the lines of modern preppy, though I am incorporating more things as I get older (I am early 40s). I wear a lot of dresses and skirts. Weekend and workdays.   My offices have been casual for around a decade now, so work wardrobe has merged with weekend.  I tend to be more dressed up than my peers.   In the old days my weekend looks were basically less structured versions of my work looks. So instead of a pencil skirt I’d wear a stretchy tube skirt that functioned like a pencil skirt with more ease. If I wore jeans, I paired it with a blouse and cardigan depending on the weather.   Now I am kinda in hiatus from pencil skirts and that shape altogether. But the same idea applies, add a casual element.    I’ll wear a work friendly skirt on the weekend with a tee shirt, probably a graphic on.  Or a more casual tank top. Today I have on straight jeans and a floral blouse. I like t-shirt dresses, and will pair them with a nicer third piece: cardigan, bomber, or maybe a blazer. I love things like a jersey jumpsuit. Or a knit one.  It has a lot of ease and drape and adds a bit of polish. My “weekend” dresses are the same shapes as the work version, but with a casual fabric. Maybe that means a cotton shirt dress instead of a more structured one.   I wear a lot of flats but have also been embracing Birkenstock’s for some outfits.    My weekend purses still have a bit of structure, because that is my preference.   And to keep my outfits kosher for my casual workplace, I always pair something dressy with something casual. And that is a good rule for weekends too.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop for specific things without google clogging up with items from fast fashion? Or. How do you find the real designer of a fast fashion item?	labels:I’d honestly suggest using Depop or Poshmark. Most of if not all of the results are second hand so it’s less likely to be fast fashion. Fast fashion definitely makes it way in there but you can raise your price bar to around $10+ or $15+ to weed all those out.
text:What depop are *you* on? From where I'm standing, Depop is 80% fast fashion being sold for near full-price, and way more than $10 lol.	labels:Maybe I’m just good at finding the not fast fashion then	episode_done:True

text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:I buy almost everything from thrift shops. I keep a list of items I'm looking to buy (black turtleneck, navy sweater vest, etc), on my phone. Whenever I'm near a thrift shop, I stop in to check for those items only.   I have a lot of success this way and I spend very little time shopping.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:The present always feels “neutral”. I think if you watch any reality show from the early 2010s, even as late as 2014-15, you’ll see a big difference from what was considered “no defining silhouette” then. things like just a tshirt change slightly in cut and shape over time.
text:People should watch old seasons of the bachelor if they don’t believe this. Professionally styled TV glosses over or tones down some of the trends you forgot about. The ladies of reality TV, on the other hand, really deliver.	labels:Definitely. I watched Ben F.'s season (2012) and was stunned at the difference. Even myself, 10 years ago I wore short sweater dresses with Uggs and tights.	episode_done:True
text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I think they can work as long as you consider how they fit with your outfit and the colour palette.  A coworker wore a lovely green scarf tied loosely around her ponytail once and the rest of her outfit was grey/black and simple. It looked great. Had she worn a bright blue dress and bright red lipstick with it, maybe not, at least in a professional environment.  Some women get away with dressing a bit eccentric, but I’d say they’re almost always in a senior role, near retiring or very young. I say ‘get away with’ because we technically have no dress code, aside from something really inappropriate.  Intend to stick to neutrals and darker colours. I have a few plain tops in bright colours, but I always pair them with very simple and plain items. It’s not that dislike them, but they require more thought!	episode_done:True
