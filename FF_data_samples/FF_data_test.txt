text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:I am not saving any of my clothes specifically for my child. I only have a son so it's unlikely he'd want to wear or fit into my clothes anyways. I am saving the sweaters I knit for him. I do have a few keepsake sort of things I'm hanging onto that he's welcome to if he wants. The dress I was wearing when I met his dad, and a silver ring I wore the last month of pregnancy because my fingers got puffy.  My MIL gave me some of old kilts of my husbands and I will save those as my son grows out of them. I guess it depends on the amount of storage space you have and how often you move? If you have something special that you feel sentimental about and keeping it isn't an inconvenience to you, go ahead.	episode_done:True
text:Looking for aesthetically pleasing pajamas	labels:This is a bit on the cutsier side but in Australia we have a brand called Peter Alexander thats dedicated to pyjamas
text:I was going to suggest them too. I have a nighty from them that I wore until it basically fell apart (afer about 4 years - probably from washing on a regular cycle rather than delicate) .I am going to take a pattern off it to try and recreate it because they don't make that shape anymore!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:Very narrow shoes that aren't ugly and expensive. I'm somewhere narrower than a standard narrow, and I'm basically stuck wearing lace-up shoes and sandals with certain types of straps. It's been a problem my whole life, and I'm wondering if I'll end up with foot problems later because nothing fits. (If anyone has suggestions, please send them my way.)

text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:I'm actually going on a no buy for clothing, shoes, and accessories in 2021.  My lone exception is that when my athletic shoes wear out, they will be replaced (as wearing dead athletic shoes hurts your feet).    I have a full closet and TBH too many clothes.  Stopping the inflow will help me get things under control.  And I may have to move at the end of 2021 depending on my WFH situation so less stuff means less stuff to move.	episode_done:True
text:Revisiting Fall Favorites: Barbour Jackets pt 3	labels:Fall? It was 32F this morning in NYC. Where's the winter collection.  I do like me some Barbour. Nice album.
text:Was Fall ever a thing? Like...I remember fall being a season when I was a kid, but now it lasts like 2 weeks.	labels:North Carolina sort of had a fall. It was about 65-75F for a while (kinda late summer though) then suddenly it dropped to sub 40F in the last week. A week ago I was wondering if a flannel was too warm, yesterday I went out in the same outfit and regretted everything.
text:Not where I am In NC. We had 3 days where it was 60-70 then the next day it was back in the 80s for a week, then it dropped to the 50s for 3 days, then back up to the 80s, and now we're in the 40-50s again. Fall doesn't exist here. It's just winter/summer/winter/summer until your body doesn't know what is happening and you fell like you're gonna be sick from all the back and forth.	labels:God, that so accurate. I've had to switch from heat to a/c every other night the last two weeks.	episode_done:True
text:What are you most comfortable clothing items (cute or not)?	labels:Not a clothing item but my husband got me a Pendleton wool blanket for Christmas, and it is the most comfortable blanket that I've had. It's twin size but we use it on the couch, and it's perfect for Netflix binging and lazy working lol
text:I recently got a pile-lined fleece throw blanket from Uniqlo.  On especially cold days, I place it \*under\* my top sheet so it's directly on my skin and OMG...it feels so warm and comfortable!  I actually sleep better with this blanket.  The other great thing about this blanket is that it has snaps so you can wear it over your shoulders around the house...so I guess you can count it as a clothing item!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:So I would consider Zara fast fashion because on a biweekly basis they list new items on their website and receive new items in stores. The amount of clothing and accessories they churn out in a season would make me characterize them as fast fashion.  I however, love checking their app twice a week to see what's new. I am not buying on a biweekly basis however I do make updates to my wardrobe each season.  While I love this about Zara, it is an issue. Do we really need that much new stuff each season? It also creates this mentality in my mind that I need to have everything now. Zara can deliver everything now, in I am certain an unethical way, whereas a smaller, independent, more ethical clothing line, cannot deliver that.  So I am a part of the problem. However I am not getting rid of my Zara stuff each year. It all generally lasts me upwards of 3 years	episode_done:True

text:Thanksgiving Outfits	labels:I don't understand the question. Aren't the holidays 100% about conforming to whatever your family wants of you with zero choice in the matter?     Am somewhat joking, but coming from an abusive background I've never even conceptualized holidays as "for me" in any way. Which, in some sense, is freeing. I don't treat Thanksgiving like anything because the day is, away from the abusive family, essentially meaningless to me.     Apologies if that's a bit too heavy or off-topic. Could've just left this thread. I just, maybe as something to take away for others, it's a reminder to find one's own way and validate doing what makes you feel happy if you have the kind of spaces that allow for that.	episode_done:True
text:[NEWS]Yohji Yamamoto launches 2nd capsule collection with horror master Junji Ito	labels:It would have been cool if he could somehow reinterpret the horror genre into the actual form/structure/patterning of the garments rather than just graphics.  Not that I have any idea how that would be done.
text:I think it's a very fair reinterpration of Ito's work actually, same story structure :  - very strong story intro  - damn this is sick  - wait that's the end ? where's the rest	labels:Ito's work is a critique of Japanise social norms and presssures, delivered as body horror comics. It's a nice idea to pair it with fashion, since the many niche fashion gang in Japan works on a similiar vein; be something else than the norm.  This execution is piss poor though.  &#x200B;  edit: but i guess it's fitting, since the people who think those mangas are just "some weird random shit with spirals lol" are the same who unironically enjoy pieces like these.
text:I don't know why you are downvoted, I unironically enjoy Ito's work, but I 100% agree. His only palatable (and most famous for a reason) story is Uzumaki because there's an actual beginning, middle and end. 99% of his shorts you reach the last page and are left hungry.	labels:the endings are defo abrupt, but cosmic horror is by it's nature is something that will leave you without answers or closure.	episode_done:True

text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:I discovered last year that drying clothes in a dryer was roughly equivalent to wearing them 10 times (5 minutes in dryer = 1 all-day wear).   Air drying my clothes makes them look so much sharper for longer, and overall just last a lot longer. My jeans now last at least 3x as long.	episode_done:True

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:I spent like two months investing in a bunch of nice wool sweaters that I could wear through the winter, put them in a separate laundry bin after wearing so I could launder them myself, but my ex washed and dried them on high heat and they all shrunk so badly that I couldn't even fit them on my dog.

text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Nothing polyester ever. I'm working towards a wardrobe in all natural fibers. I'll wear blends that contain lycra or spandex in small amounts, but absolutely no polyester.
text:Yessss!! I'm on a similar journey and I don't miss or think about \*any\* of the many synthetic clothes I got rid of. I still have a few loved synthetic pieces that just look amazing on me, so I kept those.

I'm 27, so just old enough to remember my own mom wearing this style. The pants make me feel ugly and frumpy, not trendy.  They're now the only jeans I have that don't have a hole between the thighs, and it's way to cold were air live to be outside in leggings right now, so I wear them almost every time I have to leave the house.  I don't think they look good on me, and they're slightly cropped so I have to wear big thick socks to keep my ankles warm. They're that awkward not-quite cropped, not full length type business. Oh, and they're also a size too big, so I constantly have to pull them up?   Why did I buy these??	episode_done:True

I've always walked to class / for commute and waterproof footwear is a game changer. Honestly I think soggy feet should be banned, no one should have to suffer that!   Nowadays I have a pair of office appropriate waterproof boots and a pair of semi-hiking boots and my toes never have to feel the horror that is wet socks.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 17, 2020	labels:How do I layer my pants in winters? I am from a place where it drops to -25 C in winters so I layer my tops  in a way that I can take off any number of layers when I go indoors (and  still look presentable). For example, if the heat is really high indoors, I  will dress down to my last layer which is usually a decent t-shirt.  But how do I layer pants? I mean I cant wear a pant beneath a pant, right?. The  only thing I can do is wear long johns beneath the pant, which doesnt  work for me coz I cant take my pants off and walk around in long johns.
text:\-25C is survival temperatures. I am not sure there is an answer besides wearing long-johns or performance leggings.

Not because it's a bad skirt, it's really beautifully made and gorgeous... but I literally haven't had a chance to wear it once. So it sits in my closet looking sad and beautiful and useless.

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:When I realize there's something in my closet I'm not wearing, it's usually because there's something wrong/missing from it. So I do whatever I have to do to eliminate the obstacle. I'll find something to layer underneath/on top of it and put those two things on the same hanger as one garment that is more wearable (ie a sleeveless tunic that needs to be layered over a longsleeved shirt or a sweater dress that looks dumb without a belt). Or in extreme cases, I will paint it, crop it, chop the sleeves off, rip top stitching out for a looser fit or cut a slit up the center so I can tie it.  Also, I fee like a grandma librarian saying this, but I spent 5$ at goodwill on a skirt slip that is an absolute game changer- warmer and my skirt doesn't cling to my tights. Same with a padded camisole- more comfortable and warmer than a bra- it makes thinner sweaters and blouses an option for colder days. Underwear is apparently important.

text:Using Pinterest to Help Find Your Style (or: how to tell Pinterest it is no longer 2012)	labels:These are really good points, I think I was doing some of them because I found out that Pinterest was helping me learn more about some designers and have them "saved" in my boards.  What I do is I have styling boards for seasons right now they are "autumn-winter" and "spring-summer" but I'm going to separate them because where I live summer is its own season with very extreme temperatures. I have a subcategory in the boards for colour, so I can pin outfits and inspiration which have the colours I'm looking for even if it isn't necessarily the shape or garment I like.  I also have another more inspirational but I don't use it that often, maybe for "saving" haute couture or really fancy designs.  What I've been doing recently is editing my boards because I found a lot of pins I don't like anymore. I'm trying to improve my wardrobe and tune my style and I revisit them often, so editing makes a lot of sense for me.	episode_done:True

text:What is something you've heard as fashion advice that isn't worth following?	labels:Anything regarding pantyhoes and heels as requirements in a professional workplace. It just seems sexist, old fashioned, and no longer relevant. Ymmv.

text:When I was a high school teacher in Texas we would frequently get angry emails from the Principal about how women need to wear pantyhose with their skirts/dresses.

text:I was a Sperry's boots, Hunters were too wide. No umbrella, I'm not a pants person so warm sweater dresses. Scarf, beanie.  I'll admit, sometimes I did the shower cap trick under the beanie. I could keep my hair from tangling in the wind if I was wearing it down, slide it off in ladies' room at work, and sometimes I just wanted my head extra warm.	labels:>the shower cap trick under the beanie  That's brilliant. I wish I'd thought of that when I lived in Scotland. I looked like a drowned, half-frozen rat half the time.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 03, 2021	labels:Looking to take advantage of some Todd Snyder sale stuff.  I already have champion collab stuff (hoodie and a couple pocket sweatshirts).  Are there any must haves from TS?  Could be collabs or just TS stuff.  Tia!
text:LL Bean was a big collab. A bit hit or miss for me. Some pieces were cool. If you get on the list for a paper catalog you get $100 off coupons every season or so	labels:Thanks!

text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:I'm not sure where the dividing line is between leggings, workout pants, and actual pants. I bought a pair of what Costco calls ' Skechers Ladies' High Waist Pants', I would call them leggings.  I wore them a couple of times and just went back for another 2 pairs.  Costco has them in grey, black, and burgundy. $19.99 with a $4.00 off at checkout ($2.00 more on-line).  4 slim pockets. Perfect length for me. From XS to XXL, and Costco sizes generously. A slight compression feel, so snug-fitting. They are so much nicer than they look online. I don't wear them with a tucked-in shirt - perfect for flannel shirts, button-downs, longer Ts etc. I'm wfh and they are so comfortable,	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:When I had to buy business/work clothes, I invested in a really nice, fitted black suit, a couple of collared shirts, and a pair of flats. Those were my basic essentials that I knew I could mix and match with a lot of stuff. Everything else I picked up at Goodwill.   My coworkers commented on my cute clothes so I think it was a great strategy. I collected a pretty huge work closet for practically pennies.  After that, I've never had a clothing budget. My closet is a pretty good deterrent of overspending because I hate clutter and I hate having a crammed closet so if I think I dont have room and an item I'm looking at isn't worth creating room in my closet, I dont buy it.	episode_done:True
text:Inspo Album: Mellow Yellow	labels:This is a wonderful album, thank you.  There are many unusual silhouettes that I love and would like to see more of.

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I am a very ordinary person so take this with a grain of salt. What I would do is a commitment to wear sth "new" every day. It's just not how you put it on and look at the mirror, but it also has to do with how you feel in it all day long.   Sometimes it's gonna work, sometimes it won't but you can have fun with your wardrobe everyday and hopefully you will find what goes well with what you have inside that huge wardrobe.   You are young so you can be daring.  You will be surprised.  Good luck and happy trying :)	episode_done:True

text:Is there actual visible damage or are you just worried?	labels:Worried.	episode_done:True
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:I think whats popular now is more late 90s and Y2k as opposed to like 2005. I'm currently watching the Real Housewives of Orange County and the style is basically extremely low rise flare jeans, layered camis, empire waist flowy blouses with giant cross necklaces, and halter tops. It's giving me traumatic flashbacks of middle school. I do have to say I kind of like the blonde hair on the outside black on the inside style.
text:Oh god the empire waist shirts.  I always thought they looked so good on me since I could show off my chest and the smallest part of my body is right where the empire belt sits right below the chest.  And I got so offended when people asked if I was pregnant.    Looking back they were not a good look on me.  Especially since mine were all in terrible like shiny polyester fabrics from like Kohl's or Dress Barn with weird patterns.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else always hesitate to buy what they truly love because they don't have a social life?	labels:Outside of Covid,  I am perfectly happy to wear fancier than necessary clothes to work out while running errands.

I just want to wear a ball gown once a year,  is that too much to ask?
text:Once covid is over look on Eventbrite for charity events or browse other sections for black tie stuff :) my boyfriend and I have made it a point up through this year to attend stuff like that for fun (he likes to get dressed up too).

I'm normally an L-XL in women's tops, and now there is this one blouse where the model is around three sizes smaller than me (according to measurements) and they say she's wearing an XXXS (?!). So I guess I should order an S.  Ah, UPS is going to get some back and forth shipping business out of that one.	episode_done:True
text:What’s your everyday purse?	labels:Status Anxiety has great everyday bags. I have the 'force of being' bag. Super great quality and the price is good.	episode_done:True
text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:I think basically all brands are way crappier now. But Old Navy has really upped its level of style in the past few years. It is way more on trend.  I went on a shopping spree over the past couple of weeks, and had picked up some things from Gap and Banana Republic - for the first time in ages. They were all crappy! The fabric was either thin or weirdly stiff.   On the other hand I was pleasantly surprised by Banana Republic Factory - the styles seem nicer and the fabric is better than I remember.   I do not completely agree about u/IdBeCool_inThe90s's assessment of Coach. They were making nice bags over the last 20 years - but not all places and stores had equal access. What is newer - over the last 5 years or so - is that way more bags are available with leather lining. That did't happen before, and they brought it back when they launched the "1941" and Coach Classics lines. Now I do not want to buy a bag without a leather lining!
text:Same for Old Navy! I ignored them for years because I was scarred by all the American flag shirts from there as a child, but they're really stepping it up. I love the Stevie pants and their t-shirts. The jeans are hit and miss for me, I definitely can't just go in and buy without trying on. I just wish they put their active wear on sale as often as the rest of the store!	labels:The American flags! I used to buy lots of holiday themed clothing there right after the holiday for a steal. Like valentine's day pj shorts for less than a dollar.

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:I'm borderline X/millennial.   I see Gen Z wearing styles that I remember from middle school.  Things like baggier jeans, the high waisted trend (my early 20s was defined by low waisted pants), oversized clothing (think Billie Eilish), etc.  I see some of these styles and think "this should have stayed in the 90s".  The example I think about is Mom jeans.  Many millennials still remember the SNL skit where they made fun of them and how unflattering they are.  They made them look matronly and dowdy.  I can't bring myself to even go near them in the store without that SNL skit playing in my head.
text:Yes exactly! This is the same reason that I can't bring myself to buy a fanny pack. No judging anyone who likes them. I just happen to remember a time when they were considered very uncool	labels:Yes fanny packs scream "retiree tourist" to me and always will.	episode_done:True

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom taught me basically everything I know about fashion/style! She has a very classic/classy style which I resisted for a long time (because I wanted to keep up with trends like ripped jeans) but now that I'm in my mid-twenties, we trade clothes and have a very similar style. She always seemed overdressed in our Florida home (she's not American, and also wears heels 90% of the time) but now that I live in a city, I appreciate her style a lot more.   What she didn't teach me was how to have fun with fashion and be expressive with it so maybe one day I'll venture into that.	episode_done:True

text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:Clothes are never ever an investment. With the extremely few exceptions like Birkins and limited edition Chanel bags or stuff like that, it's not a thing.   Clothes will not retain their value and it's naive to think that you can buy something and expect to recoup more than half your money after *5 years* of wearing it. Especially since it's probably already a few years old when you buy it.  Pret a porter does not do as well as bags on the resale market. No one gives a shit that your old cardigan is designer because in another 5 years it will not only be worn out, it will be really outdated. If someone is paying hundreds for one single item, they're not buying worn from a collection 10 years ago AND still be willing to pay half the original price.

text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Skirt length - if it's going to make me pull a 2007 Britney Spears every time I get out of the car, nope.   (Additionally, clinginess that might make it become too short - if it requires me to shimmy it back down every time I stand up or walk 10 feet, nope.)  See-through anything - I don't want to buy something extra to wear under a shirt or dress. It ruins what I thought the piece would look like most of the time. It's more laundry and more clothing to put on. Most of the time it has to be a bralette or something else tight/supportive and I just don't want to wear that ish anymore.	episode_done:True

text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:Volume (a lot of items) and access (lots of designer things) doesn't create personal style. Personal style creates personal style, and it is a huge spectrum of things. There is no "one up" in personal style when it is authentic and your own. You'd simply appreciate all the style around you as its own, and appreciate and focus on your own style and look. Most people on social media have tacky, pointless style. They're wearing clothing, etc. for likes and clicks. The problem with this is that it means you're always cycling through what generates likes and clicks - not what is unique and stylish about you. You don't need new clothes. You don't need to change. You need to recognize your style and own it, and find the validation in it how it comes versus mirroring/measuring it to someone who is operating for validation and attention.	episode_done:True
text:WEEKLY DEALZ	labels:I am still reeling from the Nordstrom rack sales on Everlane items. They are so good. The sneakers are really good quality for 19 bucks, and I do see sizes come back, if you check daily. I bought a pair for myself and a pair for my friend.  I also bought a few clothing items that is taking forever to ship though. I might cancel some of them and wait out the rest. I mean, 30ish bucks for dresses/jumpsuits and 40s for cashmere is a pretty good deal, and it's not like Everlane's style is gonna change much. They sell the same shit year in and year out.

I'm part of the hype train myself.   Just as a general advice, I'd avoid putting that sweatshirt in the dryer if possible. Their "softAF" fabric has a tendency to pill over time and the dryer will accelerate that.

text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:Madewell - I ordered a plain black t shirt during covid just for lounging and the thing literally had a hole already in the front when it arrived.  Aritzia - I've been shopping there for well over a decade and while you really can't compare fabric from so long ago (it's incomparable imo) even just the stitching is becoming obviously bad. Last winter I saw a blazer, still on the rack in store, with threads already sticking out at the shoulder seam. Absolutely ridiculous. However, I will say their peacoats have turned around a bit - not what they used to be but a couple years ago they looked like they were made out of felt and definitely have gotten better since then.  American Eagle - I really like the new curvy fit of their jeans, 10/10, and I feel like the aerie underwear quality has gotten better, the last couple of years the material had gone downhill.

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:Back when I did online dating and went on lots of first dates, I tended to keep it super casual and then just have one really flashy thing.

If they wanted to go somewhere fancy, I just always talked them down into my comfort zone (i.e. a bar where all the staff know me, at least by sight) and will try to keep me safe if I need it.

text:What niche do you feel is missing from the fashion blogging/YouTube world?	labels:Have you checked out Allison Bornstein? Her style leans refined, professional, and easy. She has EXTREMELY HELPFUL edits on her Instagram and website on how to use fashion pieces. She pulls in dozens of examples from all different price points and shows how they look on different body types. She even recommends different cuts based on body types. As a professional woman in my late 20s, I've found her hands down the most stylish, yet professional "influencer." She's actually a professional stylist (Katie Holmes is a big client of hers!). She does virtual styling appointments for regular nobodies (like me) where she helps you figure out how to wear pieces in your wardrobe and sends you a bunch of pieces she thinks would really add versatility. She's all about maximizing the wear out of a few pieces. Finding her this year has dramatically changed how I approach clothes!

text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:I recently read The Curated Closet by Anushka Rees, and one thing that is a really interesting idea, which I'm in the middle of doing, is to take note of what you do during the waking hours every day for two weeks.   Mine is, so far: work from home (5hrs/day), chill at home/housework (3hrs/day), walk/hike with the dog (2 hrs/day), exercise (30 min-1 hr/day), errands (2-3hrs/week), date night/day (3 hrs/week), visit friends /family (3 hrs/week), go to birthday party/snazzy event (though during covid, they are all virtual, 2hrs/two weeks). And so, my closet should reflect the percentage of the above categories.   Understanding and making my closet mimic my own daily use, I hope will make my closet easier to manage.   The author also gives guidance on how to purge your closet.  I recommend giving the book a peruse, I borrowed it from my local library.	episode_done:True

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:Secondhand all the way! 90% of my wardrobe is secondhand. Poshmark, ebay, depop, thredup, the list goes on. Thrifting too!
text:Which of those apps do you prefer the most? I currently have depop, but the clothes for the brands I like are always either pretty expensive or bad.	labels:Depop is so hard to use IMO. I like Poshmark and eBay. Ebay is nice because you can save searches.	episode_done:True
text:What’s something you wish you could tell clothing manufacturers to do differently?	labels:It might be just a preference, but, I would prefer it if shirts were less baggy. They are all boxy, and the only once that go in at the waist are too tight everywhere else. Maybe I'm shopping at the wrong places or something lol but I wish my waist was warm for once

Died from carbohydrate overdose.  You might see this as a tragedy, but you'd be wrong. People go nuts for me as a ghost. No one gets spooked by the image of a pre-showered girl in ugly socks pulled up past her ankles, even if she is see through. My presence is announced with the scent of fresh oven chips.

I really love the midi/maxi skirt looks.  If I may ask, where is the longish black skirt from?
text:Hey, there were 2 maxi skirts.  My old one was from a NZ brand called Marle. Genuinely loved that skirt, but sadly had to sell it as it became too big.

text:What is something you've heard as fashion advice that isn't worth following?	labels:I'm an hourglass shape, and I always read the advice of "accentuate your waist" online. But it doesn't work for me, or a lot of people who don't like form-fitting clothes, because I like to *hide* my feminine figure rather than emphasizing it. Let me live my life as an amorphous, androgynous blob thx.
text:Also an hourglass, but my waist is unusually high, so "accentuating my waist" means I look like a pair of giant tits resting on an ottoman. I tend to gravitate towards silhouettes that skim my waist, rather than cinch it, and I look much more proportional.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Pants matter for WFH?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:Hmmm... I dont agree with the no defining silhouette. I would say a lot of decades have more than 1 silhouette as a defining style (early 60s and late 60s are super different; same for early and late 1990s ); 1920s had a mainstream look vs the flapper look; etc). And for this decade I can think of two silhouttes that defined the decade for me.   One is the Kim Kardashian/SheIn style - long skin-tight dresses/skirts down to the calves or so in neutral colors. It was popular from like 2016 to 2018, with some bleadthrough until now, although personally that style is unflattering on me (I'm short and dont like things that cling at the waist).   As for the early 2010s, I can picture that kind of Zooey Deshanel, "New Girl", with the 50s kind of flared A-line skirts, bright colors, with maybe polka dots on them, and paired with like blouses, and a hair bandolete.  I think the current style (straighter lines and earthy tones) will be more remembered as an early 2020s thing.

On the way back in, I forgot that the cleaner had just been around our building spraying bleach solution on the railings (to stop COVID) and I backed into one of the railings to give a neighbor some space, only to feel the wet handrail and realize what I'd done.  Now I'm terrified to put it in the wash.  :(

text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:I wear it at home. So I can get used to it without others seeing me. After a bit I suddenly feel more comfortable.   Also, avoid mirrors! This helped massively when I was trying to get comfortable wearing bright lipsticks.
text:This is a great answer. I did this with a few of the shorter dresses I have and pretty soon I was just used to it and when your own brain is used to something, you don't care as much what other people think. Excellent advice!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:Boston here. I have what I call my sleeping bag coat. It's a columbia coat that goes down to my knees. If I have that I can wear regular dress pants or jeans and be fine especially with boots. Always a knit hat. The hoods are always a pain to stay up so I don't bother.	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I wear a lot of dresses, skirts, and wide-leg flowy pants during the summer. I almost never wear shorts because I've always hated them. Breathable fabrics are important especially with humidity; you'll be a lot hotter in polyester than in cotton. Also thigh chafing is a thing, so I like to alternate between days I wear a skirt and days I wear loose pants.   I do tend to carry a lightweight top layer for air conditioned buildings. But it doesn't need to be something super warm; mesh or a loose weave is fine. I tend to like that layer to be something that won't wrinkle so I can toss it in my purse.	episode_done:True

text:This is unrelated, but I rarely drive anymore, and now anytime I get behind the wheel I feel a few moments panic that I've forgotten how to drive.	labels:I definitely had that! My boyfriend and I drove four hours to go look at a house we were thinking of buying and we took my car because it has better mileage.  Driving over 50 mph is SCARY! hahaha it really was an adjustment for me. I've been getting as much as I can delivered so I only drive once a week or so to grab like a gallon of milk or pickup dinner that's outside our delivery radius.	episode_done:True
text:What are your tips for being stylish when your weight fluctuates like crazy?	labels:"Oversized" cropped sweaters can look great while also avoiding making you look frumpy. High waisted pants look great when you shrink because the belt makes for a flattering cinched waist (purchase in your median size or higher).	episode_done:True
text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I'm autistic and I have a lot of sensory issues so I can relate. I've found that wearing a layer underneath other things helps. For example, I have uniqlo leggings and a long-sleeve undershirt that I know I like the feeling of against my skin, so if I want to wear a sweater that's kind of scratchy or something else similar I'll just wear an undershirt that protects me. Another thing that helps me is tight sleeveless undershirts tucked into my jeans/skirt/bottom half whatever so that my shirt and waistband don't rub against my skin. (edit: I don't know if this will work in warmer climates, it works where I'm from because it's cold pretty much all year)  I also have a strict policy of not buying things that I know I'll find uncomfortable (and that I don't have a workaround for), wishing that maybe this time it will work. Because it won't, I'll just wear the thing out once and feel bad the entire time and then feel guilty for never wearing it again. If I find something that I really love, I cling to that and try to find similar things in the future and things that will complement those items.	episode_done:True

text:My 2020 Clothing Challenge	labels:I like the idea of the challenge but I don't get how something can be a hit if you wore it only once or twice in months..
text:Yeah, I was thinking similarly. I guess it would have helped to define what one would consider a hit or a miss and our definitions might be different, but I feel like a hit would be something I found myself actually incorporating into my wardrobe in a meaningful way (read: something I wear regularly)	labels:I think I could've been more clear in my write-up. I have a vision of how I want to dress and things I bought in previous years didn't always reflect my "ideal" style. The pieces I bought this year, in my opinion, fit into my Pinterest Inspo board more than any ever year. I guess to call something a "hit" I asked myself, 1) do I like this piece of clothing and feel confident in it 2) If someone took a photo of me in this piece would it fit in with my Pinterest board and 3) Next year (when I expect to get out more) will I wear this piece of clothing a lot
text:Ah okay, I think that makes sense! So rather than targeting a certain number of wears at the expense of compromising your style down to something more basic and easily wearable, you're more focused on acquiring only items you've specifically sought out.   Also a good point that you were probably expecting to have more opportunities to leave the house so that's very fair :)  It sounds like a good idea for a challenge although I don't necessarily know how well it would work for me, because I sometimes feel I have an idealized version of my style in my head/on Pinterest that just isn't accurate to my style in real life or doesn't fit in with my lifestyle, and despite how much I might like the clothing on the hanger I don't think I could call it a hit unless it became a relatively regularly worn item. But again, I think this just has to do with priorities; I wouldn't consider it money well spent if I only wore something one time.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What niche do you feel is missing from the fashion blogging/YouTube world?	labels:Midsized women who want to be fashionable, but not in a professional/streetwear sense. I've found some size twelve ladies who dress neat and tidy and ready for law practice, and I follow some size 12 ladies who wear streetwear, but nobody wears anything of actual interest in that size between either spectrum. Anybody I do see not in those two categories seem to be more in a "Macy's catalogue, 2013" aesthetic.  I need someone with stomach pudge and jiggly thighs to show me what cool structural and interesting pieces I can pull off without me spending 10 days and 10k dollars at the store to find it.
text:100% this. Almost all of the midsized people I see on YouTube wear a ton of fast fashion, too, which is fine but just not what I'm looking for.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are you hate wearing?	labels:Anything that is even slightly restricting on my neck (turtlenecks, mocknecks, even some crew necks). Yet, for some absurd reason, I am absolutely drawn to the aesthetic. Its an ridiculous tug of war between fawning over them from afar but ripping them off my body within seconds of having them on.
text:I have a turtleneck that pairs well with some of my skirts, but no joke.. I've tried it on four different days in the AM and said nah fuck it as soon as it got on my neck.	labels:Turtle necks are one of those things that always look so chic and cute on the models, so then I buy them and get bored of them in .2 seconds.....I'm hate-wearing mine now to get over my guilt of having once purchased them.

text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I don't follow anymore my "body type" rules since it's about hiding my "flaws" or compensating for them (inverted triangle). Instead I've been following the Kibbe method and embracing my strong shoulders and long wide lines, as a Natural type. Life changing to me, and very empowering. It's less about flattering figure and more about honoring your body, about dressing in harmony with your essence if that makes sense.
text:Because of your comment about Kibbe, I went in a mini rabbit hole. I am a Theatrical Romantic, and hilariously this matches the guidelines I am most drawn to on myself.  Thanks for taking me into this detour!	labels:I'm happy it can help. Do you feel that it's empowering for you or putting you in that "flattering rules box" you were mentioning in your post?
text:Honestly, the recommendations for me land on roughly what I would end up with based the "flattering rules." It's another lens to look at things for sure. I think it hones in on some small details that can potentially open up more possibilities for some people.  I'm a cello based on that other body typing model. I'm chubby, curvy, and have longer limbs. So rules are always "accentuate your waist" in one way or another. And maybe sometimes cover up more that I care about doing.  I don't feel compelled to follow the guidelines with every outfit. There are plenty of silhouettes I hate, but I am also willing to try out something else, no matter what the rules dictate.   But I probably end up liking things that are closer to the boxes setup by the various typing models.  They all seem to lead me to the same place.	labels:Makes sense! I can see how it's yet another set of rules, that's why I was asking. Thanks for sharing!	episode_done:True

I'm a bit too old to go trick-or-treating, so I'll be giving out candy in it if any kids come to the door. I can also hide my real mask under the gas mask, which is cool. The only major piece I'm missing is the pants (the greatcoat covers a lot of the legs), and I would also love to make a pair of vienot lenses for the gas mask, which are those spider-web eyes that stop the lenses from blowing inwards from the concussion effects of explosives.	episode_done:True

text:What are some stores/brands that have surprised you?	labels:Abercrombie! I always associated Abercrombie with the clothes that I wanted but couldn't afford to buy when I was 12 and too dark, too scented stores. But I've found that their denim selection is actually fantastic with lots of classic and trendy options! I have a weird size (2, curvy fit, long), and a lot of stores will have curvy fit but not available in long or vice versa. I think they must be trying to re-brand themselves , because their sizes go up to larger sizes now than they used to as well :)

text:Indoor layers	labels:I find that moto-style jackets and sweater blazers (or sweater coats) work great for this! Thick-knit cardigans can also work well, but it can be difficult to find cuts that read "distinct layers" as opposed to "just wearing two sweaters."  I'm always cold, so in fall / winter I usually end up with a removable mid-layer under my outerwear to make sure I stay warm enough wherever it is I'm going. At the office, I wear a lot of sweater blazers, and for casual wear I have some knit moto jackets that layer really well over sweaters and long sleeved shirts.	episode_done:True

text:I wish bolo ties would come back into fashion. I'm in the northeast but spent some time living in the southwest as a student in the early 90s so I bought a couple of them then. Plus I used to make beadwork jewelry and accessories before my arthritis got so sucky and I made several bolo ties of my own beading around gemstone cabachons.

text:My 2020 Clothing Challenge	labels:Thanks for sharing this post: really good take on a year's worth of buying. I may try something similar in 2021 because I just buy too many clothes. I'm pretty good at picking out stuff that works for me, but still, too many clothes. Roughly one piece a month sounds fair.   Also, echoing everyone else's comments that red dress #1 is great on you.	episode_done:True
text:Hooded Sweatshirt Roundup	labels:Once you get over a certain level of $ point, it's really hard to rank basic hoodies over one another, it mostly comes down to the fit that you want.  I've tried a lot of hoodies from cheap to expensive and most of them are as comfortable as each other. The article mentions JEs villain hoodies which are probably out of fashion these days but JE still produces other cuts of hoodies such as the beach hoodie, raglan hoodie and oversized cropped hoodie which all have different fits and are all as well made as each other. People who rave about a particular brand of hoodie are highly likely to be just really happy with the fit, the quality and comfort isn't gonna really differ between RC, Norse Projects, Champion and such. Even coveted things like loopwheeler also doesn't provide anything unique either when it comes to comfort.  I've rambled but if I had an advice to give to hoodie buyers who are mostly focused on fit and comfort, it would be to identify a fit that you want and just start from the midrange brand that you can find of that fit.
text:I bought a JE zip up hoodie. I also have Stone Island and Burberry hoodies, as well as American Apparel and other cheaper ones. I won't say spending $300+ (cad) on hoodies is smart, but the main difference I note is the cut. Comfort, like you said, isn't too different unless you get into cashmere, but the difference in cut and overall shape and sizing is much better. I definitely wanna get my hands on a Todd Snyder Champion hoodie though, that's right up my alley.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I can only speak to the Lulus because I own a couple pairs. They're super comfy and feel like I'm wearing sweatpants at work. However, they're made from a light synthetic material so they can be static-y and are also not particularly warm. Now that it's rainy and windy in Vancouver I'm putting the Lulus away and wearing heavier cotton or wool.	labels:Thanks friend. I've heard about how stretchy they are.

text:I hand-crafted gifts for my four immediate family members from the age of 8 onward, and eventually started buying more meaningful gifts either with my siblings for my parents or with my parents for my siblings. Once I was in college with a job, I bought gifts for each of my family members in the $20 range. Eventually we all decided that a Secret Santa worked best for us, and now we all get each other a small gift for our socks and just one larger gift ($20-50) for our Secret Santa. I let my boyfriend handle his family and I don't purchase gifts for any of my extended family cause we just aren't that close. For my boyfriend-now-husband, I usually spend about $100 total. Maybe more if I'm in a better financial spot.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:I don't generally thrift clothing items from brands I ethically disagree with. I know it doesn't financially enrich that company at all by thrifting their items, but to me, it's about mental clutter. I don't want to be reminded of the horrible conditions an item was made in, or the awful thing a representative of x company said when getting ready for the day. There are exceptions, it isn't a hard rule for me. But I do notice that something being from a brand I don't personally align with affects my enjoyment of that thing. However, I think everyone should do what they're personally comfortable with, and I don't assume that other people who consume those brands are in agreement with problematic stuff. Most brands are inherently problematic. I think if you can let the discomfort go, then you should get whatever you feel like on the secondhand market.
text:I agree with this. I do recognize my immense privilege to be able to *choose* while thrifting. If you are not able to be choosy, that's totally okay. I just have a preference to not buy from companies I don't like, secondhand or not.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:this is how i feel all the time with jane the virgin
text:I'm from South Florida and always thought it was actually pretty spot on.   For casualwear, Jane and Xo wear a lot of simple tank tops, jeans, and shorts, and then for date nights and parties, they wear cute little sundresses. Sure the actual pieces they're wearing are a little pricier than the characters could afford (WornOnTV shows a lot of the pieces are from Revolve, Nordstrom, and J.Crew), but you could get a similar look by shopping at Target or something.   Petra's wardrobe is definitely less obtainable, but it matches what wealthier people in my area wear, and the over-the-top looks suit her personality.  Really the only impractical thing I noticed is that Jane tends to wear heels, while most girls in my area wear strappy, flat sandals instead. But I'd assume that's necessary to make sure the petite actress can fit in the camera frame with her costars.	labels:yeah totally understandable !!  im from a cold country in europe where people wear way less colourful things so a jane look would definitely stand out too much.
text:It's interesting how much fashion varies by region! The color of the clothes didn't even cross my mind as something potentially unrealistic.   Those bright pink, blues, oranges, and purples are definitely typical for Miami and nearby places. When it's so hot you can't wear a bunch of layers, textured fabrics, or interesting silhouettes, you tend to turn towards color and pattern as a way of adding visual appeal.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:1. You can look for the special higher-end store, some stores are labeled "The Runway." That one will have the most designer stuff in it. They are stocking more of that online these days. 2. If you live in a big enough metro area, there is usually one really good store. There is no rhyme or reason to the one that will be the good one. Sometimes it is in a fancy part of town, other times it isn't. If you are a super Maxxanista it is worth taking the field trip 3. Look online - they are planning the e-commerce launch eventually - so maybe look for that.  4. Check out the online cousins: Ruelala and Bluefly	episode_done:True

text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:90% of my clothing breaks all these rules lol. I love everything oversized, to the point that sometimes my sleeves are very long that they pool at my wrists.     When it comes to piecing items together though, I still make sure there is some sort of balance to the outfit - but I do it more for how I feel in my outfit rather than wanting to be taller or thinner and following these traditional conventions. For example, if one day I feel like wearing a long baggy hoodie with wide long pants that make me look thicker and stumpier (I'm 5'4"), then why not? It's my mood.     There are definitely occasions however where these guides are useful, for example, my wedding day. The dress must be flattering in all the right places, yet still cater to how I feel in it.	episode_done:True

Also I'm searching petite options. Aritzia always runs too long for me unless I buy cropped pants. I have a 27" waist and 37" booty. None of the faux leather pants so far that I've tried have done me any favours. I find Zara pants ill fitting and H&M I've yet to try.  I feel like I wouldn't look good in the pants you tried. I would want something a bit looser. I used to wear tight pants but don't like the look anymore. I know you could hem your pants perhaps but I think you could find better for yourself.

I've been wearing ill-fitting Value Village suits for the past decade and want something I can use for job interviews and black tie events. Both Moore's and Indochino offered to make me a suit for $550 CAD. I have no independent Tailor shops that actually sell clothing in my city, they just adjust clothing you bring, that's why I'm not going to them.  I was just rewatching the first season of Better Call Saul which, at least the first few episodes made me realize how a cheap suit, fitted or not, can really look bad.

We do live with roommates so there is some validation in dressing up, which is really nice, but I still find myself wearing really boring, machine-washable clothes every day. I've noticed the same with coworkers (on Zoom): we all started off in dress shirts and nice tops, but have disintegrated to sweatshirts all around.  So I've completely stopped buying clothes. It's helping me save a lot more money, but it's also a huge part of my depression. What a wasted year!  What I'd doing instead: (1)  trying to funnel my fashion interests into art - drawing, designing clothes, creative writing - and hoping that will help a bit. My usual spending on wardrobe, saved up, have become a new laptop computer. (2) doing fashion another way - I've really gotten into eyeshadow as a way of being more colorful on Zoom.	episode_done:True

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:this point is also really relevant nowadays not just in fashion but in general queer 'trends', you see people picking up queer slang, particularly POC slang, or choosing to present on social media as queer-biguous yet get strangely defensive when people ask if they're actually queer. just look at people jumping on the girl in red / hey mamas / I cuff my jeans! trends on TikTok and other social media
text:I mean the point at which you choose to present as queer-biguous on social media is the point at which you are queer-biguous. Gender nonconformity is under the queer umbrella.	labels:well that's the hope. then again like I describe, you come across people who copy queer signalling and get strangely offended when people ask if they are queer/gay. look at early fan service in idol culture, managers will literally have them kiss/skinship intimately but then very publically deny being queer to any extent. taking on 'minority identities' to appear more attractive is nothing new unfortunately	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 18, 2021	labels: I have odd body size. I am 6' 190 lbs with a 17-17.5 inch neck,  42 inch chest and 40 inch hips. Needless to say shopping for clothes is  always a hassle specifically for business casual clothing. It seems I  must have everything tailored to fit which is definitely expensive. I  have always been in between a medium and a large off the rack with a  medium shrinking after a few washes to an uncomfortable tight size or a  large looking like I could swim in my clothes. Regardless, I can never  button up a shirt and generally have to buy XL dress shirts and have  them heavily tailored.  This makes  online shopping a nightmare. Are there any retailers, websites or  manufactures that I can buy from directly that I can essentially plug in  my numbers and be sent items that fit pretty well? I'm not expecting a  perfect fit but man if I am not exhausted trying to find good fitting  clothes.

I like to wear it with a brown skirt and the combination of colors makes both pieces look more modern.	episode_done:True

It's just like any other hobby, for example,  a sketchbook isn't a nessecity, but if you are into drawing it would make sense to buy some	episode_done:True
text:Do you have a childhood fashion icon? If so, does their influence show up in your wardrobe today?	labels:Cher from Clueless, seems to be as popular as ever though.

text:Pantone Color(s) of the year for 2021: Illuminating and Ultimate Gray	labels:That yellow is almost the one which is my favourite, bright but not too bright. It suits my colouring I think. As for yellow things, I have a pair a few things, a sweater and trousers and some pairs of shoes. I'll be looking forward to getting one or two blouses in this colour. I don't have any and it's a colour I like.  The light grey is one of my neutrals. I like it a lot.  I like yellow and grey together as well. I was wearing that combo last year for autumn-winter, though it was the more mustard kind of yellow.  Honestly, it won't matter over here. Pantone is mostly ignored, outside of fast fashion and even then... well, kind of lacking. I didn't get anything in the blue shade of this year. There was hardly anything.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 29	labels:Is there any way to stretch my pants? I have bulked up in size and this one black trousers I really love is now tight as hell around my waist and gets unzipped by itself. Is there any way I could stretch down that area? It says it is 58%cotton, 39%polyester, and 3%elastic. Thanks for any advice!  PS: they're chinos kind of pants. Suit pants looking-like but in a casual. I suck at describing pants!
text:Do you mean make them longer? if there is extra fabric at the hem, possibly but probably not more an an inch or so. With jeans almost certainly not.	labels:Sorry I thought I copy pasted my whole thing! No, the length is not the issue, it's around my waist that they are tight.   Original post: I have bulked up in size and this one black trousers I really love is now tight as hell around my waist and gets unzipped by itself. Is there any way I could stretch down that area?

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 29	labels:How can I start taking care of my hair / deal with split ends?  I'm 21, and over the past couple months I've started getting more into fashion and taking care of myself. Buying new clothes and shoes, taking care of myself, etc etc.  However, the area I'm completely lost in is my hair. I've never used shampoo or hair products any more than just a generic bottle of cheap shampoo. My hair is currently just down to my shoulders, and it's kind of a mess. There's a lot of split ends, and it's messy - but not in the 'intentionally done to look good' type of messy.  I want to start taking better care of my hair, so how would I go about doing that? First priority would be taking care of the split ends, shampoo recomendations (I don't even really know the difference between shampoo and conditioner tbh), things like that.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!
text:Split ends need to be cut, no way around it. Go to a *good* barber, ask them to fix up your split end (likely quite a lot of hair will have to go to get rid of all of them and make the cut still look even) and ask them for a shampoo recommendation.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I'm like super petite and have had luck with Ann Taylor petites, and the loft petites. And having a local tailor helps. They're out of business now but I also have some timeless pieces from petite sophisticate - you can probably find them on eBay for not too much.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Do you have a childhood fashion icon? If so, does their influence show up in your wardrobe today?	labels:Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century was my absolute jam. Wild colors, tight silhouettes, crazy layers, metal accessories, crazy hairstyles... all of it. I was always doing weird shit to my hair as a tween and I owned way too much pleather for living in DALLAS jeez I was crazy.  I don't think Zenon really fits in my current wardrobe except that it's basically the opposite of bohemian and I don't think I own a single item that could be called bohemian. I prefer clean lines, cool neutral colors like black and gray, little to no jewelry... I do still wear my clothes pretty tight, though and I keep my look from being boring by having fun and colorful (metallic!) shoes and bags. My most recent shoe purchase was a pair of rose gold metallic classic Reebok high-tops and a pair of dark purple oil-slick Doc Marten boots. I also had shaved sides until I realized that quarantine would probably be a good time to grow it out.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - October 28	labels:How are people able to wear a turtle neck without choking? My God! So, I've tried two different styles, two different brands, and two different sizes, and while they look amazing and fit very well, my neck feels like I'm wearing a dog cone. My Adam's apple is pushed back a lot, but the thing is that it's not tight, it's just uncomfortable to even swallow. If I get a bigger size, the sweater won't fit, and I'll end up having a shawl-sweater.  I truly do not understand how men are able to wear them. Do I have a thick neck, or an overly-protruding apple? What is going on?!  That was all, carry on.

It's a new love from last year that I now have flamingos, lobsters in sunglasses, dinosaurs, and plant shirts among others already that I wear all the time to work and I just would love more.. I was just daydreaming of where to find more options on another tab actually.. I'm really short though so I've been shopping in the little boys section. Tuck one of those bad boys into a nice pair of pants or longer skirt and I'm living my modern Mrs. Frizzle dream.   Also love bell bottoms! Those are hard to find though for people under 5ft. lol

text:Dress Sneakers Are Alarmingly Popular	labels:I also think it's on the rather unfortunate looking side... counterpoint: I know a surprising amount of people who have to wear dress shoes for professional reasons... but comfortable sneakers for health/pain reasons... this caters to them and after several have told me in how much pain they are I don't give a hoot anymore. Let Cole Haan/whoever do their thing.  Edit: this is not counting people I know who may have very different requirements throughout a workday/ work trip and may not want to pack/ bring several shoes and are in a constant haste.
text:hmm is this all a result of office culture getting more casual and people having trouble finding good looking dress shoes that are also comfy?   would be cool if people here could recommend comfy dress shoe alternatives, but I guess I am a bit late here	labels:There are moc-toe dress shoe styles that come with soft rubber soles. For example, the Eastland Falmouth. Comfortable as all fuck (with or without socks), dressy enough for a stuffy middle-aged office, casual enough to go grocery shopping in. You could describe them as loafers with laces, or as boat shoes without the boat part. These are my favorite type of shoe.	episode_done:True
text:How do you challenge yourself?	labels:I branch out when I watch a new TV show and I really like the main character's style. I will buy one or two things that are really 'them'.  But then I always end up not feeling like myself. So I'll either immediately return those things, or I'll wear them a lot for three months and suddenly snap out of it one morning, like, 'what was I thinking?' and push them to the back of my closet.  So now, when I have that itch, I just add everything to my shopping cart and then close the tab and go to bed.	episode_done:True
text:Is there a fashion show that is widely considered to be the greatest show of all time?	labels:Gianni Versace's 1991 Freedom! show is usually cited as the birth of the supermodel as a pop culture phenomenon and still holds merit for producing clothing with top tier technical skill. Also, has george michael as the backing track

text:It isn't about professionalism but extending use of items like dresses and skirts otherwise I'd only get maybe 3-5 months of use instead of 7-8.	labels:I've never needed to wear hose so I had no idea this was a thing.  How does it save clothes?  Would a slip do the same thing?
text:It's about temperature control and my mechanics of getting up with wearing pants resulting in rear end blow outs. Less often I can wear pants, the longer my pants last!

text:Unless you want respect and to be accepted into a social circle. Personally I  believe in the philosophy of age appropriateness because that means you care what the group (society) thinks and that reflects that you are not a narcissist or stunted person. Although some youthful touches can be endearing in a look. In other words, skip the daisy dukes, keep the mary janes.	labels:	episode_done:True

Maybe even nail polish and hair in the same tone of blue or pink if I have the time.    If I can't be clocked for not being fully themed and matchy matchy, then it's all good :D

text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:I'm wearing sequins, neons and fun stuff, at home and when I go out. I have neon sweatpants. I got my leather jacket back out this week because it's decidedly autumnal here now. I'm not at home all the time, and even  if I was, I'm sick of earthy/neutral loungewear/athleisure in general. I appreciate lots of people like it but I don't want dozens of collections of drab pink and beige pjs strutting down every runway and I have little interest in linen or billowy stuff right now so IDK, I like garish colours and bad bitch stuff.

Problem is, I bought it halfway around the globe, nearly a decade ago, and am having trouble finding a good replacement online. A few desired features:  * Warm but breathable (my old one was merino wool, which was amazing); mid-weight * Zip-up * French terry * Cheaper and more durable is always better, but the main emphasis is comfort. I don't care if it's especially fashionable. Let's try to keep it around $100 or less? * I'd prefer no hood, but a hood is fine, I guess  Any suggestions?

text:What am I supposed to do with my head post-chemo?	labels:* Try an undercut. Popular, works great with straight hair, easy to care for, and lots of styling options. As for styling products, American Crew Fiber is good, it has a matte finish so it won't look greasy.  * Plain baseball cap. No logos. I'm not usually big on hats, but I've been growing my hair out during the pandemic and wearing a cap in public just to keep my hair out of my eyes. Works with just about any casual wear, doesn't look weird wearing it indoors.	episode_done:True
text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:My major gripe is pilling. If a material has even 5% cotton in the fabric which is most of them, it pills in me. Dresses, sweaters( I havent been able to get  more than 2 years of wear from any sweater so far) , joggers, tops etc.  Underwears- elastic loosens overtime  Socks: Same story, elastic loosens and they become thin or develop holes in foot.
text:socks getting holes is my biggest pet peeve! I usually buy socks from new places or just make sure I get fun unique ones and before I know it the socks I got from a museum I went to once, that I've worn nonstop for 1-2 years, has a hole right on the bottom. I hate throwing them away, but I also am not good with patching  uhggg	labels:I feel you. I am quite a socks collector myself. I usually throw only the one that has hole and keep the good one around and mix it with another lonely one. I love my mismatched pairs more than than the matched ones.	episode_done:True

text:Down Jackets	labels:Used to live in Chicago and the amount of Canada Goose jackets I would see was insane. If you're paying that kind of money, you might as well splurge for a less ubiquitous better shaped jacket from some place like Veilance (Monitor Down) or Norse Projects (Rokkvi). Granted these are slightly higher price but do drop down to the CG range several times a year.   I own the Rokkvi 5 from Norse and it's the fucking bomb. Slick, impervious, warm as hell.
text:> Rokkvi 5 from Norse  No way I can justify that purchase when my Patagonia down jacket does the job better for a much cheaper price. Heck I be willing for an Arcteryx down jacket and it still be cheaper than paying for that tag.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Style rut: Pinterest vs reality	labels:Okay, so people are heckin' rude. What inspires us can be unwearable on our particular bodies, and we're not obligated to wear it. Or maybe we don't want to wear that exact item, but some part of it excites us. It's okay to translate what you loved in a picture into something you feel fits into your everyday life. What gives with your "friend"?  Now, if you find yourself unable to do that -- you're STILL okay. And if you need help, obviously that's why Daily Questions etc exist. Because we weren't any of us born knowing how to style.
text:I love dusty pinks and mauves.  I cannot express how badly those colors look with my skin. I've had *strangers* ask me if I was ok because they assumed someone who resembled a corpse that much must be actually nearing death.   I love heels and very sleek business casual as well as what I can only call ho-fits. I have bad ankles fr from working on concrete floors too many hours, and take public transportation. It's too much of a risk I could sprain my ankle from how much I walk, and I can't afford another sprain. My office is not business casual or sleek, but a no fuss "just don't wear t-shirts with slogans or anything" type of place. I am decidedly over my ho phase, despite my continued love of the clothes.   My fantasy of wearing heeled booties with a structured fashion blazer over a mauve dress is not any less real just because I have the common sense to not go through with it.  Fashion fantasy is still a valid form of participation!	labels:I have gotten around that a bit by having decor in colours I look bad in. I definitely have some dusty pink throw pillows.

I've been wearing babydoll dresses because they hide my back brace and doc martins because they're comfy and I can get men to kneel before me (to tie them bc I cannot bend). Usually I dress more grunge though, like right now- I've got on thermal pj pants, a bleach stained baggy old sweater, and a tye-dyed sports bra.

Enough of that this time around and the trend will cycle to something else.  signed,  someone who dealt with many, many ripped jean legs.
text:I vividly remember wearing my too-long-baggy jeans on a rainy day, during a late night out with friends. They ripped all the way up to almost my knee.

I usually burn through a pair of Jbrand or Paige jeans in a year or so and the Ginger jeans I made a year ago are still going strong. Bonus, my pockets can actually hold things.

I've used my lockdown time to play with my makeup and really play up my eyes (since lipstick is covered now).  Today I'm wearing a "watermelon" eye (green around the edges, pink in the middle).  I've used this time to play with colors in my palettes that I normally don't wear.  I never knew olive eyeshadow looked good on me (olive clothing does not).	episode_done:True
text:Shopping for clothing items you already own: confessions of an outfit repeater	labels:Converse Cutaway Sandals. I've been looking for years and have only been able to find them on sketchy online sites. They look great with EVERYTHING and I always get tons of compliments when I wear them. I was desperate enough to look up a tutorial for re-dying converse shoes...unfortunately, the insoles are also completely worn out so I would need a DIY fix for that too...	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: Ghost Outfit	labels:This must explain why the apparitions that people often claim to have seen, are that of a beautiful woman in a white nightgown, who glides behind the windows of a drafty, abandoned manor, or paces the long hallways of the run-down hotel. After all, no one wants to see an unshaven and out of shape ghostly figure clad in leisurewear, eating out of a tub of Ben & Jerry's which is my current state.

text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:Bought a hat for my mom off Facebook a while ago. Perhaps it was the pandemic...but it took three months to arrive!	episode_done:True

text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:In a perfect world, everything I own would be able to go in the washing machine and dryer. I have a lot of environmental allergies, so I wash all of my clothes after each wear. That said, if there's a piece I really love that says hand wash or even dry clean (and it's priced such that it won't be the end of the world if I ruin it), I'll put it in the machine on delicate with cold water and hang it to dry. Most things I've done that to survive just fine. The things that are less likely to survive are delicate fringed hems/mesh/beading, so I try to avoid that, even if I love the aesthetic. Rayons can shrink, so cold water is important. Polyester can usually take a lot of abuse, even if the label says otherwise.  The only thing that I bother to actually hand wash are ballgowns. Those get washed in the bathtub with mild soap, rinsed, and hung to dry. Usually with ballgowns I do a focused scrub on the armpit area to get out any deodorant stains/odors, and don't use much friction on the rest of the dress.	episode_done:True
text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:They don't resell for much but TWICE have I found Diane Von Furstenberg dresses at my local thrift, one of those times I happened to spot it in the nighties department! $3 and $4 respectively AND in my size. Her wrap dresses work really well for my shape but sadly the pandemic hasn't really given me an opportunity to wear them.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 12, 2020	labels:Hi, I'm trying to get some better jeans for my wardrobe, I'm looking for some good midrange jeans in the $60-120 USD price range. I've heard that Levi's are really good for their price (in America at least, from what I know they're more expensive outside of the U.S.) but I don't really like the way that they fit loosely around the butt because I just prefer the way it looks when jeans have more of a snug fit around the butt. I know there are a lot of different styles of Levi's though so if you know of a style that fits differently like that, I'd be happy to check them out! Also I bought a pair of Uniqlo jeans and I am actually pretty happy with the quality, but I'd rather support more environmentally-friendly companies if I can. (although I don't know how possible that is in my price range)

text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Anymore if I don't already have a great outfit for it, hard pass.  The exception is if I have a full outfit in my cart or if it's for a special occasion.

text:What pieces would you love "backups" of?	labels:One of my favorite shirts is a short sleeved cotton (not a tee) black and white polka dot shirt from J Crew Factory.  It fits me beautifully and goes with so many other pieces I own.  I didn't think it was a 'favorite' when I first bought it but it was something that grew on me over time.  I love the cut and material.  Over the summer I bought a back up on poshmark, so now I have two.	episode_done:True

They are saying that they cannot see how playing with build, cut, fabrics, and optical illusion can translate into ready-to-wear pieces or forecast ideas for the direction a fashion house is taking. Among the things I listed, it's basically a "*why* is fashion" comment that appears all the time.	episode_done:True

text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I'm just... still getting dressed up. This has actually given me a nice opportunity to try new combinations of outfits and pull out pieces that I wasn't sure about before. The routine of getting dressed and feeling put together is really important for me with regards to getting into the work mindset.
text:Agreed - if you want to dress a certain way while quarantined/working from home, just do so haha. Jeans and a nice sweater is almost as comfy as leggings and a hoodie, and much more pulled together. (Also, now I can really say that I do dress for myself and not for others - I still like putting together outfits and feeling nice even if no one is going to see me.)	labels:Same. I also use it as a way to cheer myself up when I'm feeling down
text:I've been breaking out older formal dresses for when I need to clean the house, its honestly made it more fun, if such a thing is possible	labels:I really want to do this!	episode_done:True
text:Has anyone just said screw it and focused more on fit than color scheme for your outfits? What's an unlikely color combination that you ended up loving?	labels:I purged black from my wardrobe and now wear mostly light colors: ivory, sage, lilac, and blush pink. I was happy to lose most of the dark colors, but green is my favorite and I missed wearing olive. Seeing @friskygatos pair pastels with olive was momentous and pastels +olive instantly became my go-to.
text:I'm curious what is your complexion? I feel like full pastels would wash me out.	labels:I'm neutral skewing cool and low- contrast. (I posted to r/femalehairadvice recently so you can actually see my pic.)  I always loved jewel tones, but realized while shopping with my Mexican MIL last year that those rich shades that are so stunning on her were actually washing me out more than lighter colors. Or maybe I'm super washed-out now that I wear pastels, but Ilike it so whatever.	episode_done:True

I go to a planet fitness and they have Smith machines not free weights lol I can do squats and bench easy enough, but I'm not gonna screw my back trying to do a Smith machine dead lift
text:They got squat racks? Try good mornings.  Dumbbells? Single-leg deads.  I mean upper body, cleans aren't really a "building" movement so much as a "skill" movement. All the normal bro stuff for upper body works - pressing, pulling, rows, etc.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Moncler acquires Stone Island	labels:WTF is experientiality? And for that matter, what is wrong with inclusiveness?
text:There's nothing wrong with inclusiveness. Stone Island has been a menswear brand only, with the vision that they only wanted to design clothing for the male body, but the stone-island woman would buy the male garments. It's part of the unapologetic masculine design aesthetic the brand has.  &#x200B;  experientiality is a focus on being experiental. meaning to learn through experience.	labels:You're right, but I was referring to the press release using "inclusivity" instead of "inclusiveness".  Probably as opposed to exclusivity... Just my aversion to buzz-words  As for "experientiality", it does not mean that. The reference I've found, defines it as "the quasi-mimetic evocation of real-life experience", and it's a term related to narratology.
text:On the one hand, I can definitely meet you in agreement in that I hate brands appropriating popular terms in the zeitgeist, because my cynical side tells me they do so only for profit, though my well suppressed neolib angel tells me even brand acceptance for morals that align with mine own is still progress.   That said, few things seem more boomer to me than complaining about descriptive grammar	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Pro: Outfits are easy because it's all black and everything matches and I look unapproachable so strangers don't strike up conversations.  Con: Finding a specific black item of clothing in a mountain of black clothing, in a dark room in the AM is nearly impossible.

text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:This is more pertaining to young contemporary, but neon colors will be pretty much completely out of style by next year. I work in wholesale fashion and we've been closing out our neon styles to companies like ross, forever and fashion nova.
text:Thank god. I do think neon looks good on women with pretty, deep skin. But myself - a pale gal - it looks horrible.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Is it disgusting to not wear socks with shoes?	labels:As long as you don't wear the same pair of shoes every day, no socks is fine.    For several combos of shoes and outfits, no socks is definitely more fashionable.  You could do the no-show sock here, and if she didn't think to say "are you wearing no-show socks" before insulting you, she's being an asshole on this one.  But yeah, if you don't just wear the same shoes every day, and they air out between wearings, no socks should be perfectly fine.  That's how many, many shoes work.	episode_done:True
text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:During the party celebrating my First Communion (so seven or so), I refused to take off my pretty white dress, despite my mother telling me that I had to be really careful not to stain it. Then my older sister gave me a juice box of fruit punch, and I spilled ALL over myself. My mother has never let me, nor my sister, live it down (despite the fact that it's been 25 years...) and I have been too scared to wear white ever since.
text:My mother took great pride in her laundry ability. One of her crowning laundry accomplishments was completely removing fried smelt stains from a baby dress.  She had lovingly sewed me this adorable smocked dress when I was 1, took me to a wedding in it where I apparently gorged myself on stinky fried smelts, which if you've ever been within 5 miles of a baby you know half of those greasy smelts ended up smashed into the dress.  Before she died she left notes pinned to family heirlooms in a little chest, and that story is in there pinned to the pristinely clean dress.	labels:Your mom sounds like an ascended master of laundry.
text:She was master of so much beyond that too, its weird to think sort of generationally some of the skills that I know my family has lost that I didnt think about at the time.  There was so much "more" to her than domestic skills, but I also think about how those skills are still devalued and seen as "just womens work" (that women too are sometimes think is lowly if that's "all" we do).  Rather than valuing them for how important they are.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Good quality men's jeans?	labels:A few thoughts  Crotch tearing is usually attributed to size, if you're like me and have decent sized thighs and a small waist sizing up isn't the greatest option. I'd try a differnt cut, something with a good taper and wider thighs. Something with stretch is probably a good idea as well.   High quality Jean's will likely stain shoes as well, that's normal for indigo... I second the magic eraser recommendation.   As for brands theres loads of threads here on good brands you can search. Most focus on higher priced items though. So Just focusing on something you mention, in Levi's go for the premium(usually around 90) over the regular, the construction is usually much better.
text:Hi there, I feel like you and I are pretty similar in that my thighs are pretty big compared to my waist. Probably should have mentioned this in my post... So I'll try your recommendation. The cuts I've experimented with were probably simply not for me.	labels:What cuts have you? 511s in Levi's or?  Personally I love the way skinny fit looks on me, I have nice legs and like showing them off, but I need a lot of stretch and that almost always leads to the Jean's losing shape
text:The 512s actually!	labels:Sorry thought I replied.   Yeah dude. I'd try like the 502s, maybe sized up 511s. I realize you want a trimmer look, but it might not be the most realistic. Odds are though that if you have bigger thighs less of a taper will be more flattering for your body.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 02, 2020	labels:Is it normal for a (slim fit) chino to bunch up along the legs and not be 100% straight? If i stand and smooth the legs out everything is straight. After a few paces the material bunches up around the knee and i have 2-3 breaks etc. The shop pictures show them straight on the models.

text:What is your go-to favourite dress to wear in the cooler months?	labels:I have a few short sleeve midi dresses in winter-weight fabrics that I will pair with a cardigan and wear thick leggings, or just wear tights if it's a milder winter day.  Beyond dresses I also have an assortment of winter-weight midi circle skirts as well.	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:One short cocktail length and one long if you feel like it. I personally wear fancy cocktail dresses no matter how fancy the wedding  I like black and navy bc you can rewear a ton. Color is great too. Just go for classic cuts.	episode_done:True

I live in NE Ohio so it's usually in the 30s or below, and there'll be a handful of days it gets close to or lower than zero. Not usually outside for an extended period of time other than walking to my car, so I probably don't really need something that's super heavy. Would be wearing over a sweater and OCBD most days too

text:If you could only have one overcoat, what would it be?	labels:Grey large scale glenplaid/herringbone is probably the most flexible style that could work with everything from jeans to suits.

text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:I get most of my shirts from thredup and swap dot com, and after sorting by price and color, i use brand as a guide. But I also am a competent mender, so I don't stress too much about potential rips since I know I can fix most of them. And since I'm paying $5-10 per item, i can make a bad purchase or two without breaking the bank.	episode_done:True

My neck is 16.5" Chest is 40" Sleeve is 34.25"  Most off the rack dress shirts/oxfords in medium would fit except the collar would be to small.   I rarely wear a tie, should I just get medium or should I buy large and get them tailored, which I'm going to do regardless.
text:I suggest you look for brands that size by actual neck and sleeve measurements instead of alpha sizes.	labels:Correct. A 16.5 x 35 is probably the most common 16.5 makeup. A lot of Italian 42 will approximate that. The OP shouldn't sweat if the sleeves are a bit long - if they really do hang long, moving the button placement can be an idea to shrink the cuff circumference and thus stop the sleeve from hanging too low.	episode_done:True

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:Having gone through this transition, the main advice I would give you is to understand the categories and "slots" in your wardrobe before you shop for pieces, and if you have an item-type you like while you wish the piece were better in a particular way, upgrade that piece specifically, and take your time doing so.  For example: I learned I love well-fitted, thin turtlenecks with structured trousers and skirts, so now I feel secure shopping for high-end turtlenecks. But I also know I only have 4 "slots" in my closet for these - one black, one gray, one taupe/camel, one cream - so that's all I need, forever, and I can upgrade one piece at a time. I'm giving myself permission to wear the same things all the time, like a cartoon character, while I do so. :)	episode_done:True

I've owned my pair for five years of regular wear and I just love how they look as they have aged.  -Uniqlo U Tshirts. They are thick and relatively inexpensive, and they are the only t-shirt I've owned that doesn't wear down in a year. They also don't get wrinkly.   -Jcrew Fisherman's Sweater. I don't know what to say about this except for that it's warm, cozy, and classic.	episode_done:True
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:You are 14, no clothes can really age you that much at this point. And for what it's worth, I don't think that 10 years down the road Dark Academia will be seen as a cringey style, definitely not more cringey that the early 2000s low-waist jeans or pink sweatpants with "sexy" written in the back.	episode_done:True

It's the sort of thing 50 year old blokes wear because they think they're still 'rock n roll'	labels:This.   AllSaints used to have better quality and better looking clothes. Then they decided that they had to make everything they could possibly make. Fragrance, watches, jewelry, etc. and it sucks.   Then someone decided that every other piece had to have ALLSAINTS wording plastered over it, which looks tacky.   I miss the old AllSaints.

text:Pantone Color(s) of the year for 2021: Illuminating and Ultimate Gray	labels:I love yellow & I love gray, in most shades, but these in particular just feel so... textbook Crayola starter pack to me? Like, in a vacuum they could be the platonic ideal of yellow and gray, so I can kind of appreciate how they are both true mid-tones, but I don't like them together (for some reason it's giving me flashbacks to the chevrons and turquoise of 2010 decor) and I don't find them particularly inspiring right off the bat.  Or it could be that as a warm-toned olive I know they will both look terrible on me, lol.

text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:I used to enjoy Victoria's Secret underwear, but the quality got really bad while the prices kept going up. I was just like "screw that".
text:I stopped buying VS undies when I had a newish pair literally fall apart on me. Aerie is like old VS quality, so I only buy from them now.	labels:Have you noticed Aerie's quality going down?

text:Stockings vs Tights vs Leggings	labels:I wear tights under skirts/pants, mostly opaque now though I used to wear some patterned ones. As it gets colder, I wear thicker tights, like knit ones or ones with fleece lining. I have a couple pairs of leggings but only wear maybe 2 of them during winter, as pants.	episode_done:True

I had one in leopard and not only did it boost my tiny bitties it was comfortable enough to sleep in and it was unlined. I spent multiple years on depop and ebay buying every in new condition one i could find because i loved them so much. I still have one of them but I dont wear it because its literally in rags	episode_done:True
text:What’s a piece you bought before the pandemic, but haven’t worn a single time since because the occasion has been cancelled/we have literally nowhere to go?	labels:I bought a beautiful lavender dress with a beaded cape to wear for my cousin's Labor Day wedding, which was cancelled.    The worst part was that I had also purchased a really cool metallic lavender suit for my boyfriend that matched perfectly with the dress.    We have since broken up and I have no idea what to do with the dress or the suit, which I kept because it matched so well but even if I could wear the dress again, what am I supposed to tell the guy I am dating then, like hey can you wear this suit I bought for my ex?	episode_done:True

I bought it in the spring of 2020, it was cheap as Uniqlo was phasing out its 2019-2020 autumn/winter collection. I spent only 2000 yen on it  I use it almost every day for work in fall.   I'm glad I got one from the 2019-2020 and not the new 2020-21 line.  This year's one doesn't stretch as well and feels uncomfortable.  &#x200B;  I only wish I could have bought another color from the 2019-20 so I'd have more variation  I guess when I get something that fits well, feels comfortable, and cheap to buy.. I get really happy about the purchase.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 03	labels:How do I buy pants that fit online?
text:Do you already have pants that fit?  Measure your fit and rise. Then, look up that brand's size chart to double check your measurements. Then, look for other brands with similar measurements. Higher rises require different waist measurements.  Leg opening and inseam and other measurements might help too.  Edit: also, check return policies including return shipping. "Free" returns where you have to pay $10 for shipping each way are not really free.  Also, if you can try on a particular size / cut from a particular brand, and know it, and trust it to be consistent, that's good too.  Also, know a tailor.	labels:	episode_done:True

Do fun hairstyles. Use accessories to identify your trades tools. I keep a small charm on my box knife. My co-worker keeps her work ID on a quirky lanyard.   --shop at local boutiques for quality accessories, thrift shops for deals on good staples, direct from brand shopping for long-term staples, consignment for vintage treasures, and everything else from big box stores.  --rescue lightly worn pieces from your friends' closets. (wash before wearing!)  --don't buy clothes you're not going to wear. time proves comfort beats a good look.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 06, 2020	labels:Does anyone have any recommendations for a bright wool coat?  I've noticed recently that all of my coats are very neutral (black, navy, charcoal, tan, etc.) and that's *great*, but I also really want a bright coat as a statement piece since a lot of the clothes I wear under are already pretty neutral. My ideal piece would be a bright blue wool overcoat, but I can't seem to find a men's one anywhere online.  Does anyone have any recommendations for something like this? I just want a wool coat in a primary colour (e.g. blue, yellow, red) and I've honestly never been concerned about standing out in a crowd. Overcoats, trench coats, duffle coats would all be good!
text:Look Paynter	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are you hate wearing?	labels:Just a mix of nonstop leggings and sweatpants. I miss dressing up but I'm so fucking lazy. On a good day, I shower and change into leggings, a bralette, a  teeshirt and sweater/sweatshirt. On a bad day I just stay in my pajamas all day.
text:I feel this at my core. I used to wear such casual chic clothing around my clients with big funky accessories and always with a bold lip color. But now, I am in hatelove with a gigantic chunky green sweater from Target that cost me all of $22, but I wash and dry it as if it were some high end boutique item from a Brooklyn designer. Gentle cycle, cold water. Fluff. Hang dry. And then I wear it again for 3 days in a row without makeup because I can't even begin to relate to my stylish clothes. They seem like old friends I've lost touch with and I forget what we have in common.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Is anyone dressing up this year for Halloween?	labels:I usually go to my local goth club on Halloween, dress up ridiculously and dance all night. That is absolutely not happening this year, so I have opted to dress up ridiculously and drink for free at home.    2020 has been a complete wash as a year, but I haven't put on makeup or heels in 8 or 9 months. I'm hoping dusting off my vanity will cheer me up at least a little. Last year I wore a very involved angel costume, but since I'm not going out I'm just going to put on my much more comfortable bunny costume.

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:I spent like two months investing in a bunch of nice wool sweaters that I could wear through the winter, put them in a separate laundry bin after wearing so I could launder them myself, but my ex washed and dried them on high heat and they all shrunk so badly that I couldn't even fit them on my dog. About $1500 gone.
text:This is why I don't really let my husband run the laundry too often. He's an amazing human, I love him, and there is so much he is good at; but laundry ain't it. He puts everything all in the same load, all on Hot water, and all in the dryer for an hour. If I left him to do it with no supervision, everything would be ruined.	labels:Yes to this. This is why I do all the laundry (and he does all the dishes for compromise). If you can't tell what goes in the dryer and what doesn't, hands off.
text:I've told him nothing knitted or with trim or elastic goes in the dryer. So far, so good, he's only messed up a few pieces that could be re-rinsed and hung to dry. He did give up on my blouse this morning because it needed Spray and Wash, so, that's kind of bullshit. But yeah, I'd rather do that myself tbh.   He's only shrunk about 3 sweaters in 3 decades; not too bad!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:It really depends on your area. My favorite in my town in Salvation Army. You really just have to check all the ones in your area out and decide for yourself which has the best selection and prices. Also, figure out which days they do sales (my SA has a color tag for 99 cents on Fridays) and plan trips strategically. I moved from a city to a small town and at first was really disappointed in the thrifting since I rarely find modern brand name items, but the prices are way better, there is lots of great vintage, and I feel like there are less 'trendy' people shopping for the same style of items as I am.   So it also depends what you're looking for!	episode_done:True
text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:These are both accessories but they make me feel put together and are 100% worth it for me. Prescription sunglasses (allowed me to finally give up contacts) and my 8mm pearl stud earrings.	episode_done:True
text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:In 2020 I've been working in a small, casual office that has a wide range of temperatures during the day, so my style leans towards the comfortable high waisted jeans and a flannel or cardigan combo with clean sneakers. I also have some very stretchy dresses.  Pro: I'm so, so comfortable, my clothes match the physical requirements of my job. My clothes bounce between masculine flannels and feminine skirts in a way that I like, and the colors look good on me.  Con: Because I'm dressed casually, I worry that others will see me as messy or shabby. I have a plus-size body, which factors in. But I'm probably also feeling this way because I haven't had a chance to dress up in 2020.	episode_done:True

On the two-hour train ride back, made my other friend smell them to prove they weren't stinky after me wearing them all day lol!   Thanks for posting this. I'd completely forgotten about that trip, and I realized I absolutely need to go track down the (few) photos I have from that day and scan them.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 08	labels:I recently got into biker leather jackets, but I read that you gotta drop at least $400 on a decent real leather jacket. I wouldn't be opposed to it, but my two main concerns are that:  1. The biker jacket aesthetic may not stick with me in the long run (even though I think they're super cool since a few months ago) 2. I'm currently at 160lbs and plan on bulking to 170lbs. I'm concerned that the jacket will be too tight in the shoulders, arms, and chest and I can no longer wear it.  I also understand that faux leather jackets are of inferior quality compared to real leather jackets, but it's also at a lower price point. Those things considered, is it worth buying a faux leather jacket over a real leather jacket? If not, what things should I consider while shopping for second-hand leather jackets?
text:If you think it's possible you'll change taste or change body shape in the near future you should 100% go faux leather over real leather. Leather jackets tend to look better the better they fit you but because they're leather you're not gonna get a lot of give in the material to allow for slight fit issues. There's a reason that there are multiple popular made-to-measure leather suppliers that allow you to dial in the exact fit. Particularly because it's such an investment I would wait until you've hit a long-term goal weight/body shape before dropping serious cash.	labels:	episode_done:True

Especially if you played sports but honestly with every group for a while there! Old Navy flip flops replaced them eventually though, probably because they were so much cheaper.   I definitely remember a lot of things others mentioned already - too low, flare jeans. Studded belts. Camisoles for days. Very fitted shirts. In the summer, VERY short shorts, like the shorts barely existed.

It was the stars above nightgown which is rayon/polyester/spandex... very smooth.   Can anyone recommend something that would be very comforting and not irritating to skin? A blanket or sweater, etc?
text:I'm not sure about a blanket or sweater- but I can recommend something for cold feet...? I have some health issues that cause my feet to always be painfully cold. I have always struggled to find warm socks or slippers since I have sensitive skin and I am also allergic to wool. This year I tried Heat Holders slipper socks and they are WONDERFUL. Very soft, keeps my feet super warm without making them sweaty, and thick enough to keep my feet from hurting as I walk on tile floors.

I seem to have this problem with all my trousers, be they jeans, chinos, smart trousers or joggers.  I'm anything between a 29 inch & 31/32 inside leg, depending on what type of trouser I'm going for. Does opting for slim fir, or trousers with stretch, make it better or worse? I've heard arguments for both. I have fairly big thighs, and large, muscular calves - does this add to the problem?  What sort of trousers and fit should I be going for?

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.
text:This is the method I use as well. I have an Arcteryx non-insulated hard shell in black that I purchased 15 years ago (still going strong cause it's bulletproof). It is the only jacket I wear for skiing. If its -20C with windchill I just keep increasing layers. Dri-fit base, Merino wool (tight), Half zip merino wool (loose), heavy full zip fleece jacket, Arcteryx hardshell over top (adjusting the number of layers for conditions). For spring sking - the Arcteryx hardshell with Dri-fit base only. One Jacket to rule them all.	labels:You wear 2 base layers? That's nuts. I like it.  Right now I wear a merino base, a patagonia nano puff insulation layer, and a Helly Hansen Alpha jacket that is rated 3/6 on their site for warmth. I'm still too cold, and I don't see how in Canada anyone could get away with a lighter hard shell jacket.  In your case, with 5 layers, anything is possible.
text:In BC, for mountain hiking, I get by with three layers:  -	Uniqlo HeatTech base -	random merino sweater -	Arcteryx Atom LT  This has been fine for summits down to -5C, as moving definitely helps. Theowing on a Patagonia Better Sweater and a Beta LT helps for higher hikes and windier/colder days.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What's on your 2021 fashion wishlist?	labels:I'm going from the Middle East (last year) to living in the Baltics (2021) so it's going to be aaaaall about the cold-weather gear and woolens for me. I don't have a super-great grasp on what the formality levels are going to be at work yet, but I'm definitely hoping to get some great all-weather boots, some super warm leggings for non-work or work from home wear. The new job comes with a promotion so I'm going to need a few suits and some wool dress slacks for work (for those days when it's just too cold for anything else!).  I'm thinking a lot about velvet and knit and texture, trying to do longer (and warmer!) skirts than my usual pencil skirt without looking girlish or dowdy... and trying not to splurge on every coat known to man (four wool coats and a cape isn't too-too much, right?)

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:I learned nothing from my mom - not that she didn't try, but that she had no sense of style.  She was a plus-sized woman raising a plus-size daughter in a time where plus-size fashion was not a thing. Muumuus and ill-fitting pant suits everywhere! She's very much a believer in wearing shapeless, baggy fabrics and that plus-size women should hide everything. I can't go clothes shopping with her, I can't trust her judgement.   She's good at applying makeup, but bad at choosing shades and types that look good on her, so I ran away from the orange lipstick and green eyeshadow and didn't ask her for help.  She's had exactly 2 hairstyles in her life: the giant 60s beehive and then short perm'ed curls. Long hair is a mystery to her so I never learned the art of ponytails, buns, braids, anything like that.  I didn't make a lot of female friends until the end of high school and we didn't bond over clothes and makeup and they just couldn't understand why I didn't know any of these things.	episode_done:True

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Disclaimer-- I know myself well enough to know that a capsule wardrobe is not for me.  When I get back from traveling, I cannot wait to wear different clothes.  Consider your laundry situation.  Having a smaller wardrobe means that you will be doing laundry more often.  If you're one in a family of 6, it may not be a big deal.  But for a single apartment dweller (pay per load), the additional costs can add up quickly.   Because I pay per load, I make sure that I maximize the capacity and only wash full loads (I'm paying the same no matter the capacity).  I am not one to hand-wash clothes in a bathroom sink.  Not now, not ever!   I do laundry roughly every other week alternating lights and darks.  (Sheets and towels are their own ballgame, and I will sometimes throw things in with them.)
text:Just curious but why didn't you get a washing machine for the apartment?	labels:Some condos either don't have space or they don't have the right connections. I do wonder if some rental apartments mandate coin laundry.
text:It's weird to control what appliances go into places you rent out in my opinion.  I only want to know what conditions lead to her not owning one because it is common where I'm from even in the cheapest type... People are so overly sensitive here they downvote anything that has the slightest possibility of being offensive	labels:Landlords' prerogative, their property, their say. I actually want to understand why too, because I consider a washer and dryer to be basic appliances. IMO some rental places have coin laundry maybe so landlord can make some more $$$ or something.   Other times, for older buildings, maybe the infrastructure just isn't there and it's pretty infeasible to make such radical changes.
text:I'm a landlord, I own a condo in an apartment style building. I looked at getting a washer and dryer in my unit, but there wasn't the proper venting for the dryer in place. It was an issue with the building that wasn't possible to change from my unit. So as you mentioned, an infrastructure issue. I'm happy though at least that the use of the laundry facilities in the building is free for my tenants to use.	labels:	episode_done:True

I usually wear a pair of black sneakers so a pair of really baggy jeans would just look wierd I feel so that's why I'm here asking for advice, thanks!
text:I wear 36x32 as well.  I wear straight fit jeans.  I usually wear them with white sneakers or brown chukka, and give them a roll or two because I like the look.

text:I agree!  I'm short enough that they fit me like proper pants.    I accidentally bought a pair of mid-rise dress pants, and I feel so uncomfortable in them.    And related to low-rise, I don't think I'll ever be able to tuck my shirts into my pants.

text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:> "house dresses," i.e. clothes that you wouldn't want to be seen in public wearing  I actually get the opposite read from that NPR link. Not house dresses as embarrassing clothing to be worn only behind closed doors, but rather as a step up from sweats/activewear, helping people feel better/more put together/more normal in our current situation. I'm reading it more as saying, house dresses originally existed as a concession to comfort, allowing women to wear looser clothing while still remaining "ladylike" (because they are dresses), but they are trending now as a way for women to feel "dressed" while at home.   I've been living in a Cupshe button-front loose floral dress that I got in a clothing swap right before the pandemic, and I wear it just as much to the grocery store as I do at home :)
text:Oh, I didn't mean to say that the article was claiming these clothes are embarrassing. By describing all of these styles (t-shirt dresses, caftans, etc.) as 'house dresses,' I feel like the article was suggesting that these aren't 'real' outfits, and that's cool because we're in a pandemic. Is there something specific about these dresses that distinguishes them from non-'house dresses'? I mean, trapeze dresses and shift dresses have been a thing for awhile, right? In other words, why is comfort a "coping mechanism" and not just comfort for comfort's sake?	labels:I agree that the styles themselves are not anything new, just the home context. Certainly there are people who have been rocking these dresses at home before now, but I also don't think it's out there to say it's becoming more common or trendy right now.   And I actually don't think it's the comfort that is the coping mechanism, but rather the dressiness. If comfort was my sole concern, I would never change out of my PJs. But changing into even a slightly elevated outfit, even if I'm staying home all day, does help me cope.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 13, 2020	labels:Hello, I was referred to this sub for help.  I'm a girl and looking for a bit of fashion advice for selecting a Disney/disney park outfit for my Fiance.  I'm aware it's super easy to go overboard and make a childish or slightly effeminate look when dealing with disney stuff. Which isn't my intention.  I'm getting married and honeymooning st Disney world next year2021. And I know we will be taking a lot of photos. And I want to gift my sweetheart a cool outfit to wear for pics.

First day I wore them to work I got out of my car and proceeded on the five minute walk from the car to the office.

text:Noel Fielding X Fendi menswear colab	labels:I see Noel Fielding. I remember the Great British Bake Off. I updoot.  When I think of Fendi, I'm not a fan due to the overt branding on the baguettes. I don't think this collection really strikes me as interesting, though I am a fan of look 31 and the blue piping detail. The graphics also don't excite me a ton, except for the cursive Fendi coat in 23 (and I actually love the pop of the turtleneck and gloves and piping - so whimsical!) This collection confuses me as it's simultaneously very muted but also funky, but I don't feel as though there's cohesive messaging. I don't know Noel from anything besides GBBO, but I would have expected or liked a l'il more goth and/or more color out of the collab.	episode_done:True
text:Feminist clothing	labels:I have to laugh at a request for feminist clothing being downvoted on a women's fashion sub.    The ladies who fought tooth and nail so yall could vote, own property, have careers, and take for granted the notion that you can be your own person would be *so proud*.
text:It just reeks of performative consumerism. Unless you're really gonna make sure every fiber was picked and shipped and dyed and processed in a eco friendly intersectional feminist way its a pretty hollow descriptor	labels:I had to check what sub I'm on for a minute.  This is the same sub where they had to make an actual rule against ethical-shaming, because people wanted a safe space just to enjoy fashion for its own sake.  But OP drops the F word, and suddenly everyone's got a thesis in the comments about "performative consumerism" and how nothing is ethical enough.  Fine to make suggestions of what you consider truly ethical enough, but that's different than randomly downvoting the post.  Of *course* its performative.  *All* fashion can be described as performative.

text:Genuinely curious, what body type looks better with low rise over high rise? I thought cinching at the waist was universally flattering maybe I'm wrong	labels:Low rise tends to look better on people with short torsos! Mom jeans just make me look like a bunch of legs and a head :(

I read this is normal and they should close up as the shoe gets broken in but I feel like mine wont close up all the way because its an inch wide at the top. Is it normal to have a V in oxfords or will I look foolish? If I go up a size the shoe will be too big. Maybe my foot is just weirdly shaped.

It will be less crowded.   * Find out if there's a weekly sale day where the store gets basically cleared out. The day after that will always have a narrow selection, so avoid it.  * Measure your best-fitting items while laying flat. This will help you determine what fits if you can't try stuff on. You can even bring a little tape measure with you to the store.	episode_done:True
text:2020 Gift Megathread	labels:I'm trying to choose which clothing store to get my mom a giftcard from. The goal is to get her to branch out her style (shapeless black clothing) and get clothes that _fit_ and make her feel good. It has to be a clothes store (no Targets where she could spend it on other things), and I'd prefer a store that's leaning into the current sexy trendy vibes over the frumpy trendy vibes (so no Madewells).   I'm considering Zara, but imo Zara is pretty overpriced so I'm here to see if anyone has any other suggestions! :)

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 29, 2020	labels:  Can I buy women boots instead of man's? ( Yes , I've been trying out men's boots and they never have my size since the lowest is EU 39, women boots are usually sizes lower ). It's usually on the leg that it gets large and it's uncomfortable, since woman tend to have smaller legs the model are smaller in the legs ( I hope I'm right).  I'm not sure if there are any identical boots I can buy in the woman section that will look good and not be feminine.  Am I being stupid haha?
text:Women's shoes usually run B width which is 2 sizes smaller than standard men's (D). If they fit, you can wear them.  Some men wear ladies Red Wing Iron Rangers because they don't offer narrow widths.  ~~EU39 is an 8.5US, is that really that rare?~~	labels:I think your conversion is wrong.

text:The best sweatpants — 11 pairs tested (full post in comments)	labels:$150 for what I am essentially going to wear to bed seems a little expensive, when historically most of my pajamas have been homemade.  Are people actually wearing sweatpants outside the house? To me that's sort of a sign of giving up on life.
text:I thought people only wore pajamas to bed on TV.	labels:Well, that is what they are for.  Where I grew up it got SUPER cold. My childhood bedroom would be in the low 60's at night. I generally slept with warm pajamas, several blankets, and a very thick quilt.
text:I have indoor heating.	labels:So did we supposedly, not that it ever worked well in my bedroom growing up. But the heater struggles a bit when it gets down to -17F at night.  Even now, I usually wear some pajama shorts at the very least. I've always been a little concerned, if there was a fire or something I don't really want to be sleeping in the nude.

And the days of spending lots of time idly browsing shops and trying stuff on to find the perfect fit are over. Now I just buy stuff and hope it fits, and if it's passable, I keep it. I dress plainly but I do care about things that fit well. That's not really achievable with online shopping and stores with closed fitting rooms :(	episode_done:True
text:What’s your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:It brings back warm memories indeed! I think I'm with many other 80s and 90s kids when I say I'm enjoying the comeback, but it's not for me personally. I feel lile I've been there done that, and with been there I mean as a kid. This style involuntarily feels like stuff I wore when I was a kid, which makes them look cute on others, since you know, it's a trend, but on me, no, I'd feel like I'm back where I started, a fashion interested 9 year old.	episode_done:True
text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:I have no idea if it's possible to see these anymore but watching "What Not to Wear" was a game changer for me. Rather than following trends they talk about dressing to your body type, which was a revelation for me. Trendy items are for accessorizing, but the base of the wardrobe is classic pieces that flatter the body type. Highly recommend their method.	episode_done:True

Jeans or leggings with a black top so I've decided to change my shoe wardrobe over to red. So as each pair gets worn out or I decided to get rid of them (for instance, I don't LOVE my ballet flats, I should upgrade) I will buy the next pair of shoes in a red hue. I like most of the styles I have now so I can see myself buying that same style again just in red lol	episode_done:True

text:Ever been censored at work because of what you wear?	labels:Fellow teacher here. That's fucked that the school censors you but allows Trump promotional items.  Sorry you're dealing with that. Not sure if it's worth falling out with your employer over. Maybe vent to a teacher counselling service even if you don't intend to take any action?
text:It doesn't sound like the issue is a Trump issue - the problem is that the teacher is employed by and represents the school while acting as an authority figure and role model for the kids. There is nothing against any employer asking that their employees refrain from perceived political messages in their attire or behaviour. In fact, most jobs will not let you display political messaging in your attire nor during your duties.    Schoolchildren wearing trump paraphernalia are not employees, they aren't bound to the professionalism and ethos requirements of the school in the same way that the teachers are contractually obliged to, and they don't act as authority or role model figures, nobody will question the seniority of a students authority based on their political views...	labels:Lmao how the hell is a 'feminist' shirt political messaging and worthy of questioning one's authority? That's some conservative misogynistic crap.   Just say you're a Trump supporter and go, your comment history spouting conspiracy, 'devil's advocate' crap like 'but what if the guards were democrats trying to make Trumpists look bad????' makes your bias quite clear. Shameful.

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:I make a point of buying investment pieces and thinking of my overall wardrobe before purchasing. If it's an item I know I'll wear a lot, I'm happy to spend more knowing it won't fall apart as quickly. For example, workout leggings and black leggings specifically. There are so many cheap options on the market, but they always fall to pieces after a few washes. I prefer buying a pair or two of high quality, often pricier ones that last for years! They still look brand new after tons of wash and wear and I'm not replacing them often, thereby not contributing to fast fashion as much!	episode_done:True

I'm in my early/mid 20s, and now that I've worked a couple years at the same place, I'm wearing more what I want than boring professional. I also started caring about what I wear and planning my outfits. Velvet shoes, corduroy overalls, rainbow prints, sequins, bold colors. Who cares? I've been called out for dressing "fancy" before, but I've stopped giving a shit in correlation with my confidence in my abilities. I'm a teacher...if anything, I'm showing the students it's okay to be yourself and take risks.

In completely unrelated news uniqlos balmacaan is great for me. While the material is shit the fit is great hits just above the knees and slimish and the hand of the fabric is really soft/smooth I'm excited to wear a long coat!
text:I'm not knocking the hustle, but something about the idea of getting payed for your plasma really rubs me the wrong way. I mean, the idea that companies pay you for your "fluid" and then turn around and sell it for a profit is super ghoulish to me. Idk, it's like getting payed in blood money, literally, hahaha.	labels:Oh yeah I totally agree haha I have a piece or 2 I'll joke about paying for in blood cuz I purchased it using my plasma money.   they push a bunch of ads while your in there explaining how you're saving lives, and it's being used for medicine but we all know everyone is there for the easy money the staff are always really nice tho so i use being there to practice small talk sometimes.	episode_done:True

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:I used to make jewelry. I got a screaming deal on some sterling silver wire from a shop that was going out of business. Like $40 for most of a spool. I made a gorgeous graduated byzantine chainmaille necklace. I could have easily sold it for $500. I had it out showing it one day and hurriedly put it away with some other pieces in a paper bag to get it back to my car (I know- WTF was I thinking?!). I forgot all about it and cleaned out my car a few weeks later...and threw away the bag.   That's by far my most horrible one. There was no excuse for it. Just an epic brain fail.	episode_done:True

I do feel like it's an addiction, though. I've told myself that I'm not going to buy any new clothes until I've cleaned up and organized my closet because it's seriously a disaster and I can't even find the things I want to wear a lot of days, but I still find myself browsing through shopping sites and adding things to my wishlist. And I still like actively seek out new clothes. Whereas my mom will say "I want to stop ordering clothes but I keep getting emails about great sales and I can't resist them," I will be doing work on my computer and suddenly get the impulse that I want a handkerchief-hem skirt and start googling "handkerchief-hem skirts."

At least most of the time I end up changing my pants because I don't know what shoes to wear. And it's holding me back. I've never been a huge fan of derbies, especially black derbies because I associate them with school uniform shoes, and I'm forbidden to wear sandals. So now I don't know what to do. More types of boots? Buy nice derbies and see if I like them? Accept that all outfits go with boots? shrug

Imagine an eternity with underwires! Maybe that's why so many of the female ghosts from the corseted ages are wailing all the time - they're bloody uncomfortable!   I died slipping on my driveway cleaning up the Halloween decorations.  I guess I'd be called the Candid Wanderer, given that I'm an immigrant and died searching for what I'm supposed to do in life.

text:What am I supposed to do with my head post-chemo?	labels:I don't spend a lot of time on this sub so I don't have any great threads to link you or anything, but there's lots to love about straight hair! I don't know exactly how yours is, but depending on how long you keep it, straight hair can be great because you can style it however you like. If you keep it at that medium-short length that most guys have, have fun with getting a pomade and styling it into some kind swoopy style. Look at hair models to get an idea.  In terms of maintenance, you've kind of hit the jackpot. Managing straight hair is stupid simple. I use the most basic Target-brand shampoo and conditioner (separate, not all-in-one) when I shower and my hair turns out soft and healthy.  I think a lot of advice here depends on what kind of state your hair is in, what length, what kinds of styles you go for, etc. Might be good to edit in some of those details if you can before more people stumble on this thread.
text:Thanks for the advice! I'll be sure to add that my hair is short at the moment. I haven't had any time to find out what styles I go for because of how recently I grew hair back, however.	labels:Grow it out for a while before you write off straight hair! Spend the next month or two looking at straight hair styles you like and once you have the length try one out.

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash.

Wools and silks I hand wash using soak detergent.   Rayon I'll give the old college try and hand wash but with limited water contact - 99/100 times it's fine. I think newer rayon tends to shrink less than old rayon. There's only been handful of pieces over the years that have been ruined by this method, and usually because I left in water too long so set a loud timer. Big wool coats or fancy dresses I'll dry clean though because its a hassle to hand wash.	episode_done:True

I've been wanting to buy a leather jacket and have now found the perfect one. Most size small jackets fit me perfectly but , considering I'll be piling on some size, I don't want to outgrow something I love.

I especially miss my heeled booties :(
text:I miss shoes too :( I'm not a shoes-at-home person so I'm now barefoot or in socks 97% of the time, and when I do leave my house I'm usually in sneakers to exercise or run one (1) errand and I want to wear heels goddamn it. I might just say fuck it and start dressing up for my errands honestly....	labels:I dress up for my errands - idgaf. I miss looking cute. It makes me feel good when i'm out too.	episode_done:True

text:I'm a really big fan of Kuhl's synthetic stuff. As a hardcore surf fisherman and fly fisherman they work great in the summer and hold up to the salt water. I've owned a few PFG items and have had 1 good experience and 1 bag, but the price range can't be beat.	labels:This is pertinent. I can't get near water and not fish and invariably get wet.  Appreciate the insight!

text:What do you mean by "edgy?"  I think 18 East and No Man Walks Alone carry some cool shit, but I wouldn't call them "edgy," or dress in anything I'd describe as "edgy..."	labels:I kinda use it very broadly, but i guess more specifically i mean dark/punk sorta aesthetic
text:Alright, that's fair. Not really my vibe. But I think most people who use the word "edgy" are *mostly* making fun of you.	labels:I've never had anyone call me edgy, just the way i choose to describe how i like to dress
text:Kay. Don't sweat it, I'm just messing around. Have some fun. Good luck with that job.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:Honestly, I've transitioned to a lot of outdoor brands (arc'teryx, Patagonia, etc) for this exact reason. I find that these clothes are usually made with high quality construction, are very comfortable, and are made to be repaired (and usually have a correspondingly awesome customer service/warranty). There are a lot of offerings from these brands that don't scream "outdoor technical" too.
text:Same lol. Outdoor brands are so good for durability. There is a lot more scrutiny placed on them too with reviewers comparing pieces in action on hikes or whatever. And since the styles don't really change that much year to year, they basically have an efficient process to make the items at the best price with quality to withstand the elements. It might not be the most stylish but it's going to last.    Also since the style types don't change much, there's a lot of second hand stuff that's basically the same as the new season stuff just different color ways and  you can get them for better deals. They also hold their resale value on the secondhand market. Like the patagonia better sweaters / vests and stuff.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:The North Face's Denali Jacket Hit Icon Status in '95—And Stayed There Ever Since	labels:I had a love/hate relationship with this jacket. When I was in high school in the PNW in the early 2010s, all the "popular kids" had this Denali jacket in black or the raincoat. I wanted one but also everyone had it so I also didn't... I don't see it nearly as much of them now but also I'm not in high school or live in the PNW anymore where North Face was the dominant adventure/nature lifestyle brand around those places

text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:I have had good success with Poshmark, but I use it to find items that sold out in my size when it was in stores. I've also used it to replace a lost or ripped/stained favorite piece.   I feel like the prices are high. And the semi-"social media" thing they have going (news feed, styling someone) is dumb. I think there are some sellers on there who ghost their listings but so far only came across that once and I was refunded.  I used to Ebay more but Poshmark is better for the app.	episode_done:True

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Cons: People think I'm crazy  Pros: Other crazy people recognize me as their own. Regular people are not as startled when I act weird or talk about weird stuff.  I wear a lot of very unusual clothes that I make myself. A lot of them are inspired by historical fashion and videogame characters, but there are elements that are sort of hippie or vaguely goth/theatrical. A lot of what I wear is exceedingly lazy in essence, but people don't really notice, I think. I also have a very... medieval view on colors - specifically I consider the idea that some colors clash to be just a nasty rumor.  Also, I am autistic. I figured out that it pays to advertise. People are less weird about some of my odd behaviors (that I can't really help) if they get a heads up in the form of a huge lavishly embroidered long red skirt and a baby-pink viking style coat and a bright green shawl. And a pale purple puffy pointy hat that looks like the tower top of an ortodox church.

text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I usually wear one statement piece with more basic items, but if I want to combine more dramatic items, I try to pick items that stand out for different reasons (unless I'm going for full on maximalist).   So like with the pink suit, it's 100% the colour that makes it stand out. So I would pair it with a top with a bold pattern, or a dramatic scarf that creates an interesting silhouette, or a belt or necklace that has a lot of interesting detail.

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:Gen Z teens have unlimited access to quality makeup, makeup tutorials, hair tutorials. They can buy any clothing style they want and receive it in the mail tomorrow.  Milennials in their teens had 5 high street stores, Camden market, 3 women's magazines. Then style YouTube exploded when we were in our 20s.
text:I would say that's not entirely true, I'm on the older end of being a millennial and definitely used LiveJournal for hair and makeup tutorials and bought cheap vintage clothes on ebay. ASOS started shipping to the US in 2010!	labels:What kind of vintage were you into? I really wanted to be a vintage shopper, but my mum hates second hand clothing. I once bought a fun faux fur coat that give me some Courtney Love power and my mum threw the coat in the bin :(
text:At the time I was really into 1950s shirtwaist dresses - I didn't even watch Mad Men but I did dig the style like everyone else at the time. I don't love the fit and flare style as much, but I do have some 1950s skirts and sweaters, mod 1960s dresses, and some fun 1980s big sleeve blouses and a jumpsuit.	labels:Shirtwaist - that's a very flattering cut!	episode_done:True

I do try with leggings, 8-hole doc martens and woolen socks with crazy patterns made by my aunt, though. (Socks overlapping leggings)  But how do you make them look smart and cute without looking like your pants are just too short?  (Yes, I struggle a lot with the current trends of 7/8 and cropped pants)

text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:I was like "Oh, no... I don't do that." but then I thought about it and realized I have a TON of unwritten rules about getting dressed. Like, never more than three pieces, period (so, dress, jacket scarf = okay. trousers, blouse, cardigan, scarf = I feel weird and too busy.) Always at least one item of jewelry if I'm going out of the house (usually earrings). No more than one print, but more than one texture is OK. And all-black requires a statement piece of some kind to be 'an outfit' -- cool shoes, neat earrings, or something.   ...this may possibly be a big part of why I've spent 90% of the pandemic in my PJs, come to think of it.

text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:I think that the current pandemic makes people unwilling to indulge in (or display) fashion excess. I visited Paris during 2009. Everyone on the street was wearing monochrome dull colors. Even the wealthy fashionable women were wearing dull colors.  People don't want to draw attention to their wealth right now. Also, there are very few places that we can go that require any kind of fancy dress, which is where (in my opinion) maximalism really shines.  We are living through a boom and crash. Maximalism was the fashion that WOULD have happened if the coronavirus hadn't happened and destroyed the economy. Look at what happened to fashion before and after the stock market crash that set off the great depression.  I am going to huddle under an oatmeal wool blanket now and take my anti-anxiety drugs...	episode_done:True

text:Same here... I'm guessing we're around the same age. Corduroy was pretty unfashionable when I was growing up so I always associated it with old people.  I still don't own any, but I'm no longer repelled by it since I've seen a lot of designers and hobbyists incorporating it into fits I like.	labels:Possibly, I am from 2001.

I have plenty of clothes already and don't need any more, but currently just have 1 pair of earrings so would like to expand my collection a bit :D I think I also want to invest in some white trainers, I was too scared to buy them before in case they got dirty, but they go with so many summer items.	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite colorful brands?	labels:Oh if you like lucy & yak take a look at lucy locket loves (it is sports wear with some casual clothing - lots of amazing bright leggings in cool patterns)	episode_done:True
text:Do you have any pieces that "should not" work with your body that just seems to work?	labels:I'm chunky and busty, when I say busty I mean I am a 36J-K.  For some reason shirts that are tight over my chest, and looser across my tummy always make me look much skinnier (think upper case P, in a good way).  One would think that the looseness around my tummy would make me look chunkier, but it doesn't.	episode_done:True
text:Are there any alternatives to a suit that you know about or your culture uses?	labels:In bangladesh for formal occasions you might wear a normal suit, but more common is a Panjabi and white Paijama. They are both basically made of thin fabric so are good for summer. The panjabi is often a deep colour with a lot of embroidery, but you can get light coloured simple ones too. Pair it with leather shoes or sandals.   My dad personally wears a panjabi with suit trousers and a suit jacket. We live in england. I only bring out the panjabi for special occasions like weddings
text:That's fascinating! I'm checking out the images now and it seems like exactly the kind of formal wear I was thinking about: ornamental, sleek, and appropriate for the climate. Mixing it with a jacket is also an interesting hybrid. It allows you to be sensible, express your culture, and take ownership of what was essentially a British standard set on the world. I might look into exploring a combination of a guayabera with "suit" like ornamentation.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Style Lessons from Male-Presenting People: An Inspo Album	labels:I loved this album! Some of these, if I saw in the wild, I would think looked kind of accidental (like I was wearing a jacket and then decided I needed another jacket) but I love your comments for each picture. It made me look at things in a more runway mindset, "Why is this outfit interesting?"  I have a request, if you're taking requests (no pressure though, this was great)  a summer album? I feel like in the summer my style is more constricted or more basic because I wear fewer pieces, and it's easier for me to have weird & cool proportions with jackets and sweaters.	episode_done:True
text:What are you planning on getting rid of this year?	labels:I've been letting go of some denim. I'd amassed a bit of an overload of Pure Blue Japan on recent trips to Japan, and while they're all beautiful and fit perfectly, I just can't wear them frequently enough. A friend happens to be exactly the same size, so I gave her a deal on 'em. She was happy, because finding button fly, 100% cotton, heavy weight denim for women is pretty tough.

text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:My 2021 resolution is to wear the clothes I bought in 2020 and not buy more, lol. Honestly I'm in the UK and it looks like we won't be coming out of frequent lockdowns until maybe June/July at earliest so that leaves less opportunities for going to places and serving snazzy outfits which is sad but hey, it is what it is.  I've been trying to wean myself off buying clothes, not because I hate fashion or something but to combat a shopping addiction I developed in 2017 (basically dealing with any negative emotion by buying clothes) and I've gradually gone down from 80 items a year to 40 and now 25. I've got a baller wardrobe with clothes I love so if I can manage to get my clothes shopping habit to what it used to be - a rare treat instead of a regular thing then I'll consider it a win for myself.	episode_done:True

I've really loved them over the past few years (shout out old navy $12 sale!). I have a pair of what I guess you might call camp shorts? They're kind of cotton with an elastic waistband and deep pockets? I'd definitely buy more of those if they were cheap enough.   One thing I've been recently fascinated with is bellbottom overalls. They've got a few options on amazon, but they're 40 or so bucks and that seems a bit much for something that may be awesome or very dated/weird looking in actuality.   I don't anticipate they'll get around to my vaccine until fall if not later, so I'm not "dressing" for summer at this point. Even if I have to go back to the office my new job has a "wear whatever as long as you aren't indecent" policy.	episode_done:True

It is obviously prescriptive and repressive to say fat people need to hide fat "or wearing "flattering clothes", but if they are wearing some loose maybe they just like it? We do not have to wear body fitting clothing to be OK, or proud with our bodies, sometimes you know you just like the silhouette, the cut, the comfort.  Grandma can wear whatever she wants and she is not necessarily ashamed.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 22, 2020	labels:So I've been lurking / participating here for about a month and I think I have a good feel for the types of posts that generally end up on this sub, common opinions etc.  I see this same pattern - posts that align pretty well with what's discussed in WAYWT/Discussion threads, like the Rick Owens post from today or the coats post from last week, getting thousands of votes and comments from people posting things like "he looks like he's shit his pants", and "nobody would wear this".  Why do people who spend their time lurking this sub, silently absorbing whatever opinions and discussion, decide to come out of the woodwork to post _this_ hot take? Really - you had to put some thought and energy into typing that out. If that's what you think, why are you here?  I just don't understand.

It's actually been very interesting to me that a lot of my style is actually coming back into fashion (midi and maxi being back for a few years, volume/bishop sleeves, prairie dresses, historical inspired fits and corsets, 70s inspired coats and leather dusters/blazers) when it has been out for years.  Maximalist elegant/historic inspired jewellery has been out for a while in favour of a more chic boho thing, like the shell trend and abstract minimalist gold shapes trends and now its retuning to the cute Y2K stuff. I'm just not a fan of it personally and really delight in finding more grown up whimsical pieces in metal and semiprecious stones.

text:I can't rank because I haven't tried all 5, but Charles Thyrwitt is a slightly thicker dress shirt, whereas Polo Ralph Lauren is a thin, semi-flowy shirt.  They're both nice though. Ralph is great for summer in my experience.	labels:Thanks for the reply ;)	episode_done:True

text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:I think it just takes time to find the right fit for our own bodies. Lots of items look good online/on models, but when we wear it, it's different. It takes practice.   Also, when you mention effortless cool people, you are talking about Instagram influencers right? I think it's good to learn from their way of styling clothes, but only to a certain extent. It would be egregious to try everything they are doing/buying, and too expensive as well. But, lots of fashion influencers know the basics about fit and style, so it's good to take tips from them in the beginning.   I think Zara, HM, Aritiza are great brands to buy from - they are pretty trendy and have interesting stuff always. I don't know what you mean by simple and chic? Do you have examples?
text:Thank you for the tips :) effortless yes, some instagram influencers put on things that if I saw in real life i would never buy but when they style it and wear it I go all heart eyes for it. And then I beat myself up over it cause I think to myself damn why didn't I think of that outfit.    As for simple and chic, im not big on extreme patterns or colours I just want to look put together effortless. Not fond of really bold patterns and colours but don't mind it for special occasions. Zendaya is my style inspiration if that helps. Also i can never find the right wash of denim pants and then I see girls with the exact wash that I had in mind and I go crazy.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:My best friend and I had ~matching white ruffled mini skirts which we would wearing with layered brightly coloured camis, candy-coloured skate shoes (we do not skateboard then or now), and fitted jean jackets with trucker hats. We were not, then or not, truckers. She works with autistic children and I'm a librarian.  Sometimes, I wish we had more pictures.   Mostly though, lots of flared jeans that were torn to shit at the bottom  and usually soggy halfway up the calf, tight polo shirts with tight zipped hoodies on top, the candy-coloured skate shoes mentioned above, and really bad highlights. I remember getting a pair of ballet flats (black, classic) and being mercilessly mocked. They came in style properly about a year later and then everybody had the Steve Madden snakeskin ones. I wore them on the first day of school with a camo print pleated miniskirt and a tight black polo shirt with fishnet gloves (????)	episode_done:True

text:Decolonize Sustainable and Ethical Fashion	labels:I'm surprised the article doesn't offer ANY suggestions for decolonization of the extremely western hierarchical consumerist notion that clothes must be brand new ready-to-wear to be considered "fashion." There's no mention of secondhand fashion, no mention of custom-made clothing, no mention of traditions like crafting your own clothes and accessories, repurposing old clothing through alterations or cosmetic updates, home dyeing, or even caring for classic pieces so they last and don't require replacing. To me this notion of always shopping for new "sustainable ethical" pieces is the "bombing for peace" of the fashion industry. Decolonize wasteful over-production. Decolonize fashion as status. Decolonize newness.
text:This is my take on everything related to fashion! I think there is a lot that can be gained as a consumer from this as well. If we are willing to maintain clothing, we can spend more on a single piece of clothing.   I recently learned how to hand sew so I could repair small amounts of damage to clothing. So far I have saved one pair of $100 pants from an early death and made a pillow.  Currently interested in learning Sashiko and maybe some other patching techniques. It is already paid for itself.	labels:I'm sorry for asking but is sewing not common where you live? In India its very common to repair clothes by hand sewing.

text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I've decided to fuck it and wear what I want to wear. I have literally no one to impress so my clothing purchases of late have been....questionable?  I've said hello to a halloween 50's dress with crinoline, a tree printed cowl neck dress, a faux fur lined hooded dress that is thin enough for Texas winters, and I have a 50's dress with skulls on it on the way.  I wore a witch hat, a raven and feather headband, black unicorn ears headband, and a 50's pillbox with veil pretty much every day from September to November.   I am quite enjoying my fashion of late. It's ridiculous and I love it. I even roped my bestie in (who is a nurse and goes to work every day) to buying matching dinosaur dresses with me. First I bought matching dresses for myself and my daughters, then her daughter saw them and asked for one and she bought it for her. Next thing I know she bought one for herself. We went exploring one day and found some cool murals and my husband took a photo of all of us in them and I've just hung it in my house because I love it	episode_done:True

text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:I know that social media can subconsciously influence the way we perceive ourselves and the world around us. Perhaps try taking a little break/limit time from exposure to social media? It might change the way you dress. Also, I find that educating myself about the world of fashion has really opened my eyes to all the possible things that one can wear, so maybe try reading up on some fashion history/watching educational videos to hopefully gain a deeper appreciation for garments?

I've been wanting to buy a leather jacket and have now found the perfect one. Most size small jackets fit me perfectly but , considering I'll be piling on some size, I don't want to outgrow something I love. Should I buy small, as it's consistently advised to size down on leather jackets, or go for a medium. Keeping in mind that I'll keep this bulk as lean as possible. Thank you.
text:Wait until you've reached your goal, consider it as a motivation goal and a treat. There's no real way to predict what build you'll end up with and when, and a leather jacket is an expensive "investment" so you don't want to screw up the fit down the line.	labels:Thank you, But what beats me is all the "credible" advice around sizing down on leather. But maybe it's just me trying to rationalize this purchase. Hope, to hear your thoughts
text:The advice to "consistently" size down on leather is meaningless for many reasons :  1. Not every brand sizes the same 2. Not everyone who buys a leather jacket wants the same fit 3. Sizing down on your actual body shape when you plan to bulk up doesn't make any sort of sense.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are you hate wearing?	labels:Basically any plain t-shirt. Really 90% of t-shirts actually. I just feel really bleh in them, unless there is some other element I really like. AKA the screen printed image, occasionally the color.  They rarely become part of a real outfit for me.  I also bought these pants in January that were non-returnable and big old waste of money. The color is great...the fit could use some work, but most importantly the quality is awful. I have worn then at home. And out a few time. Everyone is fooled - they can look cute. But only I know that the threat at the seams have holes that get increasingly bigger with every wear. I'll be lucky if I can get to 15-20 wears before there is a big old hole.	episode_done:True

If you were to wear leggings, would you still be wearing underwear?  And a less dumb question, I'm probably buying slippers or other house shoes since I'm probably staying inside much more this year.  What do you look for in lazy and warm footwear?
text:I wear leggings under shorts when working out (no other underwear). I also sometimes wear them under pants when it's really cold.  For slippers, I look for something that won't lose all of its cushion in a couple of months. I also look for something with a durable rubber sole.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What's the greatest length you've gone to obtain a much coveted fashion item?	labels:Before more fashionable brands got into making plus size clothing, Torrid was one of the only places bigger teens could get trendy and/or goth clothes (before they turned into aspiring baby lawyers). Being Canadian, it cost a fortune to order from their online store and I don't even remember if you could return back then, if you could, it definitely wasn't free.  My parents wanted to go fly out to visit my aunt in BC and visit scenic Victoria, so I convinced my mom we should rent a car and go across the border so I could go to Torrid. I tried to sell her on Seattle but she was afraid of driving there, so we settled on Tacoma.   And that's the story of how I ended up spending hundreds of dollars on plus size goth clothes, going to Olive Garden for the first time, and almost dying when my mom tried to make a left hand turn on a busy street to the shittiest hotel I've ever been in.
text:>going to Olive Garden  This is so cute. A lot of my non-native US friends haven't been to Olive Garden or Red Lobster, so we all went and it was an EXPERIENCE lol. Even though they've been in the US for a few years, unlimited anything is still a novelty.	labels:I sorta make it a habit of eating at all these legendary US fast food/casual places whenever I'm there. I've hit most of them except Whataburger, Bojangles and White Castle. Sorry Murica, animal style isn't as legendary as it's made out to be. I wish we had a Chipotle near me but a bunch of ripoffs have opened so it's okay.
text:Honestly same LOL. I make a point to go to McDonald's every time I travel to a different country too. The localized menus are fun.  I grew up in Texas and I fuckin loooove Whataburger. If you get a chance to visit one, def go when you can get a honey butter chicken biscuit and take extra fancy ketchup to use later LOL. Animal style fries are trash. (But In n Out fries are trash in general.) I like animal style burgers with peppers though.   I don't understand Chipotle hype. I grew up with Freebirds (possibly a chain you could hit up with Whataburger) and I like that a lot more.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:More Men Reach for Sewing Machines	labels:Learning to sew darts, hem trousers, bring in trouser legs, and wastebands, have been some of the biggest savers of my favourite items and keeping up with the fluctuations of weight and style that come with life.        Not to mention jeans repair, crotch on my nudies is more darning than original fabric now. Worn in look on a reliable pair of jeans that fit nicely is hard to imitate.      It's wierd how the simple home repair craft has been labeled un-manly, despite most of those paragons of manliness people put on pedestals singing the virtues of repairing objects used every day.
text:I take pleasure in working on cars, eating meat, and eating meat while I work on cars. Thats all stereotypically masculine. I find sewing extremely boring and will often ask my female friends to patch my clothing for me. So I textbook fit what is supposed to be "manly", and imo I'm not the worst human being ever.   Challenging what is "manly" is fine, but its very popular right now to imply that we should be challenging those norms because they are bad or "toxic". Challenge it if it doesn't work for you, and follow the norm if it does work for you.	labels:> Challenging what is "manly" is fine, but its very popular right now to imply that we should be challenging those norms because they are bad or "toxic".

text:If you change "military inspired" to "COD COLD WARZONE FITS POGCHAMP" it would get 100x more upvotes	labels:There's probably something to be said here though about the difference between our associations with the term 'military' which is disparately evocative to the associations someone might have with a fantastical or gameified work that includes military elements or concepts.  (There's also something to be said about whether or not people making those kind of games have an obligation to address the serious implications of gameifiying the history of certain cultures' violence and wars)

text:Bernie Sanders' Mittens Won the Inauguration Fit Battle - And you, too, can own your own toasty upcycled woolen mitts.	labels:I for one appreciate politicians not giving a fuck about dress codes. When they all wear suits they blend in and that lets them get away with so much more awful shit. Make no mistake, I love a good suit, and I wear them regularly - but it definitely is the outfit worn by the greatest terrorists and mass murderers on earth. Maybe it's time we let politicians express themselves.
text:I disagree mainly in the sense that it can lead to cult of personality type feelings. even what we're seeing here with the mittens thing. if everyone is dressed nearly identical it cuts out the distraction.	labels:Because that isn't a problem right now?

text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:Oy this will be jerked if it isn't yet...  I looked at the first account and you can actually see a pattern in her outfit: athleisure, black and white pairing, combat boots, leather jacket and structured handbag. It's good that you're looking for inspo, now you go through it with an analytical mind and try to find the pattern. Then you try to reproduce.   Like others have said, I don't find the style quite elegant or expensive. But if you're into it, it's totally possible to recreate!	episode_done:True
text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:Send him over to PermanentStyle.com.  Most British and Italian tailors go to NYC (obviously not happening given COVID).

My mom taught me how to hid this curve or hide this trait or not accentuate this thing. As in, wear tops that cover your butt, wear bootcut jeans, keep your hair long so it doesn't show off the Shape of your face. Fuck that, I do high-waisted skinny jeans with crop tops and a bobcut now. I love it.  I never really liked the way my mother dressed. Not as in, she dresses ugly but I just didn't wanna wear what she wore. Never had the need to use her as an example in how to dress.	episode_done:True

The really cheap brands (e.g. F21, Fashion Nova - this was before SheIn) did NOT work well for me - the low-quality was obvious in the fit and drape of the fabric, plus it was pretty difficult to find office-friendly pieces in the first place.  H&M and the Banana Republic/J Crew Factory Outlets (they're online!) were a lifeline, and I still wear many items!  You may also have luck with resale sites like Poshmark and ThredUp.	episode_done:True
text:Bernie Sanders' Mittens Won the Inauguration Fit Battle - And you, too, can own your own toasty upcycled woolen mitts.	labels:A similar pair of mittens were made by a school teacher in his state, Vermont, in appreciation of him.

text:Short answer: see if you can tailor your current clothing for extra room. If not, start replacing the core items (tops, jeans, etc.) with straight or slim-straight fit items. Don't jump into the JNCO look off the bat or you'll stick out.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:Low rise jeans - you can pry them from my cold dead hands. The high waisted trend just isn't for me. I style them with a classic tuck and belt or I wear a form fitting sweater that hides the low rise but still gives me shape.

text:When will I be "too old" to look cute, cool, hip, whatever?	labels:I can't add anything to whats been said I think there are some great comments here. I don't know what sort of build or how tall you are. I know men who are short, were considered cute when younger and in their fifties have never filled out and even with greying hair are still considered 'cute' and boyish looking.   I've always been really skinny and at 50+ I've been described as cute, I've not changed, physically all that much over the years. I'm lucky, but I've also taken care of myself eating well and taking exercise.  Your body will decide things for you, you might change as you get older, but wear what feels good for you and take care of yourself.

text:High quality plain white t-shirt, basketball shorts, athletic socks with a pair of Stan Smiths, designer shades?   Summer style all depends on venue.

text:General Discussion - October 22	labels:Seeing how crazy people are going for Aime Leon Dore is astounding. For the prices they are charging, people are snatching it up like it's a Supreme drop. At $500 a sweater or $2K for a coat, there's other brands out there (AMI or Acne Studios comes to find) that would be very similar styling or quality.   And it's selling out not even general release but the early access stuff.
text:Eh, styling wise it is very much its own thing. AMI and Acne really don't hit that mid 90s vibe just as well. But the hype has caught me off guard completely, no one seemed to give a shit about it for the past two years or something and then it seemed to just blow up over summer.   Their t-shirts are ridiculously thick though, so sorta wish I had picked some of them last summer.	labels:I think their NB collabs did a lot to build up a hype market for them.

text:I think "down jacket" is sometimes used as a catchall for insulated pieces. Synthetic insulation has actually come a long way and can be as good as down (and better in wet conditions)	labels:As someone who's hiked a mountain or two I'll even say that if you're out for  longer trip where you will physically excert yourself, and the weather is above freezing, then I'd prefer synthetics. Just getting really sweaty can be enough to start making you feel the difference between pure down/synthetics/mixes.  It also is dependent on where you live. I live on an island with very much water vapour coming from the Atlantic, so even if it isn't raining you might still be getting damp, which synthetics handle a lot better. This time a year I wear a real down vest over my sweater, and then a cotton jacket with synthetic insulation underneath. So the part that might get wet is all synthetic.
text:Yeah, and God forbid you drop your pack in water or through some other accident soak your down jacket.	labels:The sheer number of ways you can get your stuff wet doing outdoors activities is staggering. I've never gotten through a whole trip without at least one item being wet when it shouldn't have been. Be that my matches, my sleeping mat/bag, food etc. And that's with precautions taken.  A good rule of thumb, especially if you live/travel in mountainous areas, is that if your gear doesn't work wet then it doesn't work.	episode_done:True

For example, I avoid Primark clothing because it has terrible ethics but also the quality is poor and the designs are cheap.

I don't know, maybe I just associate it more with rockstar because it's an SLP piece and Alex Turner was the first celebrity I saw a photo of wearing it.

text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:Nike (and to a lesser degree every other mainstream athletic brand). They've managed to convince millions of people to buy their stuff for the privilege of being walking advertising. Kinda genius but insane that people go for it
text:I disagree. Their Zoom technology was ground breaking, their flynit tech is VERY good for runners like myself, the SB line is one of the best for skateboarders, etc. It isn't just about the brand, and they offer various models and technologies that other companies just can't accomplish. For their pricing, and compared to other brands, they are somewhat ethical now (compared to five years ago, completely different story).   Sure, the nike swoosh is a bit of a walking advertisement, but that could be said about literally any company that's not unbranded.	labels:I didn't like Nike that much over the past years, until at my local running store the sales-rep (who runs sub-2:30 marathons himself) told me to try a pair of next%.. they fit like no running shoe has ever fit me before, and running up and down a few times on the in-store track, showed me how amazing they were. Do I think they're overpriced? Yeah, but i got 15% off, and then I think they're great value for the technology.  Does that mean I changed my mind about Nike in general? Most likely not, but I do see running shoes as sporting equipment, and not like sneakers, (I wouldn't use them to go to town) so that's a different use-case.	episode_done:True

text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:Honestly, I can tell you are still young (mid-20s) from the nature of the question. It depends on lifestyle much more than age. Plenty of 40 and even 50-somethings wear trendy non-conservative clothing especially in creative or tech industries, while plenty of 20-somethings dress like dads because they have more corporate jobs. But as you get older, you do shift brands a bit. For example, currently, 20-somethings might still desire streetwear brands like Supreme, Vetements, and Yeezys while those older might still be hip but shifted to Fear of God, Balenciaga, CDG or more upscale brands that still have a casual street vibe.
text:I think John Elliot may be a better example than Fear of God.  Also, what exactly sets Vetements aside from Balenciaga to you? I feel like most "normal" people view them as one in the same. Hyper expensive and abstract "streetwear" for people with more money than they know what to do with.	labels:Balenciaga is an old luxury couture house that has been around since the early 1900s, and Vetements is less than 7 years old, so to me, one is rooted in heritage and the other is more like Off-White. Just my personal opinion. There's no right or wrong when it comes to these things.
text:Im just confused. Have you not paid any attention to what Balenciaga has done over the last 5-10 years? They fit right in with off-white. Oversized hoodies for $900.	labels:Yeah I agree about their style but they still have some heritage pieces that are closer to their runway tradition. It's just that their oversized tees and hoodies have dominated the streetwear scene, but in their boutiques, they still have a lot of designs that are closer to what one expects from the more avant garde couture fashion houses. But I agree, they are fast losing that side of them but I suppose a lot of the impression comes from heritage and I meant Balenciaga has been around since the 1910s and ranked in the same breath as Dior or Saint Laurent or Chanel, so even among the most stodgy old money crowd, Balenciaga is a recognized and respected brand, whereas I bet no one's grandma has ever heard of Off-White or Vetements.

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I love leopard print. I often pair it against denim, red or black. Sometimes pink, though I have much less pink in my wardrobe.  I hear that tho, about having a piece that doesn't really flow with the rest of what you've got, so it feels unfamiliar and maybe you dont identify with it.  I'd encourage you to play around with it and see if you can find a pairing that makes you feel confident and comfortable. Its always fun when you can break through to new styles and combos.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 23	labels:Hey folks, I'm looking for boot recommendations and my needs are a bit specific. If anyone happens to have any recs that fit these criteria I'd love to hear it! Thanks.   1) Have to be able to survive Toronto winter; good traction and durability are a must.   2) I have to be able to wear them in an office setting. My office is business casual but exceptions are made for winter boots, people wear all kinds of behemoths in there in the winter. Still, I want it to actually look decent with a dress shirt and chinos.  3) Something that would also look decent with more streetwear/techwear style outfits. That's generally my style when I'm not at work, so I'd like it to be nice looking with a hoodie and some cargo pants too.   4) Budget is probably $300 CAD, but I can save up and stretch a bit for the right item, rather do that than half ass it.   I know that's a lot, so thanks for anyone who's bothered reading it and especially if you respond. Cheers!

text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:My mom, who was one year younger than Marilyn Monroe, used to say, "some women dress for other women, some women dress for men, but I dress for myself."  That said, she did have four sequined sheaths and sparkly high heels from earlier decades (broke my heart that I'm an amazon and not built like her, since I outgrew the dress-up closet when I was about ten), and really wore things that were body-conscious in the 1950s, but it was the fashion, too.	episode_done:True
text:Do you have a childhood fashion icon? If so, does their influence show up in your wardrobe today?	labels:This one's a little different, but my aunt was always my fashion icon. She was very active and somewhat known in the art world, and her look fit the part so well without being over the top or cliche. She's tall and slim, and always wore clothes that fit well, with clean lines but not revealing or form-fitting. She always wore cream or white linen, black wool, and accessorized with a small silk scarf or a little red here or there. Oh, and she never colored her hair or cut it as she grew older, so she's always had this beautiful long mane of white and grey hair. To my mind, she's always been the absolute picture of elegance. I don't aim for her exact look now that I'm an adult, but I find that her example still strongly impacts the way that I dress and the image that I want to create.	episode_done:True

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:If you have the space to store your current wardrobe, then my advice to you is simply not to pressure yourself into getting rid of clothing that you're not comfortable getting rid of.  Minimalistic wardrobes are not for everybody, and you certainly wouldn't be helping anything if you were to throw away those clothes only to end up  buying replacements later.     Take the clothes that you don't think you need and set them aside, maybe in a box or the very back of your closet, and keep only your 'minimalist wardrobe' in the easily accessible location.  If, after a year, you find that you didn't really miss anything from the old collection of clothes, you won't feel as hesitant about getting rid of them.  If you have to dig a few things out of your stash, just keep them.  If you find that you've completely ransacked your stash over the course of a year, and ended up wearing everything you didn't think you needed, then, well... maybe minimalism isn't for you.	episode_done:True
text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:Oh god. I'm instantly reminded of the embarrassment I felt whenever I showed up to a pregame for a frat formal and then realized it was SEMIFORMAL. I was there in a long red gown and everyone was in minidresses... I already felt out of place because I wasn't in a sorority, just was dating a guy in the frat. Thankfully I begged my bf at the time to bring me home before the formal and I changed to a better dress.  Anyway, I tend to be an overdresser. In college I felt more comfortable dressed how I wanted to rather than in big tshirts and athletic shorts or leggings. At the office, I work with a bunch of old dudes that are wearing polos at their dressiest lol. I'm perfectly fine being the odd one out there.  I think it's mostly rude to overdress whenever there's a stated dresscode. Like in my first example, I wouldn't call it "rude" but it definitely looked off.
text:I once turned up to a work Christmas do in a fairly tight red satin frock with a huge calf-length flirty skirt.  I'd been away during the business quiet time since October, and hadn't been at work to see the memo about it being casual. I got told by a (male) colleague to come along, he didn't mention any kind of dress code, so I assumed festive cocktail.  Everyone else was in jeans.	labels:You were the best looking lady there!	episode_done:True

text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:Good comfortable shoes for me, definitely! I work with cleaning. This is the only part of my job clothes that doesn't have any particular guidelines from the company, so we buy these ourselves.  I live in Sweden, and here you basically never have to personally pay for the kind of work attire you are required to wear. If it's free to choose, you may have to buy those things for yourself. However, if you need special work shoes, those are paid too by the company.	episode_done:True
text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I personally don't like them, not for clothing, accessories or decor. The only animal prints I like are prints with the whole animal. Like, bees, or the Gina Linetti sweater from Brooklyn 99 that had panthers on it. Blouse with beetles on it.
text:Same! My aesthetic is very "grandmillenial" and I've just never been a fan of animal print. Partly I associate it with either middle age, suburban moms or with big hair and tight clothes a la The Nanny. Not to say that Fran doesn't look amazing, but it's just how how I would want to dress myself. My dad also was big into hunting and we had a lot of taxidermy around the home, so I think that has probably turned me off of it somewhat.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.
text:Where do you go skiing? The last time I went I only wore I hoodie because it was really warm	labels:Weeeellllll to be fair it depends on location and when you go in the season, doesn't it?

Then I went skiing in CO in late March and wore a t-shirt, and was fine.

text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:I don't think it's a MUST, but that being said I have one which has served me well. It's sleeveless (thick shoulder straps), falls at the lowe-mid theigh, and has pockets. Think semi-skater dress, but the skirt is more structured.  If I wear it as is with some bangin' heals and jewelry it's a perfect cocktail dress.  If I throw on a blazer, stockings, simple earrings, and more basic heels, I feel like it's great for a business-casual look.  A black blazer, opaque leggings, and either flats or basic heels works for me for concerts (amateur musician. Classic and jazz). This has also been worn to a funeral.  It's not really a "going to the grocery store" dress, but we can't expect one piece to be for every situation.	episode_done:True

text:What am I supposed to do with my head post-chemo?	labels:I don't spend a lot of time on this sub so I don't have any great threads to link you or anything, but there's lots to love about straight hair! I don't know exactly how yours is, but depending on how long you keep it, straight hair can be great because you can style it however you like. If you keep it at that medium-short length that most guys have, have fun with getting a pomade and styling it into some kind swoopy style. Look at hair models to get an idea.  In terms of maintenance, you've kind of hit the jackpot. Managing straight hair is stupid simple. I use the most basic Target-brand shampoo and conditioner (separate, not all-in-one) when I shower and my hair turns out soft and healthy.  I think a lot of advice here depends on what kind of state your hair is in, what length, what kinds of styles you go for, etc. Might be good to edit in some of those details if you can before more people stumble on this thread.
text:Thanks for the advice! I'll be sure to add that my hair is short at the moment.

text:When is a garment worth it to you?	labels:If I can be confident that it's high enough quality to buy used on eBay then I generally think it's worth it.  I also think about resale when I buy now. I want to be confident that I can sell something if I don't want or need it any more. That means avoiding anything that loses 99% of its value once you've worn it, which generally means fast fashion but can also include items with a saturated second-hand market like levis. That doesn't mean I'm trying to make a profit, just reduce waste.   Sometimes I think about repairability and sustainability too. I'm trying to repair and alter my own clothing. I try to avoid synthetics wherever possible, but also with an awareness that natural fibres aren't always great for the environment.

It is touted as a very versatile coat. Great! I have even found one I really like.  But for something to wear in the rain; it lacks a hood for head protection. You wouldn't want to go out in the rain with your head exposed.  So are you expected to always combine it with an umbrella?   I haven't had a proper coat for rain before (made do with a parka or an umbrella) so the lack of head protection is surprising; unless you go for a more technical raincoat.

text:FAQ: What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand?

If my footwear was falling apart, I could buy an equivalent item (Van's sneakers for Van's sneakers) to replace it. Same rule if something ripped and could not be saved by a tailor. My only flex on this rule was when I saw my favorite band play and bought a tshirt. I had not seen them in 5 years. Once you have the basics and fundamental pieces in a wardrobe down you dont need much more.

text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:Logos are *trademarked. Clothing designs are... a more grey area. Like, a v neck knit sweater can only be designed so many ways, you know? However there are some instances where parts of a design are copyrighted, like i think the red soles on Loubitons, which i cannot spell, are copyrighted/trademark. Prints and artwork are a whole other story.  There are a lot of factors and copyright and intellectual property law also differs from country to country - there is no international copyright law, just general agreements between specific countries.  I personally feel that knockoffs and replicas are different. Replicas are illegal as they are faking an item AND copying the logo. Knockoffs that just copy the design... not illegal, generally speaking. Ethical? Truly depends on the situation.  In your specific examples, yeah theyre probably inspired by Sezane but tbh theyre not really dupes, there are clear design differences in each example.
text:I've watched a video on this and I think you're right.  Also, I think the argument is that a knock-off is not going to steal market share from the original. Those who want to and can afford a high end designer brand aren't going to buy a knock-off and those who do probably can't afford the original.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Best and Worst Purchase of 2020	labels:Best: hiking pants from Columbia, wore them almost every day March to November, because they can be dressed up or down and are very comfortable.  Worst: Expensive linen blazer just before the lockdowns, because I didn't get to wear it once and I am not that person to dress up for home office.	episode_done:True

text:So uh, what’s the trends for fall this year?	labels:This might be totally wrong but I have a feeling that face masks are gonna be big this season.
text:I think it would be hilarious for face masks to also follow typical fall trends. Plaid flannel, corduroy, tweed, argyle sweater, faux fur....	labels:lol, faux fur mask... that's nightmare fuel.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 01	labels:I want to slowly start phasing out my wardrobe and replacing everything with better verisons. To give you an idea, I did a lot of Uniqlo/J.Crew/Banana Republic/etc. type shopping about 4 or 5 years ago.   I want to change all that for something better and higher quality.   My style is very minimal and basic (think business casual, but with an emphasis on warmer weather), but I want to incorporate some things that are *slightly* less basic. Not crazy looking like I'm trying to copy high fashion but interesting enough that people notice that there's something special about what I'm wearing.   Can anyone give me a list of particular brands to look for? I'm not a slave to specific brands, but that's how I want to start off... I want to start gathering a list of brands that I like, identify things of theirs that I particularly like, and then seek out deals on them.   I just need a list of brands to start out with though...
text:To my knowledge there's no big brand list that your talking about. I would look at the brand reviews on the sidebar. you should be looking at stores more than anything imo that way you can look at multiple brands at once like end clothing, Mr porter, or huckberry. Other than that for me discovering new brands normally happens from seeing stuff on mfa/Styleforum.com	labels:> end clothing, Mr porter, or huckberry  That's a good point. I've shopped with Mr Porter before but it's been a while. I'm familiar with End but never bought from them, and I've never heard of huckberry. So I'll check that all out.
text:end sometimes jacks up prices, i'd lean towards mrporter or ssense if i were you	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:Loads of good advice already. I would also consider how you want to express yourself and be seen. E.g. Fun? Classic? Quirky? Uncomplicated? Elegant? That sort of thing, do some navel gazing. Do you want to show off your body or obscure it? What looks do you love on other people? What colours and fabrics do you love (or not).	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Ghost Outfit	labels:I died in my halloween costume. I am a plague doctor. I'm wearing a black dress, a cape, long black gloves, black leather boots, and of course the creepy crow beak mask. It isn't very comfortable but i look creepy as hell.  My ghost name is Doctor Death	episode_done:True
text:Spring/Summer trends: Dresses	labels:I find these cut-outs hideous and the tent-like dresses even worse. I vowed to only follow my style for dresses and not the trends. I want nice knee-length a-line/rather 50s dresses. And I want clear colors, aqua and mint and reds and not 50 shades of greige   Sorry for my rant but I missed a whole summer due to corona and want to go all in this year and feel my best.

text:Best way to buy clothes locally?	labels:I shop at locally owned businesses, I go to thrift stores, and I follow local artisans to shop for their products.   &#x200B;  I'm a bit confused as to why it is hard for you to find anything unless you live in a town that only has chain stores
text:I should have clarified. There a ton of small businesses in my city, but I have to visit their sites one by one. Which takes forever. Is there a Nordstrom or Zara for buying local?	labels:Try Garmentory! You can search boutiques by city and shop online.	episode_done:True
text:What is one item that you own too much of?	labels:Track tops	episode_done:True
text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:There are certain cuts and colours that I gravitate towards, but I've never had a 'style' as such, and don't feel I'm missing out on anything. I just buy what I like, within the limits of dress codes, social conventions and so on. I do sometimes make mistakes with my purchases, but they're nothing to do with my lack of labelling, more usually just excessive optimism.	episode_done:True

text:Even employed people aren't willing to pay $50 for a tee.	labels:It doesn't cost that much more to make a US made tee.  There are a lot of companies trying to price gouge US made stuff.  When American Apparel tried to bring back US made items their MiUSA tees only MSRP'd at $4 higher than the import tees.  Back when Everlane use to make tees in the US their total cost listed for them was $6.50.	episode_done:True
text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:Someone posted this a couple of days ago.	episode_done:True
text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:A little different but I own several saris and a couple of lehengas, some of which were my mum's and some from my grandma on my dad's side.  With my mum's, I like to style them as she wore them which is pretty traditional and really lean into the 80s style with fluffy hair and major winged eyeliner but I normally add a statement piece of jewellery to make it mine.  My grandma's I tend to mix up with different styles of blouses, different scarves and wear as more of a mishmash to fit in with the trends at the moment. One of the saris she gave, I've had made into a lehenga with two different blouses and the skirt into a ruffled, almost flamenco kind of skirt because the material really suits that kind of thing.
text:That's so cool!!! I don't know much about how saris and lehengas changed in style over time, but I LOVE the idea that you had one of the skirts made ruffly!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:I think just occasionally you find something that fits perfectly and you just know! Sometimes it depends on the garment as some have more leeway than others. Giveaways for a bad fit are as already mentioned with shoulder seams etc. Buttons pulling, waistbands not being flat to the waist at the back etc	episode_done:True
text:Celebrating the Basic Grey Sweatpants	labels:I just look homeless when I wear sweatpants lol. Maybe it's cos mine are real baggy	episode_done:True
text:Do you think that designer brands will no longer be as sought after in the future?	labels:East Asia is a huge market that keeps growing. I think Southeast Asia will keep growing as well, as manufacturing moves to those countries and millions of people enter the middle class. In any case, you only have to look at the earnings of LVMH and other luxury conglomerate groups.	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:I feel like dressing in the winter is so difficult (although the clothes are so much cuter/look better on me lol) because it'll be like 20F outside and 110F inside, and then a balmy 80F on the metro (crammed with smelly people pre-covid). so I usually wear a pretty thick coat (I got a really nice one on LL Bean last winter) and light layers underneath - J Crew tissue turtlenecks are my staples, Docs, and a scarf.  I try not to leave my apt during the summer haha...still trying to figure out cute clothes that won't make me feel/look miserable
text:I had this problem at my last job when I took public transit to work. I finally just got into the habit of taking off my puffy coat once I got into the subway station and holding it on the train. I'm sure it made me take up like 10% more room, and it was harder to keep my hands free, but it was worth it to not be a puddle of sweat by the time I got to work.	labels:you have to do this in public transit though because honestly it's ridiculous temps in there.  i've done it too.  you take your room up girl!	episode_done:True
text:Bernie Sanders' Mittens Won the Inauguration Fit Battle - And you, too, can own your own toasty upcycled woolen mitts.	labels:A similar pair of mittens were made by a school teacher in his state, Vermont, in appreciation of him. But he gave the mittens to a hospital worker who said her hands always got cold on her commute to work. When the teacher saw this she sent ten more pairs to Bernie and said that when she saw him wearing them at the inauguration she was honored because everyone there was wearing world class designer clothes but Bernie was wearing her mittens

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 11, 2020	labels: What are some good casual boots for $200-ish or less?  Looking to get my brother some boots for Christmas. He's 30 years old, and I'd describe his style as somewhere about halfway between basic-bro and hipster. Red Wings Heritage line would be perfect, but I don't know if I can swing $300.  Any less expensive alternatives? Around $200 or less would be great. He lives in Colorado - so they'll need decent tread for snow and such. Thanks in advance!
text:I picked up a pair of black Thursday Boots Captains a couple of months ago. The company has been bashed on reddit pretty thoroughly in the past, but for $200 I'm quite pleased with them. Most of the "Buy ____ instead" suggestions I read involve waiting for sales on factory seconds or things like the redwings that straight-up cost more money.  The version I got is basically a combat boot for a smart casual office dress code, and they are great for that. Quality-wise they're worlds better than the $100 boots that they replaced.  In your case (Colorado, snowy sidewalks, etc) I might lean towards one of the "rugged and resilient" leather options.  If you want a lug sole, they have 2 color options on the captain for that, and the Diplomat has a wedge sole and a moc toe instead of a cap toe.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:I feel the same way, I'm bewildered at so many people finding ALL pants uncomfortable.   The only thing I can think of is that they're either wearing the wrong style (I vastly prefer super high rise. midrise and lowrise cut me across the stomach in an uncomfortable way, unless they're a size too big), the wrong size (too small jeans WILL be terrible, especially 100% cotton), or they have sensory or digestive issues/stomach sensitivity.	labels:I find low rise the most comfortable, so the overwhelming prevalence nowadays of mid/high rise rules out most pants for me.	episode_done:True
text:What are you wearing for Halloween this year?	labels:I won't be going out. I'm so fucking sad. Halloween is my absolute favorite, and it was going to be an epic party this year.  However! I'm still going to dress up because I want to. I have recently acquired a comically oversized witch hat, so I'll be building a costume around that. I shall be the most fabulous witch while watching not-so-scary movies, eating candy, and getting properly sloshed.

I don't have to wear a tie to work so I leave the top the button undone (if I try to button, it gets choking though). Besides some discomfort, will there be any health problems if I continue wearing these smaller neck size shirts with the button undone?

Low rise flare jeans were fine when I was 18 but not at 38 after 2 kids. Let's hope not.  But for 2020 going into 2021 I think these are on their way out fast leopard/jag print, clear bags, mom jeans, obviously chunky sneakers, insta baddie all black kardashian looks, cut outs esp in swimwear slingbacks, super neutral tones, ripped/distressed jeans.

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:oooooh,so apparently my friends all consider me the laundry queen. I also have the strictest dress code out of all my friends. I will say that much of my wardrobe is machine washable,but even with those pieces I try to limit damage from washing. I have a couple of ways:  1. wearing more often and hanging up between wears to air out and limit wrinkling.  2. Depending upon the item,using an undergarment to protect from sweat etc.  3. Using a steamer to help remove wrinkles and refresh clothes.  4. If having to wash in a machine,gentle cycle on cold and air dry. I use a mesh wash bag for the most delicate articles. I find for a lot of "dry clean only" this method is usually ok.  5. For wools and silks etc. I use Eucalan.   edited to add: I don't really havs brand recs - much of my wardrobe is thrifted and even when I've gotten recognizable brands I don't think I'd be able to say with confidence if they were indicative of the brand's current quality.	episode_done:True

I used the live-chat function in the interim, and not only did the very nice saleswoman cancel/reorder for me, she offered to re-order later in the week and honor the sale price if I needed to wait for the refund to hit.

The tag says they retaila at and theyre marked down to 39.  Not a particularly bad price, and I do like a bargain, so Im wondering - are they worth picking up?
text:I'm not a fan of Diesel as a brand. I've always felt that they're overpriced. Their shoes have never been very good quality, imo comparable to Aldo and other fast-fashion brands. $39 is probably what they're actually worth, so on that basis you're not *really* getting a bargain.  That said, if you like them then get them. Just manage your expectations - you're not getting a high-quality sneaker for $39 - you're getting a $39 sneaker for $39.	labels:Sneakers.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 24, 2020	labels:What clothing should I wear to make my shoulders appear smaller?
text:You generally don't see a lot of clothing specifically designed for that purpose, and I'm not totally sure why you'd want to, but...  Avoid jackets with heavy shoulder padding. A natural shoulder can kind of accentuate the shoulder, but at least it won't exaggerate it.  Get jackets and shoulders that are wide in the body, so that the drop from shoulder to body seems less dramatic?  Large scale patterns make your body seem a little smaller, maybe. Since you're worried about shoulder width, you could try large horizontal scale and small vertical scale, if you find something like that.	labels:>You generally don't see a lot of clothing specifically designed for that purpose, and I'm not totally sure why you'd want to, but...

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:I agree with the Pinterest recommendations but also! Thrifting is a great way to expand your wardrobe fast and on a budget. You can always go and try on a huge variety of different styles at once and see what you like on your body and what combos look good. I usually prefer having an idea of what styles or items I'm looking to add to my wardrobe (e.g. denim jacket, crop top) before I go out. There's definitely a bit of a technique when it comes to thrifting though, so if you're just starting out, you could check out some of the more curated (but more expensive) thrift stores in your area! I got hooked on thrifting after I started following bestdressed on YouTube, whose style I am obsessed with :)	episode_done:True

Oh, to have the confidence and life wisdom of a 24-year-old man.  There's nothing inherently wrong with sharing/asking for your partner's opinion about your style or wanting them to like how you dress, but it has to be something that you've both agreed you enjoy, not just one person offering unsolicited opinions. It also helps if they actually know what they're talking about.	episode_done:True
text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:Currently swaddled in a $600-ish ADD down jacket I picked up for $3 this morning.  Hadn't heard of the brand, but the tag seemed fancy. I was in the market for a down coat to help through my first New England winter in a decade. It has a ludicrously dramatic collar and I am v. pleased to wear it with the $5 flannel lined carhartt jeans I splurged in.	episode_done:True
text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I was thinking about this the other day that I couldn't wear things I thought were cute and had to wear things that I didn't like but fitted my body type. I was so pissed that some girls were blessed to wear whatever and the rest were screwed. Anyways, I wore shorts and skirts despite having thick thighs and calves; wore skinny jeans though it could be shamed for the same reason above; wore crop top despite not having a flat stomach. At this point I would rather wear things I at least enjoyed a little than wear things that were meant for me (but not for my own enjoyment).	episode_done:True

text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:>Do you ever keep something (clothing, shoes, hair, makeup color) because everyone seems to love it- even if you're still on the fence?  Yup, definitely. I tend to hold onto items in my wardrobe if they get compliments from people when I wear them. In fact, I feel obliged to keep them because of the attention I get when I wear them. But these items are almost always my least favourite.   I've realised people tend to give compliments when you look different then usual. I almost exclusively wear black so of course, whenever I wear a different colour or a pattern, I get compliments on it.  It's not that my outfit or those items look amazing, it's just because people have noticed I'm wearing something different to usual.  These items aren't special, they're just not what I usually wear and so people feel obliged (maybe?) to compliment me? Anyway, I've decided not to keep items because other people like them.	episode_done:True
text:Hats - discussion	labels:My "hat energy" translates to "college kid who skateboards and/or plays hacky sack." As in, I have an entire drawer full of knit beanies (both fitted and slouchy) that I cycle between. I have one in almost every color, some with pompoms, one with my first initial embroidered on, one Nike with a gold metal Nike emblem sewn on, some thin and others thick and chunky. I love beanies of all kind and will never part with my collection. I used to have a couple other random hats, like a straw fedora and a black and white printed sun hat, but they never seemed to mesh well with my fashion sense and I ended up getting rid of them to free up space for... more beanies.	episode_done:True

I reorganised my closet over the weekend so I was able to single out the items I purchased this year.

I'd love a designer bag but it's not in my budget and the most I'd pay for a bag is probably $200-i try to look for sales and buy secondhand.  This is what I have in rotation right now-I tend to carry a bag for a few months before I get tired of it and switch it out for a different one.  \-Frye Olivia mini Backpack in cognac  \-Rebecca Minkoff Julian backpack in a cream color  \-Marc Jacobs leather Varsity backpack in gray  \-Fossil large Harper Leather saddle crossbody   \-Fossil medium emi tassel crossbody in burgundy  \-rebecca minkoff quilted chain crossbody in white (for spring/summer special occasions)	episode_done:True

text:The Business of Markups on Logo T-Shirts. Why You Shouldn't Drop $600 on a Gucci Tee	labels:I've been a bit of a T-shirt geek for about 50 years (seriously, ever since I started buying Grubb  and Hang Ten Ts in the 70s and parking lot tie-dies at Grateful Dead shows in the 80s and 90s) and by and large T shirts have gotten worse over time.  Oddly enough, because I needed some inexpensive shirts to trash while doing messy creative work I bought a bunch of Cabellas shirts for $7 each and they have been great.  A bit thin material wise but they haven't stretched, they hang really well, and they have lasted forever.    I have a friend that used to be a VP at a large footwear/apparel company and he and I have had conversations about T shirts.  It's all about what companies like Gucci can get away with, not the quality of the garment.  Economic signal theory at it's finest.
text:Totally agree about some of the old tshirts having great quality plus actually use some of the old fashioned methods valued today. A lot of the brands you hear about now (Lady White Co., McCoy's, etc) all use the old fashioned techniques but charging $100+ for a tee.  I think it's another reason why vintage tees (including just blanks) are so valued now.   I like Sunspel tees but even those guys have moved their construction to Portugal from England and I find that the quality has dropped over the years.	labels:What I really wish I had back are all the really interesting and beautifully executed silk screened Ts that populated the Dead world before the tie die thing hit.  There was some amazing art work on those shirts and the parking lot scene was capitalism at it's finest, there was fierce competition so people used really good blanks.  I still have bits of those shirts in my shop rag bin.	episode_done:True

If they're allowed to post photos, you get a better idea of what the item really looks like.

Which goes on to suggest comparatively expensive wood slat bath mats, which can also grow mold and bacteria.  Another article in the same series derides slippers, and suggests wearing $400 Gucci loafers around the house instead....     The site's OG premise was about recommending "quality goods" and all that jazz, but I guess they bought into their own bullshit and now conflate $$$$$$ w/ "Quality"  (Additionally, an anti-cold brew article in the same series as the others .references James Hoffman, a effete British snob who I would gladly kick down the never-ending stairs from Super Mario 64.)

text:Sorry, might be a non-native-speaker problem, I thought it was a synonym for effeminate?	labels:It ***can*** be used that way and one of the alternative definitions of the word is a direct synonym for effeminate, but context and intent matter in determining which definition is being applied.  Context for my use case is that his snobbery and pretentiousness is what I'm taking issue with, not anything else.  As such, the definition I/the other user gave is the fitting one.	episode_done:True

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:This is an interesting take for me, as I feel constrained by my circumstances to not wear heels but in a different manner. I am 6'1" at 20 years old, and I always feel self conscious wearing heels as I tower over some men and women. It elicits unwanted comments of "wow, you are so tall!! I would never want to be that height" and it makes me insecure sometimes.  This is especially true in male-dominated spaces. I generally feel as though my height requires me to make (some) men feel at ease so they are not overly intimidated by me and instead will take me and my ideas seriously. Therefore, adding heels to my already tall frame exacerbates the problem.  I'm trying to work through these feelings of perception and insecurity because I absolutely love styling heels!

And then I found everyone has memed them to death and that they are considered lazy, boring, and cliche. I haven't found anyone saying anything positive about them since 2018. Is it a bad idea to get them, or are they still considered good shoes?
text:you're totally fine! it's one of those things mfa clowns on because they were so popular for a while, but they're perfectly decent sneakers	labels:This may seem like a weird thing to ask, but would I be clowned on outside of MFA for wearing them?      I know there's a whole aspect of "wear what you like", but part of fashion is definitely trying to find stuff that looks good to others as well.
text:In 2017 only J.Crew carried em and sold out everytime they had a drop. It got super hyped and everyone wanted a pair. Eventually, people were all able to get a pair and everyone wore it. That's why people are saying its cliche. No you won't be clowned outside MFA for it. It's a great neutral sneaker and it goes well with most things, that's why it was so sought after.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:I wish fast fashion would die and there was just more variation among everyone :S
text:1. Fast fashion will absolutely not "die" LMAO but ok yeah it's totes that easy! You solved the environmental crisis! This isn't a laughably simplistic take that grossly overlooks the many complexities of the problem at all!   2. You do realize that the "death" of fast fashion means LESS variety and not more? The literal point is that fast fashion churns a lot of stuff in a lot of styles at a high frequency.   Right now, more than at any other time in history, we have options for many tastes, price points, lifestyles, and increasingly, for different sizes and body types.   The "death" of fast fashion would mean dramatically fewer options and variety, these two concepts are literal contradictions.	labels:This comes off as kind of rude. :\\ "I wish" just means they wish it would happen, not that they think it's likely.
text:Girl I'm so bored of this low-effort wishful thinking. This thread wasn't even about this, but every time, someone manages to make any fun thread about "uwu i wish fast fashion would die". Like, what's the point? What is it contributing?  But they never actually have helpful suggestions or...*do* anything in this direction. They all just "wish" it would just magically "die" which is unrealistic, overly simplistic, and usually off-topic.	labels:I understand your frustrtion at seeing the same comment often, but your boredom doesn't give you the right to mock someone. You could scroll past or leave a kinder comment instead.  Realistically, as far as I know, there's nothing any of us can do to get rid of fast fashion other than buy less stuff (if you have ideas, I'd love to hear them). That doesn't mean the cycle isn't exhausting and frustrating. I can see how the original post may have dredged those feelings up in the commenter you replied to. It isn't a big leap from the question to those frustrations.	episode_done:True

I also love birds on furniture, lamps, or carved into wood.
text:Yes to celestial and sacred geometry! I recently realized I also have a lot of pieces with sun and solar imagery on them and honestly if I could wear some kind of golden sun headdress out and about I probably would. I also love tie dye, specifically blue indigo tie dye - I went a little wild in Japan and Thailand and now I have enough indigo tie dyed pillowcases to create some kind of pillow-filled den of chill.	labels:Yes, indigo is my favorite tie dye!

Remember to wear forehead sunscreen if youre wearing a backwards baseball cap or you'll have a very, very strange tan line. Thats not from experience at all...

text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:A lot of the cheaper brands sold in the UK have improved in quality. Primark, Matalan, supermarket brands, etc. I am not claiming they are great quality clothes, but there have been significant improvements from the early 2000s. The tissue-thin t-shirts and actual cardboard shoes thing hasn't been a real problem for at least 10 years now. I've only had one new thing from there die in the first wash for a really long time.Being someone who could only afford to shop at these places or charity shops (and then not even charity shops for some of that time) for most of the last 2 decades, I've been able to compare. I got a big bag of my old clothes out of my parents loft the other week, things I was wearing around 2005 and there's a marked difference in t-shirts and accessories in particular.
text:Funny that a common theme in this thread seems to be improved quality from cheap brands and worsening quality from pricier highstreet brands. Spending more never guaranteed quality but it seems like it's even worse now.	labels:Most of them use the same factories and the same fabrics now so it's not a surprise. Next, H&M and Primark are basicly the same things, but Next charges more than the other 2, for example. I use those as an example as I worked in one of them and we did get our stuff come in with their tags occasionally, or we would sell something with a print or specialty yarn and they would have a different garment made of the same fabric etc.	episode_done:True

text:Search bar sucks. I have a couple Herning and an Inverallan 3a.  The "molding" to your body is similar but its a thicker yarn and a looser knit.   I can't speak to the 15a, that's a totally different knit but everything I've seen from them is pretty good.	labels:	episode_done:True

I shelled out for a heavier Patagonia jacket & I'm so so so happy in it. Sometimes I wear a green utility coat on top of it, I like that layered look.

text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:This is all assuming normal wear (ie I don't spill a plate of spaghetti on myself).  * Underwear/socks, face masks-- 1 and done * Bras-- 3-4 wears * Tops-- 3-4 wears * Sweaters/sweatshirts (always worn with something under them) as needed * Pants-- 4-5 wears * PJs-- 4 wears or whenever I wash my sheets (I have this thing where if I have fresh sheets on my bed, I need fresh PJs) * Gym clothes (when that's a thing again)-- 1 and done.  I'm predisposed to sweat heavily.  But for me it is not how often I wash clothes but HOW I wash clothes.  I was exclusively on cold water with a tiny amount of (free and clear) detergent.  I am allergic to dryer sheets, so I avoid the dryer completely (communal facility, a lot of residue).  I use a drying rack to dry.  ETA-- Hand washing is my line in the sand.  NO WAY!   Also with jeans, I wash inside out. I use mesh bags as needed.

text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:Planed obsolescence comes in to play. If the trend is over for the next season why make it last a year?  and adding to that is the cost of investment to change trends is higher for women with more possibilities with sizes and lot's of  inventory for each size. So the "Value"is in the changing for companys because it increases consumption but men don't have that.  For them if it falls apart or feels cheap they don't buy it and a shirt can last every season XD. So if it falls apart after a couple of months they are more likely to change brand for something of higher quality.  >>  >The lack of consumption and brand loyalty can lead to increase in quality with lack of differences and change cutting cost.	episode_done:True

That's the style I just do not understand, even on the raw sub, people will cuff like 3+ inches above their sneakers or even above boots. That just looks goof as fuck. And makes you look disproportionate with your jeans rolled up like that, may as well cuff them up to your calves at that point lol.

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I'm bi and the joke is often that bi people have no culture beyond erasure and skinny jeans.   I'm from a rural area in the south/Midwest and people always assumed my sexuality was based on who'ver I was dating regardless of my style. Now that I'm married to a woman most people assume I'm a lesbian, but what throws me off is some of the queer friends I've made online in the past few years think I have butch energy which felt shocking and wrong to me. I'm just a farm kid who is a nurse now. Everyone wears shit kickers occasionally and owns Carhartt coats out here.

Tons of people do this every day and it feels like the way this article was written still inappropriately enforces a gender binary.  > This very straight and married father man who is an engineer and loves cars totally breaks the rules by wearing clothes made for women and nobody else  Rather we could say  > Person puts on clothes that fit them, looks good  But that isn't such a gripping headline
text:I know what you mean and I agree. I don't particularly like the tone of the article, and the man himself is defensive in his instagram bio:   > I am just a straight, happily married guy that loves Porsches, beautiful women and incorporating high heels and skirts into my daily wardrobe.   In other words, "I like cars and hot women, so I'm manly. I just happen to like women's clothes too. But really, I'm manly." It reads like a masc gay guy trying to distance himself from "the fems".   Despite all of that, considering where most of the western world is regarding gender roles and expression, I think highlighting something like this is important because you don't typically see successful corporate boomer men in very obvious womenswear, especially at work. So even though there are plenty of issues here I think the visibility is important.	labels:Oh shoot didn't even realize you were the one who posted this.

text:What unknown/smaller brands should we all know about that don't often get posted here?	labels:**Kotn** has affordable, sustainable, and quality basics. Really love the look of their supply chain. I've got three of their turtlenecks and they're nice. You can also get a bit of a discount if you order from the Canadian site since they price everything the same regardless of currency.   **Big Bud Press** is awesome if you like a 70s vibe. I've got two of their cropped honeycomb tees, they're beautiful.   **Ovate, Sisters of the Black Moon, I Do Declare** if you like linen and victorianwear. They're pricey, though.  **ARQ** sells crop tanks and lingerie basics in the most fab colors for women and children. Everything looks very well made.
text:Came here to mention KOTN, they're a favourite of mine when it comes to very reliable and good quality basics. Ditto that for ARQ actually, although the price always makes my eyebrows go up to my hairline.	labels:Same, re: ARQ prices (although that hasn't stopped me from buying like, 8 matching sets).	episode_done:True

They're also a brand focused on sustainability and their customer service is great (at least on the wholesale side)

text:Yup!  A couple of weeks ago I got a great pair of jeans (ok they are a tiny bit big) in a charity shop.  Nothing fancy, just M&S, but PLAIN (not ripped/sequined/ragged/holey/whiskered - you get the idea!), dark jeans with decent pockets!  Didn't NEED them, I have two other jeans and three green (not kelly/neon, just sage?olive?) trousers in current rotation, but hey that's a find!

text:The Terribly High Cost of Cheap Goods	labels:Don't believe companies when they say something domestically produced will cost tons more. They lie! It's pure green. Unfettered capitalism. Maximum profit, minimal expense. I've discovered many high quality brands that have their goods made ethically and away from China! They do not cost a lot more and I'm happy to support locally made. No I'm not rich. The problem is that big greedy companies have the marketing budget to promote their cheaply made crap and thus make it hard for smaller independent brands to compete. But we have reddit which has been super useful in discovering such independent brands.

I've been looking and they seem to sit too flat and scream K-street. Ideas?  Once the coat is found, would a tailored business casual suit be the best way to make this work?
text:So if you get a camel topcoat that's casual enough to wear without a suit it's not gonna work with a suit mostly because it will be too small	labels:Yeah, I'm thinking a big-ass, more formal camel coat.. but one that doesn't sit completely flat like a raincoat or trench-coat.	episode_done:True

I basically want to live my daily life while looking like a fantasy character.	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:Personally, I try to avoid the thinking of what I'm going to wear when I'm going somewhere, other than for functionality of course.  I feel like we expect our personalities and our lives to suddenly become glamorous and completely different once we get there, but that rarely happens in reality.  Same with vacation to a tropical paradise. Or a new job. Or a move unto the city. If I'm not a person that's likely to look glam, polished and picture perfect in everyday life, I won't have the energy to do so on vacation either. Plus, it's vacation, a time for me to feel relaxed and do fun stuff, not a time to focus on changing oneself to someone I'm not!  That's my thoughts! I feel like social media, selling and marketing is especially targeting in this way. When we see a product we want it, not just because it's appealing for the eye but also because we expect these things to change what we don't like about ourselves. Things we don't really want or have the energy to change ourselves, so we expect stuff to do it for us if we just buy them.
text:This 100%. I packed so many cozy apres outfits when I last went skiiing and then never at any point wanted to get into real clothes after shower. So my real apres style was just the leggings I wore skiing with technical underlayers and a big unzipped ski parka.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Why even the pandemic couldn’t kill fast fashion	labels:I don't think most people here realize that if everything was made in the U.S then significant amounts of people wouldn't be able to afford clothes. Not to mention that tens of millions of people are employed in the textile industry abroad, the vast majority of them aren't slaves and will lose their jobs if westerners stopped buying clothes made overseas. Environmental costs are real and so are concentration camps in China, but it isn't a simple solution.	episode_done:True

Low rise jeans are meant to give the appearance of short legs and a long torso. I'm 5'8 and already have short legs and a long torso. Low rise jeans are my nightmare. I remember my pants were constantly down, crack was always showing and my mom would just come behind and pull them up. Low rise jeans were my first "cry in the fitting room" Low rise jeans helped destroy my confidence back then i don't want them back. I'm also 36G. Halter tops do nothing for me.

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:For footwear especially, there is a lot of high quality vintage out there for great prices. Lightly used Allen Edmonds, vintage Florshiem, and old defunct shoemakers can be found for sub-$100. A comparable new shoe can't really be found for under $200 at the bare minimum.
text:I totally agree to that, but do you guys have any recommendations for people in EU ? (Both on which brands to look for and where to find them) Because as a guy from France, I've never heard about Allen Edmonds before coming to this sub, and idk if I've ever seen this brand in any store.	labels:> Because as a guy from France,   You've got *way* superior options right there in France. EU more generally also has a huge number of excellent shoemakers at various price points. JM Weston, Corthay, etc.

The watch isn't on leather so that with shoes/belt isn't a thing to worry about, but does the black dial handicap you in anyway?  I think this question is better here than in /r/watches but maybe I'm wrong on that
text:A black dial is no more or less versatile than blue, IMO.  You don't have to match a leather watch strap to anything.	labels:Right exactly. I had never heard anything about dial color (unless it's like neon yellow) being an issue, but I wasn't sure.

text:Stockings vs Tights vs Leggings	labels:I wear fleece tights with knee high heat tech socks over them to help combat wind. This year I'm going to try thigh high socks over them to see if it will be warm enough for mini skirts. If you can get a maxi skirt that has cold proof materials in it like wool, then that will help too. Bonus points if it has a lining, if it doesn't then you can buy a separate one to wear underneath. It helps keep heat in and prevents your tights from pilling.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:It depends what you mean by 'fast fashion'.    Buying something from a fast fashion brand and wearing it until it falls apart is absolutely more sustainable than say, buying lots and lots of clothes from anywhere, even "sustainable" brands.  But a huge part of this issue isn't just sustainability but ethics. There's absolutely nothing ethical about fast fashion, from how workers are treated, animals are exploited, and the environment is harmed.  So yes, buying fewer items from a FF brand and wearing them until they've worn out can be a more sustainable option, it's never going to be an ethical one.  Sustainable and ethical fashion is full of trade-offs and compromises.  Rarely is there a perfect circle of fashion that's sustainably and ethically made, within your budget, and in a size or style you enjoy.  So we have to figure out a way to shop in a manner that's as sustainable and ethical as possible within a very tight framework.	episode_done:True

Their sizing it funny for me (I size down to a small for a not-too fitted tee but am often a size 14 to give you an idea), but the quality I've seen so far is excellent. And: not see through!	episode_done:True
text:Black is Beautiful, Braids are Beautiful, Bald is Beautiful: Ayanna Pressley as an icon of feminine professionalism	labels:Wow she looks like what I think a real queen would look like.

text:I bought a Kenzo tee last year at approx. 100 USD. Such a waste of my money.	labels:The reason why I don't buy any those type of shirts is because 99% people think it's fake. It's not that it would mather what they think, but it's still a kick in the butt anyway. I am talking about those t-shirts with all the big logos on it, not those subtle ones.

It was a simple white ballgown, but the skirt had swarovski crystals on it, with the fabric swirled around each one.

It made my butt look great and it was a cool grey acid wash type of colour. Just an amazing pair of jeans that was also comfortable.   A combination of my butt, cycling, walking, dancing and all kinds of other activities caused a tear. It is not at a seam, or on my knees, just weirdly below my butt and I don't know how to fix it in a cute way.   So now this pair of jeans is chilling in my closet because I am ubable to throw it away.

Wings + Horns or Reigning Champ tiger fleece hoodie. Indestructible material, texture looks great. Nothing fancy, but looks great on it's own with just jeans.   Uniqlo jeans. Amazing quality for its price. I've now own two of the same black jeans and I wear them almost everyday   Uniqlo basic tees. After W+H these are what I wear. Super simple but lasts long for its price and fits great. Soft material.   Engineered Garments wool cinch vest. Very flexible. Can be worn over a long sleeve tee, sweater or even a hoodie. Great for layering   Wings + Horns flannel. Bought a zip flannel from them back in 2010? I'm only getting rid of it now because the sleeves have finally ripped.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 22, 2020	labels:How can make a pair of Khakis look faded?
text:Your pants are going to fade mainly from friction, either by washing them or wearing them.  Sun exposure also will fade them some.  To artificially fade them you need to mimic these things more rapidly.  So, washing them repeatedly with other clothes, (like some rough towels), will accelerate the fading process.  Or, you can leave them in the sun to let them bleach that way.  The fastest way would be rubbing them with sandpaper.  I should warn you that artificially aging your clothes usually looks fake and people will be able to tell; and that is way worse than just letting them age naturally through wearing them.   My advice is the same as Mr_Tangents.  Just wear them.	labels:	episode_done:True

I've always been someone into tailored clothing and classic menswear, and honestly the odd jacket / trousers combination is absolutely the way to go. I own a single full suit, which I love, but generally it's a functional piece to be worn when a level of formality is *required* -- and therefore not as much fun.  Meanwhile, I have lots of different blazers / sports jackets and tailored trousers, and not only are they more fun to style and mix up, they're just that much more versatile that they become my go-to combination for what is basically my every day style. You can play around with the shoes, whether or not you have a tie, or a hat, and all of a sudden you have so many more options!  My suit simply doesn't have the same versatility, to the point that (when social functions were a thing) I probably wore my black-tie dinner suit more often.
text:I think you can have a jacket that is much more exciting than a pair of pants can match. Solid color pants are all I really wear, with more bold and exciting jackets.  And for 90% of the population, anything with a jacket is a "suit"	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:Sock Dreams will have answers to your thigh high desires. I swear by them. I do wear my socks over tights though, but it sounds like my climate is much colder than yours. I wear camisoles and cotton shorts under dresses for an extra layer, add sweaters and scarves as needed, the coat and boots. I've never tromped around in a dress at minus 40 degrees (that will kill you) but definitely below 20 degrees (F).

text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:2020 wasn't kind to me weight-wise (although this is my fault, ngl) so my big goal for 2021 is to not buy any more new clothes until I reach my pre-pandemic weight, and then buy clothes that actually fit instead of buying the largest size and hoping for the best.  Second would probably be to thrift more because cost and environmental impact   Third would be to continue developing a more "refined" (?) style and adapt it to the seasons instead of wearing turtlenecks and long sleeves all year round.  Lastly I want to incorporate more skirts into my outfits! I've always been too shy to wear non-uniform skirts out, but there are so many beautiful ones out there!	episode_done:True

text:Sorry, I peaked stylistically  in the early 2000s (basically Liz Lemon style) and I have been trying and failing to make high waist jeans work for me for several years now, so I will happily accept some slightly lower rises. Not like 2", just back down to belly button level.	labels:I am short and as much as I like the look of high rise pants they seem to usually hit me in the solar plexus and make me physically ill, so yeah I'll take some lower rise please!	episode_done:True

I'm assuming the "coolmax" shirts are something to be avoided too? But I narrowed down my choice to either Twill or Royal Oxford as I don't like shirts that are more see-through.

Steam if needed.   I wash my silk and wool and all of my husband's cashmere (all thrift store finds) sweaters, plus all my fancy dresses and whatnot this way.

Worried about patching /reinforcing the rip because I only have non-stretch denim and I don't want to affect the fit. If anyone knows how to do it right, let me know!  Your vest is dope. I have a pattern for making a jacket and a lot of black canvas, I figured making a battle jacket from scratch would be like, Extra Punk Points haha.

I doubt they sell anything that isn't machine washable.  My trousers usually last me 2-5 years before either the zipper breaks or thigh rub renders the inner legs too rough for work, so i cut them into shorts, patch the thighs, and get another serveral years wear out of them.  Collared shirts are mostly from thredup or swap dot com, brands i focus on are Avenue and  Torrid.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 09, 2020	labels:I live in NYC and want a parka I can throw on easily and be warm. Should I get the Fjallraven Singi Down parka in olive or a Canada Goose?
text:Fjallravens tend to be heavier than their competitors, if that factors into your "throw on easily" thing.   It also depends entirely on your budget, in addition to the odd fact that you're comparing one model in one colour against an entire brand.	labels:haha whatever the standard canada goose jacket is for around 1K, im not sure what the model is. Basically i have a 500 dollar gift card so i could spend 100 out of pocket for the fjallraven or 500 out of pocket for the CG. Would the CG be worth the extra $?
text:I like fjallraven parkas but you have to make sure they work for you and your body as the fit is a bit different and they use more heritage materials which trades off technical properties for durability.   The langford and the chateau are probably the two most popular CG models. They're both warmer than the singi but not proportional to the price increase. It depends on whether you care about the brand.	labels:interesting, thanks for the feedback. still not sure what im gonna do. I know CG's are looked at as bougee but like i just wanna get a jacket that i can buy now and not have to worry about one for 5-10 years
text:Fjallraven will last, if that's what you're concerned about. To be honest most "well known" brands in that ballpark will last a long time. The North Face, Mountain Hardwear, Arcteryx, Fjallraven, and so forth will all get you many many years of mileage.  Just look for one that stylistically and functionally appeals to your needs and you can't go wrong!	labels:good to know. think im gonna go with fjallraven, thanks for the input! would personally do the yupik or the singi down?	episode_done:True

text:Dress Sneakers Are Alarmingly Popular	labels:I also think it's on the rather unfortunate looking side... counterpoint: I know a surprising amount of people who have to wear dress shoes for professional reasons... but comfortable sneakers for health/pain reasons... this caters to them and after several have told me in how much pain they are I don't give a hoot anymore. Let Cole Haan/whoever do their thing.  Edit: this is not counting people I know who may have very different requirements throughout a workday/ work trip and may not want to pack/ bring several shoes and are in a constant haste.
text:I do think people forget that not every fashion choice is for the purpose of fashion	labels:It's the white sole that makes them look bad though. If these had a black sole you'd barely notice they weren't dress shoes and it wouldn't change the comfort at all

text:Sorry you feel that way. When I wrote it, I tried to convey that I didn't put much thought into what I wore. Perhaps I could have said pajama bottoms with RRL cardigans. I don't have a perfect description for it, but I do think that the style Andrew is wearing there is a lot more coherent. I think there are ways to do that style thoughtfully, and not randomly.

text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:A lot of the cheaper brands sold in the UK have improved in quality. Primark, Matalan, supermarket brands, etc. I am not claiming they are great quality clothes, but there have been significant improvements from the early 2000s. The tissue-thin t-shirts and actual cardboard shoes thing hasn't been a real problem for at least 10 years now. I've only had one new thing from there die in the first wash for a really long time.Being someone who could only afford to shop at these places or charity shops (and then not even charity shops for some of that time) for most of the last 2 decades, I've been able to compare. I got a big bag of my old clothes out of my parents loft the other week, things I was wearing around 2005 and there's a marked difference in t-shirts and accessories in particular.
text:That's funny, I think Primark in particular has gone downhill, at least from the last 5-6 years. I have a couple shirts there that I bought in 2013 maybe that are still like new even with regular wear but I haven't seen that same durability with things bought more recently.	labels:Primark is all over the place but honestly the general quality is better - nothing like when I was a teenager. Their ballet flats used to be made of cardboard. I bought an emergency pair in 2009 and they washed off in the rain D: I got a big bag of my old clothes circa 2005-2008 from my parents loft the other week and they are all terrible quality, the fabled tissue-quality t-shirts FFA thinks all cheap clothes are.	episode_done:True

I have no idea how the second hand market value would effect their desirability and prominence...and that might be nigh on impossible to work out.   Personally, however I now feel really gross about wearing stuff from the very unethical brands. It constantly reminds me about the people that processed the cotton possibly against their will, to store employees that probably got treated like crap. That stops me being able to enjoy the garment itself.	episode_done:True
text:Permanent Style - Tucked in T-Shirt	labels:It's funny how most of people think of tucked t-shirts as something for "an older man", because I see it as something so fresh to a overlook and makes your trousers pop so well (specially if you're wearing a cool/elegant belt). When I try to pull it off to go to work, I usually get the feedback that I look "modern" from my co-workers.  Anyway, it depends from people to people, body type to body type, that's just my point of view.
text:People saying it makes you look like an old man are thinking about their run of the mill slim fit tees from Uniqlo tucked into their slim fit chinos or denim with killshots.   In that case it absolutely does make you look like a weird old man. Even just the tiniest bit of imagination can change that outfit like a wider uniqlo U tee with Levi's straight fit 501s and a braided leather belt and that outfit can be 1000x better.	labels:Yeah, I think it is because a slim tee tucked in suddenly looks a lot more like an undershirt. I also think it's a look you can't afford to have a beer belly, otherwise it'll look even more old-mannish (and worse for other reasons, unfortunately).	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 03, 2021	labels:hi!  i got a shirt i ordered online today.  the shirt fits good but i have problems with my body.  the shirt is too long so I need suggestions what to do with a shirt that is too long on the body. it looks weird to have the shirt outside. this might make u think i should have a size smaller but hten i know it will be too tight around the neck and shoulders which i dont like so how it is on my chest and neck feels very good. its just the lenght that i dont like   when i tuck shirts in it looks ugly because my ass is very big so thats why i dont like it when shirts are too long. is there anything i can do about this problem?

text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:I worked from home for a period a few years ago and learned then that I cannot wear pajamas/sweatpants/generally lazy clothes while working from home. It puts me in the mindset that I'm sick and/or not working, and I will get lazier and more depressed as the days go by. So I've been wearing jeans for the quarantine. I don't have a separate office space from my gaming/casual space, so the jeans vs. comfy pants divide helps to make me feel like I'm working. I already dress casually for work, so I still wear t-shirts and sneakers, but getting ready for work like I'm going into the office is important for my mental health and my job performance.	episode_done:True
text:Winston & Co. Shawl Collar Cardigan Review (But mostly preamble)	labels:I'd suggest checking out Kent Wang. Had an eye on their shawl cardigans for a while. Think they launched a custom build recently and offered 30ish colors. Custom sizing if you prefer too. The website does say to size up.
text:I think KW's cardigans are decent for the cost but in comparison, they don't mention the ply of the fabric and I think that's notable since a well-made 4-ply sweater is going to last longer and (I think) be more resilient to pilling. I'd guess that KW's are a 2-ply though either way, I noticed that the weight of their medium shawl cardigans is nearly twice of what OP says the W&C is. I'm assuming this is also a difference in the yarn being used (with merino generally being lighter/thinner if I recall).	labels:I did a little search and most "british wool" is around 2/9 - so yeah, almost twice as heavy as the merino yarn.   I like the KW Cardigan's, but they're not as refined as the luxury Scottish stuff.	episode_done:True

text:For me it's when they are wearing a coat/jacket all the time. It's obvious that wardrobe have decided that's the characters outfit but I have never met a single person who wears their jacket around their house. If someone wore a coat/jacket inside my house, I would take it as a sign that I either need to turn my heating up or they are being rude and signalling that they don't want to stay long.	labels:This is so enlightening for me. My family does this (wears our jackets inside). I'm not talking a jean jacket or a light exercise jacket. I'll wear like a down coat inside the house. Now I know why people think it's weird if I keep my coat on! I wonder how many times people thought I was trying to make a hasty exit...
text:I'm sure there are dozens of you.   Kidding aside, why do your family do that? Are you cold all the time?	labels:Yeah, pretty much. Growing up, our living room was an addition to our home, and it didn't connect to our central heating. We just had a woodburning fireplace, but that wasn't enough to really be comfortable. Even though I now live in a thoroughly heated apartment, I just never broke the habit of always keeping my coat on.	episode_done:True

text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:I'm almost 60 and if there's anything the years have taught me it's this: wear what you like and fuck fashion. I love clothes and I do not give a single shit about being on trend, ever. I buy what I like/what I think looks good on me/what makes me feel happy to wear and I don't consider what's in fashion or what others might think of how I'm dressed at all. Mostly I buy secondhand because I find good quality fabrics and construction, but that often means the garment has been given away because it's not in fashion any more. Thing is, I care about style and about quality, not about the trend of the moment, and about expressing myself, not about falling into lockstep with what a bunch of mall brands tell me I should wear.  Be confident; love what you love and enjoy what you enjoy and don't let those with less imagination or less boldness keep you down.

text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:Definitely Banana Republic and Gap. Their fabrics are thinner and more prone to pilling after only 2-3 wears. Dresses and pants that would have included a lining even a few years ago are no longer lined.  Additionally, the fit of the clothing is awkward and inconsistent. Customers try on two of a specific item in the same size and can easily see a difference between what should be the same item.
text:I agree. I got two cute lightweight sweaters from banana and they both had significant pilling after the first wear. Very disappointing.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:Poshmark filters suck, but the fact that you can ask the seller for more details and they can offer you discounts means that you can find great things!  I find that if I like something, about 30% of the time the seller will offer me a discount right away, so start going crazy on the likes if you are ready to purchase something.  I always sort by new so you get first pick of the best stuff.    I search for specific fabrics, but this doesn't work perfectly on Poshmark.  I love linen, so I often just type "linen" into the search bar and see what I find.  The problem is that Poshmark doesn't have a fabric filter, so "linen-looking" items will end up in there, and sellers that don't list fabric won't show up there.  But I've found awesome pieces this way!  "My size" straight up doesn't work for me.  It's annoying, but I always manually pick my size once I get to a category.	episode_done:True
text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:Start with one aspect of a look. Like, wear a bold print top with plain black bottoms.

text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:Well, I'm starting to shift in the way of Dark Academia (although, I didn't know it had a name until way after I fell in love with it), but I don't think each personal style needs a specific label bc if they all had one . . . that would be way too many to keep up with, so just do you, boo boo.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 27, 2020	labels:Hello, don't know if it's appropiate question here. Some time ago I ordered one shirt from Spier & Mackay (I live in Poland so shipping went all the way from Canada). Following my good experience my relative ordered from them 2 shirts and cedar shoe trees. When courier showed up, he demanded to pay extra 50$ for what looked like import fees and VAT. I didn't have that situation on my order. Anyone had similar experience?
text:Sometimes customs catches you, sometimes it doesn't. It's really that simple.   Anything coming into the EU will pay VAT, and your nation will also often impose customs fees + whatever handling charge the postage company imposes.

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I'm bisexual and pretty femme so I get read as straight most of the time. There have been times I "dressed queer" intentionally- Going out to a lesbian bar or club (pre covid), when I was trying to signal gay vibes to a classmate I was interested in.. etc. I went through a time in my life where I wore beanies and plaid very often. Also worth mentioning that I got hit on by women way more often when I had a colorful bob. With my long straight natural hair, not so much.  Nowadays, I just try to be comfortable and stylish at the same time. I think I have a good mix of the "feminine" and "masculine" silhouettes in my wardrobe. I'll wear a deep cut ankle length dress with 4 inch heels and red lips one day, and a oversized hoodie with combat boots on another. Usually the latter.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 27, 2020	labels:Hi All:   This is probably a pretty standard question, so sorry if this is boring. I googled, but I'd like some of your thoughts as well.   I don't think I need to wash my clothes every time I wear them. For example, if I'm wearing and undershirt, I don't think the over shirt needs to get washed more than maybe once every 10 wears. For context, I have a pretty sedentary job so I'm not sweating a lot. So, first of all, is the wash once every 10 wears correct?   However, the clothes begin to smell a little stale. Not really bad (like not body odor) just a collection of odors that stick to it from daily life. How can I get rid of these odors without washing (since I think washing reduces the life, makes them less soft, fit not as well, messes up colors, etc.)? I've heard of freezing to kill bacteria and maybe 15 minutes in the dryer with a dryer sheet to give a fresh smell.   TL;DR: how to keep clothes fresh with out putting them in the washer machine.
text:You definitely don't need to wash things like overshirts after every wear. Personally I'd give it a wash if it's starting to have any kind of smell though, even if it's not a body odor smell. If you're worried about longevity, you can always hand wash certain items, and air drying items rather than putting them in the dryer will definitely help them last longer.	labels:Ok thanks.

text:My incomplete guide for buying less in 2021	labels:Nice guide. Maybe for the inspiration board to also add in a visual inventory. I easily forget what I have already which feeds into temptation. Color scheme. What else feeds temptations? Trends and scared of not seeing it again. I would say if you love a piece immediately then buy it but don't take tag off. Try it out in real life first.  Also tastes change. Like I went from utility pants to wearing and liking tight jeans then back to wanting more room except I don't have any. So having an open minded/ wardrobe with pieces to take you out of comfort zone, not too far, wouldn't hurt.	episode_done:True

text:would you say they are thick?  also, looking at the site i wanted to confirm. is it $16 per single pair???	labels:I would not say thick but the hikers are definitely bulkier than regular dress socks.  Damn here in Canada they can be $30+
text:>Damn here in Canada they can be $30+  dam....  i kept looking at the site thinking to myself, "no way it can be that much for 1 pair, how many comes in a bundle?" but did not see such thing lol	labels:When I switched to darn tough I did it gradually. Their sucks are tougher wearing so last longer than what I had been wearing before. Plus any time they wear out you just return them for another pair. Eventually my socks were all darn tough. And if you want very thick socks, look at the hiking section, that tends to have the most heavily cushioned options.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 19, 2020	labels:Was searching through the sidebar over in /r/malehairadvice but everything is so outdated there.   Anyways, haven't used hair product in a while and am looking to dabble again. Medium-high hold. Very low shine or matte finish. Any recommendations? Bonus points if it's relatively easy to wash out in the shower.  Used American Crew in the past and was moderately happy with it.

text:Any experiences with Wonder Wardrobe or other online courses?	labels:I have followed the WW course ! It's nice but it still leaves you with a lot of questions. My wardrobe hasn't really changed. I think you need to be very much involved and focused and I don't really have the time and money for that.  I also feel like it gave me even more 'rules' to follow and now I have less fun than before with my clothes.  Capsule wardrobe is not for me, I don't own many clothes but seeing the same 8 tops every day is depressing to me.
text:Oh! That's interesting, I feel less sure about taking the course after reading comments.  Did you feel that her style personality categories were too rigid? Another comment mentioned that she apparently uses "five fashion personalities".  If you watched her YouTube channel, would you say her course goes a lot deeper than it, or can you basically get the idea from watching her YouTube?	labels:Hi, sorry for super late reply!  I didn't really felt like the fashion personnalities were too rigid, but she uses seasons to describe different kind of people and what color scheme looks good on them.  While it's not super rigid and she does mention it's just an advice, I ended up not wanting to wear some clothes I loved just because of it. I'm also not sure I agree with the classification. For exemple, I think I'm supposed to be a Winter type (cold, bright colors), but I find that a dark orange looks ok on me. Maybe I got my type wrong though !  I think it gets more in-depth than her YouTube videos, but the fashion advice she gives can all be found somewhere else online. It's just handier and she is very clear in her explanations, which is nice. There is also a very helpful community.  I hope this helps :)	episode_done:True

text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:I used to use patches from the inside to reenforce areas, especially I'm the right area, now I mostly use a technique that only reenforces with thread. I use white bobbin thread and match the top thread to the color of the jeans. It makes the repair almost invisible. I use the straight stitch and see back and forth until the whole disappears. With big holes, I still use thin patches underneath, along with the new technique. I've accepted however that this is something I have to do this about once or twice a year with my old jeans and I catch the holes while they're still tiny and attempt to reenforce the surrounding area a little. My current set of jeans is about 5 years old, but I do not wear jeans every day of the year.	episode_done:True
text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:I learned it through working in fashion, actually, and it wasn't really something I set out to learn, it was more...feeling the fabrics, looking at their makeup, etc. I picked it up over time.  Go into your closet and just start getting a feel for how things are produced. For example, what does the fabric feel like? How does the fabric perform in the wash? What kind of stitching does it use? What does the tag say? etc. Compare your clothes, and you'll start to find similarities and differences, and by reading the tags, you'll start to learn what the fabrics look like, feel like, and what their quality is.  I also watched a lot of fashion shows as a teen/young adult, and those give you a feel for things as well.	episode_done:True

Maybe they are and maybe they aren't but skinny jeans are so much more practical for my life, I've stopped caring if they make me look shorter or wider.	episode_done:True
text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:I love ModCloth and have for years. When they were sold to Walmart, I was disappointed--but I kept shopping there. The plus-size options are fantastic. The customer service is always great, too. I once bought a dress to wear to a wedding, realized it was going to arrive too late, and called them; they immediately upgraded my shipping for free. I don't buy the most twee things they have, but as somebody else noted, they have lots of other clothes, too. Also, sometimes I just want a cute or funny graphic T to wear around the apartment. It's true that their prices can be way too high, but they have frequent 30 percent off sales; I usually wait for one of those before buying.  The quality can be a bit mixed, but their returns are super easy, and it's usually clear quickly when a certain garment isn't going to wash well.  Will ModCloth survive this? I hope so. I know it isn't for everyone. But it's one of the only online stores I know will always have something I like, in my size.
text:I feel this! Where else do you shop for plus sized clothes? I love floral dresses, comfy sweaters, and I have 2 pairs of Modcloth velvet leggings I got on sale and wear constantly. I've been looking for other options but coming up short.	labels:Not just the size ranges but the review system was amazing.  I'm a regular size six with a 44 inch bust, and I loved scrolling to find someone with similar measurements, with a picture of them in the garment, and comments in how something fit or where it gaped or how it hung on *my body type*.  The review system is was got me shopping the site in the first place, and I'll still take the time to scroll for basics knowing I can count on a reliable review for fit info.
text:Yes, this exactly! I actually bought my wedding dress off Modcloth, it was one of their Chi Chi London exclusives. I ended up buying it to try on because a reviewer with the same body type as me looked SO GOOD in it. I loved it immediately, and it cost a little over $200 and needed no alterations at all! I didn't want to splurge on the dress since I was already splurging on the venue and open bar selection, and I have zero regrets. All thanks to that great review system.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:Am I the only one that doesn't see how the Teddy jacket would give off peaked in high school lettermen jacket vibes like all the lurkers that were clearly bullied by jocks are claiming?  Obviously it's inspired by letterman jackets, but removing the contrasting leather sleeves and not having a TGI Friday's wall's worth of shit stitched onto it completely changes the vibe. I don't know, maybe I just associate it more with rockstar because it's an SLP piece and Alex Turner was the first celebrity I saw a photo of wearing it.
text:The SLP Teddy is minimalist enough to not give off that vibe IMO. I do get that costume-y feel from some of the others I've seen though.  Context probably helps as well. In high school letterman jackets are usually just thrown on top of whatever else someone is wearing, whereas the rest of the SLP aesthetic doesn't align with what most high school jocks would wear.	labels:	episode_done:True

Realize most online stores have horrible search features. 4. Find nothing that matches, and age over how a store with 20 000 t-shirts doesn't even have a good ribbed one. 5.

text:Uniqlo always seems to make cooler designs for women than men lol  I wish the mens side also had the women's double breasted wool coat or those blazers with two side pockets.	labels:Yeah, the men's lineup is pretty bland compared to the women's.

text:General Discussion - January 19, 2021	labels:I came upon a really gorgeous quilt recently, gave it a wash outside and it's drying in the garage. The thing is, it's really damaged on all the edges, fully blasted apart, and with a big stain on bottom side (the side that touches you when you use it as a blanket, i guess the "wrong" side of the quilt)  I sort of want to unpick it, and re-use all the panels and the cotton batting (it's old! Vintage raw cotton batting! I see thread scraps in here too used as filling.) To use for.... Something? Back patch for jacket? A pair of quilt pants? Heavy picnic blanket?  A lot of people are telling me to preserve it. Patch and fill the holes with my visible mending skills and keep it as a quilt for living with. It just seems so fragile, though?  I'll show pics later but i dont want that to influence anyone, i guess. I'm wondering what i should do.
text:I feel like there is not a right or wrong way to handle this. It depends on whether you'd prefer to preserve it or reuse it. You turn it into a pair of pants? Great! You fix it up and keep it as it is? Also great! Either way you're giving it life once more :) I'd go with whatever you'd use more often. A quilt's no good if it's stuffed into a closet year round, the same goes for the pants.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I have broad shoulders and I've always hated them until trends like puffy sleeve, square/sweetheart neckline and power shoulders trend came in. Puff sleeves make my shoulders look more feminine and cute, and can mask my broad shoulders because there's actually more fabric for my arms. Square/sweetheart neckline always makes me feel more polished and the sleeves don't fall off my frame. Power shoulder (blazers, coats, etc) actually hang off my frame in a really good way????

Even well regarded brands like Ralph Lauren / Woolrich / Filson etc and fabrics like proper Harris Tweed etc are easy to find vintage stuff of so its even possible to get the quality along with it.

text:General Discussion - December 23, 2020	labels:Do you feel like social media (possibly over-accessibility in general) "ruined" things you otherwise like because it seems to cheapen everything? Ex. every look turning into a meme. Or is that it all never actually mattered in the first place and this idea that you knew about stuff on the low was utterly meaningless to begin with? Kinda like every kid in the neighborhood suddenly became privy to "your" private swim spot.   Maybe it's the association of all of it. I feel like this big shift has occurred, especially in the last 2-3 years where the kids who rock vineyard vines have found themselves getting their "street style" on or rich girls who wish they were indie chicks compensate by wearing bucket hats and only using film cameras.  Still organizing my thoughts around this.. going through a fashion identity crisis atm.
text:Idk man. This kinda sounds like "people are enjoying the things I enjoy but *they're doing it wrong!!*", which is a pretty snobby attitude, imo.	labels:I suppose that's one way to take it and probably a piece of it, if I'm being honest.  You discredit the inauthenticity that plagues a lot of it in the process though. Maybe it's just what I experienced living in Brooklyn and observing kids who fetishized being fashiony and "poor" then finding out their parents are cutting their rent checks. Same as in the techno/dance music scene as well. Shows got absolutely ruined thanks to overexposure.
text:>Maybe it's just what I experienced living in Brooklyn and observing kids who fetishized being fashiony and "poor" then finding out their parents are cutting their rent checks.   Maybe, but what's it to you?	labels:Actually, coming back to this, this isn't the point of the question posed at all. This is about the impact of overexposure, driven by social media, on authenticity. Who ever said I thought they were wrong either? You've gone on attack and dismissed the question.. what for? What's it to me? We're on Reddit (lol), what's any of this to any of us?   If you think being an NPC is a *good* thing, I'd be interested in hearing why.

Is it appropriate for the situation? Adapt or find a situation that is. Be you.   Makeup that becomes you if you want to wear it (i.e. I wear winged eyeliner because my eyes are my best facial feature and it makes me happy)- infinite points.  Dress- loud or quiet. Fuck it all up, wear what looks good on you and is appropriate for the situation- infinite points.   Shoes- have fun but be able to function in them. Mega infinite points.   Accessories- what are you proud to own? Wear that. Enjoy it.   Work situations do mean that people are paying attention to you and you'll be judged. Absent that, literally no one cares. DO YOU. Do it right away.
text:Lol that's where I fall. The most flattering "nudes" on me (urgh) might not be nude on other people. I feel that brighter colors look more "natural" on me than your typical "nude" lip--do I get additional points for wearing bright red lipstick with a bright yellow dress?   Everyone's body, undertones, personality, job environments, vibe, etc. is different.

text:Luxire is well-liked for online mtm trousers. I'd also throw in Black Lapel, Alton Lane, Spier and Mackay...  If you get it and it doesn't fit, you get free remakes or tailoring until it does.

DC doesn't get nearly as much snow as KY. Wehaven't got enough snow in the last few years to *need* snow boots, but if you're metro-ing it, definitely either snow boots with good tread or waterproof hiking boots with good tread. It's the slippery slush that gets you more than any big snow. I love my sorel boots for this. Mid thigh puffy jacket and/or raincoat. Good gloves that have fingers that work with your electronics that you would pass the time with while waiting for the train. A good hat or ear muffs. And like everyone said layers (but I find i don't need to layer too much bc once I'm inside it's fine.) Mostly it's the cold wind and the wet outside that bothers me.	episode_done:True

text:Bernie Sanders' Mittens Won the Inauguration Fit Battle - And you, too, can own your own toasty upcycled woolen mitts.	labels:Somewhat serious question: why wear mittens while you could wear gloves?
text:The math is that you prioritize warm hands over dexterity. This matters more as the temperature gets lower or if your circulation is bad enough that moderately cold temps feel even colder.  It's not about trapping the biggest amount of air as one poster said (you generally want to minimize air flow which can move heat away from the body. I.e., convective heat loss). However your body itself generates heat, so having fingers together rather than separate keeps them warmer. With gloves, you are basically insulating each finger such that it barely gets the heat generated from the other fingers.  This is also why (in addition to weight) sleeping bags  generally are just a tube rather than a big body suit. It's also why when you are cold, you don't sleep in a spread eagle position.	labels:	episode_done:True

I generally stick to natural fibers, as polyester and rayon can be very hit or miss without feeling it. I don't buy anything with any damage.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 21, 2020	labels:Hello. First time poster!  I was thinking about getting  a pair of raw denim/selvedge denim as my go to pants when I barista. As someone who has never gone down that route and currently wears skinny jeans as my go to pants, what are the communities suggestions on what I should get?  I did a little research on raw denim and the concept is very interesting to me. Something wearing over time, forming to your body and wearing down how you move sounds very cool and interesting for a work/fashion pant.   As a reference I wear a size 38 Jean, athletic ish legs for my size and usually wear a belt.   Thank you in advance!
text:Check out /r/rawdenim too  I started off with the N&F denim in Easy Guy fit. The Left Field denim in the Atlas fit is also good.

text:Best and Worst Purchase of 2020	labels:Best purchase by far was an actual wool sweater from Aran Sweater market. Completely opened my eyes to how high quality materials matter and made me rethink how I view budgeting for clothes and my day to day outfit.   (Side note, because I had never had anything wool before I was *sure* people were lying when they said wool wouldn't have to be washed to get rid of smells. I'm still baffled 8 moths later about how this damn sweater stays fresh when everything else gets stinky after like one day)  My worst one was another scarf when I don't and have never worn scarves. I *think* I want to be a scarf person but I'm really not, and it's a waste of money every time.

text:I second ASOS. 90% of my jeans wardrobe (and I have a lot of jeans) is from ASOS Tall. Their sizes are pretty consistent too, across various cuts and styles, so I find that I rarely have to return jeans from them. And the quality is good too, price is great, so it's a win win.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Which color palette do you hate wearing?	labels:Neon or bright colors, pastels or jewel tones are not really my jam. I don't like or feel good in them.   Rest of colors I don't wear is yellow, pink, purple, white, beige, light grey.. the list goes on honestly, it's easier to list what I do like :P    I prefer muted dark earthy tones like olive and military greens, burnt red, burgundy, navy, browns etc. Only "bright" color I'll do is like maroon red, but it has to have a pattern like small white florals all over it to mute it down.	episode_done:True

I think a lot of it was shoehorned into a more aggressive aesthetic than would suit some of those blazers. And we were still steeped in slim fit bottoms at the time, and people just threw a long, looser fit blazer over tight black twisted leg pants and called it a day. I think it's a great look when it's cohesive, but it came across as very bandwagon-y when it was worn with your typical Julius and BBS type stuff.  Interestingly, Elena Dawson - which is the same thing - was typically worn more cohesively, and I always really liked her work.

I like to have one or two long pendants, and with my shorter pieces I like to have some chunkier options and some more delicate options. I also want to make sure I have something that suits warm or cool outfits. I also want some versatility between casual and fancy.   That is a really broad approach but it helps me evaluate my choices: if I am looking at something I will think of a few of my most often chosen outfits and think if the jewelry will go with that.  Also don't discount the idea of a pretty watch as a jewelry piece.	episode_done:True

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:Buying secondhand doesn't benefit them so I think its fine, however, if people compliment it and ask where it's from I'd say its thrifted and not the brand so you're not inadvertently advertising their products. Additionally, in the same note/spirit if it's a problematic brand and has some sort of clearly visible logo I'd still avoid purchasing it.	episode_done:True

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 27, 2020	labels:Hi All:   This is probably a pretty standard question, so sorry if this is boring. I googled, but I'd like some of your thoughts as well.   I don't think I need to wash my clothes every time I wear them. For example, if I'm wearing and undershirt, I don't think the over shirt needs to get washed more than maybe once every 10 wears. For context, I have a pretty sedentary job so I'm not sweating a lot. So, first of all, is the wash once every 10 wears correct?   However, the clothes begin to smell a little stale. Not really bad (like not body odor) just a collection of odors that stick to it from daily life. How can I get rid of these odors without washing (since I think washing reduces the life, makes them less soft, fit not as well, messes up colors, etc.)? I've heard of freezing to kill bacteria and maybe 15 minutes in the dryer with a dryer sheet to give a fresh smell.   TL;DR: how to keep clothes fresh with out putting them in the washer machine.

text:My Wardrobe Post: Based on what I currently have, what should I wear with what? And an essay reflecting on learning to dress better.	labels:I think you are at a much more advanced level than you seem to think you and are lightyears ahead of where I was at your age.  My absolute favourite outfit of yours is the button down with shorts and the red hat. Such a casual, effortless Ralph Lauren kind of vibe. I think pairing that hat with oxfords is a great move.  I would love to see you go into double denim outfits. Pair the tan collared denim jacket with either dark denim jeans or medium wash jeans and a solid tee, light grey sweatshirt or white oxford shirt. Would also be a great outfit to add that red hat to potentially too.  Beyond that, I think your short term purchases are sensible, your shoes probably need the most help and are the bigger area that can help elevate your more put together looks. Those tan oxfords are going to look phenomenal with chinos.  I only thing I might consider for you is a more casual tie option. A knit tie in navy, burgundy or maybe a tobacco brown can pair really nicely with an oxford shirt and blazer for a smart casual look.
text:The double denim is a great idea I'll try it out when weather permits! I agree the OCBD + Hat is one of my fav fits.

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:I hate to break it to you, but Juicy Couture sweatpants were in their prime 2004/2005. I believe that's when Uggs also made their appearance. Flared jeans were still being worn, low-rise denim was good. There were woolen newsboy hats during fall and winter. There was a semi-trend of silky camis and satin bustier corset tops being worn to "da clubs", closely aligned with another trend of tops inspired by jennifer lopez' versace grammy dress, under which you'd wear a strapless tube bra. There was also a really annoying trend of the elastic hemmed bubble dress and long tops, which were so hard to iron. H&M came to Canada in 2005 and had a lot of 50s and 60s inspired tweed. It was a lot at once, honestly, I'm more excited about the Instagram interpretation of it.
text:I turned 20 in 2000 and definitely wore all of this.  I'd like to add some pretty matchy match outfits and accessories to this list. I remember heading into my job as a hairstylist circa 2003 and looking down at my outfit: Pink platform sandals, a short denim skirt, pink t-shirt and a fuzzy pink newsboy cap thinking, is this a little much??   And a little later, mid aughts, I had a lot of culottes and kitten heels. Boot cut jeans nearly exclusively until 2006 when I bought a pair of skinny jeans.	labels:Kitten heels! How I loathed those! Pointed-toe kitten heels all over the place, when all I wanted was a high heel and a rounded toe.	episode_done:True
text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:I was part of that group for about 2 months early on in the pandemic.  And then I got tired of leggings and sweats so I switched back to wearing my normal nicer clothes.  It helps that the clothes I prefer are high waisted skirts and dresses, so they're really comfy and fit in just fine with work from home.  I do sympathize with people who work in dressier offices (ex. blazers, dress pants) who now have a chunk of wardrobe they invested in that's not really usable.  The pandemic has confirmed for me though that I hate pants and especially jeans now (so uncomfortable on my body shape when sitting), so I'll be a skirts and dress girl only once I get back to the physical office.

Then the Beatles probably started the shaggy haircuts with the clean look, I can't remember what those "boys" were called but there was a name for them.

It's really helped me make sure I wear as much of my clothes as possible (obviously the black cocktail dress is going to see less use than the everyday pink sweater but it helps with more unique items like my t shirt with applique parrots lol). If you don't want to catalogue your clothes and put this much effort into it (lol) you could just move your clothes to another part of your closet after you wear them or reverse the orientation of the hangers after wearing. Try to move as much of your clothes to the "worn" side of your closet as possible. And when you pick a lesser worn item don't give up and just make an outfit of it! Who cares if it doesn't match perfectly, you'll do it better next time!	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 21, 2020	labels:Hey.  I'm 6' tall and I weigh 160.  I have a (relatively) big butt/thighs compared to the rest of me (played basketball, I do my squats).  That being said, being jeans is a pain.  Since I'm tall and skinny, with bigger thighs... if I find a pair of jeans that fits my thighs nicely, it's like a garbage bag once it goes below my knee.  If I find something that fits me below the knee, it's WAY too tight on my thighs.  Regular tapers don't work for me (regular thigh, slim leg).  I'd need something like (relaxed thigh, slim leg). I skip one level.  I have chicken legs below my knee.  Anyway, i FINALLY found a pair of jeans that fit nicely.  They're old navy and stretchy.  I'm wondering, if I can take all my jeans to a tailor and have them match the same portions in terms of length/thigh/lower leg?  In every case they'd be taking away material, not adding, which I assume helps.  Granted, my other jeans aren't stretchy material, so that might pose an issue in terms of fit.  I've never gotten anything tailored.
text:Yes, you can have jeans tailored. Selvedge denim would probably lose its self edge, but that probably doesn't matter.  Skinny fits are out. Wide fits can actually look really cool, but tend to look better with high quality denim -- for example, heavyweight denim that has a stiff but smooth drape to it.	labels:I'm not so much into the current look.  I just don't like the garbage bag feeling or all the excess material.  Nothing I'd be wearing is skin tight, no worries.

text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:Madewell - I ordered a plain black t shirt during covid just for lounging and the thing literally had a hole already in the front when it arrived.  Aritzia - I've been shopping there for well over a decade and while you really can't compare fabric from so long ago (it's incomparable imo) even just the stitching is becoming obviously bad. Last winter I saw a blazer, still on the rack in store, with threads already sticking out at the shoulder seam. Absolutely ridiculous. However, I will say their peacoats have turned around a bit - not what they used to be but a couple years ago they looked like they were made out of felt and definitely have gotten better since then.  American Eagle - I really like the new curvy fit of their jeans, 10/10, and I feel like the aerie underwear quality has gotten better, the last couple of years the material had gone downhill.
text:American Eagle has really surprised me. The last few years I've consistently been able to find a cut of jeans that fit (and flatter). Aerie swimsuits are awesome and come in so many styles. I wish young me had had them; would have been far more comfortable and less self conscious.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:advice on how to stop buying clothes I don't need?	labels:My temptation with shopping comes more from the mythical concept of a "perfect" wardrobe than social media temptation.  But my approach is: unsubscribe from every brand email list, bookmark a thing I'm interested in so it's saved and I don't mentally dwell on it, and using a Chrome extension (I use "StayFocusd") where you add sites you want to block and a time limit (kinda snaps you out of sleepwalk shopping when you run out of time).  I also use Pinterest to pin my entire wardrobe and curate a very targeted "to buy" list.	episode_done:True

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:If you are only on Facebook start searching trending fashion videos.  Then Facebook will start pushing trending fashion sites and stores.  Click on ones that interest you. If you do that consistently, you'll pretty much only get trending fashion advertising.	episode_done:True
text:Runways have been sending out 2000s vibes. Anyone onboard?	labels:"Many would say the style is tacky and embarrassing. On the wrong person, maybe."  And there is fashion.  I'm going to talk straight out of my rear  I was born in 1990 so my sense of it came from middle-high school and the 2000s honestly felt like they borrowed heavily from the 60s/70s with movies like Scooby Doo HEAVILY summarizing the styles used, so in THAT regard I'm not sure if we'll go backwards but you never know. We saw the 80s and 90s thanks to vaporwave and Stranger Things.  I personally feel like low-rise might try to make a move with higher fashion but the comfort and flattering aspects of high rise pants outweigh that, and once people realize their butt keeps popping and they aren't that flattering regardless of body type.... nah fam.  I think that u/lionaroundagan is dead on in that we'll pull a couple of select items like big colorful glasses. I think that'll work but like super denim etc, nah.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 03	labels:I'm a male of modest size. With a foot length of 24cm I often wear size US 6.5 or 7 shoes. I like the Greats Royale but from the comments it seems the royale's smallest size 7 wears more like a size 8.  From pictures it looks like there is no major difference from the male and female version.  Anyone with a girlfriend also wearing greats royale could confirm there is no difference ? Also I'm not sure about sizing equivalence between male and female us sizes

text:What was your first 'expensive' fashion purchase?	labels:Mine was the pink Travelling Cupcake Dress from Modcloth. It as sixty dollars, which to teenage me was a lot of money. I mean, it's still a decent amount of money now, but it felt like even more back then. I probably wore it to school at least a couple times a month, with a white cardigan so that I wouldn't get sent home for showing my shoulders and, I don't know, sending all the guys into swooning fits or something? Now I don't have to follow school dress codes so I wear it in the summer with no cardigan and show off those pasty delts to the world.	episode_done:True

text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:I think a lot of people here that say their clothing falls apart quickly aren't properly caring for their clothes. Growing up I learned to wash everything together on cold. As an adult I had to read articles and watch YouTube videos on how to care for my clothing. I recommend everyone learn how to properly launder their clothing.
text:I agree, I've never understood what people are doing in the laundry to make their clothes literally fall apart after a few washes. Washing on the hottest setting and drying high heat, maybe?  Ive legitimately never had anything fall apart in the wash ever and I dont take particular care other than cold water and low heat in the dryer (plus not chucking things like sweaters, dress shirts and leggings in the dryer at all). And I used the communal machines in my apartment!	labels:The washing machine at my apartment is very rough on clothing. It's a top loader with an agitator and the machines are 'twin thin' (very small). My clothing goes through the ringer in that machine. I don't know how, but my clothing gets knotted up into a huge wet ball. Sometimes the clothing ball is stuck to the agitator and you just have to blindly yank around until it comes loose. But after I realized the machine sucks... I didn't put anything nice/delicate in it ever again.  So yeah.. If your washing machine sucks, hate to break it to you, but you need to hand wash anything you aren't willing to sacrifice to the laundry gods.

I still don't know anything about plants and now my Echeveria Orion is a very Tall Boy because apparently etiolation is a thing and I love it even though it's no longer short and cute but it's still kinda weird.  Plant number two is also an Echeveria I wasn't really looking to buy but got convinced needed to come home with me by a lady at Lowe's with a pricing gun that was very unhappy at how often they were being watered and was like how does 50 cents sound and it's doing ok but I'm a lot better with things that can yell at me and I really think that I'll stick to the tried and true classic and just get more cats in the future.	episode_done:True
text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process? What would you prioritize?	labels:I don't need $5000, I need about two to four weeks of alone shopping time without the kids. But what I would do is spend that time finding a good pair (or 3) of jeans that are flattering for my body, a pair of everyday ankle boots/cowboy boots, some high quality leggings or tights, machine washable summer and winter dresses that aren't too short (seriously whhyyyy are cotton dresses always so short), bralettes and panties.

text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:Earth tones are a BIG winner if you're trying to reach outside of the standard dark tones like Black/Blues. The next ring up from White is most definitely a CREAM/OFF-WHITE shade. Grab an assortment of camel/chestnut browns too. & then find some mute shades of Green (not emerald or teal), but more like green shade that are within range of a Matcha green color....and voila! The start of an awesome color range.	episode_done:True
text:What are the Luxury IT Bags right now? And which ones are actually worth the $?	labels:The bags I see most often on my feed and being talked about most are Chanel 19, Prada re edition, Dior Book Tote and the so called hard to find items from Louis Vuitton (speedy bb, nano speedy, pochette accessoires)  The Celine Triomphe and their Triomphe canvas are popular because of Lisa from Blackpink	episode_done:True
text:Do you name your favorite outfits?	labels:I do to an extent. I am currently working on an outfit I want to call "Drunk at Church" but I can't think of what I want. Something technically church appropriate and yet not? Church clothes on backwards?
text:Lol I like it you start with the concept	labels:It's a good time. I also have "Driving someone else's BMW," "Where is the Cabana Boy?" and "Silicon Valley Biker Bar."
text:Okay but all of these are incredible and so freaking evocative i am obsessed with "Where is the Cabana Boy?"	labels:"Where is the Cabana Boy": Caftan with sides torn out a bit so there's no way there isn't side boob, large straw hat because the outfit is evocative of a 40-year-old who had a skin cancer scare even though I am in my 20's, and very large and very gold earrings.  A few others of mine are: "Double agent posing as a Fox News Anchor," "Vogue Photo Assistant who is Always Fighting with her Boyfriend on the Phone," and "I'm Lost in this JoAnns Fabrics."  Edit: "Joann's Fabrics" was incorrectly presented as "Joann's Crafts." I apologize and while there is no excuse for my actions, I ask for your forgiveness.
text:I cannot express my love for these names, I feel so inspired to take my outfit world building even further.   I have one look I call "I took a pill in Ibiza but it was a prilosec because I have heartburn" - blue and white striped linen palazzo pants, a white linen button down hanging loose, black birks, a big floppy straw hat, and giant sunglasses.	labels:I love it, that late-night cable news commercial won't know what hit it.	episode_done:True

text:What's on your 2021 fashion wishlist?	labels:Honestly I haven't really thought of it. I bought quite a few clothes in 2020 (25~ new pieces...) and had zero opportunity to wear any of it so I want to chill with the buying until I get some wear out of all the new clothes in my wardrobe. I hopped on the dark academia/smart dad trend pretty late so I'm still inspired and excited by exploring that look, so there's that. I usually get all into plaid during autumn, but this time around I've experienced a second wind with the pattern. So uh I guess 2021 is going to be mostly plaid... And as soon as warm weather rolls around it's back to linen sack clothes.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 28, 2020	labels:Can anyone advise sizing for Stan Ray pants? Are they TTS? Any shrinkage after a wash?
text:They are TTS and high rise. Don't go off mall brand size tags, actually measure your natural waist and look at the size chart. I did not notice any shrinking in the wash (despite a warning that it might) but I haven't thrown them in the dryer.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are you looking forward to buying for "pandemic life" this summer?	labels:I bought a bunch of inexpensive light jumpsuits and camp shirts last summer that are still good so I don't see buying anything special. I'm moving to the south for school this fall and I'm going to wait until I get there to assess my warm weather needs. I don't think students typically need to wear anything fancy, from what I remember from undergrad.
text:Depending on where in the south "as little as possible without getting arrested" is the proper answer. Source: grew up in Memphis.	labels:*sigh* and that's not how I like to dress at all lol
text:Oh, it has nothing to do with wanting. It just is. You want natural fibers, loose, keep a towel in your car for the ass burn and steering wheel hate.  You leave your front door, walk into an oven. It takes your breath. You lose energy each step you take to the car. You open the door and it's enough to kill someone. You just got out of the shower and you're covered in sweat. By the time you get to where you're going, the AC might have caught up. It doesn't matter. The AC gets eaten up there.   Pro-tip: Always empty the refuse tray under the AC if you live in an apartment. Open that closet, strain out the lint, and dump it. If you don't, the AC will quit.   It's hot like nothing you've seen unless you're from south of Memphis.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What’s your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:I was born on year 1992 so it's amazing to watch everyone wearing satin scrunchies, velvet bows and wide leg pants!I'm a desi and believe me this 90s trend is ON FULL SWING HERE TOO!I'm not a huge fan of platform heels although they were my go to as a high schooler whenever there was a wedding party happening!! I'm especially LOVING the return of chunky golden hoops and cuban golden chains, I have some which my mom wore(the quality is amazing and they look new even to this day!) and guess what those are adored by everyone who saw me wearing them!I just hope we don't have the thin eye brow trend and those too metalic lip color back cause I for one looked like a fish with those on(also cause I had NO idea how to apply makeup) though I can see many girls carry those color amazingly! It's fun to see us..the girls reinvent those trends in our own ways and I'm here for it :D	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:What i have found really fun is to go on etsy and have vendors make clothing custom to your size. A more affordable option is Eshakti where you can input your measurements and adjust the garment to fit you perfectly.  They have many cute options and you know it will fit because its made for you! The custom size costs only $9 on top of the garment price which is super affordable!
text:Have you ever used eShakti?  I'm similar to the OP here and have had my eye on them, but am a bit wary of inflated hopes!!	labels:One thing I encountered with eShakti is that I entered my height without taking into account that my torso is longer and my legs are shorter, so a dress came out too long since I went by height and not actual length or drop.  I suppose that dress would have been fine with heels (which I don't wear) but it did need hemming and thankfully it didn't have a cute bottom border to ruin with a hem.	episode_done:True

text:For people looking for such brands (in no particular order): Spier & Mackay, Kamakura Shirts, J.Press, Mercer & Sons, Wythe, Brooks Brothers (esp pre-2000s), O'Connells, Ben Silver, vintage Gant	labels:Vintage Brooks Brothers is difficult for me, the shirts have the right neck size for me but when I try them on they look very large in the body and are a lot longer than necessary which means that I wouldnt be able to wear it untucked. Not sure if I have just been out of luck finding the right cut or not.
text:Honestly that's just how they were cut back in the day; very trad being big in the body for comfort and long in length to stay tucked in. They were never really meant to be worn untucked or to appear slim-fitting. You'll have better luck with more modern brands for sure	labels:	episode_done:True

Any good brands you found that aren't super wide cut and have long inseams?	episode_done:True
text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:I wear wool or knitted things for about 1 month of the year.  It has to be at sub zero for me to wear anything knitted otherwise I become sweaty.  If I'm in the car and wearing anything knitted I also have to keep asking my husband to turn the heat off even if it's snowing outside.  I only own a few knitted things because of this.  I have one very oversized sweater from Terranova and another I thrifted, I think from H&M.    It sucks because I love winter fashion and love the cold but I'm such a warm, sweaty person.	episode_done:True
text:Looking for a Shear Thing (Shearling Jackets)	labels:This time last year I was on the Arizona Trail. I was heading to town to resupply and I got a hitch from a Gila County cattleman in an old F-150. Handsom young guy, quiet but kind as can be. He was wearing old 501s and a shearling bomber over a tshirt that had once been white. His sandy hair matched the undyed wool and the leather matched his dusty boots. It was the most natural, most fitting, least pretentious use of a shearling jacket outside of being in the ball turret on a Flying Fortress. And *even he* just barely pulled it off. Because shearling is the peacock-feathers of Americana.

It is touted as a very versatile coat. Great! I have even found one I really like.  But for something to wear in the rain; it lacks a hood for head protection. You wouldn't want to go out in the rain with your head exposed.  So are you expected to always combine it with an umbrella?   I haven't had a proper coat for rain before (made do with a parka or an umbrella) so the lack of head protection is surprising; unless you go for a more technical raincoat.

text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:Any time I see people being told to only wear 1 surplus piece per fit to avoid costume territory I wonder if I ever look like I'm cosplaying. Like I do wear full camo on occasion and I'm about to have a three-piece flecktarn set, but it's always very clearly just fashion and not "you're talking to a future soldier"-core right? Please say yes, I need the affirmation cause the only nice jawns I can afford come from fucking with surplus.      Also because I'm mad young and Finland has mandatory service for all males I do have a year of service in my future. Don't really have a strong opinion on that, but I do wonder if my stance on surplus and militant clothes will change after that (if I'm even wearing surplus at that point).

text:As I wait to hear if I have to evacuate due to CA wildfires, here’s a hypothetical I had to do: you have time to prepare before your evacuation and pack up your car. What clothes do you bring and why?	labels:I would start with the least generic.  So all my graphic tees for sure.  Then trousers/jeans, most favourite to least favourite.  Then my two pull over head hoodies as they are not generic.   Then all bras. Then all my stock of knickers and socks, I mean all new in package.  Then all shoes in use.  Then sandals not yet in use.  Then boots/shoes not yet in use.  Then shorts.  Coats would be the easiest replaced, so they would be last, along with knickers and socks in use.  I realise this is not specific, it is a list of priorities!  If space started to get tight partway through, I would have to start over to be sure of having some of each kind of clothes.  Footwear and trousers would be number-one priority because they are the most fit-critical.	episode_done:True
text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:Note-- I have to do laundry offsite and pay per load.  I air dry my clothes, but draw the line at hand washing ANYTHING.  Underwear, socks, masks, gym clothes (in normal times), cotton facial pads-- after each use.    Bras-- 2-3 wears depending on how sweaty I get.  Shirts, bottoms, skirts, dresses--- Usually 3-4 times depending on use.  Skirts-- 5-6 times (these don't touch the crotch area so they don't get as dirty as other bottoms).  Outer layers (sweaters, sweatshirts, etc)--- As needed (I always have something under these).  PJs-- 3-4 wears  Sheets-- Every 2 weeks or so  Towels-- Washcloths-- after each use (I use two a day to wash my face), body towel-- after about a week.  Hair towel-- when I remember to (I only use this towel for my hair and wash my hair twice a week).  Hand towels, dish towels, etc-- as needed.  Other bedding-- (blankets, comforters, etc)--- twice a year (Spring and fall).	episode_done:True
text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:My situation is probably a bit different than most because I'm dressing for a minimally temperature controlled home office (trying to save money and not run the a/c or heater during the day).  So I was too hot most of the time, and now I'm cold all the time.  Majority of my clothes were for a temperate office, so they weren't worn much.  I miss wearing all my cute clothes, but it's a vague ache.  Dressing purposefully for the day -- even if it's not the clothes I'd normally wear -- staves off the depression more-or-less.  I Kon Marie'd my shirt drawer, and I've been making it a point to work through my columns of shirts.  So everything is getting worn, which adds a bit of variety to the days.  I find that variety helps me feel like I have a life that's moving forward as opposed to being stuck in a loop.	episode_done:True

Edit to add: My husband is a furrier, if that helps your decision.  Edit again to add: I may also be a lot older than the woman with the spotted dogs and have a red and black roadster and no husband, depending.

I recently turned 26 and I've suddenly just started feeling like this. Literally in the past 6-12 months I've gone from heavy e-girl style, obsessed with 90s and y2k looks etc. and now suddenly all these things feel very 'teenager' and weird on me. I haven't gone through any major life changes or anything lately so I don't know what's brought this on! I'm kinda excited to upgrade my wardrobe to more classic high-quality pieces but I also don't want to become boring (I've always been a very 'artsy' person with eccentric taste). I'm a little torn at the moment. I'm trying to incorporate my pink hair and septum piercing into a more 'adult' look -- I don't want to lose my edge but also don't want to feel like I'm trying to emulate a teenager.  I definitely don't think 23 is too old, anyway, so you do whatever you feel! I can just really relate to suddenly feeling like a trend is too teenage for you haha.	episode_done:True

text:Sculptural Fashion Inspiration Album	labels:I love the unexpectedness and drama of making a normally shapeless medium like fabric stiff and structured enough to hold any shape you give it. It also adds a dramatic volume that you don't usually get from clothes.  This is mainly inspiration. Not much of what's in this album is what most people would consider "wearable". These are almost all runway pieces and the majority of them weren't produced for sale. That said, if they were and I could afford them, I'd wear about 60% of what's in the album.  I included a bit of womenswear. There's more to draw from in womenswear, and the pieces here are wonderful.
text:I find it extremely hard to believe you'd wear 60% of that album. None of it is functional. They're all art pieces.	labels:Why would you state something like this as fact for someone else?  You don't know a thing about their fuckin life, lack of imagination is your problem alone.  Talk shit post fit champ
text:I wish I cared enough to know what this supposed insult, "post fit," stands for.   LOL lack of imagination? There's a difference between the artists that can create this type of beauty and the imbecile that thinks, "Oh I'd totally rock that!"

Im near the nyc 5th ave store and they had good stock of 31" which i wear, in black and navy  Idk we'll see. I usually get lucky. Lots of post-mania returns flood the racks a few weeks later
text:You lucky SOB I would have no money left if I live close to that store (or any uniqlo for that matter) lol the pants only came in that 31" length btw  Yeah I assumed you were like most people in the US and didn't live near a store that would stock the collab lol you'll probably get a shot at retail unless the employees vulture them, but I wouldn't wait for clearance prices on these 70 dollar 100% wool pants are a great deal as is	labels:Hahah honestly it is a thing in my life. Now that returns are stricter maybe I'll spend a bit less  Hmm the ones i was looking at were $99 i think. They were sturdy and thicker and yeah 100% wool.

Little did I know then, but my first year of college I would start to go through a major episode of depression lasting about two years. That song and specifically that lyric got me through a lot of really tough days. I'm thinking of getting it engraved on something else because wearing high school stuff isn't fashionable, but I don't know what. I still keep it in my dresser to remind me, though.

Tall boots (Sorel is a nice brand, but something similar) and rain boots also come in handy!

Also happy to Tretorn sneakers, lots of men in pink and gorgeous people with racial diversity. Lots to see here! Thanks for sharing.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 19, 2021	labels:So I know Moschino isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I was able to pick up a polo today from what I think is Moschino's mainline made in Italy for a pretty reasonable price from Nordstrom Rack.  It was in the small section but it seems a bit bigger than other polos I'm used to wearing (Ted Baker size 3 or Banana Republic Small) so I'm hoping someone can help me out.  &#x200B;  The sizing on this is an IT/EU 48 or USA 38 which I believe should correspond roughly to a small, correct?  I tried to find the sizing chart on the Moschino website and I wasn't sure where to find it.  Also, since it's 100% cotton, I'm guessing it'll shrink a little after a wash and probably fit similar to other stuff I wear but wanted to see if anyone had any experience with the brand before just returning it in a few days since I don't think I can return it if I take off the tags or anything
text:First of all, how does it fit on you?  If it's Moschino it's mainline, their diffusion line is Love Moschino.	labels:The shoulders and sleeves fit well, it just feels boxy which was surprising since I thought the cut was generally slimmer. But maybe I just bought the wrong size	episode_done:True
text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:I got new clothes usually once a year before school started. Nothing could cost more than $15, so I usually wore whatever was on the sales rack. She would pick stuff and then ask  me if I liked it ... except if I said no she would get angry and accuse me of being "difficult" so I just wore whatever she picked out which was usually some combination of giant sweater and jeans. I never really learned how to pick out clothes or what style I liked. I never learned how to wear makeup because I only ever had foundation and she had no patience or time to teach me.  Anything to do with clothes or makeup was an exercise in suffering that usually left me feeling worse about myself. It's taken me years to realize 1) I am not the ugliest person on Earth 2) Clothing and makeup can be fun and not make you feel like shit.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:Rains Rain Coat, why does the material smell like unwashed cooch? Bruh it smells so bad. Even after washing it, still smells like cooch, albeit slightly cleaner cooch
text:LMAO.   No idea why exactly but the material is water resistant. Not breathable *and* water proof like Gore-Tex. So all that smell is coming from sweat and exertion over time.  Best you can do is wash and air dry. I've heard air drying outside for a few days helps with some of the smelliest smells, but never had the need to do it myself. So your mileage may vary.	labels:Oh this is brand new out of the box, fresh fish

text:Runways have been sending out 2000s vibes. Anyone onboard?	labels:I'm really bewildered at everyone talking about hoping for or not hoping for early 2000s fashion to eventually come back. It's already...been back? Lol early 2000s fashion has been trending for a while now. This sub seems pretty behind on the trends a lot.
text:I think people (here) are mostly referring to things like low rise not just in terms of whether or not teenagers and celebrities are wearing them, but rather how a rising trend might affect the availability of other styles overall. Anyone who lived the original trends knows it was hard to find anything but low rise/medium flare for fucking forever. We're not there (yet?) and hopefully never will be because fashion has been forced to embrace inclusive styling more than it ever did in the actual aughts.  Edit: literally said the availability of **other styles**	labels:The original post and half the comments make it pretty clear a lot of people are very behind trends and think that the early 2000s still have yet to cycle back into trend. I'm not surprised, I guess; this sub has proven many times that a good deal of it is unfashionable and woefully behind trends. But still, it's head-scratching to see a "Are we ready for Y2K style to come back?" post once a month when...it's *been* back for a long time now lol. You'd think people on a fashion sub would be a wee bit more aware as to what's going on in fashion lol.
text:Things trend differently for different age groups though, and at least what I've said here is 1) I hate a certain aspect of it and 2) I don't see people my age into it, and that's how I like it.  I'm going to be very honest here-- I don't give a fuck what Gen Z is into. It doesn't matter to me in the least until it makes my clothes harder to find or I see women in their 30s and up looking like Regina George's mom.	labels:If we're talking about what's trending in general, then to ignore what the teenagers are wearing is silly. Because the teenagers are the ones who have their fingers right on the pulse of what's trending and hot.   Like, I'm not trying to be rude, but I don't really care what you think about Gen Z, nor what you think about Y2K style in general. None of that has any relevance to my original comment, which was just pointing out that this sub is so embarrassingly slow to pick up on trends. People here are like "Gosh I hope early aughts fashion doesn't come back!" and it's like, hunny...it's too late, it's *already* back.
text:And I'm explaining to you why this sub seems "behind" to you-- It's because the dominant demographic here is not Gen Z and different things are never going to make to older people.  What you're seeing here is a lot of people who do not want this trend to make its way up the age groups.	labels:It's a fashion sub, so I think it's perfectly reasonable for people on a fashion sub to keep up with trends. Sorry, but we don't see women on the makeup subs clinging to trends from 10 years ago. Even if they personally don't *like* the newer trends, everyone still is aware of them. It's just this sub which is weirdly stuck in a time warp.	episode_done:True

Something I'm being more conscious of lately are trends  that try to be purposefully not-traditionally pretty looking. Certainly there are tons of people that like this "frumpy/ugly on purpose" trends and I have nothing against that! I just have been asking myself when I see a trendy influencer wearing something outlandish if they would be praised the way they are if they were a different body type/race/income level or if what people are REALLY talking about when they say they look stylish is they look skinny, white, and upper-middle class.

Been slowly replacing my closet with a lot of Todd Snyder and don't know how to feel about it lol, always wanted a "cool designer" closet but from a cost and functionality stand point it's not very doable. Good staples just get more wear in my closet, got to pick up more stand out pieces so I don't feel boring!
text:Todd Snyder consistently does stuff that I like, I just can't get into the prices for it. I have the exact same issue with Taylor Stitch.	labels:Agreed I only buy on discount and even then it can be hard to justify.

Haven't looked into Taylor stitch at all though.	episode_done:True

I'll try to get a board together to put a picture with what I'm describing, but any Youtube video titled Fall 2020 clothing haul will probably give you an idea of what I'll be wearing as I'm not much of a fashion risktaker lol.  I have been searching all the resale sites for vintage wool shackets, as the Zara one I'm interested in keeps selling out and its like 90% polyester anyway. I plan on buying a few vintage pendleton/ll bean/eddie bauer oversized wool flannels to wear as jackets instead.

So far I've found that choosing a good selection of colours to base your wardobe off works best (I like khaki-greens-blacks and browns) and then going from there. A solid pair of trousers in a style you like is always a good option too, I wear a pair of ripstop cargos almost everywhere, that usually helps you figure out what you like or dislike fit wise.   For example my cargos made me realise I like a more relaxed fit, but also made me appreciate something more fitted when I want to put more effort in, so I buy within those two criterias in the colours I like.

There are better choices for less money and better choices for the same money.  if it's the latter, Merchants (discontinued) are ok, maybe one of the Chelseas or chukkas.

I'm at a bit of a loss though when it comes to what I should wear after having taken off my suit or chino/shirt/blazer combo for the day to lounge at home, or a hotel when on business travel.   The obvious candidate for most people would be a track suit or jogging pants with a t-shirt. What does this sub think would be a better choice so I could be considered presentable in case, say, a friend (or lady-friend) drops by unannounced?  Stay in chinos and just switch the dress shirt for a t-shirt? Pajama pants from a high-fashion brand? Just avoid anything with a hood?

A slight formality clash. Historically, though, Shell is a more casual "work" leather and can be worn in many situations where.   Personally, most of my Shell models have a more conservative/formal style, so it would look odd to wear them with jeans and a polo.	episode_done:True

And you probably will???   Do you do it??? Do I buy the thing??? Do I just... hide it? Say I bought it on eBay???
text:It really depends on the price and what the item is. If I'm able to get a vacation somewhere rad for the same price, I'll go vacation over item. I mean there is also the option of just saving up and waiting for it go on sale. There are tons of apps to help monitor price points and you can totally put money aside per pay check to get whatever you want. Sometimes it's really nice to treat yourself with something as a great reward for hard work. Just  my two cents.	labels:Tbh with budget airlines I can get some rad holidays pretty cheaply so not sure that's a good metric for me to use   As a reward ya I can justify it to myself like that maybe
text:Tbh you didn't mention a price lol.  The whole concept of this line is so subjective that it's hard to even say anything:  >You ever REAAAALLLY want something REAALLY badly and it's expensive  Without knowing what expensive is for you, it's hard to say. That's why I framed something as a vacation, usually those tend to be expensive and they make memories. I'm just at a point in my life where if I had the chance to go for somewhere like Europe for a week or buy a pair of shoes or a jacket, I'd rather go with the experience.	labels:If it wasnt for fucking covid I would traveled so much and wouldnt have purchased any new clothes at all  can relate	episode_done:True

text:Winston & Co. Shawl Collar Cardigan Review (But mostly preamble)	labels:thanks for this review. I love shawl collar cardigans but i'm very sensitive to itchy wool, which makes it very difficult to find them. would you happen to know of any decent/higher end ones constructed in alternative materials?
text:I think the most obvious alternative - albeit $$$ - would be cashmere. There's quite a few options that have the same basic rib design as OP's wool version. I think the challenge with cashmere is that if what you want is a super-chunky look, your options become more limited since cashmere tends to be finer and thus the sweaters don't always have the same heft. That said, if you're willing to invest in a 4-ply or higher cashmere SCC, you might be able to attain that nice chunky look.   Personally, when I'm working from home, I have a knockabout 2-ply cashmere SCC that I'll wear when I just want a warm layer; it's really nothing special and doesn't look anywhere as substantial as my Northern Watters-made lambswool SCC but it's kind of perfect for a home sweater.   The other common option would be cotton or linen or blends of both but then you lose out on warmth/insulation. That said, I had a cotton SCC for years that was a go-to "lemme just throw on a layer" option in temperate months.   Do you have the same reaction to merino?	labels:	episode_done:True

But because I'm inside all the time, in Australia where it's winter and we don't have heating/insulation in our apartment, it gets pretty chilly in the house, so no matter what I'm wearing, I usually end up throwing a hoodie or an Oodie on top of it anyway. Sometimes it's fine, but sometimes it makes me a little bit sad, haha. You know, to think that I'm dressed somewhat nicely and normally and it's just hidden under a giant blanket thing every day, so I can stay warm :P	episode_done:True

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:Putting the clothes on correctly and taking them off correctly. That means not stretching clothes over my head in laziness when there supposed to be unzipped. It means getting someone to zip up a skirt for me instead of zipping it up front and rotating it. I also wash things inside out, hang dry, and steam my clothing.
text:Uh oh, why is it bad to put something on backwards and then rotate? I do that a lot...	labels:It can stretch out the waistband of clothing and rip seams.	episode_done:True

text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:I have heels in neutral colors, as well as bright colors and metallics. I have a burnished gold pair of Aldo heels that I find surprisingly versatile. I also have sandals, wedges, ankle boots, and knee high boots in various neutrals. I wear a lot of prints, so I'll match the shoes to a color in the print if I'm wearing heels. I generally determine what type of shoe I'm wearing that day based on weather and how much walking/ standing I might be doing. This time of year I tend to wear a lot of low and knee boots with sweater tights or boot socks. If the outfit has warmer tones or brown, then I usually wear brown shoes. If the outfit has black or cooler tones then I usually wear black shoes.	episode_done:True

text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:I think once you have your basics down, pay attention to the kinds of things that you find yourself wishing you had when you're getting dressed or when you're out.  If you keep consistently wanting the same things, long term, then it makes sense to add it to your closet.  It also helps if you get super specific about what you want and don't pick up things that kinda work, since you'll just end up buying a ton of similar things.	episode_done:True

text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I'm a fan of combining bold pieces with more bold pieces. They say less is more, but I believe the inverse is true too: more is less. Meaning that when a piece feels like it's "too much," it can often help to add other "too much" pieces to balance it out and create a more intentional look.   The pink suit would rock with a base layer in red, light pink, tan/brown, or even a print or stripe if the mood strikes.

text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:Seems like high waisted skinnies are out, but still the most flattering thing on me..so not gonna stop with them.
text:I feel like blue skinny jeans are out but black skinny jeans are more classic so I'm sticking with those.     That said, I think our perception of what's flattering is partially shaped by what we're used to seeing. We've been looking at ourselves and other non-models in skinny jeans for the past decade. Straight and wide leg jeans are still new, so we've mostly seen them on models. There's still some objective elements though. Like I definitely think a higher rise makes the torso look shorter and the legs look longer so if you're long torsoed they'll probably always look better on you. I remember all the fashion magazines saying straight or flared cuts were more flattering back in the early 2000s.	labels:I don't think there will be a dominating pants style anymore, especially after quarantine fashion. I still see skinnies sold in stores and high school/college girls wearing them much more than the wider cuts. Leggings are skinny, no one is making wide-leg leggings. Actually, I think they are, but they are all on the clearance rack at lululemon when I checked.

I definitely have a daily uniform and try to invest in good basic pieces.

text:Sigh. I always tried on the curvy fit stuff because my jeans always gape in the back, but turns out my issue is not what is assumed in curvy fit! I have super wide hips but basically no butt.

text:Stop Dressing For Your Height [Tim Dessaint]	labels:Well fitting clothes is key for me at 5' 6".  MTM shirts for work and casual from Proper Cloth has been awesome.  Getting pants hemmed is a PITA, recently bought some jeans from Peter Manning a short guy clothes specialty brand.  Fit great, no hemming.
text:You know, a few brands sell a 28" inseam off the rack, I'm happy with that. A few are also starting to do hemming, or even free hemming online. Spier is charging $8, Uniqlo does it for free. But I think both return policies break if you hem the pants first.	labels:My waist size is 31.  I've only seen 28" inseam online and that was for waists 30 or less.  What I liked about Peter Manning was I went to their boutique and tried on different waists, lengths and cuts.    I have to try on pants.  Sizing and fit is not universal across brands for me.  Especially with thinner cuts.  I've also recently got into more expensive footwear and have developed a preference for no break on the hem.  I ended up with 27" inseam jeans from Peter Manning.
text:Bonobos probably has a 31/28 online. But yes, trying things on is always best and Bonobos has bad qc, so if you liked pmnyc, good for you!	labels:I have a Bonobos near me.  I should stop in to take a look at their clothing and sizing.	episode_done:True

text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:Have done this 3 times. My best advice is to think of the future with your wardrobe - is what you want to buy/wear today going to be something you will wear in 4-10 years? If not, consider what would be and what would not. Buy more of what would be than not. Fill out then with the trendy stuff you can't see wearing in the future/long range. Things can last quite a long time with a wardrobe, and a lot of turnover in a wardrobe comes from in the moment purchases and items, versus thinking a little ahead, etc.	episode_done:True

text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:If you're nervous about the look itself: I used to wear things I was iffy on when I was in a new or different place. Like, if I was worried a dress was too loud and attention-getting for my comfort level, I'd wear it when I was in a different city for the day, because if it did catch too much attention, who cares, I was never seeing these people again! Obviously this is harder to do in covid, because we aren't casually daytripping or traveling, but even just wearing the outfit to the grocery store, where you're probably not going to know everyone, vs wearing it in the office, where you see the same people all the time can ease you into being comfortable...	episode_done:True

I ended up changing to a top with a higher neckline for a zoom hang with friends. I'm not used to my boobs being in a natural, saggy position on my body.
