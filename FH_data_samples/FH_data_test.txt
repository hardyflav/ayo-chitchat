text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process? What would you prioritize?	labels:You know what? I’m middle aged and secure in my job. I’d go full cyber goth. Not even joking. I’ve spent my whole life trying to dress appropriately for my work and lifestyle and it’s boring me. I have all kinds of office appropriate slacks and cardigans and button up shirts in cutesy patterns, casual jeans and sensible shoes. I want to wear plastic corsets and fluorescent clip in braids and platform combat boots.
text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:Yes, I do think our age definitely affects what looks dated to our eye.   I’m noticing that some younger men are wearing some strange iterations of 80’s color-blocked track suits that to me look very Golden Girls. Also, I’ve seen shirt and shorts sets on rappers made out of wild print fabrics exactly like the ones I made for my toddler 25 years ago.  I’m older, so I’ve seen a lot of trends come and go. We are now at the point where they are starting to repeat and are designated as “Vintage”.  I have cultivated my personal style over many years (boho/western), and have seen it done well by Ralph Lauren and most recently Christian Dior in 2018(?) and enjoy the idea of wearing the beautiful things I’ve collected until the end of my life.

text:General Discussion - January 19, 2021	labels:I never thought I'd become this person, but man, shipping costs really can fuck up my desire to buy something. I was just about to commit to buying another pair of sneakers and it's probably the best deal I'm going to find on them, added to cart, shipping info entered, billing info entered... $20 for the cheapest shipping option. No shipping codes available, no threshold I can cross to get free shipping. $20 period, no exceptions.  It's a $300 pair of sneakers discounted to $180, I guess should be able to rationalize that at $200 (including shipping), I'm still getting a better deal than what's available anywhere else online (only a few select retailers got this colorway, and all but one are sold out in my size), but still, $20 shipping feels *wrong*. My brain has been trained from years of online shopping that there should always be some way to get around paying for shipping, or otherwise, shipping should be cheap.

Looking for comfort tips!	labels:When I started shopping for function, I started to enjoy fashion a lot more. Uniqlo was a big part of the beginning for me, I really like their airsim and heattech lines. How can my clothes work for me? I really took on a evolutionarily perspective lmao, like I need Shelter from Rain, Insulation in Cold, Sweat Wicking in Sun. It got me to pay attention to fabric choices more, which meant I was pickier, which meant I was buying more expensive items... so then I started to care about the quality of stitching and longevity of the piece.  I had IBS for a year and there were some clothes I could really NOT wear with that, so I had to learn to make adjustments too. I like high-rise bottoms, but I can't have an elastic cutting off my intestines all day, so I get something with a zipper instead.	episode_done:True

text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession). I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession 🤣

I think people assume you’re confident just because you’re rocking something unusual!
text:General Discussion - December 23, 2020	labels:i go on walks around the neighbourhood sometimes and my grandma always asks me, “isn't it kind of cold out?” (she's 90, anemic, and hates putting on layers – she's almost always cold) and i tell her no it's fine i have a jacket and a sweater. she'll ask me, “is that warm?” and so i'll give the sweater or jacket to her to hold and she'll smile and say, “… oh. yeah, this is good, you're going to be really nice and warm.” but that never stops her from asking me if i'm going to be cold the next day  so i don't know how, but we've gotten to a point where i give her a full breakdown of what i'm wearing just so she knows i'm not cold. it's really funny. so i'll tell her, “okay, feel this. this is like wool and mohair. it's warm, right? i didn't even know what mohair was until i got this.” or “look at this! a nice pair of jeans. it's a really heavyweight denim. you know i'm not going to be cold in this.”  and she'll laugh and say, “alright, i get it. that's good, this is really good.” and idk how but it just occurred to me that i ask my grandma for a fit check every day

text:Advice needed - Nordstroms Out of Stock items	labels:Have you called a store near you? With Nordstrom specifically, your best bet is to get ahold of a sales rep and pray that they'll want to help you. They can do a stock search and see if there are any units left in the company (aka did someone return it?) that can be shipped from the store to you. You'd probably have to call periodically to check.  If it's something super hype, like the latest Supreme shirt, you're SOL and would have better luck buying it after-market at a higher price than retail.  Calling and having someone ship something to you from a store doesn't work for every company - Sephora won't do it and I don't think most fast fashion places will either. Your chances of getting a sold out item go up if you have an established relationship with a sales associate.

The shape allows freedom of movement and room for other layers, and the smooth lining defeats friction so the hem doesn’t bunch up.

Lately I’ve had the thought that the ideal under layer might be those Indian-style pants with the crotch that comes down to the knee.	labels:Where do you purchase such a skirt??	episode_done:True
text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.

text:Coveteur: An Ode to the Striped Shirt	labels:I have...entirely too many striped shirts.   I am a sucker for them. I was always told to wear vertical stripes because it would make me look slim. Growing up, I was a beanpole. no boobs, no hips, just enormous feet. So I started dabbling in horizontal stripes to make me look a little less scrawny.   then in my 20's I got my boobs done. those horizontal stripes now made the new boobs look absolutely vulgar and *I loved it*. I still do.  wide horizontal stripes are great for toning them down, thinner horizontal stripes really bring out the wow factor. I have a few tops that are a little baggier, with stripes, and I find that those are the perfect way to wear a casual tee while still being like LOOK SHE HAS A SHAPE!	episode_done:True
text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:The problem is that doing a no-buy for a year is a HUGE undertaking that you are destined to fail. Not just you, people, in general. I think 3 months is a great start, and I think it's easier if you start with smaller, more attainable goals. It's like with a project at school or work - you break it up into smaller increments.  Once you get the hang of it, it'll be WAY easier to extend another month and another month. Looking at a year of no-buy is daunting. 3 months? More manageable.   The other thing is - you can't go cold turkey, because that is also unrealistic and sets you up for failure. I'd start with a low-buy, a circumstantial buy, a no-buy with a number of exceptions, etc. That enables you to form better habits.  The less strict you are being with yourself, the better your chances of success, overall, and long-term. If you go hard (one full year no-buy, no exceptions, fuck yeah!!!), it'll be super easy to break down and lose your progress, because the minute you give in, you've "failed" and what's the point of continuing. This is an endurance run.  Eventually, you get excited at your progress and want to see it through till the end. This is what helped me start saving money. I wanted to save for a deposit, but man, setting aside that first $1000 was hard. But once I saw my bank account growing and growing as months went by, it became easier. It became thrilling. How much could I save? How much closer to my goal could I get?   It's satisfying to see the progress, and it's harder to give up once you've made a "dent" in your ultimate goal.

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items are my Native American Turquoise jewelry and my cowboy boots. Just purchased a huge $900 squash blossom necklace and have worn it constantly. My boots range from $30 for a secondhand pair to $750 for custom made and none are worn more or less than the others.  When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was “saving for good”. Ironically, “good” apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I’m just out running errands.

I don't like how I look in flannel and doc martens. I really do like how I look in an embroidered satin maxi skirt.  Going back in time, I used to feel like I had only two options : butch or look straight. It was not a fun choice. Neither was right for me. I spent a lot of high school looking way more masculine than I really felt comfortable with. It was partway through college that I realized that I had a third choice. Perform the hell out of stereotypical feminity. Embrace the chiffon and satin but do it on my own terms.  I don't look exactly like your average straight woman these day. It's subtle but there's a difference. Well there's also the fact that I dress like I'm an escapee from a Victorian brothel. I play with feminity. I wear petticoats beneath skirts and dye my hair blue. It's not the same kind of feminitity as a the average straight lady. It's a conscious performance of femme and not an uncritical acceptance of gender norms. It works for me.	episode_done:True

text:My theory on why Harry is this: playing with gender in fashion isn't new as you pointed out, eternal icons like Grace Jones have been there and done that. However, Harry's instance is unique because we have seen in a highly publicized way the evolution of how he sees his gender. He started as a (sorry fans) generic white musician with bland style and has since sort of aggressively redone his look. I'm sure he's been called "brave" in numerous articles documenting his steps towards this moment. Similar pretty boys like Ansel Elgort and even people like Post Malone have played with gender, but none in an as aggressively pursued and marketed way as Harry did. I also think people see that he has an X-factor because of his sexual identity. Billy Porter being a publicly queer person is sort of expected to do these things. Yeah his gown moment was highly publicized but it certainly didn't "break the internet" and spawn discussion like this did.  edit: also exactly what u/Anthraxistaken said	labels:I was thinking that too about how it was all because we've seen his growth and I couldn't have summed it up better.	episode_done:True

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:I have no idea if this is a good idea but it’s what I’m trying out. I transitioned to thrifting and focused on “vintage” aka <2020 clothes in natural fibers to find my style. Now I feel like I can recognize quality clothes, which cured me of any desire to shop crappy fast fashion. Now if only I could break my thrifting addiction...that would be the last step on the road to a small, high quality wardrobe.	episode_done:True
text:"Can people just hate fashion again" - Synecdoche When Talking about the "Industry" Discussion	labels:> Should spaces & industries for fashion lovers, clothes lovers, and people that have to wear clothes be completely separate?  I don’t think that any of these groups should be completely separate however I do find them all being lumped into the same spaces very frustrating as someone who does love fashion as a form of art and creativity.  I like harsh and blunt constructive criticism in pretty much all areas of life and I most certainly want it for my outfits as well. I want to hear what other fashion lovers and artists think of my colour choices, proportions, textures, fit, etc. and be able to refine those things and really flex my creative muscles when creating an outfit. Instead, many fashion spaces are dominated by ‘you do you hun!’ and ‘so long as you like it, that’s all that matters!’ which is great for someone *who has to wear clothes* and doesn’t actually care about fashion but joins fashion spaces because they feel some obligation as a woman to care about it but... those spaces just become unhelpful and bland for those who really love fashion and want to get better at it.  I’ve been an off and on follower of FFA for a few years and I feel like it’s definitely dominated by the “people who wear clothes” group and unfortunately it limits the amount of critique that is acceptable to give.

text:Become a Tailored Suit Pro - Guide	labels:If you're totally new to tailoring this is a okay start.

I can't wear bracelets or watches because the sound of them clicking on my desk grates against my soul.  I usually live in American Eagle jeggings (soft joggers as soon as I get home), comfortable shirts, soft and loose sweaters/cardigans, comfortable ankle boots/Converse, and sometimes a well-fitting skirt with tights.  Interestingly, I have no issue with wearing tights, which I know a lot of women find uncomfortable. I don't mind wearing a bra, either.

RtR has a discount shop for the clothes they don't rent out anymore but it seems like they had even more inventory lying around and they handed it over to ThredUp to sell even steeper.  Add to that the great stuff happening on Postmark, Depop, Etsy, and TheRealReal, and it's awesome to be a thrifter right now. I'm glad its all expanding.  I've been doing slow fashion for a few years and a lot of my closet is now second hand which makes me happy. Idk what the trigger was for other people but when I found out that fashion is one of the biggest polluting industries in the world, it changed my whole perspective.

text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I've purchased several pieces of secondhand jewelry, both from physical thrift shops and one big mixed lot on Ebay. With the work from home/daily video calls life, where nobody sees me for more than an hour at a time and from the collarbone up, lasting until who knows when, I've had the desire to change up my jewelry from simple and delicate, with a lot of long necklaces, to something more colorful, bold, and closer to the face.  It's all cheap costume jewelry that I wouldn't buy new, but with the environmental impact already made it's a fun addition. Everything has been cool toned (green and blue) to go with the color palette I've been feeling lately. It doesn't need to be comfortable all day, just show up on camera until I take it off. Some of it even has visible wear that would be too much for wearing in public, but it doesn't show up on camera, so video calls are a perfect way to expand its usable lifespan.

text:Depending on where you move to, there may be local thrift stores in your area that carry high quality second hand coats for significantly less than full price.  I think most of my favorite winter gear has come from second hand stores, including multiple winter coats, fleece and wool layering sweaters, heavy duty winter boots, etc.   My favorite cold weather brands to keep an eye out for when I’m thrifting are: - Patagonia (jackets and fleeces) - Sorel (winter boots) - Marmot (jackets and fleeces) ... my current winter coat is a knee-length puffy Marmot - Mountain Hardware (hats and gloves) - REI (fleeces) - The North Face (jackets and fleeces)  Edit: Just because these are my preferred types of items from these brands doesn't mean that their other items aren't worth checking out as well! All of these brands produce solid cold weather gear, and if you're ever in doubt you can google a specific item to see what people are saying about it online.   Also, as u/BeeVoltage pointed out, be cautious about going second hand for your waterproof layer and try to stick to items with tags still on them or that were released recently as waterproofing does wear out over time.	labels:Second this! No such thing as bad weather, just bad clothes.   Make sure to check FABRICS when buying secondhand. Wool, Cashmere, down (not polyester fill) for sweaters, hats and overcoats, cotton, silk, or long underwear made for underclothes. You will want hats, gloves, scarves and good socks, and sturdy shoes. All can be cute and fit any aesthetic.   I moved from southern west coast Canada to interior Canada and learned that layering was my friend. Long underwear camis, cotton tights, jeans, sweaters, usually a ultra thin down with a wool coat overtop, hats, scarves, and gloves. Cover that skin!	episode_done:True

text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:My perspective is from someone who got interested in wearing sport coats, ties, and “professional” clothing at 17. I just turned 24 and only now do I feel like I have a solid grasp of fundamentals to try new stuff after 8 years of taking clothing seriously.   To me, it all depends on what you want to communicate to others. If you’re only dressing for yourself, you can wear whatever. If you’re more conscious about what others will think too, then there’s an element of “dressing your age” for societal acceptance.   The reason why people shit on 50 year olds wearing hollister is because it’s so apparent that they’re trying so hard to recapture their youth rather than accepting their age and what positives come with it. In the same vein, 17-year-old me wearing ties and sport coats was me trying to shed my youth and move too quickly into professional adulthood. Both have to do with fighting against what we’ve been given rather than working with what we’ve got in a natural way.   The issue may be one of standing out from the crowd being frowned upon, but I think it has more to do with the underlying mentality and reasons why people chose that look.	episode_done:True

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:Hi! As a stylist I get this question ALOT. For starters don't get rid of too much before buying replacements. What ends up happening is we get rid of everything without establishing what pieces we actually need.   Start with establishing your personal style. What do your want your closet/style to be? What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping! Now that you have a moodboard and list of things you need you can shop to fin in the gaps and more importantly you can shop with intention!   &#x200B;  I hope that wasn't too much and was helpful haha. I'm always happy to help.

text:FAQ: What is the difference between off the rack (OTR), made to measure (MTM) and Bespoke?	labels:/u/blackstrider has a great TL;DR but I'll add a bit more detail to MTM and Bespoke.  MTM: The pattern/style is generally pretty fixed, often there aren't fittings, and you make adjustments by changing standard measurements like "I want to add 0.5" to the leg opening". Pretty flexible format but I find it takes a couple of garments to really figure things out which can be tough.  Bespoke: Often a pattern is created for *you*, there are multiple fittings (in-person). This is where you can get really specialized tailoring looking at the pitch of you arms, how much you round your shoulders, etc. Bespoke tailors/cordwainers will also have styles that they specialize in so don't go to a tailor that specializes in structured "English drape" if you're looking for a casual unlined jacket or something.

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:To put it bluntly, 100% privilege plays a role in the way people dress because there is increased access to options (including natural fibres, so called “sustainable” clothing, tailoring, etc) that are completely inaccessible for the majority of others.
text:Sewing your own clothes	labels:Having basic sewing skills to repair or slightly modify existing clothes is a fundamental skill most people should have and is absolutely worth the time. Novice tailoring is a great skill to have too and can save you some money. Beyond that, sewing clothes from scratch is more of a hobby than a necessity for most people, due to the widely available nature of inexpensive and functional clothing. So like most hobbies, whether or not it is "worth the time" (and cost! Sewing is expensive and it's frequently cheaper to just buy an item unless you're looking for a custom fit or something super unique) is more dependent on your enjoyment of the activity than it is on more "functional" motivators like cost-savings.

text:Spotting is certainly a common complaint and I can see how it diminishes people’s enjoyment of shell boots. I live in a place with 250 days with rain per year and wear mine in all weather conditions (except old snow as I’m afraid of the salts). I have some semi-permanent spots on faded ravello, but have accepted them as part of the patina. My color 8, black and cigar shoes all deal really well with rain and mud and I find them much easier to clean than calf skin/cow hide boots. Now that I think of it, maybe there’s so much rain here that they now have ’even‘ stains. Shell shoes can be enjoyed as heavy beaters, I believe.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:This makes me think of a conversation I had with my husband yesterday - he asked me (on my next run to the thrift store) to pick him up some track pants as his main pair have gotten a hole and it's too cold to run in shorts.  I told him he didn't want to wear thrift store track pants (I have spent many hours digging through the men's and women's sections in our local thrift stores for both of us).    Husband: why not?  Me: Let me put it this way.  Women tend to donate their clothes when they don't *want* them anymore. Men tend donate when they *can't* use them anymore.     Men's clothes don't change as much, and men tend to either wear them until they're ruined or they cannot use them (aka, they gain/lose weight, change jobs, have a spouse donate them, they move and can't store it etc).  So while you can still find good stuff if you really dig, there's way more staining, missing buttons, fading and wear on men's thrift clothes.      My usual score for husband at thrift stores is  (formerly) expensive cashmere and wool sweaters, and occasionally, high quality dress pants and shorts.  Nice jeans and regular shirts are hard to find, and this is probably related to the fact that others have pointed out - men can wear their clothes for 10+ years and still be moderately in style.    As for men's clothes that I wear - I never buy women's socks for work.  Always men's wool and cushioned socks.  Same with any kind of technical under layers for martial arts.  I like the women's designs better, but for some reason they assume the women have no boobs and I'll have 2-3 inches of stomach showing under a rash guard.  So I buy men's.	episode_done:True

Generally not a problem for me; I only made an order with Topman once and it was because I had some vouchers to heavily reduce the price. I only considered Topman items when they were in the sale anyways.  Since I shop semi-regularly at ASOS, this change won't affect me too much. I'm not concerned about the uality of ASOS products either; they seem fine enough for what I need. I'd rather have a good quality item at a sensible price, than an excellent quality item at a much higher price than what I could possibly afford.	episode_done:True

Shoes are in a shoe rack that I keep behind my closet door.  I have a ton of jewelry, so I have one of those over the door jewelry organizers, a bracelet holder, and I made myself a necklace holder out of wood, paint, and command hooks, since it was significantly cheaper than the one I liked.	episode_done:True

text:Of course people like Chanel because of the status quo the brand gives off but Karl impacted it to greater heights which we have seen today. It was a dead brand before Karl joined.	labels:The brand was huge before Karl, Coco was alive until 1971, and it was a major luxury brand at that time, before and after. He joined in 1983. But he did a great job at getting the mainstream aspirational consumer and young wealthy into the brand, which is what it needed. I know women who are in their 60s and 70s who have Chanel from way back when. There was a time after WW2 that the brand struggled a little, but so did nearly all luxury European brands at the time. Overall though it's always been a key brand in the category.

text:The Very Useful Black Sweater	labels:>And black leathers don’t acquire the  patina that makes a pair of well-polished, well-worn brown leather  shoes so handsome. In fact, giving up square-toed black shoes in favor  of more anatomically correct brown ones became something of a rite of  passage for well-dressed men.   This is quite a reach. But then again it does feel quite reminiscent of nearly MFA where brown red wings were the best choice a man could make.
text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:The last time I did a big closet cleanse, I made a list of reminders in BIG sharpie letters that I hung on my mirror in front of where my face would be. So, instead of looking at myself and judging myself and fantasizing about who I could be in those clothes... I saw my list and the clothes below it. It made things much easier from an emotional standpoint.  My list went something like this:  * You can only wear one pair of pants at a time. (Which applies to all garments but I like the groundedness of pants as the representative of all clothes.)  * You are a stylish and fashionable person no matter what you wear.  * You would rather have the money.  * You enjoy spending time on maintenance, but that does not include organizing your storage!  If I did this exercise again today, I would also include:  * If you don't want to wear it right now, you probably will never want to wear it. (Speaking to emotional reaction to clothes, not situational factors like working from home, etc.)  * If you don't want to mend it or alter it, that might be because you don't actually want to wear it.	episode_done:True

Keep anything heavy in your personal item/ backpack to avoid overweight items. Jeans or black bottoms go with just about everything and allow you to mix up your outfit.

text:General Discussion - January 20, 2021	labels:My partner is now officially my spouse. I now wear a ring which will look good with my fits, but feels really weird being just ... there on my hand, all the time now.  They vetoed me posting pictures (we have public facing jobs, these pictures are all over social media, too easy to reverse image search etc.), but they wore a Rick Owens dress (that I picked out) while I went full minimalism with a collarless shirt with onyx studs, a sleek blazer and cropped trousers. I put this together from my existing wardrobe, since we didn't want to spend a lot. Covid measures made things a bit weird, but the court officer made a real effort into making it nice, which was great. (edit: just so nobody thinks we are totally irresponsible: it was literally just us at city hall, no guests, no party. We'll catch up with that after vaccination.)  It was fun seeing all y'all Americans count down to my wedding day.
text:What work for my boyfriends taste and body type?	labels:Photos and a budget would help.  Layering can be good, especially for a guy with a broad frame like you're describing.  If he wants more Americana, he can try westernwear (denim, flannel shirts, chambray shirts in the summer, rugged leathers). Flannels can be worn open over a tee shirt as a very casual midlayer, or buttoned up as you might expect.  On the smarter end, he might be interested in Ivy / Prep. That will include oxford cloth shirts with button down collars (a "university stripe" in blue is a good start), tassel loafers (a Brooks Brothers original), khaki chinos (overrated), and a navy blazer.  I can give more specific recommendations if you give us an idea of your budget.	episode_done:True

text:Thoughts on Shein?	labels:Controversial opinion, but, they aren’t that bad.   Let’s have some empathy for a moment: it is an absolute privilege to be able to shop at a sustainable store and/or to be able to buy secondhand. Imagine being someone who hasn’t bought new to them clothing in years because they can’t afford to and then fast fashion prices are waved in their faces on clothing that fits them and is their style. I’m not going to tell someone to not buy clothing from a place they can afford. I’m absolutely not doing it.   People demonize fast fashion because they look at it as black and white and don’t understand that, if you’re shopping at SHEIN, you likely can’t afford the more sustainable sources/you can’t find what you’re looking for secondhand. I’m plus sized. I can’t fit into and afford a lot of the sustainable brands out there. And, people buy out the “fashionable” plus size items in my local thrift stores to sell on Depop, so, I don’t blame people for shopping on SHEIN.  I’ve bought SHEIN secondhand and I’ve had items for years and I haven’t had any issues. I haven’t bought first hand from them in a long time but when I did, I never had any long shipping times or anything, either. I found the same defects I’d find at Target, like, a long thread here or there that I can easily snip off.   This goes for fast fashion in general—if you take care of your clothes and wear the appropriate size, you can make them last. It’s not like they spontaneously rip apart, you have to do something to make them do that. Steam your clothes to get out wrinkle. Tumble dry, hand wash, etc.
text:I think actually the issue is they went from being family owned private businesses to parts of conglomerates who are publicly traded. Growth is king. So they need to sell a lot more product or be more expensive or both to increase revenue and profits.  Luxury has become trend driven and decreasingly focused on craftsmanship to keep up with the quarterly numbers and growth targets.   Handbags, makeup, sunglasses, and perfume are very profitable and open the door to lower end customers.   The street wear trend is a boon because manufacturing and materials costs are very cheap, design needs are minimal, and it sells for a huge markup.	labels:>Family owned private businesses   Oh how this can come back.	episode_done:True
text:American fashion designers take center stage at the US presidential inauguration	labels:How about bernies mittens tho?	episode_done:True
text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:I wouldn't say I inherently hate the brand but I think Champion is an example of a brand that exploded a few years back/to now basically all because some celebrities or whoever wore it- and everyone who wears it now is most likely a ding dong hypebeast type or the VSCO type girl or whatever. Like I'm old enough to remember it being bottom tier Wal Mart level shit you'd get borderline made fun of for wearing- but now all of the sudden it's enjoying this moment. So it's just that perceived inauthenticity and collective pivot in peoples' minds to a fashion name to people rather than just athletic apparel that irks me somehow.  However though, the Todd Snyder Champion stuff is PHENOMENAL- it's not the mainline stuff. You don't see any of those assholes rocking that.

text:Face Mask Reviews - Round II	labels:My partner and I have the Tom Bihn masks and are very happy with them. Can confirm that the neck lanyard is extremely handy, as you can take off the mask while it still hangs around your neck. The adjustable ear loops are also super handy and comfortable. If I had to find a fault, it's that the mask material is quite thick and muffles your voice significantly, so be prepared to shout at cashiers who are also behind a plastic protection barrier.	episode_done:True

I'm not a fashion designer nor a trendsetter of any kind, and maybe this opinion is one of the reasons I'm not 😂 I'm just not excited enough to reach for any of these pieces instead of something with a pop from some other brand.

text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:Am I the only one that doesn't see how the Teddy jacket would give off peaked in high school lettermen jacket vibes like all the lurkers that were clearly bullied by jocks are claiming?  Obviously it's inspired by letterman jackets, but removing the contrasting leather sleeves and not having a TGI Friday's wall's worth of shit stitched onto it completely changes the vibe. I don't know, maybe I just associate it more with rockstar because it's an SLP piece and Alex Turner was the first celebrity I saw a photo of wearing it.
text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:I’d add that the most *important* fit for these clothes are the shoulders.

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

Although I still think the way he's communicating is strange. I think he means tonally neutral, bland, desaturated colors. "Cold" is a really strange way to say that, whether or not the term is technically ambiguous.

text:How many distinctly different outfits do you have?	labels:I've wondered about the same thing a lot before. I spent some time working in Japan, and I had a fairly limited professional wardrobe there. I had a handful of skirts, with only two silhouettes really - a long maxi and a full a-line knee-length. To add to that, two pairs were literally the same skirt, just in two different colors. So I had to plan how I wore them pretty carefully to try not to repeat them more than once a week, and to try to avoid a weekly schedule of skirt wearing. What I really relied on was my blouses and sweaters, because although their silhouette and fit was also very similar to one another, they tended to have patterns and be more distinguishable that way.  To be honest though, I think I spent a lot of time worrying over something that few people really paid much attention to. There were a few times I forgot to do laundry and ran out of clothes, so I had to repeat an outfit before I wanted, and no one ever commented or gave me weird looks. And I definitely knew people who just repeated things all the time and didn't care. I think if anything, if many of your clothes are very similar, it makes it easier to dress and just becomes a distinctive style trait.	episode_done:True

What kind of lifestyle do you have? What is your fashion style and "look" like? What are your undertones? What is your budget?  Answering those questions may help someone give you advice regarding jewelry. Prescriptive "everyone should own" lists are completely worthless.
text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:I thrift quite a bit and take items to my local alterations tailor. Think vintage made in USA items made using natural fabrics (cotton, wool, cashmere). Sometimes they are made with older, odd, or boxy fits that are slightly off. Which leads me to the diminishing returns of...   Tailoring and Alterations (in relation to fit): These costs can add up quickly - and sometimes the end result will not be satisfactory.  Simple alterations like taking in the waist or sleeves usually work out - but major surgery with jacket shoulders and major pant adjustments usually are not worth the effort.    It's ok to pass on a sale or leave an item on the rack if you know the fit or alterations won't work out for you. On the other hand, it can be worth the extra $ to purchase something if it fits very well off-the-rack.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:Going for good materials is definitely the way forward if it's something I'd want to wear for years to come. I prefer solid gold or silver to plated pieces which will barely last a few months before coming off. However, if it's a fun fashion style I'm not adverse to cheaper options like gold filled or vermeil.  Same goes for stones - e.g. diamonds or pearls over CZ or plastic pearls.  There is a wide spectrum of 'real stuff' depending on your budget and brand preference. E.g. a Tiffany diamond is more expensive than a non branded one from Costco. A lesser quality diamond (based on the 4 C's) or lab diamond is cheaper. 14k gold is cheaper than 18k gold and sterling silver is cheaper than 14k gold...  Not sure if I'm still considered young anymore but I've certainly always enjoyed jewelry! Sterling silver is cheap to buy typically if you don't go for branded (Tiffany, David Yurman) - Etsy is a favourite. Plus second hand saves a lot. Gold is a lot cheaper in Asia if you buy non branded as the labour markup is a lot lower. Given the weight method of sales, solid gold earrings and rings are quite affordable as a result.   And cultured freshwater pearls are a lot cheaper than say Akoya pearls of AAA quality. When I was on holiday in Asia, it'd be common to pay £5 or something and pick some oysters that they'd open up and you get to keep all the little seed pearls they had inside  Typically there were quite a few! Goes to show how easy it is to farm them.  Overall, I think if you're savvy about how to shop and willing to compromise on quality, these items are all affordable.  I'd say have a browse for what you enjoy wearing and like the look of and go from there. Some people might enjoy a single classic item and save up and others have a wide range. I'd say pawnbrokers, eBay and Etsy are some of my favourite go-to places depending on what I'm looking for.

I’m looking for some ‘transition’ clothes, so I can start trying to find my style without ‘showing off’ my fat, if that makes sense. I’m not really sure how to explain this lol.  Are there any brands that are good w/ baggy clothes, if not what are some inspo sources that have sweatshirts, baggy clothes, etc.  I’m in the US, and have a budget of around $100, maybe $150. I’d have what you call a ‘Baby Face’, very uncooperative hair (which is always in a side part, just naturally), and zero self confidence lol.

It’s always only the one, but I’m not sure they’re different entities or it’s the same one with an infinite number of variants.

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls” catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your “fashion house designers” but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I’ve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.

Chris Brown is an awful person, I'm not changing the song if a Chris Brown song comes on my Pandora station.

I'm hitting that point where I'm going to sell off a bunch of stuff because I haven't put it on in 9 months and I don't want to sit on unworn things.

text:My thoughts of the Cote&Ciel Isar L after a year	labels:I’ve owned the same exact model for some 6 years now. It holds up very well, although the issue with the shoulder strap slipping is annoying and has gotten worse.  Proudest moment was when a group of Japanese girls crowded behind me trying to figure out what brand it is.  When I still lugged a laptop and then some everywhere I was using it a lot. But  I’m not carrying as much anymore. I just need a tablet and a water bottle for which the Isar is overkill. It alone weighs more than both of these together.  So great bag with great design but specific use case. Smaller than your typical carryon but big for something to take everywhere.  What traveling I prefer a carryon plus a bag I that doubles as my daily carry, but the Isar is for me just a bit too heavy for this.	episode_done:True

text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:First, I do have some questions for you:    Which kind of items would you like to wear?   What style would you like to go towards? (I can't get much information from jeans and basic t-shirt)   Do you have a small waist? (this question goes towards if pants/jeans that fit you in the butt and thighs have a wide gap at the waist)   Are your legs "too long" for normal-sized bottoms? (regarding if you need tall sizes for jeans)   With your chest and shoulders, do you often have the issue that you need to size up to have correct shoulder hems but then the clothing item will be too wide in the chest/belly area?  Once you answer, I can give you some suggestions.

text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I have at least 20 frames.  Some of them are no longer my prescription but I don’t want to get rid of them. I buy them from zenni but also wherelight and some other places. They are most definitely an accessory because sometimes I need them to stand out more or less depending on my outfit.   My eye doctor has me wearing progressive lenses now so the price has gone up significantly on my everyday glasses so I don’t have the same selection I used to. However, I can see just as well out of my $60 zennis as I can out of my $400 frames from the eye doctor.	episode_done:True

I'm in my early/mid 20s, and now that I've worked a couple years at the same place, I'm wearing more what I want than boring professional. I also started caring about what I wear and planning my outfits. Velvet shoes, corduroy overalls, rainbow prints, sequins, bold colors. Who cares? I've been called out for dressing "fancy" before, but I've stopped giving a shit in correlation with my confidence in my abilities. I'm a teacher...if anything, I'm showing the students it's okay to be yourself and take risks.

text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:I’d agree that personal comfort is the big thing.    I’d also pay attention to the content of the compliment. “That’s a cool sweater” is NOT the same thing as “you look great in that sweater”, KWIM?   Sometimes people are appreciating the design or color or novelty of an item and not the big picture of how it works for you.
text:I wonder where all these designers went off to when GUESS/GBG let them go. Yeah I hated seeing GBG lose its flair out of nowhere. All their later designs became very plain. I have no idea what they’re doin now merchandising-wise by filling GBG stores with GUESS Factory stuff. Might as we just close the GBG stores. I guess corporate is still figuring something out and they are filling stores with non-GBG stuff in the process.	labels:I think most of them just went off to F21, or other companies in the LA area. Even when a brand is not doing well, the name alone still has some value. They are probably trying to hold on to whatever the name “G by Guess” still has in value. If they were to give up the name, they can potentially loose trademark/copyright of that name and it becomes available for anyone else to pick up if they show Guess not using that name. I think it is honestly all legalities.
text:Well there would be, id be using my undergrad in fashion design to then hone my skills in said field. Was thinking FIT, Parsons, CSM, Antwerp for grad? Or even just an associates.

Or should I just drop it all and go to great fashion program at a fashion school.	labels:As I said, only worth it if you want a job where you have to have a graduate degree. Honing skills isn’t a good reason. You can get paid to do that
text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:Taking a picture or asking for a second opinion from someone who’s fashion sense you trust can help too! I’ll put on something that’s risky or different from my usual fits and think it looks awful. All I see is how it is too tight in the bust or emphasizes my waist, then I take it off and move back to safer ground.   My husband’s favorite dress on me... I was going to return it, when he saw me trying it on and told me to pick a restaurant. I still don’t love the dress on, but he swears it looks amazing on me. (And he does not shy away from expressing negative opinions).   I’m just saying, sometimes we see what we expect to see. And getting a second opinion is worth it, because that look might really “look right” on you. It just might not be what you are used to seeing.	episode_done:True

text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:To add onto some already really good advice, what you like may not be what you look really good in. This part took me the longest time to figure out. Key here is to keep an open mind. Your likes will probably change every 2-4 years, so when you buy new clothes, take note of whether it compliments with your features,is easy to mix and match with other things in your wardrobe and how wearable it is for your lifestyle. Once you start understanding a bit more about what works for you, even if your style changes over time, you'll know what to avoid or what to look for.	episode_done:True

text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I am a teacher that went back to working in the building at the beginning of September, so to be fair I was only wfh for several months in the spring, but it still drastically changed my style, or my perspective on my style.   Pre-Covid my work style (and general style) had morphed over the years to become very, very minimal and neutral. Lots of Everlane and Eileen Fisher. This was both because I wanted to be taken seriously at my job (I read very young) and because it also seemed like what was in style to me.   Returning to work in the fall, I realized I really f*cking hated all of my sensible, plain, go with everything black and grey clothes.   I still really prefer earth tones and blacks and greys, and I still wear some pretty simple outfits somedays, but I went on a small spree on The RealReal after I had my realization. I bought myself some louder statement pieces that feel more me, including an embroidered Happy Sheep sweater, a knit Missoni sheath dress, a multi-colored leather and fur purse, platform oxfords, and a couple of geometric patterned silk shirts and dresses.   For me life is too short to try so hard to be timeless and professional. I’m not knocking the look, it just isn’t ~me~ I want to love the clothes I wear and the clothes I love are fun knits and patterns.

text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:I hope you're not asking this because of rude comments from others - if so, it's worth learning to ignore those people.  That said, I've found lightening up the hairstyling and makeup is quite helpful if you want to look more relaxed.  I also have a personal rule about shoes and skirts: the higher the hemline, the less sexy the shoe. This keeps miniskirts looking relaxed, and prevents longer skirts from skewing frumpy. Obviously rules are meant to be broken, including this one, and it doesn't really apply in the evening.

text:MFA Theme WAYWT: Casual Tailoring	labels:This stuff looks great and the idea is nice in theory but after years of attempting this and being “that guy”, it really doesn’t work outside of the largest/most fashionable locales (NYC, London, Paris, Southern Europe, etc.). If you really want to do this and are comfortable with it then by all means go ahead. But from my own experience I did this, and actually did it fairly well after many years, but at the end of the day it stood out too much in real everyday life in a normal town, regardless of how nice the outfit was, and it definitely hurt my social reputation a lot. After toning it down a bit I immediately noticed a difference in how much more positively I was treated by people. You can still dress well, but remember context is key.
text:General Discussion - December 08, 2020	labels:Yesterday we had in here a brief discussion on the potential impending resurgence of square toes (niche designers -> celebs -\*> big designers -> fast fashion -> regular people).  (\*you are here). Lurkers gonna be *mad*.  Upon reflection it really highlighted to me how downright insane the discourse of 10-years-ago-MFA was. Taking the square toes as examples, we had all this "teaching material" about how they were wrong, unflattering and just an all around horrible idea. With the implication that the people who make and wear square toe shoes simply don't know what they are doing.  Yeah, right. The people running one of *the* most profitable and most competitive markets simply didn't know that square toes "don't flatter your foot". They needed randos on the internet to find that out. *Insane*.

text:How to find non-custom tailored clothing for short men (under 5')	labels:>The shortest I can find on sites for short men is 5'2", which isn't super useful for someone at my height.  Why would a three inch difference make that clothing useless? Have you tried it on, or just assume it won't work? I'd imagine they would work, and at worst you would have to have a tailor hem things a touch shorter than the off-the-rack size.
text:If I could drive there I would definitely feel more secure. My greatest packing achievement yet was packing 1 suitcase + 1 backpack for 2 months, 5 countries and 4 different ranges of weather. I was able to fit everything I needed without having to shop, but I can't imagine surviving on it for an entire year without resorting to minimalism. It just seems so boring to me, I can't see myself looking like me in those types of clothing	labels:One thing I think a lot of minimal capsule wardrobe inspo images don’t show is that you don’t HAVE to do only neutrals. This is a revelation I just had recently — I came to the end of about 2 years of personal style exploration and put together a capsule wardrobe to see if it would work for me. I’m all about colors and floral patterns, so for me the trick was to choose everything in a color palette that would mix & match. My colors are navy blue, coral pink, yellow, and dark green. Almost all of my items were one or more of those colors, and everything interchanged really easily, even though I only had 20 items or so.   You said fashion is how you express yourself. What are the consistencies between your favorite pieces? Do several of your pieces already go together? That might be the basis for creating a “minimal” wardrobe that still feels expressive and in line with your personality.
text:Blondo has waterproof suede. I have like 3 pairs collected over 3 years. They lose their waterproofing eventually but they're still fairly sturdy.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it’s typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it’s a bottom, they no longer “stay up”. This usually happens with leggings or panties after about 5 or more years of regular wear with caring for the items properly.  I also had a faux leather jacket wear out after 6 years of regular wear. The faux leather ended up “peeling off” or something like that.

text:FAQ: What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I haven’t made myself any rigorous challenges, but i have tried to be more mindful about purchases.  In my opinion, a bit of self awareness goes along way.  If i am thinking about an item i write it down on my wishlist. I dont buy anything that hasn’t been on that wishlist. If I come across something online, even if it is a flash sale, just put it in the cart, on the wishlist, and chill. I come back to the list periodically, and see what i still want, what i still think about, and what ive either forgotten or don’t really want anymore. The time waiting on that list should be directly related to the price.  Don’t succumb to the FOMO. For me, not filling my life with extra stuff i might not actually want is far better than missing out on a deal. If i only thought about it because of the sale, i can afford to wait for the next sale.   This has been effective for me. There are plenty of things that I would probably enjoy, but most often, after thinking it out over time, it’s clear that I wouldn’t enjoy them significantly more than things I already have. If i had implemented this technique from the start of my clothes interest, I estimate id be about $2-3k richer now. The only thing i can think of now which ive consistently been interested in for a few years would be some guidi boots, but honestly those are too far out of my price range to make happen	episode_done:True

text:Why Did Bottega Veneta Delete Its Social Media Accounts?	labels:All these thinkpieces serve to do is mystify a transparent marketing strategy dovetailing neatly with the ethos of the brand. As a brand Bottega Veneta is fashion's equivalent of your friends on social media who announce to the world that they're going to be moving in silence from now on  – a brand for those who want to be lowkey, *but not really*.  Social media makes sense for brands like LV for whom the core ethos is in your face flaunting, as Instagram is both chief flex medium and ultimate marketing tool to an aspirational public. Bottega Veneta's courtship is a bit different. If I'm BV I don't even want to be seen as attempting to court that customer, and so the retreat from social media makes sense considering the brand's appeal to aspirational customers who want to be perceived as more sophisticated than those of LV. In reality BV is every bit as accessible before (just type it into the search bar) but it's the *illusion* of withdrawal which is key, both in attracting more aspirational customers and retaining your seasonal clients, for whom discretion – especially in LVMH's major growth market of China – is key.  I don't have any experience in marketing or the luxury sector but what this tells me is that LVMH believes either that a social media presence was a waste of resources or that this'll help cultivate a fake sense of "in the know" among their growth demographic, particularly with COVID exposing the full extent of income inequality's social rot.  Considering influencer fraud, flexing, and the danger of being mixed in with the bland minimal luxury aesthetic running rampant on IG, it makes perfect sense for them to pull back.  &#x200B;  TL;DR: It's just good marketing. The brand will still be very present in all the relevant outlets that actually generate sales.
text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:Well, I’m no fashion expert, but I’d try...  - mixing and matching old-timey-style things with modern things (like a corset over a tee (or blouse, for more vintage points) and modern pants/jeans, an old flowey dress with a modern leather jacket, things like that) - maybe adding vintage accessories (an antique locket, vintage hair pins?) - styling your hair in more vintage styles (like Bernadette)  Hope this is a good starter! If I think of any more I’ll try to update.
text:Experimenting With Different Focal Lengths & Landscape || Portrait	labels:For a straight on shot, yes, a longer focal length will look more objective and usually better, as well as compress the depth of field. But, I'd say the shorter focal lengths would be more appealing if you composed the shot to take advantage of the lenses!  A wider lens will look best when you're making use of and exaggerating depth, so maybe a seated pose with the legs stretching towards camera, or shooting from below or above, getting closer to details of the subject.  I do a decent amount of photography, and I wouldn't take out a wide lens just to take the exact same shot I would've with a longer lens. Adapt your approach to your gear!
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Nothing that needs to be dry cleaned except winter coats. Hate the smell, hate the bother, hate the expense.  No glitter, no metallic thread. I like it on other people, but on me it makes me feel like I’m wearing a costume. Sequins and paillettes only on formal evening wear (for me).  No dolman sleeves (for me). I don’t like how they look on my busty inverted triangle shape.

text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:Layers layers layers. I live in Canada and our winters get nasty. Long skirts are a must if you want to wear one. Any exposed skin is dangerous and will immediately make you lose warmth very quickly. Wools are fantastic in the winter. They naturally wick away dampness and hold in heat even if wet. Silks are next because they are similar, but they don't breath as well or hold in warmth as well. Avoid cottons like the plague. If they get wet they will sap heat away from you and this can be fatal. I avoid polyester whenever possible unless maybe as a waterproof outer layer. Leathers are a great outerlayer that is generally water resistant.  If I am going to be outside for a length of time in a skirt I wear merino wool leggings from icebreaker if it's cold enough under the skirt. You can also wear another skirt under the first one, or a third, go nuts. Also add boots that make it to around the end of the skirt, or a pair of socks over the tights to extend the coverage. Don't forget your toes, fingers and head. You can bundle up as much as possible but if you forget those you basically undid everything. Your core is much warmer than your extremities.  Also, don't make the layers too tight. You keep warm so long as the air around your body is warm, so you need loose ish styles to seal in not just you, but warm air.  This being said. I would not recommend any serious bushwhacking in heavy skirts and deep snow.	episode_done:True
text:I’m not a tailor but I think there’s a way around it. Maybe it would cost to much to tailor but I think it could be done on jeans for example. kinda like how a tailor would cut jeans to be tighter but then instead of sewing it shut just put elastic behind it to pull it shut but when it opens just the denim shows... again idk what I’m really talking about but I feel like it could be fast ke to make pants go from like a 28 to maybe a 31/32	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What clothing items have you reverted back to since WFH/quarantine?	labels:I've really been embracing dressing more youthful. I'm in my early/mid 20s, and now that I've worked a couple years at the same place, I'm wearing more what I want than boring professional. I also started caring about what I wear and planning my outfits. Velvet shoes, corduroy overalls, rainbow prints, sequins, bold colors. Who cares? I've been called out for dressing "fancy" before, but I've stopped giving a shit in correlation with my confidence in my abilities. I'm a teacher...if anything, I'm showing the students it's okay to be yourself and take risks.

They're 50/50 cotton poly blend. Evidently he bought one in high school and then just kept buying other colors. They're looking pretty faded at this point, so I'd like to buy him a couple new shirts to try out (and hopefully step up on quality too).  Any suggestions of brands I should check out? Must haves are that it's soft and tagless. Definitely willing to pay more for quality. He's really fit on a small frame, so standard or fitted styles works.	episode_done:True

text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism? I love it, but how do you do it?	labels:Based on that album, I guess I am maximal about half of the time! :D  I think the easiest thing to do is to start small.  If you wear a lot of solids and neutrals - dip your toe in with a great coat. A coat in a fun color, maybe even a patterned coat. Wear that daily.  If you don't want to commit to a coat, get one "loud" patterned item. The easiest way to pair it is to pull out one of the colors in the pattern and that is what you wear it with. Instead of using the neutral, use one of the accent colors.  And number 3 is color blocking. That one is super easy. You just pick two solids, but skip the neutrals. Tone on tone is fun, as well as things that are near opposites on the color wheel.  I have yet to master pattern mixing, that is one of my goals.	episode_done:True

I've been trying to pin fashion and style again, and I find I really miss the website Polyvore.  I never used it, but the ease with which other people made outfits and shared them meant that there was always something new to pin.    I follow a few fashion bloggers who seem to be popular, but I sometimes forget the work that goes into doing a blog post, styling things just right, taking the photos, etc.  Not to mention buying the clothes!  With that old Polyvore website, users were pushing out complete outfits everyday.  I hope something like that comes back around again soon, because I found the flat lay design of the pins easy to identify with.  With real people or models, I start to worry about whether something would work with my proportions, what kind of style tips they're using, etc	episode_done:True

It's usually not something that looks good, at least to ourselves.   I remember Karen from Karenbritchick, who often looks amazing in her clothes and designer items, talk about her most complimented item, and it's not the designer bags, cool clothes that she owns, but some wack, elaborate guitar strap for her bag.   So, our own gut feelings are important. Also, what looks good might not feel good.

That way you can find what suits you within the category so it can be classic and something you will actually wear!

text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:It’s less about the value of the item and more about the stars aligning perfectly.  I wear a size 12-13W shoe, plus other things that make my feet really hard to fit, so I am used to buying formalwear to match the one maybe two pairs of formal shoes I own at any given time.  So when I was 17 and going to prom in 2006, my mom tried really hard to help me find shoes, any shoes, that were suitable. But we could only find casual flats or runners, and I realllly wanted to dress up nicely for the first real time in my life. So she said “you know what, let’s buy a dress and then we will just have to find a way.”  So I picked out a black and pale pink dress that just made me swoon, and I figured black heels would be easiest to find. Lol I was so young and stupid.  Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn’t find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I’d just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.
text:General Discussion - October 23	labels:I gotta say, as an American, it's really surprising that there's class connotations to rugby shirts.

Seems really out of place for it to be paired up with golf, tennis, and horse-related stuff.

text:“I'm all locked down with nowhere to go – but that hasn't killed my lust for fashion”	labels:I have one suggestion, get dressed and take pictures. It doesn't have to be for Instagram/facebook. It can be for just yourself. If you really like an outfit, remember it with a picture. You can take it in a park, or at a location that is memorable for you, with your SO, or with your cat. You should at least get a few good pictures with you pet in the 10+ years they reside with you.  It's actually a fun learning experience, on how to use the cameras. I am interested in photography and usually use a dslr, but for selfies, dslrs are not as good. With an iphone, I think it's an entirely different genre of photography. You have to use completely different lighting system, etc., to use it to its full potential.

text:Women who have moved for extended periods of time on 1 or 2 suitcases only, how did you do it? Here's the beginning of my process	labels:I'm an Australian who moved over to the other side of the world to London in January, and I was only limited to a 30kg suitcase, a small cabin suitcase, and a backpack.   I'm not much of a minimalist person either, but I brought all my basic t-shirts, a few skincare products that I couldn't live without (I'm a skincare junkie, and my skin breaks the fuck out when I'm stressed so that was important to have for me), and I also brought my summer clothes over. Why? Because Australian winters are quite different to UK winters, and I didn't think my Australian winter clothes would hold up in a UK winter, and I figured that buying winter stuff in London would be better than buying winter clothes in Australia and bringing it over to the UK.  The UK isn't as cold as I expected, but I don't regret buying my winter stuff in London. If I was gonna blow my money on new clothes, I'd rather spend it on winter clothes than summer clothes, since the UK doesn't really have long summers.  I also brought a couple of shoes over: black heels, black flats, my Docs, one pair of fashion sneakers, and my running shoes. I ended up buying Chelsea boots in London for work, and a pair of sandals during summer.  Try to make sure your stuff is as versatile as possible when you first move, because chances are, you'll be too busy to shop in your first week of moving!
text:Discussion: what does your shopping process look like?	labels:I have two kinds of shopping experiences. One is:  - carefully think about gaps in my wardrobe - search in my favorite stores for key items  - save the items - come back to the items with fresh eyes a few days or weeks later - decide whether to buy  OR  - fall in love with something (usually shopping in person) - impulse buy it - get excited about my new clothes or feel regret deep in my soul  Edit: thanks for the award! 🥰
text:Has anyone lost their wardrobe creativity as they’ve gotten older? How do you get it back?	labels:Read the Curated Closet if you want to really hone in and define a personal style and how to wear it. Great tips about how to buy clothes purposefully, how to accessorize, how to identify quality, etc.   As far as the aging thing goes - I’ve found I just become more myself. I don’t buy into trends now. I know I won’t wear a color that isn’t navy so I don’t bother buying it. No velvet. No shorts. Etc etc. I just have less time for navel gazing and bullshit. Maybe because I’m a nurse in a pandemic who is also in perpetual grad school. Or maybe because I finally have money now to buy what I really want? Either way. No real advice but just a question to think about what you actually want to wear for who you are today. Not an imaginary person who doesn’t live your life with your budget and your body and your friends, ya know?

I'm kinda anxious that they look like clown shoes on me lol. What anxiety I've had from wearing normal chucks have doubled with this pair.   Here's some pictures and videos of me wearing said pair. Is there such a difference between this pair and my other shoes? And yeah, I'll probably exclusively wear this with wide pants. I'm aware slimmer pants just fuck up the silhouette way too much.  Height is 173 cm. Average build, around 155lbs or so.
text:Best of Techwearclothing 2020	labels:!mfaimagebot 17 49 74 93 95 71  I'm into these. The westernish vibes from 17 and 49 are cool, 74 is channeling a bit of Harrison Ford (Indy or Han, take your pick), and 93 and 95 are quite close to modern tactical "greyman" wear, but aren't super militant, and I wouldn't necessarily pick 93 from a crowd, that sweater does a good job of casualizing (there's gotta be a better word for this) the outift. 95 does look a bit like a GoRuck ad. 71 looks a bit like he drank all of the greyman coolaid.   I'm seeing lots of room for people to blouse their pants into their boots and I dig it.   I got into MFA to get away from costumey clothing but I'm finding it might get me back into it lol.  Edit: the presence of fanny packs and even binoc harnesses here also surprised me. Y'all do function and I love it.	episode_done:True

Yes they’re still using your clothes, but you’re letting them shoot themselves in the foot by getting them to contribute to the exact opposite of what they stand for. It’s a win-win-win situation. Michael Scott would dig.

text:Plus there are SO MANY MEN who know absolutely nothing about fashion or style. If he doesn’t even know the right terminology to use then he probably falls in this group.   It’s possible the boyfriend has an art school education, or participates in online fashion forums, or is very tapped into visual style (if so, he still could keep his opinions to himself)... but I’m betting it’s more likely he wears too much hair gel and the same crumpled t shirt and jeans most of the time. Which is also fine, but doesn’t make him qualified to comment on anyone else’s fashion choices.  OP, if you feel comfortable in it, go ahead and wear it. You’ll work out what you like, and it’ll probably evolve over the years. If you’re looking for more ideas, try searching tags on Instagram and pinning outfits online to refer back to.	labels:When an ex of mine (well-meaning but very much a bro) would make any remark about women's fashion, I'd just give him a look and say, "Yeah, ok, Mr Versace..." and that would shut that shit right down.	episode_done:True

text:It’s 2021. A vaccine for the virus has been made widely available and businesses may operate at full capacity, including bars, clubs, salons, etc. How will this influence fashion?	labels:People will go ALL OUT. This sub usually salivates at the thought of athleisure taking over and killing fashion (and fast fashion) but that 100% wouldn't happen. Almost every woman I know is bloody sick and tired of not getting to dress up, not being able to wear lipstick, not having places to wear heels and vacation outfits. People would literally go crazy and it truly would be the roaring twenties. Dresses of all types, miniskirts, sparkle and glitter, heels for days, fun fabrics, bolder colors, leather pants, blouses with impractical sleeves, statement earrings – women would really be dressing to the nines *and* wearing bold lipstick colors to compliment.
text:Is Money Important for Style? - The Style and Direction Podcast	labels:It’s funny to me. I live in Southern California, home to the entertainment business and some of the best clothing shops in the country, but the hierarchy of fashion and money isn’t linear. There’s some old school law firms where everyone wears suits, and   studio executives often wears suits, but bottom-rung business-side entertainment folks (eg, low level agency people making $40,000 a year) *have to wear suits* too. At the same time, actors, tech people, and high ranking people in the business get to dress casually - casual dress is becoming a mark of success.	episode_done:True

They’re comparable to other high end althetic wear brands (but still cheaper than lululemon & girlfriend) but the quality is absolutely incredible. They don’t pull after weekly wear, hold their shape and last for years while still looking new. Nearly all pairs pass the squat test.

Thusfar they've had some of the mildest winters in years and NOW I am moving again to England where I have been told the weather is basically the same as Seattle.

text:Start small and work your way up! Maybe sew some pillowcases first to learn making straight/even hems and borders (or I guess you can use scrap cloth but that’s not as fun or rewarding) - also maybe kitchen cloths - and then maybe you could try tailoring your outfits. Maybe a pants is slightly too long, or a blouse is too loose - now you can hem up the pants and take in the blouse. Don’t cut cloth until you’re comfortable!! Sewing is the opposite of cooking - you can subtract but never add, while cooking you can always add but not subtract. And even then, when you build up to the stage where you want to cut cloth, maybe try that project on scrap material first lol. Cloth can be expensive, so as pretty as it is... start small.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:Go on Pinterest and pin things that catch your eye. Once you have a board try and find similarities between the pins (for example ruffles, silk, strappy backs etc) and start searching up those things at stores that are within your price range.  In terms of comfort, look for materials you like and what silhouettes you’re into. If you tend to do tighter tops with more volume at the bottom then look for dresses that match that for example. If you know you like cotton blends look for those.    Also look for stores that carry petite sections or find a tailor in your area  Don’t go crazy trying to push yourself too far out of your comfort zone. Look for things that are your style but that you’ve never worn before.
text:Also I don’t know about the APC jeans, but most men’s jeans that I find are 9” rose or lower. I’m into selvedge jeans and the most selection can be found in men’s styles, but very seldom do I find any jeans with 10”+ rise in men’s. 10” is my bare minimum...and those are mid-rise on me. 11” is a minimum for high-rise.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How to combine colors	labels:The article about monocolor wearers is awesome. I don't think I have the self-assurance or tie for that, yet, but I may grow into it with time - how fun it would be to dye all of my own matching clothes in exactly the same shade. Thank you!
text:It’s so important to take into mind silhouettes and proportions.   Now that I’ve gained weight bc of quarantine, a lot of things that i use to be able to wear when I had a thigh gap, no longer look good on me. Skinnies make my legs look like tree trunks now, and straight legs look more like slim legs. I wear exclusively very straight (almost wide) leg “boy” jeans now and it makes my waist look smaller and balances out my top and bottom.   TLDR: I use to be more ruler prior to quarantine but I’m definitely a pear now and I have to be very careful that what I wear doesn’t make me look fatter.	labels:This reply made me sad. The idea that you have excluded an entire silhouette because of a recent body trend is depressing. I have never had a thigh gap nor will ever likely have one at a healthy weight. Your legs are not tree trunks, you do not need to hide them. They are carrying you through a very tumultuous and difficult period of life right now which is worth more than how slim they are. If you love straight fits now that is wonderful, but please don’t feel that you are now excluded from skinnies because of an Instagram trend.

text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:These kinds of dresses are really popular in Japan as casual wear. Many women will wear them around the house or just to run Errands. Often they are worn with leggings for a comfortable look with the fit often being slightly oversize. This is possibly as close as we will get to comfort fashion/athleisure in Japan. The style borders with the Mori girl (forest girl) look which favors loose dresses in natural fabrics.   &#x200B;  Look at shops like Uniqlo or Muji - the womenswear section always has a few in stock all year round. I myself own quite a few of these type dresses to wear at home, on weekends and to work.  &#x200B;  In my office today, all the women are wearing some sort of loose fit dress because it is hot as balls outside.	episode_done:True

I loved it for years and then it got a big ol hole and I don't know how to fix linen (can you fix linen idk?) so I had to let her go.   I was heartbroken, she was so good to me, always covering my pasty white skin while keeping me cool, hiding my belly on fatter days and tucking beautifully into some jeans on less fat days.  I wasn't even really aware of resale sites until last year because I hadn't really gotten into secondhand shopping yet. Then it took a while to realize that I can re-buy all my dearly departed favorites.  Then one day I searched for her on posh and we were reunited in less than a week.

text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:I love Etsy for jewelry! There’s a huge range of eclectic handmade statement pieces to classic but affordable silver and gold/gold filled pieces. Also, since we are heading towards colder weather in the northern hemisphere, scarves and tights really help adding versatility to your wardrobe. Tights especially help with transitioning warmer weather clothes like skirts and dresses into fall.	episode_done:True
text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I haven't worked in a proper business casual place in a long time. My office is casual and I tend to dress up.   As mentioned, it depends on what level of casual is implied. I always took it as sort of one casual element, and the rest is regular business.   So I feel like you can do a couple of angles.   One of my favorite angles is a fancy version of something casual. E.g. a jogger in a trouser fabric or a shirt dress shape in a nicer fabric (like a wool knit, or some sort of jersey knit or silk. Or a shirt dress but with sheen.   The other angle is one casual element with a dressy outfit. E.g. nice dress with fancy sneakers. Or jeans with a blouse, blazer,  and "nice shoes."  Or maybe a sheath dress with a moto or jean jacket.   My default work outfit is usually a dress, and I feel like depending on the shape it could either go casual or dressy. And it jut ends up being a lot easier for me. I have dresses that are a bit more casual and ones that are a bit more fancy. The fancy ones get a casual piece and the casual ones get a fancy piece.	episode_done:True

I think some of this comes down to the encouragement of bargaining on the platform. People will say they anticipate being offered a lower number so they'll overprice something, but if you're a buyer that's just an additional layer of hassle that would stop impulsive purchases which isn't great for getting things sold.	labels:	episode_done:True

Tony called the company I first worked at (him, not an assistant or other person) and I actually picked up the call. He wanted to partner with our business to really bring a boom to DTLV. I remember how honest and enthusiastic he was. Sadly I couldn’t make the decision and had to transfer him to a coordinator who eventually brought the details to our VP, who declined (stupid reasons why).

text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I'd get a really nice piece of outerwear, either a coat in a quality material like wool or a leather or shearling jacket. If you live somewhere with colder weather during part of the year, outerwear is something you'll be wearing all the time so it's worth investing in a piece that's great quality, keeps you warm and makes a statement. I think an amazing jacket or coat will elevate even the most basic outfit, whether it's a more classic piece, something utilitarian like a puffer jacket or something more extravagant. Personally I think Acne, Chloe and Tibi are brands that make great high-end outerwear in a variety of styles.

text:I know what you mean and I agree. I don't particularly like the tone of the article, and the man himself is defensive in his instagram bio:   > I am just a straight, happily married guy that loves Porsches, beautiful women and incorporating high heels and skirts into my daily wardrobe.   In other words, "I like cars and hot women, so I'm manly. I just happen to like women's clothes too. But really, I'm manly." It reads like a masc gay guy trying to distance himself from "the fems".   Despite all of that, considering where most of the western world is regarding gender roles and expression, I think highlighting something like this is important because you don't typically see successful corporate boomer men in very obvious womenswear, especially at work. So even though there are plenty of issues here I think the visibility is important.	labels:I absolutely agree. And yet, I kind of get it.   As a guy who likes high heeled boots and silky shirts and racing/motorsports, makeup, musicals and woodworking and design and shooting... it’s almost like I’m two completely different people based on which of my hobbies/pastimes/etc. I’m currently engaged in. but I’m not. I can be selfish and like all these things. they can all inform part of my identity. The me thats wearing a track hoodie and a helmet and going sideways on the autocross course is the same me that’s wearing flowers and done up and belting the lyrics to frozen (frozen 2 because it’s better than the first and y’all can fight me) in the kitchen  (The fact that I only recently discovered I’m bi only adds to the contrast. oh hey look another thing I can’t choose)  But it’s a good reminder to be careful about *how* I remind people that I’m “not just X”, because it can come off exactly like you described.

text:What designer bags and eras do you think will come back in fashion 2021-2022?	labels:I think bags with a lot of hardware and buckles will come back. Mulberry is relaunching the Alexa tomorrow and I suspect a little bit of a comeback of big slouchy casual bags like the Alexa, the Balenciaga City and some of the hardware-heavy (literally) Chloe designs.  Small shoulder bags, Prada Nylon, the Fendi Baguette and the Dior Saddle won‘t be going anywhere.  If anything, I fear that Nylon bags are coming back with a vengeance... bags with lots of pockets, compartments... those ridiculous prada boots with the little pouches are just the beginning.

text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I think they can work as long as you consider how they fit with your outfit and the colour palette.  A coworker wore a lovely green scarf tied loosely around her ponytail once and the rest of her outfit was grey/black and simple. It looked great. Had she worn a bright blue dress and bright red lipstick with it, maybe not, at least in a professional environment.  Some women get away with dressing a bit eccentric, but I’d say they’re almost always in a senior role, near retiring or very young. I say ‘get away with’ because we technically have no dress code, aside from something really inappropriate.  Intend to stick to neutrals and darker colours. I have a few plain tops in bright colours, but I always pair them with very simple and plain items. It’s not that dislike them, but they require more thought!	episode_done:True

text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:I looove this aesthetic, it's my actual workwear, and funnily enough I dress this way because it does make me look older.  To stay age appropriate, the key is accessories. Socks that fit the aesthetic but are more playful, bows are great, and fun jewelry. There are so many looks, like plaid skirts, that I like but would never wear because they're better for a younger look. Also, if you don't already look older than your age it's probably not going to be a problem. If it does have that effect, it's not in an inappropriate way so it really doesn't matter.	episode_done:True
text:clothes + art: random inspo	labels:Thought I’d put together an inspo that more heavily focuses on art and clothes. While there may not be an intersection between many of these paintings or pieces of clothing, there’s always something to pull from works of art, whether it be how colors work together or how the form of the piece can inform your own choices about clothing. I think that grounding clothing choices in the context of the art, architecture, or anything else that surrounds you can be a really good move overall.

text:What's on your 2021 fashion wishlist?	labels:I'm going from the Middle East (last year) to living in the Baltics (2021) so it's going to be aaaaall about the cold-weather gear and woolens for me. I don't have a super-great grasp on what the formality levels are going to be at work yet, but I'm definitely hoping to get some great all-weather boots, some super warm leggings for non-work or work from home wear. The new job comes with a promotion so I'm going to need a few suits and some wool dress slacks for work (for those days when it's just too cold for anything else!).  I'm thinking a lot about velvet and knit and texture, trying to do longer (and warmer!) skirts than my usual pencil skirt without looking girlish or dowdy... and trying not to splurge on every coat known to man (four wool coats and a cape isn't too-too much, right?)

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:I have moved to different climates many times. My recommendation would to not purge or change anything until your move is complete. The reason is, you definitely get climatized, where what would consider "warm" in the winter to you now will feel chilly enough to wear heavyweight items you hadn't expected would work once you are climatized. A lot of items that you think will/won't work end up being the opposite, etc. You mentioned having less storage, so it sounds like you will need to offload/purge at some point, but I'd wait to do it once you get there and put it off for as long as you can to truly see what items work. I'll never move to a cold climate again but even moving to different warmer climates, I will wait to do any paring down/purging until I can get a little climatized and adapt.

text:yea, Im pretty sad they are so long.

As someone that's 5'5 I didnt expect a regular length to be to long. Im not sure if I want to pay the 8 dollar return fee again though to go for the crops since I'm having a hard time getting past other fit issues  I might try the rebel pants instead as its stated they are meant for curvier types. I do not like the fitted look though, I prefer the straight leg, I just think they bunch because they are to long	labels:Eh I think that it’s great piece for fall/winter bc you can wear big sweaters to hide the other fit issues. By the time summer comes, you definitely won’t be wearing them. But if it’s only $8 for something you might like better and actually wear, then I would bite the bullet. Better than these sitting in your closet and never wearing them, or taking a loss and selling them.	episode_done:True

I don’t buy into trends now. I know I won’t wear a color that isn’t navy so I don’t bother buying it. No velvet. No shorts. Etc etc. I just have less time for navel gazing and bullshit. Maybe because I’m a nurse in a pandemic who is also in perpetual grad school. Or maybe because I finally have money now to buy what I really want? Either way. No real advice but just a question to think about what you actually want to wear for who you are today.

text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:I’m going to go one further and say weight also has to do with it. Picture Bella Hadid in mom jeans, dad sneakers, and a tucked-in vintage t-shirt. Trendy and casual, right? Now picture someone like Sandi Toksvig from GBBO, who is 62 and more sturdily built, wearing the same trendy, casual outfit. One of them is going to get called “so stylish” and the other one may be criticized as “frumpy” or “did she even try” or “Walmart fashion.” There’s that quote about how some fashion influencers aren’t stylish, they’re just thin... and I think that saying should also include that they’re young. The more you deviate from the social “ideal,” whether that’s age, weight, or anything else, the less favorably some people will look at whatever you do because of their ageist, fatphobic, etc biases. There are definitely other factors this applies to, such as race, socioeconomic class, having “bad” teeth, and many more, but I’ve already written a novel here and I feel like you guys get the picture.

text:> I do find them all being lumped into the same spaces very frustrating as someone who does love fashion as a form of art and creativity.  >I feel like it’s definitely dominated by the “people who wear clothes” group and unfortunately it limits the amount of critique that is acceptable to give.   I agree, I think this sub is made up of people who enjoy looking at clothes or just want to know how to dress appropriately for work & school. There's a few subjects *related* to the industry as a whole that people are passionate about, like sustainability & ethics, but I don't think this sub is able to appreciate fashion as a form of art.   I agree that a *you do you* isn't very helpful. If someone specifically asks for constructive criticism, they want feedback from people with an eye for detail. If it looks like their blazer or pants need to be tailored a bit, then let them know if they're seeking constructive criticism.	labels:	episode_done:True

Consequently, a woman who is utterly stupid will always find it extremely difficult to become truly elegant.”

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.

As i said initially, i took your question at face value. It seems as though you simply wanted to comment on the ethics of leather as a lifestyle choice rather than a necessity, which, while totally valid, could have been phrased differently to further the discussion in this thread re: faux leather or real leather.	episode_done:True

text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:I think you can still look fashionable while ignoring heels etc.   I agree with you on heels, and my foot shape finds them quite uncomfortable, so unless they’re a platform or quite chunky (like with most booties), I just don’t do them.   Now, I personally love high waist (the higher the better, gimme that steve urkle shit 😂) but lower waist, softer fabrics, or even high quality leggings (like faux leather styles) will look much nicer than sweats.   Well-fitting basic t’s look great. They just need to fit properly across your shoulders and chest. Plenty of flat shoes exist that look nice. Vans, leather or leather-ish ballet flats, nice sneakers (e.g. New Balance or similar) with a well-tailored outfit.  Honestly a lot of it comes down to the fit of clothing, the FABRICS (I mean, put on anything pilled and it looks 🥴 immediately), and other styling elements like hair. Hair thrown into a ratty bun with sweats and uggs? Yeah I look sloppy. Straightened hair with joggers and vans? Now I look stylish! Ha.  ETA: that unfortunately body type also comes into play here. There have been quite a few posts detailing how basics look “timeless” and “stylish” on thin frames, and sloppy or unstylish on larger bodies. I thought I would throw this in there just in case, although I think most of my comments still apply regardless of body size!

text:Inspo Album: Vintage Wool Sweaters Need Good, Loving Homes	labels:As a born and raised Norwegian, now living in the UK, my love for wool jumpers is endless and my sadness is twofold. 1) I might be Norwegian, but I've also got extremely sensitive skin. Thus my heart may be set on wool, but my skin is absolutely not, unless it's very fine cashmere or particular blends. 2) When autumn comes my immediate reaction is "WEAR ALL THE WOOL JUMPERS", and then I remember I live in the south of England and it doesn't actually get that cold here, plus it always rains.   Neither of those points are going to keep me from now spending several hours looking at vintage wool jumpers online though.

I have a selection of neckties from Drake's which I haven't had a chance to wear yet but they have a nice heft and they feel lovely. I also have a purple 70% cashmere 30% silk scarf which is absolutely wonderful to wear.

When interviewing for my last position, I was instructed very plainly to NOT wear a tie.  Director doesn't want to see extremely formal interview attire.  If you wear a suit at all at my workplace, (when we actually went into the office), I would assume you are in sales or something that is customer facing.  Everyone else dresses extremely casually.  All that being said-buy a grey or navy pinstripe suit if you are not going to a funeral.	labels:> All that being said-buy a grey or navy pinstripe suit if you are not going to a funeral.  A pinstripe suit says to me you're either trying to be Mad Men, or you're an East Coast rich kid; even among suit occasions they're *extremely* rare in my experience in California (and also in movies, tv, etc) so I would definitely not recommend that as a general rule.
text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:The present always feels “neutral”.

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:Hi! As a stylist I get this question ALOT. For starters don't get rid of too much before buying replacements. What ends up happening is we get rid of everything without establishing what pieces we actually need.   Start with establishing your personal style. What do your want your closet/style to be? What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping! Now that you have a moodboard and list of things you need you can shop to fin in the gaps and more importantly you can shop with intention!   &#x200B;  I hope that wasn't too much and was helpful haha. I'm always happy to help.
text:How to find non-custom tailored clothing for short men (under 5')	labels:This is a huge issue I haven't been able to solve as a short man who isn't skinny and has large hips. Boy's clothes are just too small, even in "hefty" sizes. Hefty sizes that are big enough are often too long regardless.

So, I’m looking to find out the men’s equivalent to yoga pants... that is, active wear that I can chase after the kiddo, and/or run to the store and not look like a total schlub... and maybe get my ass checked out periodically, lol.  If it helps, most weekends, I’m in jeans and a button down, maybe hiking pants and a technical shirt.  Thanks!

text:When did skinny jeans go out of fashion?	labels:Women in fashion have stated that skinny jeans have been out for years now.

text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:I need to stop shopping - full-stop. I did way too much "fill the hole in your soul with stuff" this year, for obvious reasons, but I feel overburdened with the amount of clothing in my life now and I need to make a conscious effort to pare things down. If I run into a genuine need, I'll continue checking secondhand options first before buying new. I'll also continue logging outfits daily with Stylebook, because it helps me be honest with myself about what is and isn't getting worn in my closet (both for getting-rid-of purposes AND for informing-future-purchases purposes), *and* it'll help me focus in on what I gravitate toward in my day-to-day life rather than continually shopping for some nebulously just-out-of-reach fantasy self.   Summed up:  * Buy less, buy secondhand, buy practical, buy for TODAY (not a dream and a half from now), and buy only what is genuinely needed (very likely *nothing* for quite a while).  * Continue evaluating what I really need in my life, and how much, and adjust accordingly as time goes on with the goal of seriously paring down my closet to a manageable size.

I also wrote out which physical attributes I want to highlight (and which ones I didn't), as well as listed wardrobe things I wanted and outlined a shopping strategy.

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.

Are you a student, or professional? do you go to a lot of fancy restaurants and the like in your free time (pre-covid obv), or are you more outdoorsy? This may seem kind of obvious but you'd be shocked at how many people don't think about these things when they dress, and your lifestyle is really important for creating outfits that you not only like, but will wear often! Pinterest is great but it can also be a little unrealistic sometimes. After you consider practicality its much easier to put together outfits and find things you like that match the occasion. Also, congrats on getting out of your parents' house, and good luck with the search!! you'll do great :)	episode_done:True
text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:Why would it be tonedeaf? This is kind of a U.S.-centric view. Not everyone in the world is still struggling with COVID, and a lot of the rest of the world isn't nearly as casual as America is, fashion-wise.   Call me crazy, but I'm tired of shapeless billowy clothing in earth tones, and I am READY for some structure and interesting textures. All summer has been about beige and washed out green and brown linen, let's see something else.   Plus, it's a weird take anyway, because high fashion doesn't really target loungewear, either way. Do we really expect major fashion houses to all abandon blazers and leather pants and start showing PJs and sweatpants on the runway?   Others have already pointed out that these collections have been designed months in advance, but consider another point - fashion has always been reactive. When forced to stay inside and only wear sweatpants for 6 months, people will rebel and start daydreaming and longing for the opposite. This pandemic was always going to inspire a sort of glam rock aesthetic, imo. BRING IT.

I have often thought it would be cool to be mixed with potting soil or grass food so my nutrients can help sustain new life.  But please, stop believing that funerals are for paying respects for the deceased, at best they are to help the living say goodbye and gain closure, but in the 18 or so I have attended in my life, they were mostly for people to compare how terrible this is for them in some gigantic, disgusting pissing contest of grief and in general, I consider them a waste of money, more so than a wedding.  I remember the joy my mom gained from my brother's funeral, when it was so expensive for the most basic services that she had to make payments on that funeral for 5 fucking years.

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I do not like black opaque tights very often. I love a patterned sheer-ish tight - with polka dots or some other thing. A loose enough pattern that hints at your skin below.. I have also had grey sheer pattern tights and other shades, but I a dark skinned black woman, so I have some different color constraints. I generally prefer darker tights over paler ones since I am darker.   As for ankle boot height? I prefer right around the ankle, or even something that has more of a profile of a shoe. I am not a big sock wearer, but if I do want ones to be visible, the need to be an interesting pair,   I'd pick colors that mimic your skin tone or pickup a shade in the dress/skirt you are wearing. I also do not love big contrast between the sock and the tight. But it depends, if the tight matches the dress/skirt - then contrast in the shoe is fine. But otherwise I like the shoe and tight to be closer together.	episode_done:True
text:Schott 538 Nubuck Cowhide Mechanic Jacket	labels:Schott jackets are designed for old white people. You can get this style in a more flattering cut from Aero for around the same price.

text:/u/pieface777 is right, and there's also eBay.  That said, trad is the dress style of the American old-money elite. The ethos is to buy well and then wear it into the ground, so there's a thriftiness there, but it's not one based on seasonal fast fashion. It's more based on buying a good pair of shoes and then taking care of them, having them resoled when necessary. It's buying a great Shetland sweater but then having it darned, or patched with leather, as it wears out (or just wearing it with holes).  Back during the #menswear days of 10 years ago there was a kind of fetishization of that sort of thing. I think people by and large are aware now that it still takes money to have this sort of relationship to your clothes. I also think there are a lot of 3/2 sack blue blazers and repp ties that are not getting quite as much wear as people might have expected when they bombed out big bucks for them, because the style isn't as in fashion anymore. Thus, more opportunities for the rest of us on eBay.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:These are all valid points and I appreciate your perspective on this. I totally value the integrity of top designers of HC labels as well. There are some incredible designs from YSL and Gucci that I would splurge on, even if the fit wasn't 100% what I wanted it to be.  The reality is though, that there are several body structures and only 1 final product, which doesn't capture all of those body builds, and that's the struggle with HC.  I genuinely think it's only a matter of time before traditional bespoke tailors move into goods that are more commonplace - t-shirts, sweaters, etc. - and most of these designers are quite good at their respective crafts.  I've interviewed many of these emerging designers/tailors myself, specifically Mike Paul, who is based in Toronto. He is moving into bespoke tailoring across multiple verticals. His story is pretty cool too. If anyone wants to hear it, DM me and I'll throw the link to the pod episode.  There's also another designer in Toronto that does bespoke jeans.  So, there are definitely designers who have identified the need in the market.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:As I wait to hear if I have to evacuate due to CA wildfires, here’s a hypothetical I had to do: you have time to prepare before your evacuation and pack up your car.

So random.	episode_done:True
text:I've tried that but feel like the outfits are too much for a casual stop at the grocery store. Any tips on that?	labels:Part of it is accepting that it's okay to dress up for the everyday. You do everyday stuff every day so why would you exclude those things from opportunities to feel like your best self?   Now is, I think, a perfect time to play around with atypical/"special"/non-casual pieces in every day wear. There's been a great blurring of lines between occaisions and I'm seeing lots of real business wear matched with casual items, like pencil skirts with chuck taylors or dress pants and denim jackets. Ultimately, it is the full package more so than indivdiual pieces that make an outfit appropriate for a situation. That isn't to say that there aren't specific items that are inherently inappropriate for some settings, but that at least some of the partitions we've placed between items of clothing are unnecessary and arbitrary, and they prevent creative engagement with your closet.	episode_done:True

text:That's funny, I have also read an absurd amount of litterate on MM, and I have the exact opposite thoughts of her. I think she was a very smart business woman, who knew how to play the game - I don't think being sweet and naive would carry you to the top in 1950's Hollywood. Especially not when she started off as an orphan with nothing to her name.    That being said, I don't think being conniving when you work in the entertainment industry, is evil or anything. I think it's really hard (actually impossible) to project an image as consistently as she did, without being incredibly self aware. She could have internalized misogyny, but she could have also played the "cool girl" in order to win approval.	labels:She definitely knew how to play the game and did it pretty well for a while.	episode_done:True
text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:Honestly lululemon. Find a pair that fit you well and with all the features you want and you’ll never turn back. Leg pockets and waist drawstring for me.
text:I have found people overwhelmingly wear clothes a size too small (like speaking to friends and whatnot). My sister, for example, buys the same size leggings as I do despite her hips and waist being 5-6 inches larger than mine, and then complains about them being see through. I have strong suspicions that this is the reason people find thongs horrifically uncomfortable as well.	labels:I have slim hips but a wider waist, so I have to pick a smaller size for mid-waist then for high-waisted. Slimmer hips also comes with a bit of belly pouch, even at size 6-8.  Most bottoms are cut for wider, but flatter hips then my round ones, so sizing pants up rarely works if it get's larger in the wrong places.  Tight, high-waisted jeans doesn't work at all for me, since they try to force my lower torso into another shape, and usually leads to stomach ache.	episode_done:True
text:What are your 2021 Fashion / Style Goals?	labels:I'm going on a super low buy for 2021.  There's a chance that I have to move at the end of the year so I want to pair down my stuff (less boxes to pack).  I'm allowed one item per month in the following categories (with exceptions carved out).  This is one item PERIOD, not one shirt and one lipstick.  I can either get the shirt or the lipstick.  Makeup, clothing (including bras, underwear, and socks), accessories, shoes (can replace only worn out athletic shoes), tech including headphones/charging cables (can replace my laptop or phone should they die), books, craft supplies (unless I get a custom Etsy order and need something for it), stationary/office supplies (I can only buy a 2022 planner).    I'm really trying to fast-track the "financial goals' portion of my budget and I'm hoping this low-buy shifts my habits and diverts money from "wants" to financial goals.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:Honestly, I think if an item brings you joy, fits your budget, and you’re sure you’ve got things to wear it with then it’s ‘worth’ whatever the price is.   I try to spend more on things I’m sure I’ll wear over and over. Like my fake leather jacket I’ve worn every cool day for eight years finally started cracking on me so I decided to throw down the money on a good real leather replacement that will last me a long time. Same thing if I wear through a favorite pair of jeans or have a specific style of top I know I love wearing. Those things are worth the extra cash.   But for a trendy thing I just want to experiment with? I see no harm in tossing out $20 on it, seeing just how often I wear it and then buying a higher quality version later if it starts to wear out. I try to limit these purchases so I’m not wasting money on a closet full of trendy stuff I never end up wearing but I still spend $20-$30 on a new “it” item to feel like my wardrobe is getting refreshed each season.   Tl;dr life is short, value is subjective. If that cheap forever 21 cardigan is calling your name then get it even if you know it’s not gonna last forever. So long as you actually wear it and enjoy it then it’s not money wasted.

Prior to that I was in a job where I had to wear skirts, I wore collared tees/shirts, jumpers and cardies with them.  That takes me back to 1981.  Before that, too long ago to remember but certainly not "business wear", and before that when at uni/college/school, I guess the then equivalent of what I wear today.  Well school was uniform, I meant time not in school.	episode_done:True

text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:I think start by looking at pictures online on Pinterest or Instagram of styles you find aesthetically pleasing and create a little dashboard with outfits that catch your eye. You can also think about some of your favourite actors or singers that wear outfits you like and try to save the pictures you find. After that i would go window-shopping online on websites that fit your budget and look around trying to find pieces similar to any outfits you saw. fyi; i would browse on a website first and then go to the actual store to try out what you saw online, it gives you an idea of what you’re looking for.  I think imitation is the easiest way to start finding your style. Once your comfortable in a type of style you can start experimenting with it and picking more personalized pieces. Good luck :)

text:General Discussion - December 28, 2020	labels:Really thick into quarantine and realized I don't really have anyone to talk about fashion with anymore. It's kind of a bummer being excited about clothes and not being able to talk about it. Makes me actually want to start posting pics on WAYWT.   Been slowly replacing my closet with a lot of Todd Snyder and don't know how to feel about it lol, always wanted a "cool designer" closet but from a cost and functionality stand point it's not very doable. Good staples just get more wear in my closet, got to pick up more stand out pieces so I don't feel boring!
text:You raise good points, but I’m going to respectfully disagree - I don’t think there’s ever any valid excuse to buy from a company who openly profits from exploitative third world labour. We can all do better.   Sustainable fashion is expensive, yes. But *usually* buying quality clothing is cheaper in the long run than buying lots of cheap stuff (I know this is easier said than done for people living hand to mouth).   Secondly there are options that don’t exploit people. Namely second hand shops and Depop. I guarantee - no matter what the item is - someone’s already bought it or something VERY similar and wants to get rid of it. Even when I have money I buy from there because... why wouldn’t you?   The “what about poor people” argument always gets made but it just doesn’t sit right with me. What about the people who are being paid 40p a day in sweltering and unsafe Bangladeshi factories? Factories that are dumping toxic dyes into water sources? We all have a responsibility not to perpetuate the monolithic success of these horrible fast fashion conglomerates.	labels:Regarding the poor people argument, what finally resonated with me is that looking at the profits for these fast fashion empires like shein is that poor people simply do not have the purchasing power to be responsible for those types of profits. Fast fashion businesses are profitable because, overwhelmingly, not poor people buy from them, and they buy a lot of items from them. I first heard the argument from a fashion activist called Aja Barber and it really got through to me that my support of fast fashion was a choice even at the times in my life where I struggled financially. Poor people are not responsible for fast fashion even when they buy it. Aja has a fantastic Instagram and Twitter if you are interested in the topic!
text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:For the longest time (like 15 years), I hated all animal prints. I found them tacky, loud, cheap...the same connotations you had, basically. They had their moments in fashion now and then, but even when they were in fashion, I never came around to them. I think it may also partly be because someone I know growing up had a LOT of animal print in their wardrobe and house, and I became sick of it at a young age. Hatred of animal print was the one aesthetic feeling that stayed consistently with me for *years.* I was very accepting of most trends, but this is the one I could never bring myself to like – so I eventually shrugged and accepted the fact that I would always despise it.   AND THEN?????????? randomly a year ago, I suddenly found myself really liking leopard print, snakeskin, and croc skin (in small doses; I don't think I'll ever enjoy it on large pieces). They had come back into fashion, but unlike the previous times they'd cycled into fashion, this time I was suddenly feeling them? I really can't pinpoint why. It just happened. Maybe I saw some really cute outfits and ways to style it that I'd never really considered before. But either way, I bought pointy-toed leopard print pumps (with a really stunning dark golden velvet base!), leopard print slip-ons, croc skin slides, snakeskin sandals, and a snakeskin bucket bag. I thought these specific animal prints suddenly looked really cute as accessories!   So now I'm basically a-ok with leopard print, snakeskin, and croc skin. But I still really dislike zebra print for some strange reason. Not sure why this one still irritates me, and who knows, maybe one day I'll come to like this one too! But for now, zebra is a nope. And tiger print is horrendous and cheap to me.	episode_done:True

text:Why Ralph Lauren Never Goes Out of Style	labels:My first job was for RL and I actually just quit as an HR manager there this summer to start my own company. RL will always hold a special place in my heart, at the top they really are a good company. There’s some corporate shenanigans on the district levels and below but nobody’s perfect. Ralph pumps out a lot of pieces and some of it really is ass but those special pieces are *special*. RRL and Purple can’t be beat. Going forward I’d start to stray away from outlets as more and more items are being made specifically for outlets instead of strictly just being the previous season’s items as it used to be :/	episode_done:True

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items are my Native American Turquoise jewelry and my cowboy boots. Just purchased a huge $900 squash blossom necklace and have worn it constantly. My boots range from $30 for a secondhand pair to $750 for custom made and none are worn more or less than the others.  When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was “saving for good”. Ironically, “good” apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I’m just out running errands.
text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:I follow the IG feed Parisians in Paris (@parisiensinparis) and it’s given me more courage to wear hats when I’m out. The people on there are cool and practical, which is honestly the goal, right?  I just bought a black corduroy engineers cap at Anthro yesterday and I loved it so much I wore it the rest of my shopping trip. It felt appropriate with the outerwear I was wearing, and kept me warm and dry in miserable weather.

Just do your research on items to make sure you’re not getting scammed	episode_done:True
text:Great story and valuable insight! Thanks for sharing.  While working with youe stylist, when you decided on color and styles, what criteria did you use?

text:Handbag conundrum: lesser know (and lesser seen all over the place) or standard luxury designer bags (think the usual Gucci, YSL, LV, etc.)	labels:Definitely buy what makes you happy. The fact that you have looked at the high end, well known brands and came away disappointed indicates that (this season at least), they aren't for you.   To answer your question directly: for me, personally, showing my own style is 1000% more important than showing the status of a luxury brand. Do the two sometimes overlap? Yes, and that's fine. But I don't personally get buying something *just* because it is a certain brand. Who are you trying to impress? What are you conveying with that logo (wow, you're well off? What kind of message is that, on its own?) I just feel like people who are super into labels, not the design or the style or anything else, just come across as kind of immature? The truth is, anyone worth spending much time with isn't overly concerned with what logo your bag has. (Now! I will concede there is a difference between showing off luxury brands and having higher end items, in some circles. Like, there could be some tension if you're hanging out with super millionaire socialites and everything you wear is from TJ Maxx...but in that case, I'd still say its important to focus on personal style first. And knowing about smaller higher end designers, rather than designers you can buy at a mall, is a whole different thing too...)
text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I used to wear small diamond earrings every day, and would put them in my wallet when I went to the gym after work. I got to work the next day and realized I forgot to put them back in after the gym, so I opened up my wallet and they were gone. I had made my usual morning stop for breakfast on the way to work, so I rushed to the food cart and looked all over the sidewalk but I couldn’t find them.  At least 1-2 weeks later I went to the same food cart for breakfast, looked down, and saw one diamond earring in the crack in the sidewalk. I looked more closely and there was the other one! The metal was chewed up (they were bezel set) so I had to get them repaired, but it was a lot cheaper than a new pair!   Definitely my #1 fashion (jewelry?) miracle.

Or buy one or two shirts with a classic wool jacket and that's enough.  Recently, I found a new brand True Classic and ordered 2 hoodies. They are really very comfortable and I'm looking forward to winter to wear them.	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:Not white, not red and depending on area, not black. White and red are the bride's colors (culturally dependent). If the bride wears white, red can be considered attention grabbing. If the bride wears red, her culture probably views white as a mourning color. Black can be seen as an objection to the wedding and mourning - very regional.   Something conservative enough for church weddings. Knee length, covers shoulders? Shoulder covering can be fixed with a cardigan.   Something light for a hot outdoor wedding.   In my area, most weddings are cocktail or semi formal aka short dresses are fine. Formal would imply floor length gown, so if the store has a good one, that you like, and you think someone seems more likely to go full formal, that might be a good call.   If you have seasons, then one for each season. Think about the weather in your general area. How cold or hot does it get?

text:Upper midwest here - after the polar vortex, I don't fuck around. I bought a mid-calf length down coat and smugly swan about in it looking like the Michelin Man and feeling no windchill.	labels:I feel that. I went to Canada during a cold winter and have been living my best life with Canadian winter fashion (a fancy long coat and big hat and unapologetically winterized boots) since then. I live right on the US-Canada border. We have the same weather but fashion is marketed so differently...I think it’s bc Americans in this climate are experiencing the coldest weather in the country, but the Canadians in the next town over just past the border have the warmest weather in their country. The means catered to by the markets are totally different.  Since then I’ve been waaaayyyyy happier, all snug as a bug in my big coat while my neighbors wear the standard low profile down parkas found in stores here and complain they’re still freezing.	episode_done:True
text:That's actually really helpful! How do you suggest finding my style? I feel like I have such a wide style that I wear (minimal, to punk, to cutesy, etc). I feel like I love all of my clothes but some go months without being worn.	labels:No I totally get that! A great way to start would be to hop on Pinterest and create a board of everything that speaks to you. Type in feminine type in punk etc.   It’s not terrible to not wear things for months but you mentioned wanting to create more of a capsule minimal wardrobe. So that’s something you should decide now to help you going forward.	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: Ghost Outfit	labels:Humiliation in life. Humiliation in death.  I've died wearing the too-large, white-but-actually-gray-at-this-point, ratty bathrobe given to me by my ex over a decade ago. I haven't had a haircut in almost 2 years and I'm not even wearing socks.   The worst part is that I spilled coffee on myself, so now I have a coffee stain on my chest for all of eternity.  I think it's safe to assume that I died from falling down the stairs or some shit after spilling coffee all over myself. I'm going to haunt the path outside my house because when the wind blows really hard, it actually howls down the path and it's spooky AF. I think I need all the help I can get, give the whole bathrobe situation. Though my coffee stain MIGHT pass for blood, so that's cool.  People aren't creative at all, so I'm probably going to get called something stupid like Bathrobe Witch. Or like, The Ghost of... Well I'm not actually going to put the name of the path because I don't want someone to find out where I live and make me actually dead.

text:Matching shoes & purse	labels:I don’t think fashion has any rules anymore unless you’re royalty or it’s cultural.   I personally don’t like matchy matchy bag and shoes unless I’m going for a monochrome look. I tend to match tones rather than colours. I like a patterned bag (say Gucci dionysus or Fendi zucca or LV canvas) as opposed to patterned clothes because I find they blend in well with a variety of outfit choices.   If I do colour, I will make sure the tone matches. I can’t stand mixing warm times with cool tones. Eg I have a cool tone lilac paid of heels that I love wearing with my cool tone magenta bag.   You can also do opposite sides of the colour wheel with shoes and bags like a green bag and a purple/magenta pair of shoes. But again keep to the same tones. The key with fashion is the tone of colours, and that includes neutral colours too. I would always suggest everyone does a colour/tone analysis and then stick to buying items in that range. It makes mixing and matching easier.
text:Work From Home Outfits I Should Wear More Often	labels:My work as a freelancer usually has me dress pretty casually. However, this year I’ve actually taken to dressing up more for work.

text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.

Kenneth Cole 100% wool, new. $110  I put the prices on here but I’m not concerned with paying an extra 60-70 bucks as this is something I plan on using for years.  All should fit me based on the measurements, but no returns on the vintage, the other two can be returned.  Which one will feel the best/be highest quality?  Thanks

text:Athleisure button down shirts	labels:I've had good experience with Twillory shirts.  Good stretch and it travels really well.  I find that it may wrinkle a little but if you spray with a water bottle and let dry it'll come out.  My biggest complaint is that I'm normally a 14.5 / 32 with a 38 chest and 31 waist, and i think i'm in between sizes so mine are a little oversized at 15 and 32/33 (since they don't make a one number sleeve length) rather than my buttons popping off.    I haven't brought myself to buy any of the others since they are 40% more at best and if you buy 2 or more you can get the same as the others but a 2 for 1.  I've tried on mizzen and main but they are just way too big for me even at their small / trim size.  You could find those on nordstrom earlier this year for less than $100.	episode_done:True

The solution is obvious: Day of the Week Underwear!  This will ensure that not only do I always know what day of the week it is, but I'll also go back to changing my underwear daily.   I also have resolved to only thrift my clothing, so I bought a used pack of day of the week underwear on ebay. It's missing Wednesday, but Wednesday is the worst day of the week anyway, so I'm just going to skip Wednesdays and go straight to Thursdays. Then, every two months, I'll have a leap week, where I don't wear any underwear at all, so that I can "reset" to the proper days of the week.   A flawless plan!

text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I went out on the thinnest limb of hope for Romwe after seeing ads on insta. I saw the cutest blouse and had to have it. Then I went online and was shocked to see the prices and may or may not have gone a little crazy and bought a handful or so pieces. Only until after did I do research and find multiple negative reviews.  Most of the items that arrived were not good quality. But some were acceptable so I kept them. The sandals lasted a little over a year. The blouses I still have and wear. They haven't decreased in quality. Of course, I also take care of them when I wash them. So, it's hit or miss.  But, honestly, I wouldn't purchase from there again. The anxiety that I can't be certain I'm getting what I'm expecting isn't worth it. And the thought that I might've been lucky this time but next time might never receive my order like others.  Rookie shopper move, for sure. I should've known it was good to be true. And, at least for 5 pieces I kept, it has worked out. But if a company cannot guarantee that their products are of an acceptable quality, you have better luck at target, from which I have a few items that are of way better quality. Also, forever 21.  The clothes do last (I know fast fashion is horrible but if you're on a tight budget, you can find pieces that'll last so you're not buying often). I haven't tossed out a single piece and I've owned them for years.	episode_done:True

Maybe I've just seen enough of this battle for now. Like I said, with /u/Rariora, I like the long coat over interesting pants, but I think it came out better last time. And I'm not in love with the black-forward color scheme here. Plasma's look is also more tame than usual, no crazy colors, but the first background was... cheating, really. The long cardigan worked. And is that all color 8? And the scarf being worn asymmetrically like that is a plus for me. Tame, overall, but... really solid.  \--> /u/ngoknows <-- v. /u/chunsak \-- I'd say NGO ahs the most interesting fit here, for me, with the big, fun, scarf. I like the asymmetry in the first photo... Really solid fit. Oh, and I love the detail shot! Chunsak... Also solid, but doesn't stir anyting up in me, personally. I can see how cord, flannel and donegal in this combination might excite some of you, but for me... eh.  Overall... I expect something crazier next round. Don't pull any punches for the finals.

text:“I'm all locked down with nowhere to go – but that hasn't killed my lust for fashion”	labels:The past 10 months I've only been going outside of my lil apartment for my daily dog walks, and I think it's really helped me find my style that is 100% for me, and 0% what other people will think about what I'm wearing. I've essentially created a small capsule wardrobe of all new clothes in the past year that I love and I'm so excited to pick out my outfits every day. The few blocks around my place have become my runway, and I have come to love the passing comments from the fellow dog walking neighbors about how they feel underdressed when they see me!	episode_done:True
text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:I work on political campaigns for a living, and part of putting together event briefings for candidates is deciphering the dress code and putting in plain English what they should wear.  Neither of these were my candidates, but I have seen two candidates overdressed for the event-- one man and one woman (of opposing parties).  This particular event was a beach cleanup sponsored by an environmental group.  Volunteers were gathered to literally pick up trash from the beach.   If anything, the accessory of the day was cleaning gloves.  The male candidate wore a designer suit and newly shined dress shoes.  The female candidate wore a skirt suit (think Sarah Palin) with 4 inch stilettos.    This event was back in 2011.  When I put together what a candidate should wear to an event, I think of these two candidates dressed to the nines to pick up garbage from the beach.   This is NOT an image you want to convey to voters.
text:For the parents of girls	labels:As a daughter. My mom and I went shopping together. And we figured what would be appropriate for my age that we were both happy with. And then i would dress myself. My mom always says that i came up with some crazy choices. But it is part of your development. You figure out who you are through clothes.
text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:Love hearing about your UGG transformation!  While I have purchased probably my normal amount of items during Rona, I've been resisting the impulse to shop more often and have been pretty successful in seeking and finding those boosts from my existing closet.  I've been challenging myself to approach fashion as a **verb**, not just something that I buy.  Weirdly, when I did a pretty major closet clean out during quarantine, I ended up feeling like I owned \*more\* afterward.    Not nearly as dramatic a transformation as your Uggs, but yesterday I took my ankle boots to be resoled and a belt to be repaired.  Afterward I was like, dang, these are some sharp boots.  Focusing on decent quality within the context of my budget and taking care of my stuff has made me more thankful for the awesome stuff I own, and really how much I have.  I've done a lot of shopping my closet and making new fits out of existing items.  I've found myself feeling more of a sense of abundance and creativity, while I have identified a few gaps and have shopped a bit to fill them, I often have a sense of "I can't wait to wear all these great fits I created!"  \[while working from home as my son rolls his eyes at mom, lol\]  Which feels indulgent, fun, and gives me a boost without shopping.  Like you I also enjoy variety - I can't be a minimalist all the time, sometimes I want big colors, bold patterns, different looks.  Even so I'm finding I'm pretty happy with the mix of colors / patterns / neutrals that I own; my accessories go a long way, and I'm finding myself able to creatively achieve a lot of variety.  I won't pretend I never have the impulse to shop, I research a lot and I do resist that on a regular basis.  But I'm happy to report that I'm having a lot of fun with what I own already.	episode_done:True
text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:Yes free the titties! If that’s what you want to do. I hate this idea that the ideal boob shape is something that just isn’t natural for most women. Or that there is some supposed “ideal shape”. I’m currently a 38DD. Who has boobs that size that naturally look like the shape formed by an underwire bra? Literally basically no one. I’m a human person. I have boobs. They don’t have to defy gravity. And I don’t have to wear some uncomfortable CONTRAPTION to fool the world into thinking they do. I fully support women who feel their best in an underwire bra. I just don’t think we have some societal obligation to optimize our boob shapes. I like to look good and feel good in the clothes that I wear, but I’m not going to sacrifice my comfort.	episode_done:True

Cole Buxton T-Shirt - Simple staple for the wardrobe, quality is impressive. Cotton has a heavyweight feel.   Roger & Gallet L’Homme Menthe - Recently smelt this as a sample with an order from a beauty website. A nice clean masculine scent. A nice stand in aftershave for everyday use.

text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I've been on a fashion sustainability journey for a while now - in 2019 I vowed to only buy recycled fibers - and did so until early 2020. Somewhere along the line, I realized that's really not the best thing, and went on a no-buy.  Then I discovered depop.   I was pretty restrained to begin with, then, driven by my love for variety that is quite similar to yours, went on a bit of a spree of buying all the things I've been holding back from for a few years. That said, I probably only purchased 10-15 items in total, and out of those, only one has turned out to be a dud (slightly too small, will sell on), so I'm pretty pleased.  I also naturally tend to buy things that will fit with the rest of my closet, so I never had much of an issue there. It was a little difficult when I decided to transition from a very professional to a more "me" wardrobe, but I did it over time, and now I'm quite happy with how it's gone.   The thing I did recently is branch out into accessories - and I've been getting either second-hand/vintage, or unique handmade items from artisans. That's been a whole lot of fun, and I feel like I'm supporting the right people.  I don't have that many restoration tips, but I've learned some decent care tips over time. My favourite one at the moment concerns white shoes (sue me, I'm a sucker for them) - wipe them down every time you wear them and they likely won't require a huge clean at any point! Depending on where you go, of course. I also like to air out my clothing before I decide they absolutely need a wash, especially blazers. If you're persistent enough, most smells will dissipate over time. Just don't put anything in direct sunlight, colours might get washed out!	episode_done:True
text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.

text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I think the biggest miracle was when my favorite summer top (a black tight crop top with lots of straps in the back) came back in stock. It was on sale (it was too expensive for me to get at full-price) and was sold out before I got my hands on it. I checked the site over and over if it was back. One lucky day, I was in the cafeteria with my friends and eating lunch, I decided to check it again. And it was back, only one piece, and in my size! You can guess how fast I clicked the order button.  My second best miracle was finding black Dr. Martens at TK Maxx for only 50€ (they sell for about 200€ usually). They've been my fall and winter staple ever since.	episode_done:True
text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:Whoa... I am an adult woman with ADHD and I never thought about this somehow. I have MAJOR issues with restrictive clothing. Winter coats feel like a straitjacket, turtlenecks \*literally\* made me vomit when I was younger, and anything that's even slightly itchy or makes a weird noise (like a swishy windbreaker) drives me insane. I can't wear bracelets or watches because the sound of them clicking on my desk grates against my soul.  I usually live in American Eagle jeggings (soft joggers as soon as I get home), comfortable shirts, soft and loose sweaters/cardigans, comfortable ankle boots/Converse, and sometimes a well-fitting skirt with tights.  Interestingly, I have no issue with wearing tights, which I know a lot of women find uncomfortable. I don't mind wearing a bra, either.
text:General Discussion - January 04, 2021	labels:I’ve had terrible luck with dating since I left college and moved to a new city a few hours away.

text:How has your style grown/changed since before quarantine?	labels:I used to have a very professional business casual + academic style pre covid (i'm a college student in a big city, for ref.). That means, a lot of low heels, blazers, suit-like pants, editorial look. Now, I'm actually dressing more my age as opposed to for a future career: oversize, bright & colorful pieces, interesting necklines and clashing prints. Honestly, it's been a big 180\` and I kinda love it tbh. What's more fun is on days when i feel like dressing up, I combine the two styles and look very ManRepeller circa 2018, or Kdrama fashion. It's amazing!
text:What’s your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:I'm waiting until we get to the part of the baggy jeans trend when people learn about the ripped, soggy backs of their pant legs that come from the jeans dragging on the ground.

text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:Congratulations on the healthy transition.   First, don’t buy a new wardrobe all at once. Have fun buying a shirt or pair of pants in your new sizes but your body might still be changing shape and your taste and confidence in clothing with it. Vintage is a good way to go if this is your first time really branching out into fashion.  Second, don’t overcorrect for slim fits. Mercifully the super skinny fits trend is over and I wouldn’t be too self-conscious about not having muscles. I’m tall and slim, but a too-right shirt can still look like a sausage casing.

Still own them and my most comfortable high heel. It was relatively conservative looking too so I can wear it with lots of things. The other time was a long knit circle skirt at Winners. It wasn’t the right size but I might have been able to squeeze into it since it’s a knit but someone bought it while I thought it over. Fast forward 6 weeks and I found one in my size on clearance for 60% off. I don’t think I snatched something that fast before...

text:Dress shoes EEE trouble	labels:I can relate with you quite a lot because I too must wear eee shoes and have searched for brands that fit my desired style choices and budget. Alas, my recommendations are likely not to be too budget friendly; my favorite company is Alden and my second choice is Allen Edmonds. Both are made in America brands (with AE having some exceptions) and offer a great array of width options ranging from A to EEE.  I have worn AE for nearly three years now with my favorite last being the 201 and the 1757, both of which offer more generous toe boxes and insteps: However, my favorite shoe of all time is the Alden 405 (and the 403) because the last perfectly contours to my natural foot shape. This detail is essential because my right foot is slightly but noticeably wider than my left foot. Of course, none of these suggestions are cheap.   After I graduated from university three years ago I went to my local AE store and was properly fitted. I then searched on Ebay for a proper fit and found a decent pair of AE shoes in my size hoping to buy a new shoe later on to make sure the AE salesperson's great customer service did not go unthanked ( eventually I bought my Dalton boots from her). Then last year, I stumbled upon Shoe Mart's Alden Seconds program, reached out to their customer service team to figure out what my Alden Tru balance size. Soon after, I purchased the Alden 405 and instantly fell in love with it. The arch support is great, the ankle support is superb, and most importantly, the toe box fit like a rugged glove.  I hope my personal experience is of some help. Just keep in mind that buying used is not a bad thing if you put in the effort to properly clean and sterilize each purchase until you save enough to buy a new pair.	episode_done:True

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I have similar connotations as you about them being kind of cheap or tacky looking, but would add one other angle to it. While I'm 100% against the use of real fur/exotic hides, I think part of the cheapness animal prints comes from taking something that in its natural state exists on fur and copy-pasting it onto all different kinds of fabrics. Real cheetahs look beautiful and elegant. A poorly rendered cheetah print on thin polyester leggings just looks like a terrible imitation. There isn't this mental comparison going on with other patterns, like stripes or polka dots, because there's no "real" standard to compare to. They're just decorative patterns.  Even if you attempt to create a faux fur that more closely imitates a real animal hide, it's going to look cheap and fake (to me) unless it is really well done.

On a few technical levels they're closely matched although I feel Norwegian Rain has the slight upper hand, but very different style. Appreciating the Arc'teryx brand very much btw, thanks for the shared info here!

text:I’m moving from California to Michigan. Best way to move my wardrobe?	labels:I moved across country. May be an unpopular opinion, but use the opportunity to clear out the wardrobe and free up some space. When I moved I sold off/donated probably half of my clothes and shoes. Otherwise, what I did:  \- Left everything that was in the dresser/drawers in there and moved them as one piece (even stuffed extra stuff in each drawer)  \- Space bags for all of my button downs (lots of ironing when I arrived)  \-  Anything that could tolerate it (like suits, wool coats, down jackets), I rolled, folded, etc and packed them into either space bags or just into boxes  \- Packed shoes into boxes as tight as possible (I don't keep the shoe boxes normally)  \- Anything of any high monetary or sentimental value (RMC leathers, a few of my favorite Vibergs/Aldens, etc) traveled with me in the car.

text:Why do you think there's such an aversion to luxury digital? Given the general love for techwear, you'd think this would be a space flush with opportunity. As much as I love the look of luxury, artisanal timepieces, some part of me is just disgusted by how we're solving the problem of telling time in the most Rube Goldberg way with all these mechanical movements that lose time so fast. It's 2020, and we should be able to have both precision and aesthetics.	labels:A few reasons, I think.   1.	Your typical watch person is attracted to that Rube Goldberg sort of idea. That and the fact that traditional dials are very attractive. I just love the look of a dive watch or chronograph, for instance. The fact that they have purposes beyond telling time is just cool. 2.	Artisanal Digital is hard to market. Apple has had the best luck so far, but no one wants to invest a ton of money into a digital piece only for its hardware to be outdated in 5 years. 3.	On the other end of digital, you have G Shock which is hard to beat for its price and ability to take anything you throw at it.   Just my thoughts.	episode_done:True

text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it’s typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it’s a bottom, they no longer “stay up”. This usually happens with leggings or panties after about 5 or more years of regular wear with caring for the items properly.  I also had a faux leather jacket wear out after 6 years of regular wear. The faux leather ended up “peeling off” or something like that.

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:Give shoes a day break between wearings.  A shoe repair guy said that even with socks, shoes absorb a lot of moisture from our feet. He suggested going  at least day on day off with shoes to give them time to dry and regain their shape. Otherwise he said they stay in that moist, malleable state and get out of shape more quickly.  Anecdotally I’ve seen a major difference in the lifespan of my shoes.
text:General Discussion - January 18, 2021	labels:I'm renting a car to drive home with my SO (about a 14 hour drive). I rented from Avis and it was a bit expensive, about $450 (I purchased extra insurance). When I went to check on the rental, it said that the insurance was now $3,500 a day instead of $35 a day, so the rental would be more like $7,000. I was able to cancel the extra insurance, but wtf? In no way should it be legal to charge 14X the estimated price. The worst part is, no customer service agent was able to tell me why the charge increased, and the option for extra insurance just popped up at $35 a day.
text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:Personally I try to avoid faux if possible. Real leather lasts longer, faux leather is just plastic and I find it cracks and/or scuffs usually within a couple years. Granted, I haven't bought any luxury faux leather so maybe that would last longer. Also on the sustainability side I feel like real leather is better (although I'm sure it depends on processing and where it comes from)

text:The wildest thing to me is that Madewell has really consistent sizing and I'm able to order online with confidence about what will fit. I have ordered a bunch of things and haven't needed to return or exchange a single one. By the end of last year, J. Crew was the most inconsistent sizing of any brand I think I've ever encountered. I could take 15 items of the same size into a dressing room and all 15 of them would fit like shit in totally different ways. It means online shopping is essentially unavailable to me - in this economy, no less. They've maintained those price points while spiraling out re: their supply chain.	labels:I feel like JCrew *used* to be more consistent. I used to have faith that a size 6 Perfect Shirt was, indeed, a perfect fit for me. I owned three of them in white alone. That hasn't been the case in recent years, and it's a shame.   Besides inconsistent fit, there's also just been some bizarre merchandizing decisions. Last March, right before all this (gestures at 2020) went down, I went into a JCrew looking for work pants. I did not find a *single pair of full length pants.* I mean, I can understand gearing up for spring, but ... no pants? at all? Some decisions just don't make sense.

text:Thoughts then and now?	labels:While I can appreciate the aesthetic and social decorum norms of vintage dressing, it strikes me as a kind of sartorial MAGA.  It is a nostalgic viewpoint that largely ignores the social and political structures tied to it. There are a lot of reasons people don't dress up on a daily basis anymore, including:  * women aren't relegated to being homemakers anymore * a woman's value is no longer solely attributed to her appearance * people's lives are a lot more complicated and multifaceted than they were before * people move around a lot more than they did before * people face greater economic pressures that before * lifestyles and social values, in general, have changed  While there will always be social/cultural expectations that dictate what is appropriate to wear in a given situation, it is generally a good thing that we now have more freedom of choice in what to wear on a daily basis.

text:Who are your fashion idols?	labels:I would highly recommend Justine Leconte. Not necessarily for what she wears or designs, but I love her YouTube channel for the way she describes things and I feel like she has a good, practical approach to fashion. She is my idol for actually talking about color, shapes and styles for different people and how to get things that flatter you, not the model on on a shopping website. She also has a good, no nonsense approach to basics and I think her methods of building a wardrobe are easily adaptable to anyone’s personal style.	episode_done:True

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Disclaimer-- I know myself well enough to know that a capsule wardrobe is not for me.  When I get back from traveling, I cannot wait to wear different clothes.  Consider your laundry situation.  Having a smaller wardrobe means that you will be doing laundry more often.  If you're one in a family of 6, it may not be a big deal.  But for a single apartment dweller (pay per load), the additional costs can add up quickly.   Because I pay per load, I make sure that I maximize the capacity and only wash full loads (I'm paying the same no matter the capacity).  I am not one to hand-wash clothes in a bathroom sink.  Not now, not ever!   I do laundry roughly every other week alternating lights and darks.  (Sheets and towels are their own ballgame, and I will sometimes throw things in with them.)

text:That’s a really good point, but could you elaborate on what makes a dress appropriate for certain seasons, other than temperature considerations? I wear jeans and t-shirts all year long, so I’m very ignorant in this whole area.	labels:To me, a winter dress either has long sleeves or is worn with a blazer/jacket to cover up short sleeves. Winter dresses are either long (past the knee) or if it is short, is worn with dark colored stockings/nylons/leggings. Winter dresses are typically darker colors- blacks, browns, dark green, navy, burgundy, etc.  A summer dress is usually lighter in fabric and lighter in color- whites, yellows, periwinkle, taupe, etc. A summer dress can be long- but if it’s long than the top should be short sleeved or tank top/halter etc so you don’t overheat.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion - “ Odd “ Fashion Inspirations	labels:I can't get enough of the fashion from Korean dramas.

I even find myself searching for some of the accessories (earrings and necklaces) worn in some of the dramas.
text:What are "iconic" items that you should know about, and their basic history?

It was also the first sneaker to retail for more than $100 and, though now associated with unfashionable comfort-conscious dads or Japanese-inflected americana (depending on which circles you run in), was coveted, especially among sneakerheads.	episode_done:True

text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:So I did this for a week once as a social experiment.  I was sick of putting together new outfits everyday and was curious if people would notice. I wore the same blouse, blazer and pants for an entire work week (yes I washed them). I don’t remember if I changed my necklace or shoes at all. Hair and makeup are always the same for work so that wasn’t a factor.  Nobody commented or seemed to notice throughout the week. On Friday afternoon I asked people if they had noticed anything about my appearance and they said no, and when I told them about my experiment they seemed genuinely surprised!  The biggest surprise for ME was how bored I quickly became. I basically felt like a cartoon character and was excited to wear my other clothes again.  So no, I don’t think it matters, but if you plan on doing this long-term I would recommend buying multiples of the same item to eliminate excessive laundry.	episode_done:True

text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:I’ve been unfortunate enough to have been to two funerals in the past few years, and the idea of wearing all black to a funeral doesn’t really seem to be a thing in Australia. I wore all black both times because I thought that was what you were supposed to wear but lots of people wore casual clothing. I’m talking singlet (tank top), shorts and thongs (flip flops). I was very taken aback that people would wear that to a funeral but I guess them being there is the most important thing.
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:I have a really hard time shopping on poshmark. I find I have to be super specific and it's not great for browsing. For instance "j crew tan cashmere cardigan" gets a manageable result but "flowy top" does not. I also uncheck boutique as that's all cheap stuff from china and search by brand when I have one in mind.   Ebay is has more filters which helps to narrow items down. I usually filter by material and country (only shop within the us since that's where I am, this gets rid of all the new stuff from china).  Also, I would definitely recommend thredup because you can return things. I recently placed my first order from them and ended up returning about half of it. They charge $2 per return and for free shipping you have to take store credit, which I think is fair and way better than just being stuck with something that doesn't fit. You can set up saved searches to make it easy to check for new items and also filter by brand/material/size/condition and sort by newest first.   Depop is also worth checking out, I find it to be a bit more curated and trendy than poshmark but often overpriced. There are less items so searching is more manageable, and search results are based on an algorithm (poshmark is just newest first). Also shipping is cheaper for small/light things.  Another one people are into is the real real, I haven't ordered from them myself but have seen it recommended. I think it's pretty much a higher end thredup.	episode_done:True
text:Woah that 10ply is insane. Please let me know how you like it! im tempted to save for one.	labels:I received it todat. Damnnn, it is SOFT. I would say it is probably close to cashmere in term of softness and how smooth it is. The knit is tight, and dense. It isnt as weighty as inverallan or so but i started to sweat 15 seconds after putting it on. I am on the bigger side of size small so size S fit slim on me. Up one of your usual size if you want a relaxed fit. The color is very hard to capture, i even thought the green look brown looking at the website but it is more green in real life than on picture, especially under the sun. Will edit the comment with more pics if you dont mind. I say i love it.

text:> ower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose)  Also because of the cost of raw materials like wool or leather. A $100 wool coat will always be thin and flimsy because wool isn't cheap and you need a lot of it for a coat. The only way to make that $100 coat is to use less wool, either by replacing some of it with polyester or by using less of it.  (Which, in this specific example, leads to people buying a cheap woollen coat and a cheap down jacket and wearing them both at the same time. Which does make sense for a lot of people, but I can't help finding it a bit funny.)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:The clothing examples will be dated because the book was published in the early 2000s, but Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine’s “What Not To Wear” talks about similar body types—minus broad shoulders and long legs. I’m short and have a different body type, so I won’t be much help here, but checking out Trinny and Susannah’s book might be helpful to get ideas of general clothing cuts that might work for you. They also have a series of YouTube videos called “The Rules” which repeat a lot of what’s in the book. I hope this helps!	episode_done:True

text:Noel Fielding X Fendi menswear colab	labels:I love Noel fielding. Which is why I really really wanted to feel excited about the garments!! But I.. don't. I just feel like.. I've seen them before, many times. A few of the signature colorful statement pieces are OK, and while I love a clean cut, minimalistic design, in this case I would have wished for something a bit more bold.  I'm not a fashion designer nor a trendsetter of any kind, and maybe this opinion is one of the reasons I'm not 😂 I'm just not excited enough to reach for any of these pieces instead of something with a pop from some other brand.
text:Normally for these albums I agree with you, but I don't have issues with the ones in this album. I personally hate it as a layering piece when it's forced into menswear like with a tie and trousers. I'm a big fan of these personally.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:[Inspo Album] Inspired by a recent Red and Pink Comment: An Inspo album of unexpected, but totally wearable, color combos	labels:This is fun! I love that you have both bright and muted colors in there. My favorites are the first and last photos - both featuring blue & green. Is that intended or just a happy coincidence?	episode_done:True
text:My unpopular opinion : most shipping is criminally underpriced and we should pay more for it. Many of the externalities don't seem to be priced in properly and everyone ends up paying for me to have my luxury purchases delivered.	labels:Totally agree	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:I love that you brought this up. Of course, there are are ethical retailers out there that have lower prices, but if you are young and/or poor, there is a certain amount of fast fashion that you need to buy because it fits your price/budget. Even though it isn’t ideal, not all fast fashion is gone in a couple years, if you are buying less trendy pieces you can wear for a while.  Many things I’ve bought from fast fashion retailers I’ve had for years - I haven’t changed my height or weight much in over 10 years, so I have tops from Old Navy I have had for 10 years and other clothes that have lasted way past 5 years.  Reducing consumption is a key part of ethical fashion and even if you buy it from a retailer that is cheaper because that’s what you can afford, if you keep it a long time and don’t buy a bunch of clothes all the time, you are reducing demand and helping the environment.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 06, 2020	labels:What has been your crowning fashion achievement or something that you're super proud of?   For me it's probably that one time I made the denim pilgrimage to Kojima Jeans Street in Okayama and bought a pair of Kamikaze Attack from the owner himself. That or my wardrobe built on sample sales
text:Closet Organization By Color	labels:My system includes by color, but it's a little complicated:  Left door: Dress/formal clothes   Right door: Casual clothes    I then categorize clothes by warmth, which is usually just sleeve length. No sleeves are in the center of the closet, then short sleeves, then long sleeves. Coats and jackets are at the edges.    Then each warmth section is organized by color: Black, grey, white, black/grey/white mix, cream/tan, brown, yellow, orange, red, pink, purple, blue, green.    It helps me readily identify where I have gaps in my wardrobe, whether I am ready for the upcoming seasons, and makes picking clothes super easy for the day's weather.	episode_done:True
