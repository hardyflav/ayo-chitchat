text:Seems size 6 is a 50/50 size for a lot of people given the standard size is made for bigger feet. I have a few friends that wear a US size 6 and it's basically split down the middle between if they'll find the same shoe comfortable or not.  One of my friends revealed that she is SUPER flat footed so, even 2 inch heels can give her problems as a result even if it's a thick heel or a wedge style. Some of them were also just buying low quality shoes since they didn't want to spend a lot of money and then when they got better quality pairs, their shoes hurt far less. Quality definitely matters a lot.  Something as simple as the incline (outright influences the slope steepness) is a game changer as well. Not to mention ankle and nerve strength differing between two individuals. There's so many factors into why shoes are comfortable or uncomfortable for us but, it definitely appears most are unaware of the heel slope steepness and shoe size factors.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:I’m so happy you posted this. People keep suggesting that I wear taller heels as I’m 5’0”, but my size 5 feet can’t handle much over 2 inches.	episode_done:True
text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:If the heel height is graded for size the angle of the footbed should remain constant between sizes.   IME wearer weight, fitness, and tolerance for discomfort play a more significant role than anything else. I’m 176cm, IT38, wear heels more than is probably good for me, and can comfortably manage a 100-105mm pump sans platform to dinner, and 85mm or so for days at the office if needed. With an enclosed wedge or block heel style I can easily do ten miles of walking at the same height, more with alcohol ;) I’m a former rock climber and lifelong endurance athlete, so discomfort and chafing are not foreign to me. Even the worst heel is much more comfortable than trying to jam a thin crack! I have former dancer friends who report a similar experience, while other less grin-and-bear-it types find anything more constrictive than Uggs unbearable.   I drop weight in the late summer and early fall for races, and even the 2-3kg shift makes a huge difference in comfort.	episode_done:True
text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:Size US11 here! Wearing heels is a breeze for me, personally, even if I'm over 6 feet tall in them! .. never thought about it this way, though. Makes a lot of sense that smaller feet would have greater strain while wearing heels. And yes, it is hell finding shoes my size. I usually wear men's sneakers. I only own two pairs of heels, and I'd say they're both about 4 inches tall.	episode_done:True
text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:I can't offer any help, but I just want to say that I hate how the heel height is measured from under the sole, when the footbed might actually slope up another full inch from there to the back of the heel. I'm only comfortable in heels up to about 4" max, and I don't order online bc they're always taller than I think from the measurements posted!	episode_done:True
text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:Something I’d like to point out, as a former dancer (yes, that kind of dancer), who spent several years wearing various heel heights:  In my experience, the slope and comfort of a shoe is partly dependent upon the height of the platform. The higher the platform, the less of an impact a high heel makes.  Both of the shoes in your photo have a thick platform. I think it would be helpful to deduct the height of the platform from the height of the heel, as that would give you a truer measure of the impact of the heel height.	episode_done:True
text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:pointed this out to my husband once when he bragged about wearing 4” heels with no problem, so why couldn’t I? Yeah buddy, it‘s simple geometry, look at the extreme angle of my size 6 foot with my heels raised four inches above the floor, and then look at yours with your size 13 feet. It’s fascinating how many things shoe designers need to take into consideration!	episode_done:True
text:Excercises for personal style	labels:>I am womdering if there are some techniques or excercises we can complete together for a more authentic version of herself.  Be careful yourself.  I am a bit wary of the concept of people developing confidence and helping friends develop other (different) styles. Style confidence is really personal. And assigning exercises, is a bit "teacher" like, wisdom dripping from above, chore like.   Friends might need help, but also to preserve friendships, it is often to always remember "you do you" and couch advice carefully and always understand people have different styles, different taste, and it is also OK to not actually CARE about style or fashion.	episode_done:True
text:Excercises for personal style	labels:Friends helped me narrow my style over the years. The most important is knowing what Looks Good on you. I love many pieces that don't fit my body. Someone had to help me by pointing out things that look bad & good. I also dressed way too conservatively for my shape and situations. They had to help show me - it's ok:)   Now I'm confident in my choices and help others. A clue that you're on the right track is when people compliment what you are wearing- not just what it is but how the color/style suits  you. Or the way you put it together. Complimenting other people is not only a nice, decent thing to do, it's also a good way to get them talking about clothes/styles/etc.	episode_done:True
text:Excercises for personal style	labels:I started making a personal style guide for myself last year, and it's an ever-evolving thing. I listed different eras of inspiration (1950s, 1960s, etc.), style icons (real and fictional) and describing various vibes. I also wrote out which physical attributes I want to highlight (and which ones I didn't), as well as listed wardrobe things I wanted and outlined a shopping strategy.  I told a friend about this, and now she's adopted it for herself! I feel like it's a great way to analyze what you want your style to be for yourself.	episode_done:True
text:Excercises for personal style	labels:Can she make a Pinterest board of looks she likes? If she has the money, she can slowly try out some parts. I emphasize slowly because there have been times where I think I'll love a style and it just work.	episode_done:True

For example, if  Person A wanted to be perceived as confident, they would ask themselves if the article of clothing or whatever fit inside the "confident" bubble.  I found that idea to be useful.

text:I'm reading this at the moment!  A lot of the ideas on it aren't completely new to me though. Justine Leconte has a video on YouTube about finding your style that touches on similar themes without being so labour-intensive and detailed. I also got a free PDF of Rachel Nachmias's The Face of the Business by subscribing to her newsletter a while ago and that has exercises that also overlap, although I abandoned it when it got too business-focused.  (Edit: I also meant to mention the Everyday Style podcast. I can't remember if she does it for all episodes but in earlier ones she gives "homework" exercises that could be relevant.)  Anyway, they're some options that could be useful alternatives if The Curated Closet is tricky to get a copy of. I also think Justine is really sweet and worth watching generally :-)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls” catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your “fashion house designers” but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I’ve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.	episode_done:False

At least 1-2 weeks later I went to the same food cart for breakfast, looked down, and saw one diamond earring in the crack in the sidewalk. I looked more closely and there was the other one!

Well, the stone fell out at some point, and my mother didn't know exactly where or when. We all looked everywhere, but how do you even start to look for something that's only a few mm? We scoured the house with flashlights looking for any sparkle. We even cut open the vacuum bag and sifted through everything, same everytime someone swept or dusted. Replacing it was not an expense my parents could really afford.   A few weeks later she'd given up and had decided it would have to be replaced somehow...until she noticed a small sparkle on the [very narrow] back rim of the top loading washer by the hinge of the lid. No clue how it didn't just fall into the washer when she put the clothes in! My best guess is it fell out of a pocket and that's where it landed.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I passed on buying "THE" Zara dress last summer because where I am the markup is crazy, I tried it on but ultimately decided I couldn't justify the equivalent of around €60 for shit material, and it's not like Zara's poor business practices are a secret.  Recently, I started thinking about it again, how it would be great for work/some (COVID responsible) events I've been to recently.  I figured it's almost a year out of season, people must be bored of it by now, there are no thrift shops where I am so I took a chance on eBay and nabbed it for €20, it's in the post on the way to me and I'm feeling quite chuffed with myself.	episode_done:True
text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I used to wear small diamond earrings every day, and would put them in my wallet when I went to the gym after work. I got to work the next day and realized I forgot to put them back in after the gym, so I opened up my wallet and they were gone. I had made my usual morning stop for breakfast on the way to work, so I rushed to the food cart and looked all over the sidewalk but I couldn’t find them.  At least 1-2 weeks later I went to the same food cart for breakfast, looked down, and saw one diamond earring in the crack in the sidewalk. I looked more closely and there was the other one! The metal was chewed up (they were bezel set) so I had to get them repaired, but it was a lot cheaper than a new pair!   Definitely my #1 fashion (jewelry?) miracle.	episode_done:False
text:That's incredible! I'm a notorious earring-loser, so I never wear nice ones. This gave me so much satisfaction ❤	labels:It was insane that I found them! I still went to the same food cart pretty much every day after losing them, and I would half-heartedly look down, but I never thought I’d actually find them! This was in a big city by a bunch of office buildings, hospitals, etc., so a ton of foot traffic. I just assumed someone else found them and that was their lucky day, LOL.	episode_done:True
text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I had this perfect oversized navy and white striped linen tee from LOFT. I loved it for years and then it got a big ol hole and I don't know how to fix linen (can you fix linen idk?) so I had to let her go.   I was heartbroken, she was so good to me, always covering my pasty white skin while keeping me cool, hiding my belly on fatter days and tucking beautifully into some jeans on less fat days.  I wasn't even really aware of resale sites until last year because I hadn't really gotten into secondhand shopping yet. Then it took a while to realize that I can re-buy all my dearly departed favorites.  Then one day I searched for her on posh and we were reunited in less than a week. It was beautiful and I feel whole again.	episode_done:True
text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I think the biggest miracle was when my favorite summer top (a black tight crop top with lots of straps in the back) came back in stock. It was on sale (it was too expensive for me to get at full-price) and was sold out before I got my hands on it. I checked the site over and over if it was back. One lucky day, I was in the cafeteria with my friends and eating lunch, I decided to check it again. And it was back, only one piece, and in my size! You can guess how fast I clicked the order button.  My second best miracle was finding black Dr. Martens at TK Maxx for only 50€ (they sell for about 200€ usually). They've been my fall and winter staple ever since.	episode_done:True

text:I Dyed My Jeans With $6 Dye and Here Are The Results	labels:Just going to put it out there, as a costumer who spends a lot of time dying fabric... RIT dyes   almost never take entirely, and tend to produce spotty results. You can use them in a \*very loose\* dyebath to produce a wash, but for anything else, you're taking the risk of producing a patchy result.     If a garment is truly precious to you, I would definitely recommend hitting up the internet (or a specialist's crafts/fabric store--not just the big chains) for Jacquard or Dharma dyes. They're more expensive, but we're talking about the difference between spending $10 to restore your favorite shirt or $6 to destroy it; I imagine for most folks it'll be worthwhile.	episode_done:True

It’s even better if your background lighting matches your real lighting  -	statement earrings also work out well for extra pizzaz. -	if you can help it, angle the camera slightly higher than your head, or whatever you use as your “selfie” angle. If you can’t do this then at the very least do not have the camera angled up at your face. -	I have noticed when I have my monitors blue light filter on, because the screen is more yellow toned, it warms up my skin on camera lol	episode_done:True

text:What are your fashion tips for looking good on Zoom?	labels:I think it's all in camera placement and lighting.  Have the camera at eye level or slightly above it. My laptop webcam was at a seriously unflattering angle, even when propped up. I just got a webcam that I put on my main monitor and the angle alone makes me look 10x better.   Get a light source behind your camera that's pointed at your face. Get a ring light if you can. Play around with desk lamps. If you have 2 lamps, try placing them behind the camera, one on each side of you. If you have 1, try placing it behind the camera pointed directly at you, try to bounce the light off the wall, etc. If you're sitting with your back to a window, close your blinds.  What color is your desk chair? Don't wear a shirt that's the same color. Other than that, I think anything goes with respect to fashion. You only really see like 10% of the person's top on videos.  Makeup wise, I like to wipe my face with an oil-blotting sheet to make sure I'm not shiny, lots of blush and bronzer, and  a YLBB shiny lip balm.	episode_done:True

It's good that you're looking for inspo, now you go through it with an analytical mind and try to find the pattern. Then you try to reproduce.   Like others have said, I don't find the style quite elegant or expensive. But if you're into it, it's totally possible to recreate!	episode_done:True
text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:It is a good thing you put the links of the instagrammers, because their looks was not what I imagined from the word "elegant".  They are thin and fit, likely with lots of cosmetic surgery and beauty treatments, one is very tall, they are all very "done". It is a look, and everybody do their own thing. Their look is very body conscious, very revealing, very showing off curves (in the right places since they are very thin.. Always explicitly sexy. It is indeed, maybe stereotypical very russian, or eastern european in general.  Some  observations about those looks and if you want to :  - keep shoes all pristine. High heels or sneakers or combat boots, but keep them as  pristine as possible.  - when in doubt, downsize clothes (this is against my regular advice, but this is a specific look).  - usually always showing one of legs/cleavage/midriff.  - very brand aware but you will find similar pieces everywhere starting from primark up...	episode_done:True
text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:What those instagrammers depict is that sort of standard put-together-basic-high-life luxury look. I wouldn't be surprised if they had selfies in private jets and resorts with like giant rose bouquets and the like etc. You can get this look by having all your shit together - hair, makeup, manicure perfect, toned body, nice tan.

text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:I might suggest checking out the book “A Guide to Elegance” by Genevieve Antoine Dariaux. It was written in a different time, but it has a lot of great advice when it comes to “elegance” and how to achieve it. It’s also quite funny!  For example: “To be elegant is first of all to know oneself, and to know oneself well requires a certain amount of reflection and intelligence. Consequently, a woman who is utterly stupid will always find it extremely difficult to become truly elegant.”	episode_done:False

text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:The clothes they are wearing are actually the least important part of them looking elegant.  Ignoring genetics (it's a lot easier to look elegant if you're tall and thin, imo) there's a few things that can help someone look elegant regardless of what clothes they're wearing. Also ignoring the fact these three probably have teams to help them look how they want ;)  First off is how you carry yourself - how you walk, how you pose for photos, how you sit and stand etc. It helps to have a friend, a good sized mirror, or to record yourself - then watch how people you see as being elegant move and hold themselves, then copy them and practice.  Second would be presentation. The instagrammers you mention have long, clean, shiny hair in simple styles. More neutral colours for makeup - but be aware it takes a lot of time and product (and practice!) to get their kinda looks. Clean, well manicured nails - they don't have to be too long but no chipped polish, dirt under nails etc. Clothes that fit (find a tailor if you can afford to alter clothes for you, or learn to do it yourself) . A cheap shirt that's been altered to fit you will look better than a more expensive one that fits badly.  And thirdly would be mindset - this also ties into the first because no matter how much practice you've had, if you feel clumsy and nervous you will find a lot harder to pull off looking elegant.	episode_done:True
text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:Good personal grooming-  neat hair, clean teeth/breath, “nails covered by at least clear nail polish” etc, Clothing- tailored, looks neat (no wrinkles, lint, excessive pilling, etc） Bags / shoes- I think these can really elevate an outfit, but remember even if your bag is $$$$ it still needs to be neat/ not too visibly worn out.  “Walking with confidence” is also important.   I think that Aly Art and Merriam style are good sources for finding your style.. Anna Bey’s channel I think is good for learning about modern elegance and at the very least self confidence, “living life to your fullest” and self respect even if you aren’t preparing to have formal dinners with a kind every evening or having an expensive lifestyle. I don’t know of other sources for “modern elegance”..   Knowing what lines and colors look good on you also makes a difference in your appearance.	episode_done:True
text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:Honestly I think you have to give way more detail on your old pair and what you’re looking for.  In my mind the biggest hurdle to perfect jeans is the fit, and since every body is different this is highly individual. Some people might prefer stretchier denim for a more forgiving fit, while others look for stiffer fabric, and have less leeway.

text:Levis premium 501 high rise skinny (99% cotton with the button fly) - the cut for this season is more straight than truly skinny despite the name. I picked up 3 pairs in the sales recently. Immediately trying them on they look a bit loose in the lower leg and a bit tight in the hip & thigh but after wearing for one day they've relaxed and conformed to my body and look perfect. I do advise sizing down - the size chart said 28 for me but I had to exchange for 25 (25" is my actual waist size if that helps).	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:If you like skinny jeans, American Eagle are my favorite “affordable” (for me) jeans. I am tall, slender, and not very curvy and their “next level super high-waisted jegging” is my favorite. If you can spend more, my holy grail skinny jeans are the Good American Good Waist jeans. They’re super flattering, they hold in my belly, and they don’t get baggy in the waist even after multiple wears. To extend the life of your jeans, try to wash them as little as possible and keep them out of the dryer! If your jeans have any kind of elastic in them, the heat of the dryer basically melts it over time so your jeans don’t look as good or last as long.	episode_done:True
text:Can someone tell me where people get their outfits that we see during Seoul Fashion Week?	labels:A lot of people who go to these things are SUPER into fashion and most likely have been collecting clothes for a long time. While some definitely wear more avant-garde or lesser known brands, a lot wear your usual luxury brands too. In the first picture is a JW Anderson cap bag which goes for about USD800-900 new. Third picture has a Lady Dior that runs about 4000-5000+ new. I'm not familiar with any of the clothing but some brands you could look into as a first step are Undercover and Comme des Garçons (and its various lines).  For the affordability issue, I second going on Yahoo! Japan and other resale sites but you need to know what you're looking for and have some idea of what might be a fake. This is also good if you're looking for past season clothing and other rare pieces. For more current stuff, you can also try SSENSE during their sale seasons.	episode_done:True

text:Hiking Aesthetic - Functionality vs. Fashion	labels:Honestly, most people that get serious about hiking learn pretty quickly that fashion is low on the priority list. You can colour coordinate your gear but it's not really going to be fashion.	episode_done:False
text:Exactly this truthfully. You start to look at everything your wearing for its physical properties. Something that will keep me 1 degree warmer while not increasing my weight is way more important than any fashion considerations. I'm not even nearly as serious as most people.   Otherwise on casual day hikes I just wear a mix of "normal" clothes and what is most important to me such as shoes and socks.   Not to say you can't go the "other" way with your clothing. I wear my merino wool base layers under regular clothing all the time same with my hiking socks. I also have multiple copies of my hiking pants that I wear both hiking and as casual wear.  I think the only thing that really matters is don't wear cotton/linen/plant fibers hiking, unless your bringing a change of clothes.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Hiking Aesthetic - Functionality vs. Fashion	labels:I wear my yoga clothes with hiking boots and a Patagonia fleece in the summer and fall, Patagonia Radalie jacket in the winter. My friend has a UV protection shirt (REI house brand) which she wears due to the intense UV rays in Colorado. It doesn’t make her feel hot most days. I mostly thrift my yoga/hiking clothes, and really like thrifted Lululemon. Although I hike and do yoga frequently, I won’t buy Lululemon full price when there are so many used gear stores near me. I buy Zella leggings also for both activities. My hiking boots are currently Oboz, my trail running shoes are Asics, and I have heard good things about Salomon hiking boots. Fjallraven has very nice beanies for colder weather.  I definitely say fashion takes a backseat to function for hiking, as you primarily want to be comfortable, however, living in the mountain west, I want to look nice during an activity I do about once weekly, so fashion is at least a consideration for me.  (Edit) You can absolutely hike in your everyday clothing, and I have seen people hike 14,000 foot mountains in gym shorts and a T shirt. As long as your boots and socks are solid and the rest is easy to move in, you’re honestly good to go.	episode_done:False
text:I love Salomon for Hiking boots, trail runners, ski boots, literally everything. I also love the Adv Skin 5 Hydration Pack :)   I've started wearing trail runners for day hikes and I like how much lighter they are as well as how quickly they dry (not having to take them off for stream crossings is huge). Granted I don't have any issues with ankle mobility and I consider myself to be pretty coordinated where I don't need hiking boots to help with stability if I'm not doing a longer trip.  The point about thrifted Lululemon is solid as well. I have leggings that have held up for 10 years now, and I recently bought a pair of yoga shorts from the brand and they're pilling like crazy, while the old ones I have look newer than the new pair.	labels:	episode_done:True

Crossover shoes like LL Bean boots, Kodiak, Teva (boots, shoes, sandals), and other brands work well on casual hikes and in the city. Knit sweaters and a rain jacket.

text:Deceptive Marketing Practices by Fashion Companies	labels:I was a fabletics member for close to a year. I mostly liked their stuff but the quality was extremely variable. For the membership, they do give you an option to login to your account and either make a purchase of any amount or skip the month, otherwise you’d get charged $49.99 that you can use for store credit. I had a reminder set to skip and so most months I didn’t spend any money, but one month I forgot and got charged. I was so mad that I cancelled right away (which was easier than I worried it would be). In hindsight, I don’t like this set up and wouldn’t sign up for another rewards service that has a risk of being charged. I just want to buy (or not buy) things when I need them and not have it be dictated by needing to get something by a certain date.

text:Deceptive Marketing Practices by Fashion Companies	labels:Speaking of deceptive marketing practices, I just got this email:   Notice of Class Action Settlement  If you purchased any Coach Outlet Merchandise discounted from a “MFSRP,” you may be eligible to receive a payment from a class action Settlement.  If you purchased any of Defendant Coach, Inc.’s (“Defendant” or “COACH”) outlet Merchandise[1] offered at a discount from a “MFSRP,” you may be eligible to receive a payment from a class action settlement (“Settlement”). The lawsuit against Defendant alleges that the “MFSRP” statements on the tags of the Merchandise offered at a discount from a “MFSRP” are misleading because they included the price of its retail goods, creating the false impression that its outlet store Merchandise was once sold in COACH’s full-line retail stores and was of the same quality and workmanship as merchandise sold in COACH’s full-line retail stores. Defendant denies any and all wrongdoing of any kind whatsoever and denies any liability to Plaintiffs and to the Settlement Class. The Court has not decided who is right. Both sides have agreed to settle the dispute and provide an opportunity for payments and other benefits to Settlement Class Members. The case is called Marino, et al v.

text:All things K-Fashion!	labels:I love k-fashion and tbh it’s the biggest inspiration for my style. I got into Korean things in elementary school so it’s been a long time. There is (or was) a huge kfashion community on tumblr which I’m a part of. I’ve collected a list of 100+ stores through the years but some of my favorite brands are the big ones like stylenanda and chuu. When I think of kfashion, especially in the past 5 years or so, I think of very minimalistic in terms of color pallets with interesting silhouettes. What you see in most kdramas isn’t necessarily what’s trending on the style blogs and online stores.	episode_done:True
text:All things K-Fashion!	labels:I lived in Korea for awhile (2008 and 2009) and it was, hands down, the best dressed country I have ever seen in my life (and I am a real live Italian). So much fun fashion. What I wouldn't do for an entire day in Myeongdong just unloading all my cash. Something I've noticed is that a lot of trends that were popular over a decade ago have stuck around in some iteration -- pastels never seem to get old there, even if they're used in different ways. Oversized clothes were a staple then as now. Unabashed logos. I still try to incorporate facets of Korean fashion into how I dress over a decade later.	episode_done:True
text:All things K-Fashion!	labels:I feel like a stumbling point ofr US people is that the streetstyle isn't always...lady shaped(?). Like in Korea they'll wear baggy tops with baggy pants and it all fits, but isn't fitted. Even the streetstyle guide author in her demos still retained the American silhouette.	episode_done:True
text:All things K-Fashion!	labels:I love watching kdramas for fashion!! Partly I get sad though because I know that stuff is sponsored/product placements and I could never afford them 😭   I do enjoy SK fast fashion too though, and had so much fun shopping in Hongdae, Dongdaemun amd Ewha back when travel was a thing. Ditto for Japan! The clothes there are just more fashion forward, well-made and affordable. Whereas a similar looking piece (same quality) would cost $80 or something at Aritzia.	episode_done:True

It's been 11 years and I'm still sad about it. We always said we'd go back and have a do-over, but things happened and life continues to happen and I'll never get to run around Vegas in my wedding dress. I have worn it any chance I get though! Holiday parties or other random events. People are always weird about it "um. Is that a wedding dress?" Me: hell yeah ! I love my wedding dress. I'm gonna wear it as long as I can! I feel like a mother fucking princess in it!" Also, I'm happy I work hard to stay fit enough to still fit into it. Haha. I bought it on Craigslist for $400. I love it. I will continue to wear it as much as possible without any cares because I feel good in it.   That being said. Wear what you feel best in! If it's a wedding dress or sweat pants. YOLO it with all your confidence.	episode_done:True

If I love something but I'm either not able to afford it or just not ready to pull the trigger, I take a photo of myself in the item, a photo of the store tag, and a photo of the tags on the clothing (especially any tag with a style number). I spent 3 years looking for a specific out of my budget Paige denim jacket that I tried on at Nordstrom Rack by scouring ebay, etsy, poshmark, etc.   Last month I finally found the exact jacket (confirmed by the style number and tag information) on Poshmark in excellent shape for a great price. Unfortunately in those 3 years I've gained a bit more weight than I realized and it's a bit tighter than my original try on photos, but still wearable!	episode_done:False

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:No, I really couldn’t fathom it to be honest. I like too many colors, I like too many patterns and florals. Not everything I like goes with the other things I like. I know it’s simpler for some people but I don’t see the fun in it.	episode_done:False

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:It makes life easier although now I just fuss over which top to wear. I typically wear jeans/black pants, printed top, coordinating cardigan, flats and earrings. Sometimes I change out the pants for a skirt or dress, and the cardigan for a sweater. I gave up aspirational dressing a long time ago and started dressing for the activities in my life. I'm much happier and my clothes get worn!	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I wouldn’t call it a uniform per se, but I think I’m a very “formulaic” dresser when it comes to everyday workwear and casual wear.   For a work day, it’s always black loafers + black pants + simple top, whether it be a sweater or blouse. I work in a very conservative industry but my office is usually pretty casual, so I find this formula is best for most days and I can throw on a blazer or heels I keep in my office if needed. I would hate to be in a situation where I have to run to a meeting short notice, which happens more often than I’d like to admit, and look like a sore thumb in terms of casualness compared to the other women in the room, who are usually a lot older and more advanced in their careers than I am. I pretty much only wear the same jewelry everyday for work too.   For going out and weekends, it’s usually fun shoes + jeans + nice top + a fun element, either a statement bracelet or statement earrings.   I think my style can get a bit predictable in that I own the same pair of black pants 4 times and 3 pairs of very similar loafers, but I have fun items like cheetah ankle boots I’m obsessed with to make it fun, but can also get away with for work. I echo previous comments about fussing over tops though with this formula, and the idiocy of men copying Zuckerberg or Jobs with the uniforms... don’t they realize that they don’t/didn’t look particularly good??	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:This sub celebrates all sorts of fashion but not everyone is up for endless variety. If this is something you’re keen about, you should go for it. But slowly - make sure that the multiple versions of one outfit is something you really love wearing and won’t get bored of before you buy more  If this is more like an area you are exploring due to frustration of having nothing to wear, consider a capsule wardrobe instead. It’s much more involved and intentional than coming up with a uniform but it is a little more flexible	episode_done:True

text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:I was gothpunk with shades of scenekid and vintage-sexy supreme.  I am now living my best life as future-cult bossbish and reincorporating punk elements in to my wardrobe because it is fly as hell and representative of my true self.  I think the trajectory for counter culture folk is almost always: counter culture -> normal core -> reincorporate elements once more secure in life because its not aphasemom.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:While my style has evolved over the years, the number one concrete example I can think of is... pushup bras.

Now I’m much more comfortable with my body and don’t feel the need to squish my boobs into oblivion anymore.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:In college I still shopped the juniors section and never imagined outgrowing it, taste wise.

text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:In high school I wanted to be as punk rock as I could be. I spiked my hair up, DIY-ed everything, and bought my first pair of Doc Martens at 14. I either worked at Hot Topic or a body piercing studio through school. I grew up in an affluent/conservative area so my goal was to be as weird to everyone as possible. Music was my main influence.  In college my style changed a lot since I went to school for fashion. I moved to LA where I didn't feel like I had to rebel against anyone anymore. I started incorporating other musical influences like goth, new wave, and grunge into my style. I started appreciating higher quality designer clothing but had zero money. While I really wanted to shop at places like Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen, and AllSaints, I ended up just wearing all black all the time and trying to get those looks for less.  Now I'm in my mid 20s, moved out of California, started my career, and finally have some expendable income. I'm really influenced by 60s/70s rock n roll. I try and buy all high quality pieces that I'm obsessed with so I don't feel like I'm always having to shop.  I do still have and wear my original Doc Martens though	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:Gosh when I was a teen my style was all over the place. A little bit preppy mixed with animal print and glam/bling, etc. I was a lot more adventurous with color and styles, but now being 29 and a mom, I prefer all dark colors (a lot of black), and have a more refined but edgy style. Think the kooples and all saints. Dark tops, fitted bottoms, clubmaster style sunglasses, structured coats. I won’t ever give up my black vans eras, or Adidas r1s though.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:In my earlier 20s I dressed Sustainably, or at least LOOKED like I did. Big, oversized linen shirts with roomy pants. I only bought basics, and neutrals, but the clothes themselves were pretty boring and uninspired.   Then I went back to black, wore some Phillip Lim black trousers everywhere and a fitted top. Still very basic and safe, but I knew about designers and trends. I had more money to spend on clothing, but not enough for the clothes I really wanted (thank god i didnt have the cash to drop on some jesse kamm sailor pants...-_-)  This past year I've come more into my own, and I feel way more comfortable with myself. So now I'm finally developing my own style (which ive honestly been doing for decades...) and buying pieces that aren't so basic. Colorwise....it's a lot of black. But it's mixed with fun accessories, anime keychains on my bag, and innovative fabrics (eg Pleats Please) My reservations around feeling uncomfortable in my clothing, or sticking out too much, has really dwindled. I'm leaning into avant-garde designers while still incorporating my leftovers from my Sustainable phase.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:I've always been chubby growing up, and because of my insecurities I use to cover myself up from head to toe. Hair down, baggy shirt with long sleeves showing no chest, tall jeans with no holes, knee socks below the jeans, and a pair of old sneakers. I use to wear black a lot as well because it was slimming. I never owned dresses, shorts, tank tops, or sandals because I believed they were to revealing.  Nowadays, I am a lot more confident in my appearance. I partially contribute that to my weight loss, but my friends now also helped in boosting my confidence. I'm now able to wear jeans with holes in them, I still don't like sleeveless shirts, but am able to wear more fitted clothing and show some skin. I no longer wear knee high socks and sometimes just go out in sandals or some heels. I love playing with colors now and feel as if I'm on the path to finding a style which truly suits me. I also recently bought my first pair of shorts since I was a child, so that's exciting 😗	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:I’ve gotten a lot more conservative and preppy. In my teens and 20s, I was basically a high end version of ABG - Asian baby girl. I put away the manolos and louboutins for Cole Haan flats and splurge on Hermes scarves.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:Former goth/emo kid as well. Emo kid in high school, then clubwear/raver in college, with periods of normal and/or prep mixed in.   My aesthetic now is lagenlook/witchy/cozy. Nowadays I pay a lot more attention to quality and fabrics/materials. Having more disposable income I’d rather spend money on quality fabrics such as linen, genuine leather and sterling silver rather than polyester and fake leather etc. Comfort is also a much bigger factor as any uncomfortable garments never get worn. I haven’t worn heels in years. I stopped styling my hair and instead switched to hats. Makeup has slowly phased out except for special occasions. Color palette now leans towards earthy tones when they used to be loud and/or all black. I’ve been working from home full time for years, so basically my wardrobe has shifted from ‘meant to be seen’ to ‘cute but also suitable for going about my day without anything riding up/pinching/etc.”   I also shop with a lot more intention now too. Before I would just pick out tons of whatever I thought was cheap and cute. Now everything I bring into my wardrobe undergoes a LOT of scrutiny before I buy it, even if it’s cheap.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:In my teens, my style was a bit all over the place, but I mostly wore darker colors and did the whole emo/scene kid thing.

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:Personally, I don't feel constrained because I feel like heels have kind of fallen out of style. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they're unstylish -- I just feel like nobody wears them and so I'm not drawn to buy any. I personally prefer sneakers on any outfit. And even if it's a fancy outfit I'll wear flats.	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:I can only wear new balance ugly sneakers with custom orthotics or boots. Boots like hiking or cowboy, I bought my first pair of ankle cowboy boots a year ago. I wear them with everything have my eye on some black lizard ankle length from Tecovas for my next pair.   Wearing heels one night distroys my feet for weeks. It’s not worth the pain.  I started out specifically buying clothing that would look good with cowboy boots (skinny jeans). Now I rock them with any and everything. Just tucked them into a pair of blue plaid trousers and they looked awesome.   Its surprising how much more confident you feel when your feet aren’t miserable. Also my boots were $200 bucks why should I be concerned about them not being “fancy of fashionable.”	episode_done:True

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:Interesting!  I...actually wear heels in my casual life all the time lol, including when I run errands.  But never stilettos!  I'm in my 30s and wear a lot of block heels and kitten heels.  It makes me feel better/more powerful, and evens out my proportions in a way I appreciate.  Maybe that's why they're so common in influencer photos?  That said, I think certain flats can look really sharp if the rest of the outfit is tailored well.  In my mind, flats make good tailoring even more important as you aren't adjusting your proportions with your shoes.  When I wear flats, I'm hyper-vigilant about the proportions of the rest of my outfit.	episode_done:True

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:I recently lived in Paris near some of the the biggest tourist attractions, and I would spot Instagram influencers daily. I’d say I’d see them change into heels about half the time. Some folks just commit, but it always stood out as unusual. Paris is not stiletto friendly. Although it’s seen as a formal city, compared to any American metropolis, footwear is casual and out wear is practical. That being said, a 2-3 inch heeled boot or bootie was not uncommon and along with sneakers, the norm.   My most memorable influencer sighting was a very glamorous woman in a tiny yellow dress and heels on a 40 degree (Fahrenheit) day taking pictures on a windy terrace, only to see her minutes later coming out of a public restroom in weather appropriate and casual attire.   I feel like this stuff is dependent on your own lifestyle, and the context of the city. My own comfort level with heels has changed significantly over the past decade, from wearing a heel everywhere, everyday to now owning one pair for parties.  As for non-heeled influencers: there are so many! What kind of style do you gravitative towards?	episode_done:False
text:Lol cute story. Once when my disability was really bad I was the first passenger to board a flight, and while the staff was helping me, I saw a stylish young woman plop down in first class and do a few selfies before going to her actual seat in economy!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:> This would not be such a problem except the outfits they are posting oftentimes do not look good without heels, especially for people that are short like themselves! Midi skirts that hit at an awkward spot, long billowy trousers, etc.  This may sound like blasphemy, but I'm a genuine shortarse and I wear *both flats and heels* with those things. And usually lower, blockier heels because I don't want to break my face on the pavement.   If I could take a decent selfie I would be all about that fashion blogger in flats life. Alas.	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:Suffering for the sake of beauty went out with Scarlett O’Hara.   Every time I think “my calves would look great if I wore heels” I remind myself how much my feet would hate me and how great my calves already look.   I can do a 1” heeled bootie but I walk too much to find a higher heel appealing.	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:I feel my best in heels. I completely identify with that actress who insisted her character would keep her heels on in Jurassic World. I hate how casual everything has gotten and can’t wait for sneakers with everything to die the ignominious death they deserve.   That being said, 3 inch stilettos are not a shoe to wear frequently. I pretty much live in flats or stacked heel boots. I would love to see more practical heels have a moment once the clunky shoe trend runs its course.	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:Yes! I’ve never worn heels regularly but am genetically pre-disposed to foot problems and have had multiple foot surgeries. I’ve been trying to commit to flats or low heels (under an inch) only. It’s so hard when your legs aren’t stick thin and the standard in formal and professional womenswear is always a freaking heel. I’m starting to accept that certain pants/dresses/skirts won’t work on me without a heel. So I spend less money on variety and heeled shoes but more time looking for stylish flat shoes and clothing that works with them. Unfortunately I don’t have any blogs to share. Just wanted to commiserate and say that it’s ok to avoid heels completely for medical reasons - the mythical comfortable heeled shoe doesn’t exist for some of us!	episode_done:True

text:I bought a gorgeous teal wedding kaftan with matching floor length vest and beaded waist belt in Morocco. It was really unique from all the others as it was much more understated and all the beadwork was also done with teal beads (different from most which have a lot of gold accents). I was particularly proud because I bargained down to 450 dirhams or around $45 for it.   Wore it once in Jardin Majorelle but without the floor length waist coat but was so excited to wear that piece with western clothes. Was even considering wearing it at my wedding.  Well, we make it back to a hostel in Madrid and since I can’t sleep, I take a little thc tincture to help put me to sleep. Well, I wake up high, 5 min before checkout and obviously, since my bag is quite full with gifts and Moroccan goodies now, my clothes are having a hard time fitting, so naturally, I put MY FAVORITE REFORMATION OUTFIT AND NEW MOROCCAN GOWN IN A PLASTIC BAG AND TIE IT TO THE OUTSIDE OF MY BACKPACK.   As we’re walking through the train to go to Seville, I realize that, SURPRISE!, bag is no longer attached and I lost it somewhere on the walk.   Obviously we called the hostel but it wasn’t there...3 hour train ride with my fiancé was SILENT. I don’t think I’ve ever been more angry and everytime I looked at that backpack for days it would make so angry.   Teal Kaftan, please know how sorry I am and how much I miss you.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Books on Fashion	labels:A little esoteric, but *Subculture: The Meaning of Style* by Dick Hebdige is an amazing piece of writing on how clothing and style is a form of resistance. You might be able to find a PDF of it online, it's fairly short but definitely worth looking at.   Nora Waugh's *The Cut of Women's Clothes* is more of a historical costume reference book, but the first hand accounts from women's letters and journals about clothing is so universal it makes my heart sing. Also an excellent survey of how the fashion industry and construction methods changed over time.   *Women's Work: The First 20,000 Years* by Barber. While not fashion specifically, it is a *incredible* deep dive into how clothing was first "invented" and how integral women were and are to the creation of thread, fabric, and clothes. It is remarkably well written and a part of history that was completely new to me. I was unable to put it down, so good.   *Fashion-ology: An Introduction to Fashion Studies* by Yuniya Kawamura is heady, but worth it. It's a sociological look at how fashion works as a mindset, industry, and construct. It hits a lot of the themes that pop up in this sub, including the moral and technological debates that occupy a lot of 21st C thought.	episode_done:True

text:Those of you who, like me, don't have a closet (sob).. how do you organize your clothing/shoes/accessories/jewelry?	labels:I’m in a railroad apt built in the early 1900s; lots of walls and no closets.   The Ikea closet systems are kind of amazing.  I have the tension rod system (floor to ceiling) with a large deep dresser, clothing rod, and cubbies at the top. I had an old over the door hook rail that I put on the clothes bar so I can hang worn-but-still-clean-clothes on hooks. Clean ones are on hangers. My sister got the PAX system for her place and is really happy with it.    I also have a normal dresser that I put anything foldable in to, including intimates. It’s also my “night stand”.   Shoes - i keep a few high use ones by the door. I have a shoe rack elsewhere. My entryway is nonexistant, otherwise I’d prefer to have the shoe rack near the door too. Got a slim one from Yamazaki. Occasion shoes and seasonal (snow boots for example) stay boxed and under or ontop of my Ikea closet until they’re needed. Then they go in the daily area.   Out of season clothes are in bins under my bed.   Jewelry and accessories - long stuff like necklaces, high use scarves, and long earrings are just hanging on a 5 tier pants hanger. The kind where you can release each bar? I had it laying around and it was cheap.  Smaller earrings and rings are in a jewelry box.   I have a peg rack for coats.   Overall you also have to have less stuff when you don’t have big closet space.	episode_done:True

My denim/stiffer fabric pants do get their own tiny set of drawers since I don't have a ton, but the rest of my clothes get organized in open shelving (IKEA Kallax.)  Shoes are in a shoe rack that I keep behind my closet door.

But it’s kind of fucking annoying when I want to dress to look my best and most flattered and every resource out there is saying “YOU GO GIRL you can rock ANYTHING YEAH”. It’s almost an EXCUSE to not have to do any research or have any design knowledge.  Honestly the whole “wear whatever you want” kind of ignores fatter women - like, oh I realize literally everything that’s “in” right now is not flattering on you because it’s made for a straight thin body - but IDC - fend for yourself. But I will hide this thought process behind “THERE ARE NO RULES - you’re beautiful and can wear ANYTHING”.   Tell it like it is.

text:I'm a little wary of using the terms "real" and "normal" to refer to women's bodies. All bodies are normal and real, they just range in size. No one size is more "real" than another.

I didn’t mean to imply otherwise.  I picked ‘normal’ to differentiate from all the instagram models and fashion models I follow on Instagram. Not that they’re abnormal, but they do have body measurements that are out of the norm statistically. I once read some data that said typical model measurements can only be found in <0.1% of the population.  Secondly, as you mentioned, there’s the other factor of airbrushing, perfect/professional posing, light etc. that is also special to typical Instagram models.	episode_done:False

text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:This absolutely depends on occasion. Where are you going to wear the stuff you want to curate? School/ uni? Office job? Partying? Hiking? I suggest you figure out your colors, needed occasions and a rough direction of style and look for capsule + whatever tags suit you.   If you have an idea of favourite pieces that look well on your frame you can try to look up those and build different outfits around them.  Just take it slow, and when adding new pieces make a rule that it has to go with a certain amount of pieces you already own or plan to get soon.   Last advice, depending on your funds (or people who want to give you a present) do a professional color and style consulting; your body type won‘t change too soon, your colors never will, so this is a great investment.	episode_done:True
text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:It's important to be mindful of buying things that you'll actually wear and not things that you think you should wear or that are just aspirational for you. If it doesn't fit your lifestyle or it's uncomfortable, you're not going to reach for it and it's just going to sit in your closet collecting dust. That doesn't mean you shouldn't buy things that push you out of your comfort zone, just approach it from a practical perspective.  Another guideline is to think about what need a piece fulfills and how it fits with your current wardrobe. If you find an awesome top but it only goes with one particular pair of pants then you're not going to get much use out of it. Or you own boots that work really well with black outfits but not brown-toned outfits, seek out an option that fits where your other boots fall short.   Your style is an ever evolving process, don't feel pressure to throw out everything you own and buy an all new wardrobe in whatever image you're trying to attain. Shop slow, be choosy, and observe others to analyze what you like and why you like it.	episode_done:True
text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:IT depends on you.  What is your lifestyle (be realistic)?  When determining this, keep your area's climate in mind as well as your workplace (or school) dress code.  Also know your hobbies because a hiker is going to need vastly different attire than someone who likes clubbing.  IF your work environment is casual, then you don't need a closet full of business formal clothing.  If your workplace requires a uniform, then you don't need a wardrobe full of work clothes (unless the uniform is a dress code like black pants/white shirt).    If you're living in Miami, then you likely don't need a down parka.    That said, no matter your lifestyle, I'd have one outfit in your closet (could be the same thing or separates) to wear to a job interview, wedding (guest, not wedding party), and funeral.  Be prepared ahead of time should those occasions arise.    My other recommendation to learn color theory and the color seasons.   If you are unsure, try and find a celebrity that has similar coloring to you and study their wardrobe and what colors they wear on red carpets.  Know what colors look good on you and which ones do not.   I'm a clear winter, so my colors are jewel tones, icy pastels, and crisp colors.  Muted tones like olive, khaki, mustard, off white, etc look terrible on me.	episode_done:True
text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:Completely depends on your lifestyle. My most essential item for work is a pair of shoes that are comfortable, easy to walk in, and stylish- I go for mules currently, but in years past, I was very into ballerina flats or pointy-toed plats and even had a stint with loving Tieks.   A pair of black skinny jeans has been a staple in my wardrobe for almost a decade now, so those are probably an essential for me also- although I've been getting more into straight and wide leg denim now.	episode_done:True
text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:The first thing to do is to figure how your spend your time and what you like to wear for those occasions.    So hypothetically you spend 4 days a week in a business casual office. Workout 3 days a week. Go on a hike each weekend. And go clubbing 1x a week. And bar hopping 3x a week.   Then think about some outfits you like or style aspirations for each occasion. Then you can start to see what pieces might work and where you have some overlap.	episode_done:True
text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:It all depends on your life and climate. I think a good waterproof coat is essential and weather proof boots, but if you like in a very very dry climate where it hardly rains, then obviously it is not. For some people snow boots and really heavy feather filled winter coats are essential, I got a coat and boots I only wear when travelling in winter to cooler places and they would be inadequate for a lot of places! I love jeans, some women hate the feeling and would rather do without.  I dunno. You got to you do you, think hard of what you find comfortable physically and mentally, what makes you think "pretty" or colors that cheer you up. How much do you walk? Shoe comfort and weather adequacy really matters.	episode_done:True
text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:For me it's a tight undershirt (in lieu of a bra)-I like to have at least one regular and one that comes just under my bum (usually use this one in winter to keep cold out between my layers.   Also great to have a nice wrap coat/cardigan that is good for spring, summer, fall (can be worn closed or open). A good winter coat, better to invest more in something stylish and long lasting than to have several that are not great quality.  Wool skirt (any style) for winter time as well as wool or fleecy under layer of pants (with this one pair I can style many different ways and also wear under wool skirts with high socks for extra warmth in winter.	episode_done:True

text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:Have also worked much of my life in jobs where I had to be ready to unload dirty stuff from a van and meet with clients on the same day, and currently (during non-covid days) in warehouse 2x/week though I don't have the shoe requirement.  You know the culture of the place best, I've found that in warehouse most people respect the manager more when they are dressed appropriately for the warehouse work, vs. when they dress mostly to "look like a manager".  But I also think there is something wanting to look more professional than just a shlubby t shirt, or at least having the option especially at first.  Knit polos with belted chinos or workpants look great and slightly professional while built for action.  Ponte work pants with an elastic waist are another option for days when you need to look dressier (such as a meeting), though I wouldn't get anything too fancy.  Durable button downs are another go-to.  They work well for layering - you can short sleeve or long sleeve, and wear them alone or over a camisole, shell, or t shirt.  Casual styles and fabrics like denim, flannel, twill, etc. work best.  Tops made of knit t-shirt fabric but with slightly dressier details or cuts are good.  One of my favorites of these I've had is a Lands End dark print long sleeve tee with a boatneck.  Looks dressier than a t shirt, and the dark print hides the occasional smudge.  This is also a way to achieve a more feminine style if that is an option you want.  Lands End, LL Bean, Carhartt, Duluth Trading Co. (sizes run large), Patagonia (including used, $$ but the stuff is indestructible), Eddie Bauer is the type of stuff I'd look at.	episode_done:True

text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:I manage a farmers market and can wind up doing tons of different things throughout the day. I normally wear sneakers but I always have a pair of timberland hiking boots with me incase I need to go in the fields. I usually wear two different outfit styles- black skinny jeans with black Nike airmax, loose graphic/solid tee, with an open flannel or oversized denim jacket. Other style is dirty-white converse, loose vintage mom jeans, tight solid colored top and either no jacket or a cropped hoodie. I keep my nails neat and painted and wear a thin gold necklace and diamond studs, so this helps me look a little nicer. Obviously my styles don't have to be as formal as yours but I'm also a manager so I usually look more put together than my coworkers who often wear leggings/athletic clothes.	episode_done:True
text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:/r/BlueCollarWomen might be of help here.  I split my time between the office (well, from home) and field work. For boots, I LOVE my Carhartt 6" composite toe hiking boots. I tried construction sole boots for a hot second and decided I have better traction with hiking boots. Red Wings has several women's safety toe shoes as well  For pants (again of the more cargo/field variety), I love 5.11 Tactical. They have women's cargo pants that are durable, actually cut for those of us with an ass, have useable pockets, and have a *hammer loop*. I bought one pair, tested it out for a month, loved them, and went back for 2 more.  As for looking professional, polo shirts are the default, but not particularly fashionable. Tailored fit button down camping shirts might be worth looking into as well. I'm not much help here because any time I'm meeting non-company personnel on site, I'm probably wearing company branded outerwear.	episode_done:False
text:I am between an office and field also and I find good comfy boots, and comfortable base layers such as cami, t, and “long underwear” in the winter.  It makes a difference, I wear a uniform so it is pretty “lite” on make up and jewellery, but I work on a simple but nice job on my hair as it is also quite long and needs to be tied up high!.    If I need to be at a more professional or less “uniform” I will bring if I have to travel that day or while on course, I will take a few button ups , a nice blouse, and dress pants or skirt and tights.  As it is a toned down environment, it means classic but cute, so a nice set of earrings, classy but simple make up and a few muted accessories., a really cute classic skirt is easy to travel and pair it with a variety of shoes will work nicely.  It is a bit of a hassle bringing more clothes as well as shoes but it is often business casual.    I try and go a tad more than chinos and a polo if possible as I do not dress up often and it is a fun mix up.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:For boots, I found Keen's women's work boots to be the most comfortable. I especially liked the Seattle line with an aluminum toe for my job but they have a ton of different styles with varying levels of safety ratings.   I've worked ina variety of mining and industrial settings and jeans were the norm for a normal work day, but that'll probably depend on your specific workplace. Many women wore skinny jeans or bootcut jeans.   I often just paired my jeans and boots with a sweater or closer cut blouse and cardigan. Occasionally I'd wear the polo my company gave me with a north face zip up.	episode_done:False
text:Forgot to mention. I'd invest in a couple of pairs of nice wool socks if you're going to be wearing boots or heavy shoes for 12 hours. They can be a little expensive but so worth it for comfort and durability. I recommend the Darn Tough brand, especially because you can exchange them for a new pair if they ever have any problems, but any brand that you see in bass pro or rei will probably be nice. I recall that farm to feet is a little cheaper and still great.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:If you don't have any requirements about synthetic fabrics, you have a lot more options. Are you in a climate controlled warehouse? I basically dress for outside weather every day just in case I get stuck out there all day.  Golf polos and dark jeans. T-shirts and tops with fancy/formal detailing (like a half zip and a little pocket, or a fabric with a neat pattern or modest see-through or lacey details on the shoulders). If they have giveaway or purchasable polos with the company logo those are a good option. I used to only wear unisex cotton blend tshirts to work on the days when I would be sweating a lot, but I invested in some nicer athletic fabric v neck tees from Under Armour and now even drenched in sweat I at least look better than I did in high school marching band camp. Also on the topic of sweating, if you know you'll get gross, bring a change of clothes so you can look and feel fresh for your afternoon meetings!  I've seen some womens' only safety toe brands, but never tried them. I use the free boot truck at work. But they have some that we call the "el jefe" boots, that look more like boating shoes or desert boots or are a nicer looking leather. Those might be a good option to make you feel confident and put together.  I think fit goes a long way to make you look professional (and like a boss).	episode_done:False

text:Closet Organization By Color	labels:I organize by type and sleeve length than color. So sweaters, long sleeve knit, long sleep top, short sleeve, tank and than withing this categories I do color. I find it easiest to navigate depending on the weather.

text:Closet Organization By Color	labels:Personally, I do this, but only within seasonal categories. As for dresses and jumpsuits, they're divided into cotton / linen and wool, but tops only are divided in "autumn / winter", "spring" and "summer" (I've had it "two" seasons before and didn't work). Longsleeves are "spring" while short sleeves are "summer", then there's the chambrays and flannels which are "autumn" and knits are somewhere else altogether.	episode_done:True
text:Closet Organization By Color	labels:My system includes by color, but it's a little complicated:  Left door: Dress/formal clothes   Right door: Casual clothes    I then categorize clothes by warmth, which is usually just sleeve length. No sleeves are in the center of the closet, then short sleeves, then long sleeves. Coats and jackets are at the edges.    Then each warmth section is organized by color: Black, grey, white, black/grey/white mix, cream/tan, brown, yellow, orange, red, pink, purple, blue, green.    It helps me readily identify where I have gaps in my wardrobe, whether I am ready for the upcoming seasons, and makes picking clothes super easy for the day's weather.	episode_done:True
text:Closet Organization By Color	labels:I organize in order of my thought process of what o want to wear. Typically I think about the type of clothing, the color I want, and then the sleeve length, dress length, or pant length. So each category of clothing is separated (tops, jackets, dresses, skirts, pants) then each category is organized by color. Within each color I order from shortest to longest (sleeve length, dress length, etc). Within each length I go lightest to darkest.   This method works well for my style of thinking, and I LOVE how it looks so organized and visually pleasing. I would really try to track your thought process when picking out an item/outfit and organize from there!	episode_done:True

text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:I don’t do it consecutively because it’s too eye catching and people conclude all sorts of things (incl. you spent the night elsewhere and never returned home) and also I find it a bit boring to wear the same thing two days in a row when I have an audience of people observing my dress. But I will like wear the same outfit later in the week absolutely, or mix say a Monday pant into a Thursday outfit or a Tuesday top into a Friday outfit. My work “capsule” wardrobe is very limited because I wanted to have nice things for my job but not buy too many things.  On the weekends, I’ve been known to wear the same outfit Saturday and Sunday for sure but I don’t typically see the same people/go to the same places on both days  I think most people innately crave identity and variety especially if fashion is something that they enjoy. Not everyone need be that way though, and I encourage you to do whatever works best for you, even if you buy 5 of the same outfit and wear it exclusively all week, every week - that can be a look and a statement too	episode_done:True

text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:So I did this for a week once as a social experiment.  I was sick of putting together new outfits everyday and was curious if people would notice. I wore the same blouse, blazer and pants for an entire work week (yes I washed them). I don’t remember if I changed my necklace or shoes at all. Hair and makeup are always the same for work so that wasn’t a factor.  Nobody commented or seemed to notice throughout the week. On Friday afternoon I asked people if they had noticed anything about my appearance and they said no, and when I told them about my experiment they seemed genuinely surprised!  The biggest surprise for ME was how bored I quickly became. I basically felt like a cartoon character and was excited to wear my other clothes again.  So no, I don’t think it matters, but if you plan on doing this long-term I would recommend buying multiples of the same item to eliminate excessive laundry.	episode_done:True

text:I am older than most here, I suppose. When I was in high school, dresses and heels were not unusual (in the mid-late 70's). I liked the variety of clothes I was able to wear and enjoyed "dressing up" once a week or more!  In college, daily clothes were jeans, blouses, sweaters. I had one friend who dressed to the nines everyday-makeup, hair, the works.  I admired her and I wish now that I would have followed her example. I was too afraid to stand out and also too lazy! I did only what I needed to do to stay a B student. Staying up late at parties makes it hard to wake up and do your hair. She was also at the top of the class (chemical engineering) and was a talented actress. I don't think she missed out on fun, but probably didn't have as many hangovers as I did.  I never went back to "daily dressy" at work (flats and trousers in the lab), but I didn't wear jeans every day until grad school.  My message- don't be afraid to stand out! Express yourself and you will have plenty of admirers. Encourage others to do the same.	labels:	episode_done:True

By deliberate choice I mean things like a character wearing obviously different clothes to most of the rest of the cast to show they're old fashioned, or quirky and so on.  I'm certainly not saying don't look to film and TV for inspo, but either try to modify what you see to more match where you are, or accept the fact you might look more dressed up than the majority and go with it anyway.	episode_done:True

text:What is your favorite clothing/accessories subscription box?	labels:I've tried Stitchfix, Nordstrom Trunk Club and MM Lafleur.   Stitchfix was just laughable, in one box I got a pair of skinny black jeans and a note from the "stylist" saying that since I lived in NYC I should own a pair. All the clothes were items you could get cheaper at Nordstrom Rack (really, I checked a few).   MM Lafleur was overpriced for the quality and I felt the clothes lacked personality, though I could see this being helpful to someone who doesn't know where to start with office wear.   Nordstrom was ok but they couldn't nail my style and what would work on my body. I ended up keeping a  couple of items though, I tend to shop in a specific brand segment and price range and they sent me items  from brands I would normally dismiss as "too basic" that turned out to be good. They were also more tuned into mainstream trends (I'm sure they have research on this). With a slightly higher hit rate I might have tried this one longer.  I've been offered personal shopping a few times but that was out of my spending comfort zone in the end.  I subscribe to Scentbox (fragrance subscription). You can get more bang for your buck with decant stores, I guess, but I think their packaging is really nice and it's a fun way to try new things.	episode_done:False

text:What is your favorite clothing/accessories subscription box?	labels:I got free Stitchfix credit from a friend, so I've used Stitchfix a couple of times. (disclaimer: I haven't tried anything else). I was very specific about my body type in the profile section, and after the first box I was very specific to the stylist about what types of clothes I wanted to try and what I didn't like. There's also a small extra info box on your profile where you can mention specifics, e.g. looking for more business casual pieces, would never wear X things, live in a warm climate, etc.      I think styling services like Stitchfix work best when you know yourself well— for example, I'm petite, proportionally really short legs, and I know what doesn't work for me (animal prints, dots, shift dresses, low heels). I specifically noted items that I felt like had a low chance of success in terms of fit (e.g. jeans, blazers) and casual items (not worth the $$) as items that I did not want to receive.     The more specific you can be, the better a box you'll get. This does mean that you're less likely to need the help of a stylist to find pieces for you, but it can be fun to try on things you wouldn't have picked up on your own.	episode_done:True

text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I'd get a really nice piece of outerwear, either a coat in a quality material like wool or a leather or shearling jacket. If you live somewhere with colder weather during part of the year, outerwear is something you'll be wearing all the time so it's worth investing in a piece that's great quality, keeps you warm and makes a statement. I think an amazing jacket or coat will elevate even the most basic outfit, whether it's a more classic piece, something utilitarian like a puffer jacket or something more extravagant. Personally I think Acne, Chloe and Tibi are brands that make great high-end outerwear in a variety of styles.	episode_done:False

These have been for personal milestones, though, not professional. If I were celebrating a professional success, I'd probably buy a bag or something that I could carry all my work items in and still look fashionable and professional.	episode_done:True

text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:Jewelry. Real metal and stones. Whatever your personal style is.  I tend to mark milestones with a new piece. I like Native American made sterling with turquoise and I work in an artistic field, so these are signature pieces for me. $1k would get me a bracelet with a large, fine stone or a reasonably important squash blossom necklace. I also like to support Native artists and buy directly from them whenever possible; this is how many support their families and put food on their table.	episode_done:False
text:I love this idea! My husband is Native and tribal-enrolled. We go back and visit family on the res during the holidays so I should make sure to stop by the tribe's artisan boutique.

text:I agree but this is also a slippery slope that I have personally succumbed to. If you can afford to spend a little more, Id say spend some time finding ethical brands that fit your style. They’re out there somewhere. The stuff I find on Poshmark usually is just okay fitting and i almost always find a good reason why the original owner wanted to sell it (e.g. slightly ill fitting.) instead of wasting money (and gas/materials because packages need to be packaged and shipped), take the time to research companies and KNOW YOUR MEASUREMENTS if you want to buy online.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:But the second question is where to buy second hand from? For example near me we have the Salvation Army and a church thrift shop. I used to live next to a giant Salvation Army donation center and loved it, but after learning about their philosophy and some of the shady things they’ve done I no longer feel like I can ethically support them! Then supporting the local church thrift is also problematic given their stances on social issues! When I lived in California I was able to find some thrift stores that actually gave to causes I support (out of the closet etc) but now that I’m in the Midwest there aren’t any of these! I just want like a thrift store that donates to something like education or food banks without the religious/social aspect.	labels:In my part of Canada, basically the only two thrift stores are Value Village (for-profit company which donates a portion of its proceeds to a diabetes charity), and Goodwill By Salvation Army (non profit/charity I believe? With a history of discrimination against LGBT community and poor treatment of workers with disabilities)   The most common reaction I get, when people say "where did you get that sweater" and I say "Value Village", is  "ewwww, didn't you know that's a for profit company! You're wasting your time buying used, you're so foolish thinking you're a good person when you're just supporting some *corporation*, that's so gross, you're just as bad as me so don't pat yourself on the back for shopping there, you capitalist!"   And like... Really?? Wtf is up with that response? I'd rather support a for-profit used clothing store, than a for-profit new clothing store like Walmart or Forever 21. Isn't doing something better than doing nothing? Or, as the saying goes," don't let perfection be the enemy of good?"    (especially when my only alternative to value village is... Pretty much the last charity I'd want my money going to)	episode_done:True

You'll be surprised at what you may find in your area that is not one of the big names. Most will have a FB page that you can check out who owns them. Another idea is there may be a store that is set up to do annual/seasonal pop up style consignment where they hold a sale from a Thursday-Saturday. And finally try Poshmark, while some folks like to do insane mark ups, there are other sellers who just want to move their stuff out. You can do offers and bundles that can help drive down the cost.	episode_done:True

text:I partially agree with you. But the company still benefit from second hand purchases.   The second hand price is based on supply/demand, buying the unethical brand even second hand shows demand and increase public perception of the brand then prices go up. That’s why some brands are still more expensive than others even in thrift store.  Yet if you like an unethical brand, like you said, buying second hand is better.	labels:Postmark and eBay are full of people who intentionally sell for secondary market.

text:Black is Beautiful, Braids are Beautiful, Bald is Beautiful: Ayanna Pressley as an icon of feminine professionalism	labels:I think people just now are starting to really see the beauty in blackness, not just in fashion sense, which has always been apparent, but also in human terms.  I mean, black people or people of black skin color have been painted in very ugly and negative terms for hundreds if not thousands of years.  And that has been done by people of light skin color.  I have not seen a lot of examples of people of dark skin color vilifying people of white skin color, just based on their skin color alone.    This stuff has been around for thousands of years.  I think it really started with the Romans and the great lie they have perpetrated to steal the identity of Christ, because they could not contain the spread of Christianity despite the persecution of Christians after Christ's death.    The color black in fashion has always been wildly successful.  However, that success has never translated to black people or people of black skin color because of the concerted effort that has been done throughout millenia against them.  Black beauty is a light within which had been hidden from the world.  Despite efforts to reverse this coming to light, or as I would call it Black Enlightment, it is undeniable that this trend too is unstoppable.  Justice for All...	episode_done:True

text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I would love to see these boots!   I’ve had good luck for myself at Goodwill lately too- a merino and a cotton knit chunky sweater that spark joy at the changing of the seasons, and a J. Crew Lady Day coat- $400 new, knee length, wool and thinsulate- that needs a little love and repair. I don’t know where the heck I’m going to wear it but since 3 strangers commented “that fits you perfectly” while I was standing at the mirror trying to figure out when I’ll ever have an occasion for it, I decided it was meant to be.	episode_done:True
text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:Love hearing about your UGG transformation!  While I have purchased probably my normal amount of items during Rona, I've been resisting the impulse to shop more often and have been pretty successful in seeking and finding those boosts from my existing closet.  I've been challenging myself to approach fashion as a **verb**, not just something that I buy.  Weirdly, when I did a pretty major closet clean out during quarantine, I ended up feeling like I owned \*more\* afterward.    Not nearly as dramatic a transformation as your Uggs, but yesterday I took my ankle boots to be resoled and a belt to be repaired.  Afterward I was like, dang, these are some sharp boots.  Focusing on decent quality within the context of my budget and taking care of my stuff has made me more thankful for the awesome stuff I own, and really how much I have.  I've done a lot of shopping my closet and making new fits out of existing items.  I've found myself feeling more of a sense of abundance and creativity, while I have identified a few gaps and have shopped a bit to fill them, I often have a sense of "I can't wait to wear all these great fits I created!"  \[while working from home as my son rolls his eyes at mom, lol\]  Which feels indulgent, fun, and gives me a boost without shopping.  Like you I also enjoy variety - I can't be a minimalist all the time, sometimes I want big colors, bold patterns, different looks.  Even so I'm finding I'm pretty happy with the mix of colors / patterns / neutrals that I own; my accessories go a long way, and I'm finding myself able to creatively achieve a lot of variety.  I won't pretend I never have the impulse to shop, I research a lot and I do resist that on a regular basis.  But I'm happy to report that I'm having a lot of fun with what I own already.	episode_done:True
text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I’ve actually completely changed how I shop. I’ve been focusing on high-quality investment pieces rather than trend pieces. It’s definitely a lot slower to build my closet this way, but I just want a closet that I love so I can eventually just “shop” my closet every morning instead of always feeling the need to add to it. For a lot of my high end pieces, I’ve been going for secondhand sites so I don’t have to worry about quality or authenticity. Personally, I don’t mind spending several hundreds of dollars on a pair of designer shoes that I know I’m going to love for the next 10 year (and are actually made to last that long) rather than cycling through low end finds all the time. But that’s just me.	episode_done:True
text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I've been conscious of the impact of just buying junk for a lot of years now, but the current state of the world is just hitting even harder now and it's even MORE important to me that the things I buy are:   1. useful with what I already own,   2. actually going to make me happy longer than the "new stuff" endorphin rush lasts,   3. actually functional and as well-made and low-fuss as possible.   I just want things that I can put on, take off, wash, hang, and wear again time and time again without it being a fight. The 'YAY NEW THING' glow wears off almost by the time you get the shipping notice, so there has to be more reward in it for it to be worth it. There's more joy to be had (more long-lasting joy anyway) with finding new ways to wear old things. If I can remix a piece 9 different ways, I feel pretty baller about it! So that's my focus. If adding something new to the mix will make the remixing easier for lots of other items (a blazer, for example, that means I can wear 5 other tops to work that I couldn't before) then it's probably a good purchase. So I suppose "shop with long-term remixing in mind" is probably my biggest suggestion.  Personally I haven't had much luck thrifting but that's probably due to a champagne taste fighting with a beer budget city. Can't find treasures when the stock isn't super great. That said, we're at least stellar for used outdoor clothing and gear, so I guess I can't complain there.	episode_done:True
text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I've been on a fashion sustainability journey for a while now - in 2019 I vowed to only buy recycled fibers - and did so until early 2020. Somewhere along the line, I realized that's really not the best thing, and went on a no-buy.  Then I discovered depop.   I was pretty restrained to begin with, then, driven by my love for variety that is quite similar to yours, went on a bit of a spree of buying all the things I've been holding back from for a few years. That said, I probably only purchased 10-15 items in total, and out of those, only one has turned out to be a dud (slightly too small, will sell on), so I'm pretty pleased.  I also naturally tend to buy things that will fit with the rest of my closet, so I never had much of an issue there. It was a little difficult when I decided to transition from a very professional to a more "me" wardrobe, but I did it over time, and now I'm quite happy with how it's gone.   The thing I did recently is branch out into accessories - and I've been getting either second-hand/vintage, or unique handmade items from artisans. That's been a whole lot of fun, and I feel like I'm supporting the right people.  I don't have that many restoration tips, but I've learned some decent care tips over time. My favourite one at the moment concerns white shoes (sue me, I'm a sucker for them) - wipe them down every time you wear them and they likely won't require a huge clean at any point! Depending on where you go, of course. I also like to air out my clothing before I decide they absolutely need a wash, especially blazers. If you're persistent enough, most smells will dissipate over time. Just don't put anything in direct sunlight, colours might get washed out!	episode_done:True
text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:Well, I decided that becuase my current round of clothes is on its way out (bought three-four years ago, beginning and end of fifth grade) I’m sewing everything I can of the next one, and buying what I can’t custom (gloves, a scarf). Durable, in colours and materials I want, cheaper, and shouldn’t need replacing till the end of highschool (I started this year.). Added bonus is that I’ve never had a single store bought item fit before I altered it (I’ve altered everything I own at this point.) while stuff I sew fits first try. I posted my working list on r/capsulewardrobe recently.	episode_done:True
text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I just did a very similar thing with a pair of boots I got for $7 at the thrift store. They’re a beautiful shade of light blue and were faded, stained and creased. I just knew I could clean them up though. Well, they came out looking almost brand new with a little leather cleaner and a LOT of conditioning!

text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I've purchased several pieces of secondhand jewelry, both from physical thrift shops and one big mixed lot on Ebay. With the work from home/daily video calls life, where nobody sees me for more than an hour at a time and from the collarbone up, lasting until who knows when, I've had the desire to change up my jewelry from simple and delicate, with a lot of long necklaces, to something more colorful, bold, and closer to the face.  It's all cheap costume jewelry that I wouldn't buy new, but with the environmental impact already made it's a fun addition. Everything has been cool toned (green and blue) to go with the color palette I've been feeling lately. It doesn't need to be comfortable all day, just show up on camera until I take it off. Some of it even has visible wear that would be too much for wearing in public, but it doesn't show up on camera, so video calls are a perfect way to expand its usable lifespan.	episode_done:False

text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I just found out about goodwill outlet bins recently and I am soooooo excited about the idea of going there , but I'm scared to go during COVID because I'm personally following a "only go to stores where I can maintain 6 ft social distancing space at all times" policy.

I'm very curious, what are your personal experiences? Should I feel safe checking it out/are there new safety rules in place, or should I wait for a few months?	episode_done:False
text:It depends on the location. My local one is not as disgusting as you sometimes hear, but it is absolutely people everywhere. An hour and a half away, everything is meticulously monitored and clean.   The hullaballoo generally occurs around the new bins that they bring out. I find that most people do the first layer or so and move on so if you dig deeper, there's still good stuff left there. I don't crowd for new bins even pre-COVID and when everyone's in the new bins, it gives you a lot of space to peruse literally every other bin in there.	labels:Thanks for the reply!

text:How many handbags do you have and which one is your most used?	labels:I tend to keep one large daily purse. I prefer real leather, but it doesn't have to be designer, just well-made. This bag gets the most use (and abuse), and when it wears out, I replace it.  I have one casual bag that I bought easily a decade ago. It's the ThinkGeek Handbag of Holding, and it has so many pockets. It was my daily bag at a different phase of my life. It isn't dressy enough for the office, but I'll use it on camping/beach trips when I don't want to throw my work purse into the sand.  I also have 4-5 smaller purses that I've received as gifts over the years. I don't use those very often, as I prefer larger bags, but I save them for job interviews, weddings, and other special occasions. And since they don't get much use, they tend to stay in great condition.	episode_done:True

text:How many handbags do you have and which one is your most used?	labels:Currently, I have two Coach and one Kate Spade, but I tend to carry the same bag every day.

If I wanted a luxury bag like Chanel, I would either have to dip into savings for it or put it on credit (which is a no-no for me).

If you have a MasterClass pass anyway I’d say watch it, but I don’t know if it’s worth it for more experienced folks. He talks about building a capsule wardrobe and drives home what basics you need, but I was not impressed with his demonstrations of styling a dress. Perhaps if he had shown a more advanced view of styling with accessories and creating a look, but it was very entry level. There’s also a bit about building your confidence and believing in yourself.	episode_done:True

text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:I think buying *nothing* except bills and groceries might be a little unrealistic, given that you've slipped up a few times. Can you give yourself a small budget? Personally, I have a yearly budget for clothing. Some months I spend nothing, some months I spend more, but it's all bugeted for.  Overspending on clothes can come from treating shopping as a hobby. I switched from browsing online stores to looking at high fashion photo shoots and shows. Still scratches the fashion itch. But you can't exactly impulse buy a $10,000 dress.   Can you also try focusing on other, non-fashion related hobbies? Reading is a great one for me, and I don't spend anything on it because my local libraries are awesome.	episode_done:True
text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:I've been in the same boat!   This may be counterintuitive but I had to be honest with myself about how much I love dressing up: a while ago I decided to make space in my budget for clothes after I tried spending $0 and failed miserably. Paired with a closet assessment of needs vs wants AND actually making a monthly budget, I've been able to curb my impulse purchases.	episode_done:True
text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:First step is to be realistic and honest with yourself. Unless we’re talking about crippling debt or something you can’t pay off within 9-12 months while still living comfortably, there’s no reason to cut all spending. Just scale it back and make a small shopping budget for yourself.   Consistency pays off debt better and faster than trying to bite off more than you can chew. Take it easy and be realistic, you’ll be okay!	episode_done:True
text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:Download a budgeting app so you can visualize what you're spending and get alerts if you're overspending in a certain category. Or if you want to put in more effort, make your own spreadsheet.   If you want to be hardcore, you could make a separate debit card that is ONLY for non-necessity expenses--and fill that every month with $XX   -----  Also, don't buy stuff for the future or imaginary events. When I was younger and just earning my own pocket cash, I'd buy fancy dresses that I literally had no occasion to wear, just because they looked good on me lol. They weren't expensive, but they were unnecessary expenses.    Buy stuff when you need it. Only exception being CRAZY good deals on stuff you will actually need.	episode_done:True
text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:On top of what you’ve already done and what everyone else is suggesting I would add spending less time online if possible!

text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:When I did a shopping detox a few years ago, I found that using shopping to fill time was as big an issue for me as wanting new things. Yes, the fun of the purchase and desire to wear something new contributed to shopping. But the bigger issue for me was that I used shopping to fill downtime. It was an issue at in-person stores, e.g. in between a fitness class and work, and at home when I had plenty of time for online shopping. I had to find other ways to fill my time. I took walks between errands and tasks. I did some errands and maintenance work that I'd been putting off. I read and exercised more. It helped me see how much time I was dedicating to shopping and how much time I had available for other things if I shifted priorities a bit.	episode_done:True
text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:Organize & clean everything I already own before I buy.   For example, if I want to buy another pair of jeans & a top, I do my laundry and put it all away and have my closet looking uncluttered. Often I just want the feeling of something clean & new. It also helps me purchase items I might actually wear more often because as I put items away I think about how much I enjoy/wear them and why	episode_done:True

text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:Here are a few things that helped me get over a skincare addiction:  - Unsubscribe from emailed coupons and deals. Just bc it's on sale doesn't mean you need it.    - Unsubscribe from subreddits (yes, here included if you often get the urge to buy after seeing inspo) and YouTube videos of "hauls" or whatever else makes you want to purchase. Pinterest, maybe?   - Make a list of things you need/want and ONLY buy those things  - Put items in your cart and wait 2 days or more.   - If you don't already, get a budget app (every dollar is free) and use it.	episode_done:True
text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:Remove yourself from the mailing list for all shopping vendors that you have coming into your inbox. They'll tempt you every time you get a notification. Likewise, maybe take a break from any of the fashion social media items that you follow, Instagram, Pinterest, certain subreddits.  &#x200B;  This advice might sound really weird, but I actually did this successfully a couple times during the initial shutdown. I caught a couple of those amazing sales and I added a lot items. I got a really good  "ooo 75% off!" high. Then I looked at the cart and logged off. I never actually purchased the items. I got the shoppers' high, but I didn't spend any of my actual money.	episode_done:True
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Also, this is a common rule, but no clothing that requires anything special to wear it - eg a shirt that only works when you switch around the bra straps of your convertible bra, a dress that requires shapewear to look how you want it to look, a wrap blouse that has to be pinned into place after you put it on, a shirt that requires another shirt underneath because it’s see-through - all of those are a no for me.

I find that the dry clean only versions of these items are sturdier and made of thicker material than the non dry clean only versions so it’s worth it to me to take those in once a month or every other month depending on level of wear.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Pssst. You don't need to look "in" the way you think you do. Your clothes don't have to look like you bought them all this year. You are allowed to repeat outfits. You don't HAVE to consciously try to express yourself through clothes. You don't constantly have to try to visually display a personality to strangers. You can opt out and wear simple outfits like 90% of everyone. It's OK.     Sometimes the pressure feels suffocating, I know. But it's OK to not follow every trend. Despite what some posters in this sub think, the vast majority of people will not notice that you bought your jumper/coat/whatever in 2018. I actually like clothes and fashion but sometimes I'm too tired and just do the uniform thing. I just try changing how I do my makeup if I feel bored now, before trying to remix my whole wardrobe. I gave myself new eyebrows and tried a different style of eyeliner and I look different enough people asked if I had a hair cut (lol) which didn't involve even buying new makeup.    As for comments on my appearance, if they aren't nice or helpful ("You haven't blended your concealer" "You have leaves in your hair" "your shirt has popped open") I ignore it.	episode_done:True

I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.	episode_done:False
text:When I was going into the office I did this.

text:Revisiting Tim Gunn's List of 10 Style Must-haves	labels:To me, this is “wardrobe staples if you have a traditional office job with a business dress code” tbh. I do, so I own a version of most of these, but that kind of work environment is less and less common, and I think a lot of women no longer have much use for blazers, trench coats, dress pants, etc.	episode_done:False
text:I feel like this list can be modernized by stating an item's function, rather than defining what the items themselves should be.   For instance, instead of the blazer and dress pants, the description "an outfit well-suited for a professional job interview" would work well, and then one could discuss various pieces that could work within these constraints, such as a well-fitting cardigan and a pencil skirt.   Instead of a "little black dress," what they really mean is "an easy and versatile somewhat-formal piece" that's suitable for anything from a work happy hour to a holiday party and is easy to dress up or down. Doesn't have to be a dress, doesn't have to be black, but something that has the same level of versatility and formality that's appropriate for multiple occasions.   Instead of "classic white shirt," could mean a "versatile neutral top" that can be coordinated multiple ways across multiple contexts, worn casually on its own or as a foundation piece under a pantsuit. "Trench coat" is similar--a piece of outerwear that has trend longevity and can be worn atop most outfits, but obviously this changes depending on your climate; a down coat could fill this wardrobe niche if you're somewhere cold.	labels:	episode_done:True

I personally own a black blazer that I think I've worn to two interviews, and that's about it.  In fact, I think I would just update the list to replace a blazer with some sort of cardigan. I feel they fit in with a wider range of styles than a fitted blazer does at this point.	labels:Its jeans and t-shirts at my job. Maybe... someone wears a polo.

Even thinking of my most successful friends, none of these are relevant to my life or that of my peers, except for jeans lol. It's funny how alien it actually is, when they're supposedly "must haves".	labels:Weirdly, I’m very much a person to whom the list is totally applicable, since I wear suiting to work so I own and wear multiples of almost everything on the list.   But because of that I know exactly how unusual that is, I think, since literally no one in my social circle has the same kind of work wardrobe I have and I’ve seen so much here about what most people consider “work appropriate” but would *never* be acceptable for me. I feel like I work in the world’s last (not business formal) office where jeans are not even a possibility and suit jackets (even ties for men) are the norm, not unusually formal.   I hope that once covid is over and I go back to the office, things will relax a little since we’ve been seeing each other in tees and sweaters over Zoom for so long, but I have a feeling I’m still gonna have to yank on some hosiery and a blazer and toddle on back in my pumps like no one ever saw me wearing a pair of purple floral leggings chasing my dog out of a room on a videoconference.	episode_done:True
text:Revisiting Tim Gunn's List of 10 Style Must-haves	labels:This list honestly matches pretty well with my wardrobe, even in the time of Corona. Though some pieces I bought well before I grew into them stylistically:  - Classic black trench coat: I bought this in college but it was easily 8 years before I really felt comfortable wearing it regularly. Still looks great though :)  - Patterned skirt: have had this since high school 0-0. Didn't really wear it from about age 18-26, but it's still a fantastic piece that I wore regularly to work and will again.  I went through a phase where I threw a blazer over *everything* so I still have a bunch, including one that lived in my office if I had to go into a client meeting on short notice.	episode_done:True
text:Revisiting Tim Gunn's List of 10 Style Must-haves	labels:No. I work outside. I have no use for a lot of these items.   I need my closet to flatter me AND be physically functional.	episode_done:True
text:Revisiting Tim Gunn's List of 10 Style Must-haves	labels:*  little black dress     * I think any solid color dress for semi-formal occasions that can be dressed down to casual or dressed up to business casual are good to keep on hand for emergencies when you don't have time to find anything in particular for an event if you don't typically have events to go to. Patterns can make a dress over casual and sometimes date it, and black can wash a lot of people out. I have a jeweltone purple dress than compliments my red hair and it's my staple dress.  * trench coat    * Have one, love one, makes me feel put together in the fall and spring when I'm wearing my lovely frumpy sweaters and my only pair of waterproof boots.  * classic dress pants    * Personally, no - my office is more good jeans with a top than dress pants, and there's no scenario outside my office in which I'd wear a pair.  * versatile skirt    * I have a black circle skirt and a black mini skirt that goes with all of my sweaters and all of my tank tops. When you want to feel dressy but not too dressy, it's a good go-to, otherwise replace with dress pants if that's your vibe.  * fitted blazer    * I never remember that I own one, but wouldn't invest unless you're a blazer person or you meet clients in a professional setting.  * classic white shirt    * For the longest time, I didn't think these were necessary, but they so are. I have a plain white tee, a ruffled sleeve tee, and a white button up shirt because in a pinch I can wear them with everything.  * day dress    * No? replace with anything that's throw on comfort but looks chic with a good pair of shoes. Feel like nowadays it's more romper, jumpsuit, etc than just a standard wrap dress.  * cashmere sweater    * Literally cannot think of when I'd want a cashmere sweater, the care for these is annoying.  * well fitting jeans    * A game changer * sweatsuit alternative    * fight me in my joggers * a wildcard item    * I don't drop cash on things that go out of style as a temporary trend.	episode_done:True

text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:I have a capsule wardrobe for my corporate work wear cause I don't like having to think about what I wear. It's about 20 pieces, mainly navy, black and white with a couple of floral pieces for a statement. But my everyday casual wear I tried a capsule but decided against it. I enjoy experimenting with styles and different outfits too much. I found a capsule too limiting for my casual wear.	episode_done:True
text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:real question - what's the difference between "capsule" and "uniform"? I have a tendency to wear the same thing, or very similar things	episode_done:False
text:In my book a capsule is more oriented on the mix and match part - where things are cohesive and fit together. E.g. my wardrobe is the following colors and my 3 blouses can easily pair with my 5 bottoms of all types.    But the uniform is more like I always wear these shapes and these items - there is a standard structure to my outfits - black pants, neutral t-shirt, jean jacket.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:The concept of a capsule closet is intriguing. My closet is a behemoth, but I always find myself enjoying my outfits more when living out of a suitcase (rip pre-covid travel).   I don’t want to truly empty my closet out, but started to dedicate one clothing rail to the seasonal attempt at bringing a capsule wardrobe together. Tbh, I’ll never be a genuine capsule wardrobe person.	episode_done:True
text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:I love the idea of them \[Less decision making for me!  More time in the morning! Less clutter!\], but in practice they don't work great for me \[I get bored easily, I like a variety of styles, I love to play with clothes\].  I'm working on figuring out what 'styles' I enjoy, and a few pieces that would fit each style, so that I can have maximum options with a minimal(dish) amount.       I've been working on creating a capsule just for work though - even though my job skews casual, there are some safety rules that I should abide by when I'm in the lab space like long pants and closed toe shoes.  Plus, I seem to be more productive when I'm dressed more business-y.  I haven't figured out how to separate them in my closet though since we don't have a ton a space in our loft.	episode_done:True
text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:I use a capsule when I travel. I stick to the same few colours, in re-mixeable pieces:  &#x200B;  |Item|Colour| |:-|:-| |T-shirt|white, black| |Blouse|white| |Collared dress shirt|white with grey pinstripe| |Blouse|dark navy blue| |Cardigan|grey| |Blazer|grey, black, and white tweed| |Pants|burgundy trousers| |Pants|olive trousers| |Pants|denim| |Pants|comfortable leggings| |Dress|knee-length black sheath dress| |Skirt|burgundy pencil skirt| |Tights|opaque black| |Flats|black leather| |Heels|black leather| |Earrings|simple studs, elaborate studs| |Necklace|dainty pendant| |Watch|simple and masculine|  With this, I feel like I'm ready for anything: a lecture, a meeting, a dinner with family, dinner out with friends.  I used to overload my suitcase with special pieces or statement pieces, and I would wear them once each (if that). It took me a long time to realize that, for me, a trip is not the time to use unique pieces. I need combine-able things that look cohesive.	episode_done:True
text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:I love love the concept of "Capsule wardrobes". Maybe other people find it restricting but I find it liberating. I get easily overwhelmed with too many choices (I also tend to feel guilty when I see a piece I haven't worn for a long time like I wasted my money and that it is harmful for the environment). I have put an effort in buying less but buying a quality piece (for the environment ya know) so all I need is 20 pieces of clothing.  I usually include a couple of trendy pieces. a leather jacket. a fur jacket. a nice tan color wool jacket. another beige wool jacket. 2-3 high-waisted trouser/tailored-pants. 1 denim jean. 1 white blouse. Sometimes I include dresses and skirts depend on the season. I usually don't include skirts and dresses though because they are not as versatile but I tend to keep a beige silk wrap skirt.  Since I own less, I am able to care for each item more. Each piece is very loved.	episode_done:True
text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:I have one. It works for both my office job and casual life as I like to be dressed up when I go out. It has around 12 pieces, not including shoes,undergarments or accessories. They're in neutral colors and my pop of color comes through my accessories (normally glasses or shoes but sometimes jewelry). I love it. I've paired it down to things I actually wear and slowly I've been replacing my fast fashion items when they're beyond wear with things that match my morals now. it's def a bit more pricier now but I feel good wearing them and know they'll last.	episode_done:True
text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:I just did the same thing! I created a test capsule and put it in a specific section of my closet. I dressed exclusively from it for 2-3 weeks, and still mostly am (I ordered a couple of wish list items so I added those when they arrived).  I also felt like it was easier to get dressed (fewer choices) and my outfits were more in line with my desired style. That’s actually why I did my capsule — I came to the end of about two years of style exploration and wanted to test whether the conclusions I came to were right for me. They are!   Here’s the list of what I put in my warm weather capsule. I have another list ready for when the weather gets consistently cooler:  [x]2 sundresses  [x]Navy midi skirt  [x]Navy-based floral midi skirt  [x]Pink-based floral midi skirt  [x]2 pairs athletic / long shorts suitable for hiking/adventures – tan long & navy athletic  [x]Floral-print jersey-knit top  [x]Floral-print blouse  [x]Coral top (I think I ended up adding a second one of these so I wouldn’t have to do laundry)  [x]Navy top  [x]Chambray button-down shirt  [x]2 athletic tops for hiking/adventures  [x]1 pair dark green joggers  [x]Brown leather sandals  [x]Gray casual sneakers  [x]Adventure shoes  [x]Gold & rhinestone necklace  My colors are navy, coral/pink, dark green, and a little yellow.   I’ve been outfit repeating a ton for the last several months (wearing the same outfit for 3-5 days in a row), so that made doing a capsule easier as well.	episode_done:True

text:Yes, I agree, I think OP has this "hopeful me" style and a "realistic me" style to please her family. I think OP can sprinkle a little bit of her alternative style with her casual everyday wear. For example, wear your regular t-shirt and jeans but add a cool black leather jacket. You can never go wrong with a piece like that and it's not too offensive.  Or, you can dress to satisfy your family but wear a darker color up top. Or add cool spike earrings.   I think you can combine the two styles so that you can satisfy your family and call your style "alternative".	labels:In a related sense, I've sometimes found that I can find a slightly different "style" that gives the same effect on my body. It won't be the exact same clothes/colors/cuts that I see posted elsewhere or on models, but choose something that, on the hanger, doesn't necessarily give the same impression and it will turn out that, on my body, it will give a similar effect because of drape or how the colors look on me.

If even your basic looks have alternative elements, it might make sense, otherwise there's nothing wrong with "basic, occasionally grunge-y."

Brooklyn winter: lightweight to midweight merino wool underlayers, because sweating in your synthetics on the train will make you smell like Manhattan. Your black merino turtleneck is literally your best friend and you would kill and die for it. Don't put your cold feet into your winter-weight wool socks because they will stay that way. Put em in a hot sink first if you have to. Also, if you wear your cute boots you will step on slushy shit of indeterminate origin and that's life in the big city, baby.

Since then I’ve been waaaayyyyy happier, all snug as a bug in my big coat while my neighbors wear the standard low profile down parkas found in stores here and complain they’re still freezing.	episode_done:True

text:Women who have moved for extended periods of time on 1 or 2 suitcases only, how did you do it? Here's the beginning of my process	labels:How permanent is the move? If it's only a couple of months then you could also just bring a couple of basic items and leave space in your bag to buy new clothes in your destination. This is what I did when I studied abroad for a year. The clothes are then also a nice souvenir for yourself.   If it's a long term or permanent, again just bring the things you absolutely love the most then buy things there. You can also have your other closed shipped to you in a parcel if you really can't do without them. Obviously if it's a permanent move the issue of fitting everything in a suitcase to bring home isn't really an issue.   Depending on what climate your moving from and to you might find you don't have enough clothes for said climate. For example, I moved UK to Japan, and I absolutely did not have enough clothes for the hot, humid summers here.  The same goes for culture. Many of my friends ended up having to throw away all of their tanktops and lowcut blouses because they're not culturally appropriate here.   It's also really common to change size when moving to another country because of diet and lifestyle changes. So you could find that all the clothes you bring no longer fit you after a few months.  The only longterm move situation where it's better to bring everything is if it'll be difficult to find your size where you're moving. For example if you're 6' and moving to east asia you'll have a hard time finding clothes	episode_done:False
text:It's a year now but might become two (Depends on the opportunities pending over there) but buying clothing where I'm going can be quite expensive, and shipping would be really expensive too since it would be from one side of the world to quite literally the other.  I don't think it'll be difficult to find clothing my size for emergencies I'm pretty average size 8/10 5'3.

Put extra necklaces through a straw and clasp the ends on the outside so they don’t tangle. If you have anything fragile wrap it in clothing rather than newspaper. Keep anything heavy in your personal item/ backpack to avoid overweight items. Jeans or black bottoms go with just about everything and allow you to mix up your outfit. Also roll your clothes rather than folding them flat for optimal space and consider buying a Turkish towel rather than traditional bath towel	episode_done:True
text:Women who have moved for extended periods of time on 1 or 2 suitcases only, how did you do it? Here's the beginning of my process	labels:If you are moving to one place/country for 1-2 years, I recommend packing only what you really love and wear a lot right now. In 1-2 years you will buy new clothes in your new country pretty much no matter what.    Test pack and use vacuum bags to get extra room. Leave behind anything bulky and if you really miss it, arrange for someone to ship it to you. Do all the other usual travel tips like wear your bulkiest stuff on the plane.    Last: just pay the extra luggage expense. Not sure your situation, but if you can't leave something behind and you'll miss it, just pay whatever extra you need to if it won't break your bank.	episode_done:True

text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:Ok so quick and dirty - shoulder seams are supposed to hit at your shoulder bone. This can be hard to determine if that bone isn't visible, but if the jacket is poufing out past your shoulder its too big at the shoulder and if there's a weird crease line or dimple when your arm is straight down it is likely too small at the shoulder. Armholes should be comfortably sized, not digging in to your pit but also not having excess folds of fabric around and inside the sleeve.  Pants should sort of skim over your hips and bum/thighs depending on the fit. This doesn't apply to skinny jeans and leggings which are meant to be tight fitting. If youre getting lines whiskering out from the crotch towards your hips, your pants are probably too small. If you get a fake penis bump, assuming you don't have one, the pants are probably too big (if you do have one, this tip does not apply!)  Ease is important. Just bc something fits over your body doesn't mean it fits you, especially with stiffer, non stretch fabrics. You need room in the butt and thighs to be able to sit down reasonably comfortably. If you can't bend without fabric digging in (especially at creases) it does not fit. If it balloons out significantly when you move or sit, the garment is likely too big.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:You can get a suit jacket or blazer tailored. It’s so important to make sure the shoulders hit right where they’re supposed to, and that any buttons on the front can be properly buttoned. A suit jacket that doesn’t fit properly looks unprofessional. Sleeves can definitely be shortened if required.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:I'm 5"4, which means regular suit skirts and work dresses are a bit long but petite alternatives are a bit short, so I get the lengths hemmed. Ditto with my suit jackets and wool coats, if feasible.	episode_done:True

text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:I always have to alter jeans myself.  Apart from being too long most of the time they are always loose around the knees and ankles.

text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:I think just occasionally you find something that fits perfectly and you just know! Sometimes it depends on the garment as some have more leeway than others. Giveaways for a bad fit are as already mentioned with shoulder seams etc. Buttons pulling, waistbands not being flat to the waist at the back etc	episode_done:True
text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:The most basic thing, fundamental, objective thing is if it uncomfortable or impedes your movements. Some of this you only figure out when you wear things particularly if they are too loose (too tight you usually notice faster), like tops or dresses too big their neckline might move a bit and look askew, or you step on the hem of skirts or dresses at you climb stairs. Skirts too tight might ride up, pants too tight might dig and create camel toe or the zipper give way and open...  For other things, say pant or skirt length it might be a matter of aesthetics, 5 or 10 cm lower or higher..  Probably the most important point for things to fit is the shoulders and armpits, so it does not impede movement and because outerwear, tops, etc, hangs literally from there. If fitted, the seam should be at the edge of your shoulder blade naturally.  Not everything can be altered to fit right. There might not be enough fabric for that, or it might just a design which was cut for different proportions than yours. Tailoring can do subtle tweaks, on woven fabrics (knits are harder, way harder), but the first and most important step of getting clothes which fit well is REJECTING things, lots of things, most things, almost all things. Trying many many things, being analytical so you can learn stuff (if it looks like that chances are it will loook  this other thing on my body, Brand X pants always fit me right and Brand Y pants never).	episode_done:False

text:A note on knits--if it's 100% wool and it isn't washable, you can actually sew it up and cut (similar to a method called steeking, which is used to create sleeves in faire isle sweaters), fold the inner seams over and sew. The wool will felt to itself after a handwashing or two and the sewing keeps it together well because of the pull the woll fibers have on one another. It can be scary to try, but with practice it can really change how a sweater fits and is great. I've done it on sweaters I've handknit myself in particular, but wanted to mention it here in case anyone is thinking about wool items going into the colder months!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What do you get tailored?	labels:I get almost everything other than lounge clothes tailored. Size number means absolutely nothing anymore. Buy clothes that fit the widest part of your body, and have them taken in to fit the rest (it’s harder to let out than take in). Some of my dresses are 6s, and some are 0s, so size is literally just a made up concept for women. This definitely gets expensive, but I add the cost of tailoring to the cost of the thing I know I’ll need tailored.   So like, if I see a skirt I really want, but I’ll need the waist taken in, I know that my tailor streamlines waistbands with a zipper for 30 bucks. 35 if there’s a lining. That turns a $50 skirt into an $80 skirt. Do I really want to spend $80 on a skirt?? Maybe. If I do, I’ll buy it. If not, I put it back. It ends up saving me money because I buy less impulse trendy purchases.   Find a good tailor by testing them on cheap pieces and building a reputation. Eventually, you’ll know exactly how much they charge for each fabric/type of alteration and it helps with keeping prices in mind while shopping. A good tailor will have no problem at all with silks or satins. You may have to burn through a few and have them ruin some clothes before you find your soulmate, but it’s totally worth it! I recently broke up with my tailor and I’m still heartbroken about it..	episode_done:False

text:Why did you break up with them?	labels:She could not for the life of her take something in at the zipper. Anytime something had a side zip and I needed the bodice taken in, it would end up all lopsided because she would only take out fabric from the opposite side. It wasn’t a huge deal, but she would get really upset if I asked to have something redone, and I noticed over time she would rush the easier jobs and they would end up a little sloppy. At her high prices, I got tired of being nervous about how something would turn out, so I stopped going. Now looking for a new tailor and starting the whole process over again 🙃	episode_done:True
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:My mom got me a beautiful micro suede blue jacket last fall, but it was pretty bulky. I had it tailored to fit and I love it. Specifically the upper sleeves were tightened and the waist was pulled in.  *it even has pockets.	episode_done:True
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:TBH? Everything. Pants, shirts, jackets. I tend to dress modestly, so if the hem of my dress or skirt are long enough, I'll get them brought down to lengthen the garment. But in regards to dresses, I've had sleeves shortened, necklines lowered and raised, a LOT of dresses taken in, etc. When it comes to fabric, if the dress is made out of a cheap, or flimsy material, I'll only get it tailored if I think the fabric is worth it. So unless the 100% polyester was crafted well, I don't think it's worth trying to save the garment. My general rule of thumb is that if I believe that the tailoring will be more expensive than the total cost of the garment, then it's not worth getting it tailored/buying the garment. I'd rather save up to get a better garment than do what I believe is wasting my money.	episode_done:True
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:Speaking of silk...I got some wide leg silk blend trousers from uniqlo last fall and the waistband was flappy in the front. There was an elastic in the gathered back so that was fine but there was no stretch to the silk in front so I them in for some darts.   They fit perfectly now! They are (.....were?!?!) great work pants and I got a lot of use out of them last fall.   I also got a really nice red trench coat tailored to fit. It cost about as much to get the coat tailored as it cost to buy but it looks great now! It was slightly too wide before. It fit pretty good in the sleeves and it was good on my shoulders but it was too boxy and now it’s much more tailored!!	episode_done:True

text:What do you get tailored?	labels:I started getting my clothes tailored last year and the difference is incredible. Looked like I lost a ton of weight and I gained so many compliments on my clothes. It makes cheap clothing (but well made) look expensive!  The alternations were mostly taking dresses/tops in at the waist and shortening the length of some long dresses and skirts to make them closer to knee length.	episode_done:True
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:Take a similar shirt of different fabric in to get tailored and see how your like the experience and their workmanship. Then bring silk shirts in to ask if they think they can improve the fit neatly.  Honestly anytime someone says silk is hard to work with, I roll my eyes. Maybe it is for people with less experience with it the first time they sew it. But I am not by any stretch of the imagination a skilled seamstress (I would say I am an intermediate hobby sewist), and I love silk of all kinds.  My sister (who is actually a pro) says the same thing about stretch. Even very experienced sewists sometimes avoid stretch out of fear or describe it as very difficult, but she laughs because she taught herself to sew by fitting her jersey t shirts in high school to be tighter. It just takes a little experience and the right tools.   If it’s all chiffon, or any other very gauzy loose weave, THAT can be a bitch, because it just morphs into a different shape before your eyes, but even then, a few darts or tucks or a hem should be no big deal for a tailor even on chiffon. And that’s more about how the weave behaves, not the fiber, so it also applies to polyester chiffon, cotton gauze, power mesh, etc. Plus, the garment is already cut and constructed, so it’s not going to move around much if you don’t take it apart and rebuild it.	episode_done:True
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:I havent for a while now but I used to get tops taken in at the waist and trousers hemmed. Some tops look fine loose but a lot look better more form fitting.

I had a pair of Sketchers Whompers that I got on clearance for $1 at a Marshalls when I was in HS. The world had moved on to those 3 inch platform flip flops by then, but I wore the absolute shit out of those Whompers.

text:Good suggestion! Thanks	labels:I'd try to avoid AliExpress (and Shein etc) for jewellery (or in general) because they shamelessly rip off designers and artisans' own original designs and then sell them at a pittance. I also avoid buying from sellers on etsy/depop/eBay who are using AliExpress charms for similar reasons. It's not always easy to know whether something has been stolen (Etsy is flooded with AliExpress-type stuff)  but ruling out places where this is the actual business model is a start. Especially if you don't want loads of pieces you may as well spend the few extra ££ supporting designers, or at least not harming them.	episode_done:True

text:I have an extensive collection of (mostly-thrifted) cashmere and wool (seriously, it's a problem and I'm trying to get rid of part of it before I move). Although I have never had moths, I'm paranoid about them. I use a vodka/filtered water/lavender/cedar/mint/other herbs essential oil spray instead of mothballs, because I hate the smell of the chemicals. (I actually just bought a secondhand vintage cashmere sweater that absolutely reeked if mothballs, and I had to wash it, soak it in vinegar, air it out outside, and spray with the vodka solution to deodorize it). Does anybody else have experience with this? I don’t actually know if the spray actually works to repel moths, but I wash all my sweaters in lavender baby shampoo before storing them, so that may also help since moths are attracted to human odors/food stains.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I recently bought a very fine-gauge cashmere sweater that was advertised as “in excellent condition”, but when I received it, it had a tiny hole. It was only $10, so I bought a skein of close-enough wool tapestry yarn, separated the yarn into very thin, small strands, and “sewed“ the hole up with an embroidery needle. I'm planning on dyeing the entire sweater black with acid dye, to disguise the slightly-different color of the repair, but it's not very noticeable as is.   I'm not a knitter, so I don't have experience with darning or mending (other than needle-felting tiny tiny holes in already-felted wool). I've had one cashmere sweater for ages, and when it developed holes from constant wear (it wasn’t the best quality) I was able to felt them with matching wool roving.  However, if you know how to Swiss darn (duplicate stitch) you can fix really large holes, provided that you have the right color thread or yarn. If you find a sweater that you absolutely love but it has holes, you can also drop it off or mail it to a repair service to be fixed (but it is pricey).	labels:	episode_done:True

Also, last year I invested in a real shearling jacket and I’ve never been so warm. I can’t wait to wear it this year!  Edit: life coat = puffer coat.

The funny thing is that I live in an arid climate now, but I probably won’t ever sell it. It’s got sentimental value. There’s several on resale sites right now.	episode_done:True

text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:Yes free the titties! If that’s what you want to do. I hate this idea that the ideal boob shape is something that just isn’t natural for most women. Or that there is some supposed “ideal shape”. I’m currently a 38DD. Who has boobs that size that naturally look like the shape formed by an underwire bra? Literally basically no one. I’m a human person. I have boobs. They don’t have to defy gravity. And I don’t have to wear some uncomfortable CONTRAPTION to fool the world into thinking they do. I fully support women who feel their best in an underwire bra. I just don’t think we have some societal obligation to optimize our boob shapes. I like to look good and feel good in the clothes that I wear, but I’m not going to sacrifice my comfort.	episode_done:True
text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:> Some days, I look in a mirror and I feel really sexy and carefree in the new look. Other days, I catch a glimpse of a saggy tit in a bralette peeking out of my dress and wonder if that's like...the least sexy thing in the world for a 28 year old woman?  I feel you here in many ways, except a bit of the opposite with my A cup boobs. Some days I can rock the no bra look and feel like a million bucks, and some days I look in the mirror and think "who is that little boy trying to wear grown up clothes?" I've been trying to ignore that voice and I'm having less of those days as time goes on.	episode_done:True
text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:I'm envious. I can't free the titties, they're too heavy and it's just a weight I'm not used to.	episode_done:True
text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:My thoughts are that everyone should wear whatever they hell they want, and nobody should feel like they *have* to wear something they don't enjoy, find uncomfortable, etc. Obviously it's not that "simple", but at the end of the day...it is. There's no magic pill you can take that will allow you to suddenly stop giving AF. It's a process of looking in the mirror, having those feelings, and then accepting that your body is the way it is and that is okay. Feeling bad about your body doesn't serve you in any way. It's not going to someday lead to you waking up with "perfect" tits if you just hate yours hard enough. All it does is make you feel bad. It's fine to have those thoughts, even the most confident and body positive people will have them. They don't need to dictate your behavior or impinge upon your happiness, though. It's a choice. It's a HARD choice, and it requires ongoing effort, but like many other things it becomes easier with practice.	episode_done:True
text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:I too made this decision during covid. The Cara Mia bra is my favorite. Jockey makes a good Bralette too. If I don’t have time to put the pads back in after a wash I’ll use silicone nip covers underneath. Personally they give me cleavage that my underwire bras did not. They would seperate them too much. Everyone’s build is different. 38D.	episode_done:True
text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:This post feels like it's coming from my brain! Yesterday I wore a bralette for the first time along with a low cut top and, while I was comfortable, I was also really self conscious. I ended up changing to a top with a higher neckline for a zoom hang with friends. I'm not used to my boobs being in a natural, saggy position on my body.  I have a figure that's somewhere between hourglass and pear shaped so I have always tried to dress in a way that makes my bust larger and higher in order to balance out my hips. Seeing the other posts on this thread gives me hope that it's just the need to re-train my eye.	episode_done:True
text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:I have bigger boobs and rarely wear a bra, as I’ve gotten older they get saggier but I still make it work and the comfort and freedom out weighs my boobs looking slightly better. I feel self conscious about them sometimes but now they look weird to me when they are in a bra that really changes their shape. I say do what ever makes you comfortable, we all have different bodies, different shaped breasts and different ideals of what looks good, if you feel good about it go for it.	episode_done:True
text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:I haven’t worn a bra in months and I love it. I’m a 38D and even if I have no problem wearing a bra, I chose not to in my everyday attire now because it’s more freeing and comfortable for me. If men can go out and not wear undershirts/go shirtless I public, I should be able to not wear a bra and not be criticized. I’ve been out and sometimes my nipples show but who tf cares? My breasts aren’t inherently sexual, they’re just a part of my lovely body and the world should realize that.	episode_done:True

text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:I suggest organizing and developing categories based on how you work through creating an outfit. Do you need to see items to choose them? If yes, maybe focus on hanging the items you need to see. When you go to pick out a top, how do you decided what you are looking for? Is it color, sleeve length, pattern? Do you mentally group crop tops in the same category as other shirts, or do you specifically look for crop tops? Have you designated some items as work clothes or more formal clothes vs casual? Group your clothing in the categories you put thing into in your head, even if they wouldn't make sense to others (it's your closet after all).     For example, when I'm picking out shirts think about sleeve length and pattern, and I need to see and feel the shirt to make a final decision on what to wear. For what ever reason, sorting by color isnt as big of a priority, but whether I want to wear stripes, plaid, floral, or solid is. So my shirts are hung, divided by sleeve length, then arranged by pattern (like patterns together). I also have separated out my formal clothes and my gold clothes, as those are only used at specific times and dont need to be visually cluttering my daily wardrobe.	episode_done:True
text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:How much hanging space do you have available? I might start by separating formal/informal, and then micro-categorize from there! And I'd loosen up the boundaries for categorizations to jackets/coats, sweaters/cardigans, dresses/jumpsuits, tops, and bottoms, just for ease. Then I'd organize each category by color.  As for storing clothes that are in-between wears...I usually just dump those on a chair and re-wear them throughout the week until they need to be washed tbh.	episode_done:True
text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:I divide my wardrobe into two main categories - workwear (including going-out clothes too) and home wear (including clothes I'd wear to run errands but are not nice enough to wear to work.) Those are divided again into spring/summer and fall/winter (obviously there are overlaps, I'm ok with these.)   Dresses, blouses, blazers/jackets, skirts, and dress pants go on the hangers; tees, sweaters, and jeans are folded. Socks, underwears, and scarves go in the drawers. I also have a coat stand where I hang my worn-but-not-dirty clothes. I'm not super strict with the categorization, mostly because I have limited space, but I know where everything is and it works for me.	episode_done:True
text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:I divide my clothes by type (as you do), function (formal/informal) and warmth. The last category helps me with weird clothes: if a crop top is lightweight I would probably wear it in summer, so for me it makes sense to group it with tanks. It helps me because if it is a warm day I can find all my choices in one place.	episode_done:True
text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:I have clothes divided by sections of "cold" and "warm", then within that group they're color coded (rainbow) and within each colour subgroup they're divided by lenght. I do believe some prefer it better to be sorted by lenghts over colour, but I ahve too many clothes.  The exception are (foldable) tops and jumpers, which I seasonally store away in vacuum bags, and seasonal boxes for elaborate tights. It was a forced decision because I've "ran out" of space (more like, my mother did, so she occupied my wardrobe's top shelves against my will).  I am reasonably strict, because while I'm quite an organised person, I'm also quite messy (they're not the same) and I have too many clothes. So if I facilitate in any way, my wardrobe becomes an absolute war zone. It has happened too many times.  As for dirty clothing, I usually don't wear summer tops more than once because I sweat a lot. When I do wear them more than once, I place the hangar backwards. Everything backwards and jumpeers are washed at the end of a season, then either hung back or stored away.	episode_done:True
text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:>	This system seems okay to me, but I don't really know how to differentiate each category based on function. For example, with the system I work with now, button-downs I wear in formal situations are currently grouped with tops I wear in informal situations AND workout-tops I wear for exercising. And this stresses me out so, so much. Then there's the issue of how effective my groupings are; like, should crop tops be with tank tops? Or maybe they're more like tees? And how do I deal with seasonal clothes?   You’re way overthinking it. You don’t have to be so strict about the categories or follow a plan to a T. Do what feels natural/right to you. If it doesn’t end up working, change it. It’s not set in stone.   1.	How do you mentally construct an outfit?  I would use those groupings because that’s what you already gravitate to. I personally sort by general type, then seasonality or formality. For example, my dresses/pants are split into formal (eg cocktail dress and up) and everything else. Within those subgroups, I sort by color.  Skirts are only sorted by color. Tops are split into sleeveless/short sleeved/long sleeved (3/4 sleeves go here), and those groups are subsorted by color.  Workout/swimwear/PJs/sweaters/underwear/socks/leggings/bras are their own categories that get dedicated drawer sections for their specific groups.  2.	Crop tops would be sorted by sleeves with other tops.  3.	worn but not dirty clothes go on a purposely dedicated row of hooks the wall (basically a fancy coat hook array that you might see in an entryway).  I’ve done this since I was a child and recommend.	episode_done:True

text:For those who define their style as "classic-traditional" (tailored, fitted, matching, sleek), what are your typical outfits for work, on the weekends, date-night, running errands or lounging around?	labels:I have a pseudo-capsule wardrobe. I technically own only a few clothing items, but in several versions. For instance, several white blouses: 4 x poplin (different fits and collars), 2 x linen, silk in a minimalist version and more  dressy one with flowing sleeves, you get the idea. I too like pencil skirts, and most of my pants are either dark jeans or straight leg or slightly tapered pants in black, navy, grey, and white, depending on the fabric and/or cut they are more or less smart/casual. I don't get too trendy so I can get longer wear without looking dated. I love scarves and if I want a pop of color I'll usually go for a colorful scarf.    Work is boring, most of the time dark jeans or dark pants and a blouse or tee and a cardigan. And flats. I need to feel comfortable or I won't get anything done. During spring and fall, when the AC isn't turning my workplace into a freezer, I get a lot of wear out of my grey wool sheath dress, 4 years and still going strong!  Going out: I switch out a cardigan for a blazer, flats to heels, and put on makeup. Grab a fancier purse than my usual work black leather tote. I have some pearl and gold inherited pieces of jewelry I might bring out for special occasions.  At home I'm a slob, sorry, I have nobody to impress. Yoga pants and tees it is, as well as  everyday clothing that shows signs of wear and is comfortable enough to lounge around.	episode_done:True
text:For those who define their style as "classic-traditional" (tailored, fitted, matching, sleek), what are your typical outfits for work, on the weekends, date-night, running errands or lounging around?	labels:For work at this point I’ll throw a white button down over some yoga pants, it looks good enough for zoom and isn’t bad overall. White button-downs are basically a personal staple at this point. For running errands or running around I’ll do a fitted white oxford button down with high waisted linen pants or something A-line, with a leather handbag or backpack, or a tan tote. Maybe a long coat/trench coat if it’s cold or raining. For lounging around I’ll probably wear a cardigan, sweater layered on a button down, or something else cozy. I’ve gotten a lot of inspiration from Pinterest and the “dark academia” aesthetic :)	episode_done:True
text:For those who define their style as "classic-traditional" (tailored, fitted, matching, sleek), what are your typical outfits for work, on the weekends, date-night, running errands or lounging around?	labels:I’ve pretty much been something along the lines of modern preppy, though I am incorporating more things as I get older (I am early 40s). I wear a lot of dresses and skirts. Weekend and workdays.   My offices have been casual for around a decade now, so work wardrobe has merged with weekend.  I tend to be more dressed up than my peers.   In the old days my weekend looks were basically less structured versions of my work looks. So instead of a pencil skirt I’d wear a stretchy tube skirt that functioned like a pencil skirt with more ease. If I wore jeans, I paired it with a blouse and cardigan depending on the weather.   Now I am kinda in hiatus from pencil skirts and that shape altogether. But the same idea applies, add a casual element.    I’ll wear a work friendly skirt on the weekend with a tee shirt, probably a graphic on.  Or a more casual tank top. Today I have on straight jeans and a floral blouse. I like t-shirt dresses, and will pair them with a nicer third piece: cardigan, bomber, or maybe a blazer. I love things like a jersey jumpsuit. Or a knit one.  It has a lot of ease and drape and adds a bit of polish. My “weekend” dresses are the same shapes as the work version, but with a casual fabric. Maybe that means a cotton shirt dress instead of a more structured one.   I wear a lot of flats but have also been embracing Birkenstock’s for some outfits.    My weekend purses still have a bit of structure, because that is my preference.   And to keep my outfits kosher for my casual workplace, I always pair something dressy with something casual. And that is a good rule for weekends too.	episode_done:True
text:For those who define their style as "classic-traditional" (tailored, fitted, matching, sleek), what are your typical outfits for work, on the weekends, date-night, running errands or lounging around?	labels:I have to dress biz casual lite (aka, not jeans) for work, so my work/weekend outfits are the same - I like button-downs with midi skirts and ballet flats or feminine mule slides, high-waisted trousers with thin fitted tops, linen shorts and button-downs, and dresses (sometimes with a sweater over the top or a cardigan).   I feel like I’ve slowly narrowed in on my favored style via trial and error and I usually focus on the silhouette - I like things that nip in at the waist and I either have a looser top or bottom, but never both. I stick to a neutral palette (lots of camel, light blue, black, and green) and avoid anything too trendy.   For lounging around, I wear sweatpants haha - but I have cute high-waisted ones in a pretty tan color that are slightly “elevated.”	episode_done:True

text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:it started as a joke... me and my equally poor friends would browse designer websites from all the major fashion houses in our common room at private school. i started reading about fashion in the library, watching biographical documentaries about designers, and slowly i began to recognise key signposts for certain designers, seasons, etc. soon enough i'd see my friends in an outfit and be able to say 'it reminds me of x designer's 2008 pre-fall collection'. i made the effort to understand the gibberish about inspirations for the season, began to make links, and yes implement a few style points in my own wardrobe on the way.  it started because i was sure it was something i'd never be able to have.	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:Honestly, it started as a teenager because I don’t see myself as physically attractive, and so I felt like I could never pull off a simple look like jeans and a t shirt to feel pretty. My peers were developing and looked cute in anything, even gym class and I knew I was plain and uninteresting. So I thought if I had a unique sense of fashion people would pay attention to my clothes as my “appearance” rather than my looks.   Another piece was that growing up we couldn’t afford clothes for fashion (vs function) so I felt embarrassment when all my classmates had new clothes after the holidays and I was wearing the same thrifted clothes. Now that I have a solid income it’s something I am trying to cut back on, this compensating for my childhood complex lol. I have more than enough clothes (and love thrifting now) and donate regularly to charity and to friends who are interested.	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:I love this thread! I was homeschooled by religious, conservative parents for much of my childhood. For a brief period of time, I was only allowed to wear modest dresses, and the rest of the time, I dressed like a stereotypical homeschooler, because we were poor and I wasn’t allowed to wear much.   By the time I was in middle school and earning my own money babysitting, I started to dabble in thrifting. By the end of high school, when I went to public school and eventually had a full time job shortly after graduation, I really got into it. I spent so long learning to be okay with looking different from the status quo that I eventually really learned to embrace it. I’m thirty now, and I love standing out and wearing things that other people say they could never pull off. I also have a body that the fashion industry loves, so that part was easier for me to feel like “I fit in here” (to its discredit- I fully believe it should be inclusive and celebratory of every body).   Really, it’s been a place of refuse where I can feel belonging while still embracing my “weird kid” roots.	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:My mother. Growing up I idolized her style and would always take her saris and lipsticks. It has always been something we have bonded over. When I became 6 I think that was the time she stopped wearing the sari full time and only for special occasions. I wish she  would dress up again but she says it' would take far too long to drape the fabric.   From a young age both my parents instilled into me that a good outer appearance is very important, for ones self esteem but also for how others viewed us.	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:At first? Growing up, like in elementary school and middle school, I really did not mesh with people. The things I liked, others did not like. The things they liked, I did not get. I didn't get the social cues others were picking up on. No one bullied me or anything extreme, but I felt very much like an outsider or an alien, trying to figure out some other species. And fashion seemed to be a predominant part of this culture I didn't understand, so I felt like if I could figure that out, I would unlock everything else. So I put a lot of work into that.  But (and not to sound so depressing!) I actually ended up really liking it, and caring more about it than others did in the end, especially when I got to college and didn't have a dress code any more. Not only could I convey that I was "normal", I could convey my interests! My personality! I could even change myself for the better in tandem with my clothes. Now I find it really fun to try to express who I am on that day, and it's been a vehicle for exploring my gender and sexuality at times as well. I like standing out now, but in a good way. Whereas before I used fashion to understand others, now I feel like I use it to help others understand me.	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:Very similar to you, fashion was an escape for me. Teenage angst and insecurity, and a smaller town, fashion was so unlike anything in my day-to-day. And there were so many ways to escape and so many facets of the industry to jump into! It was exciting to be passionate about something that always changed. About being able to put on a flappers inspired dress on Monday and go punk on Tuesday.  Teen Vogue’s website used to post weekly snippets about fashionable teens, which is how I found most fashion bloggers in the aughts/early tens. Sea of Shoes, Rumi Neely, there was a girl in SF who was one of the first to start shredding her t-shirts (Children of something???), etc. They then led to other online communities, like The Fashion Spot, the ONTD offshoot, tumblr in its heyday. So many different people who dressed in so many different ways, but all loved what they wore and showed it!	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:I remember trying to design dresses when I was seven years old. Then, princesses were my inspiration. After trying to ignore my interest in high school for a few years where I would still find gossip magazines to admire the red carpet looks, my dad brought me W magazine that he had found in his mailbox and looking through it at the art made me so happy. Now I am older and wear scrubs to work and have a baby, but my fashion passion is back and coming to this forum has definitely inspired me to put more love into my image day to day.	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:I was into fashion from the age of 11 — back then it was mostly just looking at magazines and doodling my own designs in the margins of my notebooks at school.  For me a big thing is definitely being able to highlight the things about myself I like, and — as cliche as it sounds — to express myself. I was never confident before I started dressing the way i LIKED (not the way everyone else did).  I’m a very short and petite girl and in my teens I struggled with not feeling feminine. Fashion was kind of an outlet, like roleplay! The first time I wore heels to school was transformational. I also enjoyed putting together outfits that are more ”masculine”, and juxtaposing feminine with masculine. I get kicks from matching little details, like lipstick and a purse. Fashion is just something that seems really trivial in the grand scheme of things but that actually has a bigger impact than we realize!	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:As far as creating outfits for myself---I think it had to do being uncomfortable with my weight and skin (I had normal acne, but I scar really easily, so I have "shadows" of where pimples used to be years later...) and just never really feeling "pretty." So I'd try to put together outfits that maybe were interesting or looked polished, because I knew (or at least firmly believed) that **I** was/am not interesting and polished. I "knew" that no one would ever compliment or be attracted to me, so maybe I could trick them into noticing my outfit at least...I don't know. I think in a lot of ways I've come pretty far in this area, but I definitely still use clothes as a kind of armor almost. Like, don't repeat outfits and don't wear what other people have and don't do the expected combinations and all of that are hard habits to break, especially since I *do* get complimented/validated regarding clothing and not so much about my body, so I get caught in the mind trap of it all. It's gross and I'm still struggling a lot of days...  As far as fashion in general--I think watching Project Runway! It spurred me to find other fashion shows and documentaries and things of that nature. I love the creative minds behind the shows. I'm less interested in the final product, but just hearing how people, especially on a show like Project Runway, are inspired and (pardon the reference) make it work with so many limitations the show throws at them...it's so fascinating. I'm equally enthralled by cooking shows, where they have such knowledge and talent to do the seemingly impossible.	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:For me, it was the opposite... so I am still young but I grew up staring at magazines and with no one that had the same body type as me- what is now called ‘medium’. Where companies have a bunch of skinny girls and will through in few plus size girls just to get some diversity... but yet, still don’t see any medium sized girls... Nonetheless, many desi girls (desi refers to south asian).   In middle school, wasn’t a fan of makeup but my best friend was. Since as long as I could remember, she would tell me about everything she was doing and how much she loved to do her makeup. One day in 8th grade, I was staring myself in the mirror and was like hm, I want to start trying to use makeup. And from there it started... From then until about the next 4 years, I taught myself and watched video after video after video. This is what fueled me into fashion. Around my Junior year in High School, the confidence makeup gave me transferred into just wanting to look my best. I became obsessed in streetwear and just looking really cool...   From then on my style has changed a bit, but overall it was my friends and what they were into that inspired my first looks. I would take those and find things similar that seemed more like me :)	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have any visual guides for how clothes should fit	labels:I really appreciate this question/thread. I didn’t grow up seeing anyone in my family or circles wearing well-tailored clothing or professional attire in general so i genuinely don’t know what a good fit looks like. I struggle a lot with having a curvier body and a loud personality but not wanting to feel like a pinup girl caricature if my clothes are too tight or fit a certain way. I’ve never really thought about what i would and wouldn’t consider a good fit on me, besides my Levi’s 721s. I really need to have myself a think on this!	episode_done:True

text:This exactly. I have a pretty stuffy office job with a fairly traditional business dress code (not business formal, but the kind of business casual where jeans are 100% not okay, people wear pantyhose with skirts, blazers are extremely popular, absolutely no thighs or cleavage or shoulders seen), but I still have no trouble finding work-appropriate clothing that makes me feel comfortable and that I like to wear.   I have pretty loud taste and I am not one for neutrals, while also being pretty conservative with regard to the amount of skin I like to show, and I love to find stuff with bold colours (like my very favourite suit, which is bright magenta), strong shapes (like oversized boyfriend blazers instead of a traditional hip-length fitted ones, wide paperbag pants, cape sleeves, etc), and unusual patterns, like a cardigan I have with small intarsia unicorn silhouettes. I only buy the shapes I like, so no pencil skirts, high necklines only, pant rises similar to those in my casual wardrobe, etc.   I absolutely live in athleisure outside the office, but I still like and enjoy my work wardrobe a lot and I think it's still expressive while being appropriate for my specific office. I pretty much only wear it to work and I don't pull any of it out to go to the grocery store, but it's still great for the purpose and I don't need to be able to wear all my clothes for every occasion.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:My work dress code says "black and fashionable", and my natural state is color color color.

I guess I've kind of done the same thing, but I think there's just a bit more pressure right now to look the part of the adult vs my natural state of being.	labels:I’d look at the items you have in a bright color and look for something similar in black.	episode_done:True
text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:Whenever people have to work with an all-black or neutral look for work, I always tell them to look for patterns and textures instead of color to make the outfits more fun. If your style is more gothic/steampunk inspired then maybe look for items that feature velvet, zippers, or black damask print. Or if you’re feeling more ethereal you could try some lace or satin.  You might also be able to get away with fun accessories as long as they’re not distracting.	episode_done:True
text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:I came to the following conclusion a few years ago:  >I am able to wear essentially anything I want anywhere I want.  However, **every single person I meet with functioning eyes** (whether they are aware of it or not) will pass judgment on my appearance no matter what I wear, and some of these people are in a position to materially affect my life based on their opinion of me.  I think it's unrealistic for most people to "wear what you want, screw the haters!" because appearance-based judgments happen constantly.  Is that a problem?  Heck yes.  Is it illegal?  When it comes to clothing, usually not.  The balance between "what I like" and "what won't get me ostracized and unemployed" is going to be very personal and will probably change several times in your life.  The trick is figuring out who you can't afford to *not* please (being realistic, of course), then figure out what is needed to please them, then figuring out where your creative freedom lies.   Most people have substantially more creative freedom in their off-work hours.	episode_done:True

text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:I still buy from the junior's section and I'm 31. A) I'm only 5'2" and B) it's sometimes cheaper. I just try to make sure that I don't wear something to work that my students would wear. Beyond that, the sky's the limit. I'm known for dressing up anyway.  Look for sturdier materials rather than "slub" ones, and pay close attention to fit. I look better in form-fitting clothes or items with a defined waist, and avoid the long and loose T-shirt dresses. If material and fit are good, I find that nobody can really tell that it's a dress designed for twelve year-olds.	episode_done:True

text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:There is nothing wrong with having 2 or more sets of clothes (work and not-work). I have to wear outdoor clothing for my "big girl job" - think wellies and raincoat or full on hiking gear - and a lot of jobs require a uniform. I also play a sport so i have kit for that. And I have a set of smarter clothes for the odd time I need them (weddings, funerals and interviews!) It's not unsustainable. You dont have to go minimalist or what you think is sophisticated if you don't want to.   As for age appropriate? When I was mid 20's I gave up (most) things that are for children and looked it because I felt I looked silly in them (I'm early 30s) but that was about it for age appropriateness. Other stuff I stopped wearing because my body and/or style changed rather than just ageing. Even the kiddie stuff, i dont think its necessarily silly/ageing on everyone. Some people really go all out on it and OTT and make it a look, and good for them. I did have a sudden panic late 20s that I needed to dress more adult, and wasted some money on things I never wore. But most of the pressure was coming from me and from magazine features. My friends, colleagues and partner DGAF.	episode_done:True

Ruggable, while not plush, appears to be durable and has done a great job of protecting our wood floors and not allowing dirt to track too far into our house.   We also have one in the kitchen space because I am chaotic af in the kitchen and often accidentally drop knives. In our old kitchen, it'd be a stab in the linoleum, but in the new kitchen, our wood floors are safe and sound from knives and the inevitable spills.	labels:	episode_done:True

The only way I’ve found to get hair out of the rug is to get down and scrape it with my hands.

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "How to Determine Your Body Type" and "On Dressing Your Body Type"	labels:So, I'll start. I definitely fell into the trap of both not really understanding my own body and trying to look like a tall slim hourglass all the time (which is not my body.)   Taking the time to really understand silhouettes and how to adjust them for my body was a huge breakthrough for me, as well as readjusting my thought process toward "what do I want to emphasize?" vs "Is this flattering?"   Being more thoughtful and critical about the difference between something looking good and something emphasizing the "tall slim hourglass" was also really helpful. So much of fashion that we feel is objective is actually about our eye and what we train our eye to perceive as good. Getting away from that, and training my eye to see the tall slim hourglass as one silhouette among many, really helped me wear things "I couldn't pull off."	episode_done:True
text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "How to Determine Your Body Type" and "On Dressing Your Body Type"	labels:There is a ton of great info in these, though I think what I found most interesting was the section in Body Type about other measurements and proportions, because it offered a clearer explanation of why you might measure as one type and not look it.  Both guides still felt outdated, not only because of the fashion examples, but because the popular silhouette has shifted more in favor of a dramatic hourglass/pear and there more leeway in what’s considered flattering in general.  There already seems to be a lot of (understandable) dislike towards typing systems, so I could see it being beneficial to **start off** with reframing, i.e. “having an understanding of your body shape/silhouette allows you to present it in the way that you feel is most flattering”, and then moving into an explanation of the types (instead of getting right into it/breaking down all the problems before trying to convince you it’s still useful,) the shapes/silhouettes, and how to attain them. Personally, I’d love it if you could go “my body is shaped more like this type, doing xyz would help me look more like that type.” and a mention of each type being more easily read as masculine/feminine/androgynous, though it’d have to be handled delicately;  I just think it’d be helpful for people trying to present themselves more in those ways.	episode_done:True

text:Great ideas, thank you! I just realized...I don't own any belts! Haha so that's on my list now too.	labels:If you're into thrifting, belts are a great piece to buy second hand! So many cool statement belts, and almost always tons of classic leather staples belts too.	episode_done:True
text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:I don’t have suggestions on specific pieces, but I love using Etsy to find new pieces when I need them.   Additionally, you should learn what type of material works best for you. Some people are sensitive to the cheaper metals (usually nickel which can turn skin green or cause infections). Sterling silver is a good bet and usually won’t cost a fortune (as opposed to gold).	episode_done:True
text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:Thrift / consignment stores are fantastic for jewelry shopping! Thrift stores usually have cheaper stuff like you’d find at F21 or H&M, but consignment stores have authentic pieces for fairly reasonable prices. If you’re really feeling the fancy stuff, I bought my high school graduation ring (white gold, green sapphire and diamond) at an antique store for about 100$ USD.	episode_done:True
text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:My most essential accessories:  * work purse * weekend purse * going out purse * day to day versatile earrings * day to day statement earrings * fancy event statement earrings * going out statement earrings * short day to day necklace * pendant necklace * statement necklace * day to day ring (hand washing friendly) * cocktail ring (a big one that is fun for parties) * Bracelets - these are hard for me day to day, they get in the way of typing. I think they are better served for weekends and parties. I have a full range, but I go in waves on wearing them often. If you are more jewelry maximal, having a said of wear every day bracelets and fancy occasion ones is the right wardrobe. But the shapes you should choose vary based on wrist size and preferences. I like cuffs over bangles. And I do not like tennis bracelets, I am not a delicate jewelry person.  Sources?   * local craft events * Coach - bags, occasionally costume jewelry * Kate Spade - I like their whimsical costume jewelry, the bags are OK * I have some fave jewelry stores nearby: Crown Nine, Phillipa Roberts, Esquleto, Cielomar. I tend to like geometric shapes, and not colorful jewelry because I am really colorful in my wardrobe.  I generally don't love shopping on Etsy, it is hard to find the gold amongst all the stuff, I don't like the hunt, I like curated sources. Some things are well made and some things I could have made myself with no training. It is hard to discern based on a shop listing.	episode_done:True
text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:I love Etsy for jewelry! There’s a huge range of eclectic handmade statement pieces to classic but affordable silver and gold/gold filled pieces. Also, since we are heading towards colder weather in the northern hemisphere, scarves and tights really help adding versatility to your wardrobe. Tights especially help with transitioning warmer weather clothes like skirts and dresses into fall.	episode_done:True
text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:I often use:  Short necklaces in gold and silver Long necklaces in gold and silver Watches that match gold and silver Chain bracelets that match gold and silver (but might be string or leather) Diamond (CZ because I lose them so often) stud earrings Pearl stud earrings Gold and silver ball earrings  Gold and silver hoops I only really wear my white gold wedding rings or silicone ones, but I like minimalist gold and silver rings too I wear a camel? Cognac? Colored leather crossbody purse with everything. It’s light enough that I don’t think it looks super weird with black outfits. I do have a black leather tote for things like interviews though.  I have a couple plaid blanket scarves for when it’s really cold out.  Also, I’m not sure if it counts as an accessory, but I love a quilted vest. I live in the south and most of the fall is too hot for a real coat, so I wear a lot of knit long sleeve tees and sweaters with a vest on top. Juuuuust warm enough, makes me feel more put together because of the layers, and has giant pockets.	episode_done:True
text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:Scarves are my go to. Both because I’m a cold person, and because they are so easy to mix and match and change things up.   I’d recommend getting some that are 100% silk, they are so comfortable and easy to wear. You can pick them up fairy cheaply on eBay and similar places. Have a play around with how to tie them (Pinterest is a great resource!) and have fun 😊	episode_done:True
text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:Accessories are just as subject to cycles in fashion as anything else, but I always save mine even when I throw out tops and pants. Partly that is because my body won’t outgrow a necklace.   For some reason every woman around me was wearing stars the last two years, and I never saw it outside of this town. But because I had kept some old star earrings I had stopped wearing, I was already set to be on-trend. I think super thin necklaces are on the way out. But if you already have one you really like and don’t mind putting it away for several years, chances are it will be fashionable again.  And since you’re going for adult fashion, don’t forget black leather (or glittery plastic) business card cases. Even if your field doesn’t use business cards, you can put credit cards in them. I like the Francesca’s chain for those.	episode_done:True

I'm *so* tempted to buy a Ted Baker coat or dress as my first expensive single item, but they're especially unnecessary due to the pandemic.

text:What was your first 'expensive' fashion purchase?	labels:It was 2009, I was on a business trip to a place that had the first Tiffany store I'd ever seen. I'd just gotten my tax refund and I was positively salivating over an oval tag Return to Tiffany necklace.   I was 25. I rented my very first rental car, printed out my map quest directions, and set off in the direction of the mall.   Entering the store, I had the distinct feeling that I didn't belong there. Everything is so SHINY. Fuck it, I took my time and drank it in. A very coiffed woman asked me if there was anything she could help with. I made my move. I ordered up my dream luxury necklace. She was polite, but skeptical.  It was laid out on a display board, so close to being mine- its little Tiffany blue bag set neatly beside it.   Wrap it up- I'll take it! I'll be passing on my cheap knock off oval tag, it's the real thing, baby!  $330. I'd never spent that kind of money on anything. My rent was $400, FFS.   Guess who forgot to tell the bank I'd be traveling? This girl. STRAIGHT UP DENIED.   The looks of "knew it" as I left the store penetrated my soul. I've had walk of shames that were way less shameful.  I called the bank and eventually got it sorted and went back for my necklace.   I haven't worn it in probably 8 years at the least. Don't even know if they still make them.	episode_done:True

text:Inspo Album: Back to School - a Dark(ish) Academia Inspired Style Album	labels:I love this album....I take a lot of inspo from the dark academia style (although I like to call my style "Goth Academia") I do find that a lot of what I see online leans into the more "young student"element of academia,but I really like that this one has more mature professor type leanings.	episode_done:True

text:I super agree with wear it at home, especially with the pandemic. Since March I've been wearing those more out there blouses and outfits that I bought but have been usually too nervous to wear. I work from home rn so waking up and picking out an outfit has been a fun way to keep some sort of routine. I feel good wearing them when I (sadly rarely) go  my partner to get groceries and the like. Now the final step I think is wearing it out one day when I meet up with friends and folks I know again.   For whatever reason I just dread the comments of "oh wow that's new" or "dang all dressed up" but in reality it's not a big deal. People won't have seen me irl in basically a year so what better time to say I changed things up	labels:About the comments from others, this was one that I struggled with for a long time. I think it’s important to think about any and all other reasons that may have led to them making those comments. Honestly, I think it’s more likely that most people say that kind of stuff because they’re searching for a way to start a conversation and that’s all they could quickly come up with it. Not necessarily that they wanted to point out or judge your choice in clothing. It’s also relieving over time to push away the feeling that you’re obligated to explain yourself. If that’s not the conversation you want to have, simply say yep or thanks and move the conversation along :)	episode_done:True
text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:After I traveled to a place where people constantly stared at me no matter what I wore, I kind of got over it. Getting older has also helped me to feel less self-conscious. Bright colors and interesting details make me happy, and I think people can tell when I feel comfortable with what I wear.   Even if it looks off, who's going to remember? Do you remember what you thought about some random stranger from 2 weeks ago? Probably not.	episode_done:True
text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:A few tips that work for me in thrift stores: - I pick one section and don't feel like i have to check out the entire store.  - I go through racks and touch everything and stop when I touch something that feels like a nice fabric - silk, cashmere, good wool, crisp cotton. This helps me get to the nice stuff when the racks are visually overwhelming. - try on lots of things! Sometimes you fall in love with stuff you didn't expect to.   On websites that are searchable: - have a very specific item in mind or a specific brand you like - narrow the search results by size, brand, color, and fabric - pay attention to the measurements to see if things will fit - don't be afraid to make low offers on sites where you can do that  I find online thrifting very different than in-store thrifting, because online, you can search for all kinds of specific things, where in a store, most of the fun comes from finding something unexpected.	episode_done:False
text:> I go through racks and touch everything and stop when I touch something that feels like a nice fabric - silk, cashmere, good wool, crisp cotton.  If anyone is curious, this is a trainable skill. Go to a thrift store. Just go down a rack and touch every garment in the rack. Make a guess in your mind about what fabric it is, and then check the actual material label. If you do this over and over again, your guesses will become more accurate until you can accurately predict what the material labels will say. It's a skill that can be systematically practiced.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Second on feeling fabrics quickly. If I feel a fabric that seems decent I’ll go look at the tags, what materials its comprised of, and what country it was made in. I don’t discriminate necessarily by country, but if it’s a fabric I’m not entirely sold on and it says “Made in China”, I’ll pass. If it’s a great fabric and it says “Made in China”, I’m fine with it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:I do pretty well at smaller, “high-end” consignment stores and I **love** getting a good deal.  * Pay attention to fabrics. A lot of brands make nice clothes in cheap fabrics. To me, this defeats the purpose of buying from “fancy” brands.  * Have an idea of what you want before you go shopping, but be open to other options. I love coats and have gotten two great coats on consignment when I was really there to check out the shoes. It’s also a good idea to shop for items that are out of season but that aren’t so trendy that you won’t feel like wearing them when the right season rolls around. Now would be a great time to shop for boots, for example (assuming you’re in the northern hemisphere).  * If you’re comfortable shopping in person during these crazy times, try stuff on! Even if the fit isn’t perfect, trying stuff on can help you see which areas may need to be tailored. If you’re getting a garment that retails for $700 on consignment for less than $100, spending a bit of money on tailoring is still a bargain.  * Be patient! I got a very cute pair of heeled loafers by Bally after searching for a proper pair of heeled loafers for MONTHS. Persistence is key!	episode_done:True
text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:I buy almost everything from thrift shops. I keep a list of items I'm looking to buy (black turtleneck, navy sweater vest, etc), on my phone. Whenever I'm near a thrift shop, I stop in to check for those items only.   I have a lot of success this way and I spend very little time shopping.	episode_done:True
text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:I'm very successful at online secondhand shopping since I search by my measurements on websites like eBay and etsy - like "x bust y waist" and then narrow it down by dress, sweater, fabric era, etc. I've found some lovely treasures that way!	episode_done:True
text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:Most of my secondhand finds are from online auctions or poshmark-type sites. I’d say about half my wardrobe is from these places (more like 80% for shoes).  - Have a pattern. Search for the same items/brands/keywords over time and get a good idea of what’s available and what a fair price is.   - Buy fabrics, brands and cuts you already know and like. I’ve made some big mistakes with things like second hand cashmere because I don’t normally wear it and I didn’t know what to look for.   - Be picky. There’s so much choice that it becomes overwhelming, so you’ve got to have a firm idea of what your dislikes are. No matter how cute the garment is, I won’t buy certain things... for example, visible distressing, suede footwear and polka dot are all off the table because I just won’t wear them.   You’ve got to be willing to take the hits with the misses when you’re doing this online - I’d say my success rate is around 50/50 for things that make it into my regular wardrobe rotation. I do my best to resell my fails, and I’d say I probably break even on average, but it’s a lot of effort and not for the faint hearted. But I love doing it so it’s more like a hobby than a chore - but it’s not for everyone, and there’s no shame in that!	episode_done:True
text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:I buy a lot of my stuff on Depop or Etsy. I've found that the easiest way to do it is know what you want and have a lot of strict rules for yourself. If you're just looking to browse and buy whatever catches your eye like you would in a store, it's gonna be harder. So recently I've been buying a lot of jumpers. These are my rules:  * no fast fashion brands * under £20 * must be "buy it now" because I can't be bothered with auctions * must be at least 50% wool * must show a photo of the label stating the materials used * body of the jumper must be at least the same length as the sleeves because I don't want a cropped jumper * must have a picture of the front and back of the jumper * Nothing that has a brand name or logo outwardly visible  so my search terms are things like "wool jumper size S" "vintage wool jumper" "Ralph Lauren wool jumper" etc. which narrows it down massively from just searching "jumper".  Then I filter by "used" and "buy it now" (on Ebay)  Sometimes I then sort by Price - Low to High, sometimes I don't bother.   Then because of my rules, I know quickly wether something meets my criteria, so I'll open like 20 tabs that meet the criteria without looking closely at them.   When I've got about 20 open, I'll actually go through them and decide if I like / want any of them.	episode_done:True
text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!!

It’s not like regular shopping where you go, spend 20 minutes looking, and leave with 5 pieces you really love. Last time I went thrifting I spent probably about 2 hours looking, tried on 7 things, and ended up only buying one. If taking the time to dig through piles of trash to find the one treasure is t really your jam, thrifting probably isn’t really for you.	episode_done:True

So at the time the hourglass ideal was just overshadowed by the need to not look "fat" it any way (especially in the 90s).	episode_done:False
text:Seriously, I love how skinny jeans and leggings show off my calves and ankles. And they don’t make my hips look any bigger than flares did, even now when I actually have bigger hips. I also tend to wear my shirts right at the widest part of my hips instead of above it or below it, which apparently is a pear shape no-no. Oh well.	labels:	episode_done:True

I have a pair of dark brown UGGs (not the classic style, they look more like regular boots) that have served me well for years but for whatever reason I'm itching for a new pair. Was thinking of Mukluks but they're really A Look and I guess something more neutral might work better with the rest of my clothes. (But should I care? I don't know)  * A pair of soft suede moccasins as casual slip-ons for Fall--I'd go ahead and buy, but I can't quite decide on a color, black or cognac or warm brown or gray...? * Allbirds in a bright color with a colored sole.

My wardrobe is crazy as well, like elegant, boho, goth, japanese fashion, girly stuff lol But it's so destructive to buy so much stuff.

text:Yep. This. I recently realized that my spending problem was extremely similar to the way Binge Eating works , and have been trying to do things in moderation (financial version of intuitive eating ) and it’s been working ! It’s frustrating though because a lot of people , my friends specifically, don’t realize how much of a problem it is , and mock me for not just “stop spending and use all your money to pay your debt” , the spending in moderation has been helping me pay off debt without accumulating more !	labels:This is super interesting to me because I’m in a unique financial situation. My husband and I paid off all debt except mortgage when we were 22 and 25. It was the crazy Dave Ramsey intense debt reduction on very small salaries (nonprofit work and jr enlisted military), but we paid off $35k in 20 months...and then we had to move and I lost my job. Things went from VERY tight (due to our priorities) to a little looser, but still no real money. Don’t think I bought new clothes except for running shoes, and a few bras in 2+ years. Now, fast forward another year+, I ended up going back to school and we are still living on one salary. Husband has been promoted so our budget is looser...and I have a hard time controlling my miscellaneous budget because I went through like a spending drought for SO long that every time I see a good deal on something, I’m like “Oh I should get that because idk when we might need it and not be able to afford it,” especially basics like jeans, bras, etc.  I’m worried for when I graduate in a few months and our income like quadruples. Ain’t no telling where that money is going to end up.	episode_done:False

text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:Personally, I would say it all boils down to feeling like I need a 'treat' when I'm having a tough time. I grew up with a single mum and money was kind of tight, so although she did the best she could, I didn't have a games console or label clothes or the latest trendy toys, and I only ever got anything at christmas or on my birthday. I learnt from very early on not to pester my mum for something in the shop, because the answer was always no.  When I got older and had my own money, I loved to save it. I didn't really get to go anywhere, and so if I did have the occasional day out with friends, I'd make the most of it and spend the money I had been saving up. I guess along the way it became like a special treat that made me feel like I had a chance at 'fitting in' with my friends and finding myself, because I got the chance to buy things that weren't picked out by an adult as a gift or second- third- fourth- hand from the car boot or charity shop.  Nowadays, impulse buys give me a surge of happiness that I can be who I want and buy what I want, and it just makes me feel better when I'm struggling.	episode_done:False

text:Future of fibers?	labels:I think the future of fashion will be that natural fibers will get increasingly rare in the mainstream, but I hope that etsy sellers/minimalism fashion/indie brands that are the source of a lot of my 100% natural products evolve in the future to be more stylish and less “handmade.” I was a teen in the 90s with a mom who was obsessed with 100% cotton and I remember going shopping with her and maybe 30% of the items were that. Last year I went into a Club Monaco looking for either an 100% cotton or linen top and was told that they didn’t have any of that in the store. And Club Monaco isn’t cheap.  >Are there are any brand's or companies that have been successful in using natural fibers and also have quality products?  My list for cotton and linen (because I turned out to be my mom):  - Eileen Fisher  - Jungmaven (hemp)  - Lilla P   - Sunspel  - Demylee  - Tela 9  - The Great  - Amomento  - Filosophia  - Frank and Eileen  - Le Bon Shoppe (my opaque white shirt haven)  - Muji  - Nicholas  - Norse Projects  - SEA NY  That minimalist look:  - Esby Apparel   - Hackwith Design House  - Wol Hide  - Not Perfect Linen (etsy)  - Epic Linen (etsy)  - Linen Sea (etsy)  Affordable:  - Hanes, especially the ultraweight cotton tees  - Uniqlo  - Lands End  You can also find some 100% natural stuff starting at accessible luxury and midlevel designer brands like Tory Burch, Vince, Theory, Ulla Johnson, Comme des Garcons, Frame, APC, L’Agence, ATM etc. as well as mens/outdoors stores like LL Bean. but I listed only the brands that carry mostly 100% or for affordable brands, at least offer a decent selection consistently. All carry cotton and linen of the quality that I remember in my youth as opposed to the paper thin stuff except maybe Uniqlo which is similar in quality to... say Madewell but cheaper/different style	episode_done:False
text:Hello. Thank you so much for sharing this.  I grew up in Mumbai. And I never knew what was handloom fabrics till 2 years ago.  Ever since I have access to handloom/handmade fabric, I always prefer that. What companies label as 100% cotton/linen does have chemicals and a slight synthetic feel compared to the handloom fabrics. But I have come across certain machine made fabrics which are so comfortable that I'd want to wear it even if they are old or torn. They just get better with time.  I'm exploring if and how to take natural handloom clothes to masses. In a sustainable way. Economically and environmentally.  Thank you so much for sharing the brand's with me 🙏	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Future of fibers?	labels:Personally I don’t find it very difficult or expensive to shop for clothing made with natural fibers — if anything it’s gotten even easier to do so with online shopping and websites showing fiber content right in the product description. I don’t have to seek out brands that specialize in natural materials either — my clothing is mostly from Madewell, which doesn’t really market itself as being all that environmentally conscious or sustainable, and is definitely not a high end brand, but they have tons of options for clothing made of cotton, silk, etc.   I will say it’s gotten harder to find sweaters made of 100% wool over the years, however. I have several wool sweaters from mall brands that I bought just a few years ago. I gained some weight since then and have been looking for replacements from the same exact brands and it seems like they don’t even bother with 100% wool anymore, all of their sweaters are now made with acrylic, nylon, polyester, etc. That’s the only natural fiber that I feel has all but disappeared from the mainstream for some reason.   I will also add that I don’t think man made fibers are necessarily “cheap”, either. We’ve come a long way from man made materials of the 80s and 90s. When I think of man made fibers of today, I think of technical clothing and gear such as outdoor or sportswear. Patagonia for example is the poster child for environmentally friendly brands, but most of their clothing is made from man made materials, and their products are far from cheap. Partly because it performs better for its purpose, and partly because it’s supposed last a lifetime.  Which leads me to my last thought — IMO man made materials aren’t necessarily bad for the environment. It’s really our habits that are bad, and the industries that cater to these habits. If we all bought a few items of clothing that were all man made and lasted our lifetime, that is arguably *more* environmentally friendly than if we were constantly buying and throwing away natural fibered clothing.	episode_done:False
text:While natural fibers are hard on the environment, man-made fibers release microfibers into our water ways, which are polluting the ocean. Fish have been caught that have balls of microfibers in their stomachs, and even people are thought to have microfibers circulating in our bodies. These microfibers are terrible for the oceans and may have an effect on our health. Scientists are trying to study whether microfibers cause inflammation, which could implicate these fibers in cancer. Man made fibers also often require toxic chemicals to be created, which harm the workers who make the fibers. There is no perfect solution, but I think figuring out how to filter out micro plastics or making synthetic fibers that don't harm the workers who create them and can properly decompose or be recycled easily would be sustainable solutions.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:> I would suggest looking into local producers  I want this to be the future of not just fashion but the whole global economy. So many places (at least in the US) have lost "local flavor" to global brands, and that minimizes the diversity of options, competition, innovation, and perspectives in fashion and every industry. We need to move towards a better balance of local and global production and identify ways we can strengthen small businesses and enable them to compete and (re)establish a local culture.	labels:Yeah, i agree completely. Its difficult to actually do often (i live in reasonably northern Canada, like not North but we do not have a winter growing season of any appreciable value) so if i don't want to like get scurvy in the winter I won't be buying local.   But listening to first nations peoples and incorporating traditional health knowledge would be a way to solve this issue - is that going to happen on a large scale, probably not.

text:Any experiences with Wonder Wardrobe or other online courses?	labels:I have followed the WW course ! It's nice but it still leaves you with a lot of questions. My wardrobe hasn't really changed. I think you need to be very much involved and focused and I don't really have the time and money for that.  I also feel like it gave me even more 'rules' to follow and now I have less fun than before with my clothes.  Capsule wardrobe is not for me, I don't own many clothes but seeing the same 8 tops every day is depressing to me.	episode_done:False
text:Oh! That's interesting, I feel less sure about taking the course after reading comments.  Did you feel that her style personality categories were too rigid? Another comment mentioned that she apparently uses "five fashion personalities".  If you watched her YouTube channel, would you say her course goes a lot deeper than it, or can you basically get the idea from watching her YouTube?	labels:Hi, sorry for super late reply!  I didn't really felt like the fashion personnalities were too rigid, but she uses seasons to describe different kind of people and what color scheme looks good on them.  While it's not super rigid and she does mention it's just an advice, I ended up not wanting to wear some clothes I loved just because of it. I'm also not sure I agree with the classification. For exemple, I think I'm supposed to be a Winter type (cold, bright colors), but I find that a dark orange looks ok on me. Maybe I got my type wrong though !  I think it gets more in-depth than her YouTube videos, but the fashion advice she gives can all be found somewhere else online. It's just handier and she is very clear in her explanations, which is nice. There is also a very helpful community.  I hope this helps :)	episode_done:True
text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:I think start by looking at pictures online on Pinterest or Instagram of styles you find aesthetically pleasing and create a little dashboard with outfits that catch your eye. You can also think about some of your favourite actors or singers that wear outfits you like and try to save the pictures you find. After that i would go window-shopping online on websites that fit your budget and look around trying to find pieces similar to any outfits you saw. fyi; i would browse on a website first and then go to the actual store to try out what you saw online, it gives you an idea of what you’re looking for.  I think imitation is the easiest way to start finding your style. Once your comfortable in a type of style you can start experimenting with it and picking more personalized pieces. Good luck :)	episode_done:False
text:I've tried that but feel like the outfits are too much for a casual stop at the grocery store. Any tips on that?	labels:Part of it is accepting that it's okay to dress up for the everyday. You do everyday stuff every day so why would you exclude those things from opportunities to feel like your best self?   Now is, I think, a perfect time to play around with atypical/"special"/non-casual pieces in every day wear. There's been a great blurring of lines between occaisions and I'm seeing lots of real business wear matched with casual items, like pencil skirts with chuck taylors or dress pants and denim jackets. Ultimately, it is the full package more so than indivdiual pieces that make an outfit appropriate for a situation. That isn't to say that there aren't specific items that are inherently inappropriate for some settings, but that at least some of the partitions we've placed between items of clothing are unnecessary and arbitrary, and they prevent creative engagement with your closet.	episode_done:True

text:I've tried that but feel like the outfits are too much for a casual stop at the grocery store. Any tips on that?	labels:My style aspiration has always been something analogous to let's say upper east side. Completely not practical for my budget or lifestyle. For awhile I avoided it, but honestly I didn't really feel like I came into my own style wise until I figured out how to adapt things to my own life.   What I liked was a put together look, polished accessories, and femme style.   For me that means combining dressy with casual. The skirt goes with sneakers. Instead of a blouse, I might wear a tee shirt. Instead of heels - fancy flats. And overall I found my own interpretation of things.	episode_done:True

text:I've tried that but feel like the outfits are too much for a casual stop at the grocery store. Any tips on that?	labels:I look for ways they can be made more casual by focusing on the silhouettes or components. My Pinterest is full of wool trousers, delicate gauzy blouses, full skirts, and chunky sweaters. I probably wouldn't wear an outfit with all of those components to the grocery store, but I might wear mom jeans with a pretty blouse and Keds, or a more casual skirt with a chunky sweater and some flat ankle boots, for example.	episode_done:False
text:Thanks!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:I recommend doing two things:   1 - look at your current wardrobe and pick out what outfits you consider your favorite. Ask yourself why you gravitate to those items. Is it a color? A theme? A certain look? Those are some clues to your style.   2 - if you follow fashion bloggers or general fashion posts, ask yourself why you follow them. There is a likelihood that you follow them because you like their look/style.    Now, with more insight into what style you currently have and styles you aspire to have, you may get closer to defining your style. Don't feel too bad if you can't explicitly name it (ie: preppy, vintage, casual, etc). Your personal style is more nuanced and probably a combination of multiple categories.	episode_done:False

text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:I would agree with a lot of the other advice here-look at what you like in your closet, why you like those, look on pinterest instagram etc. I would also mention that you can start out shopping or just browsing online for things you like. Once you have an idea of what you are looking for you can check online stores that have locations in your area. That way when you go out shopping you arent as overwhelmed and have a plan going into it.   Covid permitting ofc	episode_done:True
text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:Something that helped me find out what my style was has been looking at celebritys/pinterest boards outfits and seeing what I liked. Then I figured out why I liked that. After that I looked at what I already had and cleared out the things I didn't like or wear and determined what I needed (basics, staples).  To start shopping for me it is helpful to have an idea of what I'm looking for or what stores I like so it doesn't get overwhelming.  I also recommend beginning to look online. It is easier to do a little at a time and you can see what's in stock at stores near you.   Also recommend depop!! Find what you like, you can follow people with similar style or size	episode_done:True
text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:Your “style” is basically what you are comfortable in. If you are not comfortable browsing the mall for hours then it’s obviously not your thing. Although what we wear do play a factor in how people perceive us we cant really let that affect our style, because at the end of the day literally everyone has their own opinion and you cant make everyone happy. You can only make yourself happy so do whats best for you. Other than that if you do want to experiment with various aesthetics but Don’t wanna spend time at the mall just shop online, or maybe try thrifting (just give everything a wash first).	episode_done:True
text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:Here with you. I've started getting dressed and putting on makeup just to stay at home all day and it helps my mood for sure, but the times I do get to go out I get *so* excited for. I'll dress up just to for a fire in someone's backyard. But on the upside, getting dressed just to sit at home gives me a lot more confidence to try things I wouldn't have tried before and hopefully will be more comfortable wearing when restrictions lift.	episode_done:True
text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:GIRL, ME. I miss dressing up so much! I've been dressing and doing my makeup to run errands, but it just doesn't feel as fun when I have to wear a mask and I'm not out with friends.   I miss wearing heels. I miss wearing lipstick. I miss being able to wear statement earrings without them getting caught in my mask loops. I miss wearing bronzer and blush. I miss being able to do my hair (I mostly keep it up when I go out, to avoid it getting tangled with my mask loops). I MISS SHOPPING WITH FRIENDS.   Ugh. I just wanna do my makeup and wear bright red lipstick (Patrick Ta's "She's Not From Here") and put on a really cute outfit, and go out shopping and then to lunch with friends. There's so much we took for granted 😭	episode_done:True
text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:I miss getting dressed a lot. I don’t really have lounge clothes, just exercise, so I was really struggling with clothing at the beginning of this.   Additionally, I just graduated my masters program, and my job during the school year essentially had a uniform, so I was really excited about graduating and starting a new job to get dressed again. And then here we are.   I also miss getting dressed for occasions. I already had my graduation outfits picked out, and had three weddings this summers that I was looking forward to wearing dresses to. Going to the grocery store is now the only time I can put on clothing and I’m just really sad. I know there’s a lot of people who are like “just wear your clothing in your house!” Which yes, I can definitely do that. But part of the joy of getting dressed for me was the “going somewhere” part. Picking out my outfit felt like I was putting on a costume to play a part for the day, which I loved. I know I am so so fortunate that I can safely work from home; but I really miss my “characters”. Wedding guest, or fancy date night, or professional worker in winter. All those roles have been reduced to WFH and grocery shopper now and I’m just really sad about it.	episode_done:True
text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:I just feel bad that as soon as I got to the point of having upgraded most of my pieces and wearing nicer fabrics, etc, I would have been the same off with just keeping my crappier clothes.  Also in my early 30s in the city.   But, I will say that the quarantine helped me start exploring the wide leg pant look, and dressing glamorously when I do leave the house because who the fuck cares now? They can't even see my face.	episode_done:True
text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:I have worked from home for years, I also was a competitive athlete so I basically have lived in comfy/workout attire for as long as I can remember.

Last night I was in my closet and noticed my section of "nice" clothes; dresses, pencil skirts, leather jackets, things I had carefully selected and curated over the years. It seems like it's all from another life now and makes me sad.	episode_done:True

But heck, do I miss getting all made up and going out! lol I have 2 new cashmere sweaters from Eric Bompard, a baguette purse from Leo et Violette, a vintage silk Bvlgari silk scarf I snatched off ebay, Bally pumps... all waiting for the time to get dressed up and show off, and no place to go \*weeps\*	episode_done:True

My morning routine includes changing, and on "weekends" (days my SO is off work) I wear house dresses or leggings, but the rest of the time I put real outside clothes on. I still spend time trying out new outfits, to keep it fresh since I'm not buying much right now. I'd encourage you to try it out, even if you don't have plans to leave the house! I joined a facebook group called "I'm high and this is what I'm wearing" and post there on days I feel the need to share my outfits but won't see anyone.	episode_done:True

I misrepresented my point by putting knits at odds with maximalism when I really was just trying to find a word to describe the overtly hard/uncomfortable trend elements like studs, leather, sequins, etc. I actually love maximalism, the minimalist look is not for me as I'm not a "fashion body" who can really pull off the minimalist look, and I love color and texture.

text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:I tend to purchase from Old Navy, Target, and various mall brands most often. I get pretty good longevity out of most of what I buy. I especially like to get athletic wear from Old Navy. My current supply of compression shorts/leggings from Old Navy are from 2016.  These are some of my longest lived items from fast fashion.  Fleece fall coat from TJ Maxx - 2012 - This was my go-to coat for chilly weather for several years. Now I just wear it for an extra layer on cold hikes, but it's still in really good condition. Has a couple of burn marks on the sleeve from bonfires though.  Running shorts (Nike knock-offs) from Wal-Mart - 2012 - I bought 2 pairs when I started running back then and 1 pair finally failed on me this past week (thread came out of the decorative piping). These have been a godsend during my pregnancy this summer (comfy elastic band for my growing stomach) and I've actually bought 4 more pairs off Poshmark to keep them in my rotation.  Navy blue trouser slacks from New York & Co. - 2014 - I bought these shortly after starting my first job after college. Wore them a lot at that first job, not as much at my second since I could wear jeans instead.	episode_done:True
text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:* H&M mini-length black pencil skirt with floral embroidery. I almost bought the dress version of this as well since I love the embroidery so much. The first time I wore it was to the mall and the sales assistant of a different store asked me if it was a Dior piece, I was super stoked.  * Zara kids olive drape-y trench. I'm petit enough to fit into Zara's kids stuff and this trench was like half the price of a very similar looking women's trench (also Zara). It's very versatile, my cost per wear is \~$1.50  I have some pieces that I bought off Taobao (black pleated mini skirt, my only pair of denim shorts, a white short sleeve blouse, and a lavender knit top) that's also around the $1.00 per wear.	episode_done:True
text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:Green fir and flare dress from H&M-- I bought this in 2014-15 when dresses didn't resemble potato sacks and this has been a tried and true piece for me.  While it is a summer dress, a cardigan (or a blazer, but I find those uncomfortable and would only wear one for a job interview) makes this cold weather (please please get here!) appropritae.  Cranberry velvet dress from Primark.  I paid $2 for this on a clearance rack.  The next year, I was invited to a nonprofit fundraiser with a friend and threw this on last minute (I changed in my office bathroom) for this fundraiser.  One of the guests at this fundraiser was a (now grown) child actor (now married) who has been on his fair share of red carpets.  His wife commented on how much she loved my dress.  To think someone who's walked Hollywood red carpets complimented on a $3 dress.  Target Xhilaration coat-- this is a mint green peacoat bought when the twee aesthetic (which is one I'm drawn to) was more popular (Before everything was boxy and oversized).  I'm going on my 5th or 6th winter with it.	episode_done:True
text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:I have an old pair of jeans from target, probably 8 years old and one of those lines they don’t make anymore.

text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:I have a Charlot Russe dusty pink off the shoulder dress. Brought it last minute when attending a wedding. I love it.

I don't know how old this is but it has a pink tag on it and all my coworkers (At H&M) state that it means its supper old. My classmate gave it to me and I love it.   H&M Big fur coat. Super warm and nicely oversized. Makes me feel like a sugar baby  Most of my shoes. I have like two non-fast fashioned shoes. But everything else is fast fashion and they rock.	episode_done:True
text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:A long black cardigan from Primark. I picked it up when I accidentally lost my sweater while at a work conference and couldn't bear the thought of spending the next few days in air conditioned conference rooms without some kind of replacement, and I was also on a pretty tight budget. It's one of my favorite pieces of clothing that I own. And it has pockets!  A solid black tee that I bought at Dress Barn a decade ago. It has a great slim fit, and it's soft and not at all see-through. I've worn it probably at least every other week (if not more often), and it's still in great condition.  A long lightweight grey sweater from H&M that I bought on a whim years ago. It's cut in such a way that it can either be worn as a duster sweater or can be tied in the front for a shorter trendier look. It was less than $10 and I honestly didn't expect it to last for more than a few washes, but it's one of my favorites and has held up far better than I expected.	episode_done:True

Looks good with literally everything, and it’s perfect for when I feel like not wearing pants but also don’t want to shave. Win win.  A velvet cami from SheIn before it was popular haha, I eventually got more colours and they’re still holding strong a couple of years later.  Knit sandals from amazon, fav purchase ever!

Here are some of the conventions that were adhered to:  A lady does not remove her hat when indoors or for the national anthem. This is in contrast to men, who are to remove hats when indoors and for the anthem. However, if you‘re sporting a baseball cap at a ballgame, I would remove it for the anthem, whereas if you were wearing a more formal outfit with hat then I would not remove it.  A hat is a daytime piece in most cases not suitable for evening wear. The fascinator is an exception to this rule, but is more of a Commonwealth/British thing.

text:Girl if I go to the trouble to put on a hat and secure it to my head, you better believe I'm keeping that shit on inside.

text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Its ok if a strict capsule doesn't work for you. Everyone's capsule can be different. You could have a secondary casule for your bright stuff to mix and match if you want! It's all about what works for you.	episode_done:False
text:And that may very well be. My idea for wanting to set up a capsule wardrobe was because in the last 5 years, I've moved 7 times, so I'm trying to keep my clothing as little as possible. With a capsule wardrobe, I can have, say, 20-30 pieces and 50+ outfits with them instead of having 20-30 pieces of non-matching color schemes and having maybe 20 outfits.	labels:One more thing, if you can narrow your colors a little, it helps with cohesiveness. Like 1-2 neutrals and 2-3 colors for everything else. You still get some color, but there are a few limits. I have a rule that all my patterns need to have at least one of my colors in it. The primary color should be one of my neutrals or one of my colors, and then it can have anything else after that! If it is a pattern that prioritizes my neutral, then it also needs one of the actual colors too. In my world, that means, if I get a floral item with black, then it should have some pink. It can't be only blues, reds. and greens.	episode_done:False

text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I don't have a capsule wardrobe per se, but I do have a color palette that isn't exclusively neutrals that (imo) goes together. I have some neutrals (warm gray tones, black, off-white, camel) and some colors (forest green, red orange). I have suit jackets in each of the colors I've listed above and camis in each color as well; I tend to stick to neutral bottoms (white or black jeans) so my tops are more colorful. I don't think a capsule has to be exclusively neutral, but do try to pick a family of colors that work together (e.g. all of my color choices are warm-toned vs. cool toned greens, reds, greys, etc.).	episode_done:False

text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I think jewelry and/or accessories can be a good idea for your loud/bold statement pieces. Earrings, necklaces, bracelets, belts, hats, etc. They are more transferable and they can be incorporated with a lot of clothing.	episode_done:True
text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Expand your definition of "statement piece" to include texture, pattern, silhouette, and x-factors instead of just colors vs neutrals. A shiny pant makes a statement even if it's black. An oversized blazer makes a statement even if it's tan. A snake print bag or skirt  makes a statement even if it's shades of brown or grey.   Some other ideas that might help: make color decisions based on seasons - if you have a lot of winterwear you love in a certain color scheme, start there and weed out what doesn't go with those faves, and so on with the other seasons. Make pinterest boards with the colors you're considering. Take pictures of combinations you like. Consider what colors you like best on yourself.	episode_done:True

text:Opals are so lovely. I would agree here, jewelry can be so subjective I would say pearl, diamond, gold and silver/white gold studs (or good looking imitations of any/all depending on budget) are good any occasion go to pieces. Even a standard pearl necklace or even studs isn’t necessarily going to be something someone with an edgier asthmatic would go for, I think standards fall more in to categories- daily wear, statement and fancy. For more of an upper class type of vibe I’d say for necklaces a diamond collar style or choker for fancy, pearl strand and perhaps something with a tasteful small scale  pendant or single colored stone for everyday and a funky maybe chunky mixed metals or stones piece for statement. Edgier might be a sharp glitter crusted but not over large ice pick pendant (icicle? Skinny inverted triangle shape...I’m sure they are called something else but I cannot think of the proper name) on a standard 18-20” braided or box chain for everyday, large round stone on a long  chain for fancy and a chain mail type collar for statement. Personally my go to pendants are a sparkly star which was my first real diamond jewelry and a cz unicorn my husband got me on a thin but not super fine chain and rose gold bezel set cz studs for every day. Little dress I change up the earrings to something with a dangle and if I’m going fancy I have a choker (on me) with white gold alternating small ‘bars’ and geometric balls and I add a long chain with a chunky pendant. Favorite statement piece is a Betsy Johnson with a large fixed crystal pineapple.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:Please never take advice from "X things everyone should own" lists. There is nothing everyone "should" own. Not diamonds, not pearls, none of it.   It's all based on your own preferences, needs, and lifestyle.  What do YOU like? What is your personality like? What do you wear? What kind of lifestyle do you have? What is your fashion style and "look" like? What are your undertones? What is your budget?  Answering those questions may help someone give you advice regarding jewelry. Prescriptive "everyone should own" lists are completely worthless.	episode_done:False
text:You are so right!   My signature clothing style is Boho/Cowgirl/Hippie, so even though I own the pearls and diamond studs, I’ve not worn them in years. However my Native American squash blossoms, Navajo pearls and turquoise cuff bracelets get worn literally everywhere, every day. Probably going to sell off the former to buy more of the latter, because there is no such thing as too much Turquoise!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:This is one of those things you need to pick according to what you like. Classic jewellery can look outdated.  For example, I have no interest in diamonds so have no interest in owning any (Or any imitation ones), although I would say the diamond studs are the closest to timeless you'll get. I do like pearls, but until quite recently they were not "fashionable" and read as either dated or a statement piece, depending on how you styled them and who you were. Also, pearls come in different shapes and I think the baroque pearls were less "old lady" than round ones. But Im.not sure if they were ever mainstream popular or just Etsy-boho crowd popular? So, no not necessarily timeless looking. Another thing with real pearls is they are not stones and they are perishable. They will deteriorate if you don't care for/store them correctly. If you can't be bothered with that then get glass, Swarovski make nice ones.  Turquoise and coral read as very 2000s to me (It's lovely but it just seems that way to me!) and amber very "middle aged art teacher". So again, a stone might not seem timeless. Size and shape and length of beaded necklaces go in and out of style too.  As for types, I don't like bracelets/watches much , and rings don't suit my lifestyle anymore so I don't wear any of my collection now.   Basicly, buy things you like that go with what you wear and suit your lifestyle. If you want to invest in beautiful pieces you love then do it, but don't expect any of it to be "timeless"/always look contemporary.	episode_done:True
text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I think a lot of other people have hammered in the point that jewelry is personal, and that lists like these aren't necessarily helpful. But here's a list of my must-haves.  1. super small gold huggie hoop earrings 2. medium 1-2" gold hoop earrings 3. long dangly statement gold earrings 4. gold choker necklace  5. gold delicate pendant necklace, sits around your collarbone 6. long, large pendant necklace 7. sparkly stud earrings 8. jade pendant necklace  I don't like wearing jewelry on my hands, except for my wedding ring. I also much prefer gold over silver-- the yellower the better.	episode_done:True
text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I don’t know about everyone but for me there are pieces of jewelry I own that even if not currently trendy I still use and reach for time and time again.  Hoop earrings - not large and not too small - a pair in gold and a pair in silver.   Diamond studs. Pearl studs.  Thin bangle bracelets - again silver and gold.  Thick cuffs. Depending on my outfit I like having the weight of a cuff on my wrist. It can make me feel like Wonder Woman!  I think bold rings are beautiful on my hands. I have a ring my Mom gave me. It’s an oval dome turquoise stone set in gold. It’s an unusual piece and I love it!   I have a good quality watch I only used for special occasions because it clashes with my Fitbit.  I have a very old (60+) gold crucifix with intricate open scroll work and a tiny red ruby in the center. It’s about an inch long and I’ve been searching for the right chain so it lays right about my cleavage. The gold is from Greece so it’s hard to match the color of the gold. I would wear this all the time.	episode_done:True
text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I agree with the general sentiment that there's no jewelry you "need" to own or that fits all lifestyles. I've had the same 6 rings on for years, I don't take them off ever, no matter how casual or fancy an event. I have two holes in each ear but can't remember the last time I wore earrings, I can wear a necklace for a bit but after a few hours it bugs me to have something constantly touching my neck. That said, I do have pieces from my grandmother I like to break out occasionally; a (fake) ivory elephant pendant and a turquoise penguin necklace. I wear her opal ring every day. My engagement ring will have her sapphires in it.   That said, if you're looking for some basics I think your list sounds great. I'd look more at your own wardrobe than trends to decide whether you lean toward cool silver or warm gold, your occupation to decide whether hoops or studs are more practical, your social activities to decide whether you'd like to invest in true gemstones or costume jewelry. Maybe a few pendant you love and chains of varying widths/lengths so it's as versatile as possible?	episode_done:True

Do we really expect major fashion houses to all abandon blazers and leather pants and start showing PJs and sweatpants on the runway?   Others have already pointed out that these collections have been designed months in advance, but consider another point - fashion has always been reactive. When forced to stay inside and only wear sweatpants for 6 months, people will rebel and start daydreaming and longing for the opposite. This pandemic was always going to inspire a sort of glam rock aesthetic, imo. BRING IT.	episode_done:False

There’s quite a few brands that offer natural fibers, minimalistic looks, but no guarantee that greenwashing isn’t involved or that they aren’t treating their employees like shit.

Big kitschy earrings, tiny dainty ones, etc. There are some true artisans out there.

text:Discussion: Clay Jewelry?	labels:I love polymer clay earrings (at least those made by the more skilled makers). The look is exactly the aesthetic I go for, and after years of feeling very meh about various precious metal jewelry, it was a relief to finally find this style. What kind of bugs me is that occasionally I've had pairs fall apart on me, whether the clay itself or the hot glue holding the studs on. I guess quality just varies dramatically from person to person, and it's tough to tell since we're buying from individuals selling their own creations on Etsy (and I want to support them in the end, so it's not really a big deal).	episode_done:True

Every clay set of jewelry (earrings and pendant necklace) I’ve ever owned has eventually broken - baring this last set of yellow earrings I’m now handling with extreme care.  They are beautiful and I’ll probably buy more because I love this girl’s work, but I just have to know going into it that this is not something I’ll most likely be able to keep forever and pass on, so I keep that in mind regarding price when purchasing them.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: Clay Jewelry?	labels:I think they are beautiful and that artists can get really creative with clay, resin, whatever. Like dried flowers encased in resin? Gorgeous.  My only concerns are practical. Sometimes, the material can be too heavy for my earlobes. (That comes with these earrings being statement pieces, I guess.) I’ve also noticed that not all artisans/brands know the earring post/earwire materials (or even if the material is “hypoallergenic”.)	episode_done:False
text:Honestly I feel like clip-on earrings are underrated.

Millennial fashion is put-together and professional, while it’s cool for Gen Z to, for example, wear clothes that are obviously from  the thrift store (generalizing).   I think it could partly have something to do with the larger influence of digital “aesthetic” pics on gen z. I’m on the cusp since I was born in 98 and i was really influenced by aesthetic tumblr and instagram photos growing up. like in 2014 i had a huge black-and-white grid, arctic monkeys, lana del rey, black-and-white striped turtleneck and black skater skirt tumblr phase and even though it’s not my style anymore, looking back on the aesthetics of that now, it makes me feel so nostalgic. that style for me is more about feeling dreamy and nostalgic than it is about looking good/attractive for other people. i’ve noticed that people younger than me will take that kind of thing further. an outfit creating nostalgic vibes is more important than it looking professional and presentable.   I also think that Gen Z style is less afraid to be matchy-matchy (which is such a taboo for more effortless, elegant Millennials). I think this also has to do with Gen Z style that is meant to achieve a certain aesthetic/vibe/fantasy.  I also think that growing up, Gen Z was more saturated with images and marketing, so being unique and original is more valued.	episode_done:True

text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:Nope, I am the reverse!  I do not own a dress, do have ONE summer skirt which I very very rarely wear.  I'm strictly a jeans/trousers/shorts Little Old Lady!	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:Without knowing what your pants/skirts look like, it’s hard to say exactly. But what I would do is stock up on some tshirts/long sleeve tshirts/vest in colours you have in your bottoms. Or even blouses in solid colours, whichever shape you normally like. That way it’s an easy mix match. (I do the opposite, love tops but only get basic bottoms that match most things.)	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:I kind of ran into this problem since I purged most my summer wardrobe last year, and the core of the rest of my wardrobe is dresses, which I just don’t like as much in summer.  I do think that if you’re just not going to choose separates over single pieces, foregoing them entirely is completely valid, once you’re not handicapping yourself.  What worked for me, since I ended up with a ton of midi skirts I really liked, but felt apathetic towards tops, was to just go the solid colour, traditionally flattering route (which I think is the smartest way of tackling elements of clothing you don’t care that much for.)  If I’m wearing separates, I’m always going to choose my bottom first, so not having to think much about what to pair them with is nice.	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:I also struggle with summer tops! I have lots of options for sweaters to wear with skirts and pants, and a few blouses (but I've always worked in business casual environments in cold climates so sweaters make more sense for me), but once summer hits I'm like ????? and just end up wearing my handful of work-appropriate dresses or t-shirts with the trousers and skirts and pray for cooler weather. I would love to have nicer summer blouses but can't ever seem to find any that a) I like and b) are actually work appropriate.	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:I have dresses and pants. Pants and skirts require different length shirts so I don't do both.	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:Omg YES! I'm the same. All I had were free T shirts to wear with any pants I had or my one white dress shirt. I hit up J Crew and sewed two boxy tops and now I have OPTIONS and two nice pull over sweaters I can wear in the winter.	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:Yeah, I wear dresses probably like 80-90% of the time, I think, and usually if I'm not wearing a dress then I'm wearing a skirt! For me it's just that it's easier to find dresses and skirts that fit better off the rack so they need a lot less tailoring, whereas jeans and trousers need a lot of tailoring for me and it gets expensive and time-consuming.  I have a lot of jumpers because I often wear them over a dress in autumn/winter, but otherwise my selection of tops is woefully pitiful haha. I quite like a nice lightweight camisole tucked into shorts or a skirt in summer though! But generally I don't wear a lot of separates (easier to coordinate that way too 😆).	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:This is me with cardigans.  I have an overflowing wardrobe and then two cardigans (well three, just bought one).	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:I worked in an office environment since starting after university, so my "uniform" has been business casual  attire consisting of button up shirts and blouses that I interchange with bottoms (dark trousers or pencil skirts). I find that going for a light and/or neutral coloured top, paired with a dark coloured (black, navy or grey) high waisted bottom has been worked for me.  It's about balance I think. Depending on your personal style, you can try a patterned, or colorful top paired with a dark coloured/neutral bottom, or vice versa. Or try monochromatic pairing, or some kind of color theme to the separates. Starting with neutrals is easier, and then maybe venturing into other color palettes, textures and patterns, depending on what you like.	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:i had this problem. i had a lot of cute pants and skirts, but like two shirts. i hated the idea of blouses (never worked a job where i needed to dress anything more than casual so it was ok), and wanted something stylish and practical.   so i got about 15 uniqlo airism long sleeved shirts for the winter in black and a pink-y color, for the summer i got about a million solid color cotton and linen deep v-neck tees from jcrew.   now i don't have to worry about my shirts anymore (which are always boring to me and i have a hard time finding ones that fit properly anyway) and i can focus on fun skirts and really loud patterned pants and my shirts will always match!  i usually pick up a couple trendy shirts each season so i'm not ONLY wearing tees, but this solution has worked really well for me.	episode_done:False
text:This was me for the longest time. I loved skirts and jeans (I also looove cardigans), but shopping for tops just didn’t interest me. I ended up stocking up on plain tees during a big sale all in one go — also from JCrew!   Then I got a job in an office that was always warm, and without my cardigans as a “third piece”, my plain tees just didn’t cut it anymore, sigh.	labels:Yes! This is my problem. I also had stocked up on tops that need a 3rd piece. But they do not work on their own due to shape, or cut, or something else. I am not really a t-shirt as part of my outfit person, unless it is a graphic tee. And as I got bored of my cardigan, the more wrong these shirts felt.   I feel like I had the most stand alone tops during peplum wave v1.   I realize this puff sleeve moment is the time I need to stock up. The puff sleeve really works for me!	episode_done:False
text:This is what I ended up doing! Basically “elevated” iterations of tshirts with some interesting detail — puff sleeves, peplum, etc. Also fun prints. IMO the brand Madewell does this very well, pretty much all of my “fancier” tops (really just a step up from plain tees) are from there.   Otherwise for boring tshirt days I wear a long necklace.	labels:I don't really shop at Madewell, but maybe I should look more closely.   I feel like t-shirt fit is hard for me, the shapes do not always work very well on me. My challenge is basically all my extra weight shows up below my belly button. I am pear-ish and I have a really short torso/high hips. So some tops that fit perfectly for tucking do not work untucked. And shorter tops need to be actually short, or they just look dumb because they hit in a weird place on my torso. And the shirt that fits my hips and lower waist is not a good fit on top, especially when tucking. So I ended up being super picky about the fit.   At the moment, the tops I am generally happy with are:   * 2 floral button ups * 3 striped shirts  * one cropped sweatshirt (lilac, it is new, but promising) * 2 long sleeve black blouses (but I didn't have the right bottoms, now I am a lot closer! I don't like wearing a fully black outfit so all my black bottoms were a bad fit. Now I have some patterned skirts and an olive one that should work) * 2 short sleeves silk blouses that may be a little too dressy for right now * pink peplum with balloon sleeves (sadly I got it like 2 weeks before quarantine, I envisioned it being super fun with jeans and I hadn't figured out skirts yet, but you know)  What I need are some interesting solid colored short sleeved tops that aren't black, and are in my palette colors, that can work with pants or a skirt.	episode_done:False
text:My body type is essentially a skinny pear haha. Also have a super short torso for my height! I find Madewell’s Rhyme top and Park Popover are really great tucked, French tucked, or untucked. Madewell definitely has a muted color palette overall, so depending on your personal wardrobe that may or may not work. I’ve also had good luck with tops from Splendid. If you’re super short torso’d, you might actually want to try Petite sized tops if you haven’t already, even if you’re not technically “petite” in overall height.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "A Primer on Materials"	labels:Hum it’s definitely an interesting read. I guess nowadays there is more emphasis on ethics and environmental cost when we choose our fabrics, so that would be an interesting add. For example cotton being so much more water hungry than hemp and linen. I was a bit thrown back by the thinsulate entry. Having spent a few years I outdoor retail, I do not really think of it as a textile, more of a insulation, and it’s certainly not the only synthetic insulation or trademark of the sort available.

It’s not really possible to not have any environmental/social impact, but a guide like that could help people make their own choices to balance some of the harms being done. (And it’s independent of brands which may or may not be making things better.

Every time I went there I bought something, it's one of my favorite shops ever.    *  Zürich: There's a nice flea market in Stadthausanlage on weekends.    *  Zürich, Fizzen: part second-hand, part regular shop, it has some nice designs similar to MANIAK in Lausanne. Also in Zürich, Barbar Vintage usually has a large selection of SH jeans and on Bleicherweg there are some more high-end vintage stores near the offices of consulting companies (what a coincidence). * France, Annecy: there is (was? maybe temporarily cancelled because of Covid-19) a quite large monthly flea market on the last Saturday of every month. I went there once especially for this and it was amazing. * Romania, Bucharest: some local boutiques are Ioana Ciolacu (designer items), Ana Urbana (shoes), Gazzelle (shoes and bags), Diana Cojocaru (unique porcelain jewelry, doesn't have a regular store but regularly hosts exhibitions around Bucharest, worth checking her Instagram account), IONA (lovely gold jewelry), Malvensky (also nice gold jewelry), Iutta (handbags and shoes with traditional motives).

I'm white AF and exclusively buy white or rose/pink gold, which to my Indian friends is seen as sacrilege (have to replate things?!?!), but I assume any fine jewelry I buy will at-best be passed down to my children and most likely have its value trend to zero. In my culture if you want to gift a safe investment, you buy bonds or straight up cash.	episode_done:True

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I have similar connotations as you about them being kind of cheap or tacky looking, but would add one other angle to it. While I'm 100% against the use of real fur/exotic hides, I think part of the cheapness animal prints comes from taking something that in its natural state exists on fur and copy-pasting it onto all different kinds of fabrics. Real cheetahs look beautiful and elegant. A poorly rendered cheetah print on thin polyester leggings just looks like a terrible imitation. There isn't this mental comparison going on with other patterns, like stripes or polka dots, because there's no "real" standard to compare to. They're just decorative patterns.  Even if you attempt to create a faux fur that more closely imitates a real animal hide, it's going to look cheap and fake (to me) unless it is really well done.	episode_done:False
text:Very good point that i think i subconsciously thought of, but never put it into words!!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:For the longest time (like 15 years), I hated all animal prints. I found them tacky, loud, cheap...the same connotations you had, basically. They had their moments in fashion now and then, but even when they were in fashion, I never came around to them. I think it may also partly be because someone I know growing up had a LOT of animal print in their wardrobe and house, and I became sick of it at a young age. Hatred of animal print was the one aesthetic feeling that stayed consistently with me for *years.* I was very accepting of most trends, but this is the one I could never bring myself to like – so I eventually shrugged and accepted the fact that I would always despise it.   AND THEN?????????? randomly a year ago, I suddenly found myself really liking leopard print, snakeskin, and croc skin (in small doses; I don't think I'll ever enjoy it on large pieces). They had come back into fashion, but unlike the previous times they'd cycled into fashion, this time I was suddenly feeling them? I really can't pinpoint why. It just happened. Maybe I saw some really cute outfits and ways to style it that I'd never really considered before. But either way, I bought pointy-toed leopard print pumps (with a really stunning dark golden velvet base!), leopard print slip-ons, croc skin slides, snakeskin sandals, and a snakeskin bucket bag. I thought these specific animal prints suddenly looked really cute as accessories!   So now I'm basically a-ok with leopard print, snakeskin, and croc skin. But I still really dislike zebra print for some strange reason. Not sure why this one still irritates me, and who knows, maybe one day I'll come to like this one too! But for now, zebra is a nope. And tiger print is horrendous and cheap to me.	episode_done:True

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I don’t enjoy animal prints on myself, but I think that’s because I don’t enjoy prints in general. I tend toward solid color clothing, and then add interest with texture or hardware over pattern. The only thing I have in my closet that have any type of pattern are shoes, because I make custom sneakers for myself.   If you like leopard then rock it. I think there are a lot less stereotypes embedded with clothing these days, but maybe that’s just the area I live in right now. Especially with the popularity of 90’s trends and thrifting, I think people just like to see creative mixing and new combinations.	episode_done:True
text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I feel like leopard print is a hit or miss and depends on things like the type of fabric, the type of garment or accessory, etc. For example, a satin leopard print midi skirt can look really elegant but a leopard print jumpsuit is more questionable. Fashion and style are subjective at the end of the day but, I will say I love leopard print and dressing it up like a leopard print top with black satin wide leg pants and black pointed toe loafers. You should try on a piece just to test the waters and see if it’s for you. Also, leopard print accessories are a good way to ease into adding prints into your wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:Growing up in a small town and then moving to a bigger one, fast fashion was a whole magical thing to me. After a few years I learned more about how terrible it is and shopped there less, but that's hard to do when you're poor. I discovered thrift shopping and have been addicted to it ever since, although I realize I'm privileged in that I'm easily able to find my size at any thrift shop. Now I'm a little less poor, but still unable to afford local fashion so I keep thrifting. I support local designers when I can by going to their sample/warehouse sales and recommending them to others.   I find the hardest part to be shopping for basics. When I need a plain black tank, I go to Target because I know exactly what I'm getting.	episode_done:True
text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:I’m not a saint - I am great about follow through when there’s also an detriment to me or when I feel “betrayed.” For example, if a brand is marketed as “high quality” and I pay premium (but not luxury/designer) prices and am disappointed by the quality, I am able to follow through on ditching the brand very well because of the financial detriment. Similarly, if a brand is “ethical” or particularly supportive of women and minorities and it turns out to abuse its employees, I feel more betrayed than say if I buy a pair of Nikes.  I do buy some fast fashion and non-ethical fashion but I like “knowing what I’m getting” so to speak. I think it’s the false pretenses and hypocrisy of well marketed but not actually ethical/wuality etc. brands that get to me and cause me to have a lasting bad taste.  To this day though, I buy a new pair of Nikes every year or so for my runs even knowing that they aren’t great ethically because the design, function and price are perfect for me. But I also feel like Nike doesn’t pretend or charge an overboard premium	episode_done:True

text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:One thing I do is remind myself that whatever I want isn't usually one of a kind. This helps me with makeup buying, because I fall in love with colours and buy them and my lipstick collection is out of control. I have to keep reminding myself that whatever beautiful colour I just found out about is either a dupe of something I probably have OR if that colour isn't something I own but the brand is garbage, that other brands will definitely have that colour too.  So for fashion, if you fall in love with a bag from a brand you can't support, just remember that no bag is unique (unless it's like an awesome bag that looks like a giraffe or something). If you love Chanel flaps but refuse to buy from them, there are so many other versions. I have one by Rebecca Minkoff but luxury brands make chain flap purses too without the ickiness of supporting Coco Chanel.  I'm a knitter and weaver, so most knit and woven things I can make myself if I don't like the brand. Same with yarn, if there's a yarn company I don't support, there are millions of other yarn brands out there where I can find something similar enough.  In general, no matter what you're trying to buy, there will be other brands that make something like it. So if you must have it, you don't have to buy from the brand you hate.	episode_done:True

Some people may still not want to even wear certain brands.... BUT it's a tiny bit like wearing fur. A great deal of people refuse to wear fur made recently but will allow exception to vintage items. If you can't live with out a certain label, maybe buying it second hand will lesson personal conflict created when buying new.

text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:Something I haven't seen mentioned here is clothing swaps. My friends and I are in the habit of having them at least a few times a year, and everyone walks out happy. If your friends don't do this, offer to host! We even had a Halloween costume version where we all traded outfits we no longer wanted.   Today I found success on Etsy. I was looking for tops that were ethically made, vegan, not culturally appropriative, affordable, and from a Black-owned business. I found lots of incredibly expensive brands on Google, but on Etsy I found smaller artists. So no slavery concerns (most likely), and it meets all my requirements. It only scratches the surface, but it's a place to start. It's about being intentional within the constraints.  I'm fortunate to be able to afford more expensive pieces, but wow is it hard to even know where to go. I don't shop a lot, so I really struggle with vintage and second-hand stores that only show clothing on mannequins. Before the pandemic, I never shopped online, but I also hated shopping in person because I struggled to find stores that had things I liked. It's so much easier to go into Urban or H&M or Loft. And we think of places like H&M and Forever 21 as the pinnacles of fast fashion, but I assume the worst of basically any major brand. Victoria's Secret, Gap, even luxury brands like Gucci or Prada, I assume they cut as many corners as possible.   Trying to find clothes within all my constraints helped me discover some amazing pieces that I am so excited to buy. They're incredible statement pieces that I never would have found without being more intentional in my purchases.	episode_done:True
text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:I've completely stopped buying from Amazon and actually feel ill when I see anyone buying from them - which is everyone I know except my husband. Even people who are verbal about how shitty of a company it is still can't resist the "convenience." I think it takes practice. The longer you abstain from certain things, the less you want to go back.   I've also been a lot more conscious of the companies I buy my clothes from. If it seems too good to be true (i.e. cheap,) then it probably is. A beautiful top listed for $10 might seem like a deal, but you have to really think about why that garment is so cheap in the first place. I've gotten to the point where I can push past being seduced by a low price and look into the company itself. I read about their business practices, and if they seem fishy, I don't buy.  I'd rather thrift my clothes and feel more confident that I'm not buying in to fast-fashion. I'd be content wearing the same clothes forever and just reworking them through the years with my own hands, as opposed to buying from a company that treats people and our environment badly.	episode_done:True

I'd also like to point out the person in your example picture is wearing 2 dresses, one sheer one on top of a floral one.  I don't think I would describe that outfit as "restrained" as much as "unique pieces but overall subscribes to the formula of a very normal outfit" in the sense that a dress with socks, a bag, and loafers isn't weird.

text:Formula for a put together outfit that works for most aesthetics	labels:I don't use this sort of rule, but to plays into my choices indirectly. For example, I am semi-maximalist. I like pattern and color. So I keep my jewelry simpler - I rarely use colored jewelry. I prefer the statement from the jewelry to come with size or shape, and just stick to metal only. Same for shoes they are generally one color, something neutral. They can have details with a little bit of texture, but I can't do a multi colored show with embellishments. It would be too much with one of my patterned items.

text:Formula for a put together outfit that works for most aesthetics	labels:I think this strongly depends on your natural features. E.g. I have an hourglass figure with noticeable boobs, so if I'm wearing something fitting it's already like 4 points, lol, even if it's a simple black dress. If I'd put 7 more "points" worth of accessorizes and stuff that would turn me into overly feminine very much in your face type of appearance. So I usually have my outfit - fairly simple but fitting, some makeup on the face, and everything else is a bit toned down, e.g. simple jewellery, maybe a pendant or earrings, simple hairdo, etc. If I had less prominent features, the "blank slate" model look I feel I could push further with adding scarves, bags, more jewellery, etc. But being curvy even red lips become kind of a provocation.	episode_done:True

text:What does your shoe wardrobe look like? What are your shoe essentials?	labels:I’m definitely a shoe hoarder. I’ve got over 30 pairs that cover a wide variety of styles - boots (tall or short), heels (from work-practical to 6+” party shoes), flats, sandals, running shoes, etc. I’m also 5’2” so if something is cute and has a heel, I’ll buy it.  My essentials probably boil down to a pair of black lace-up ankle boots, at least one pair of neutral, sensible heels for work, and a pair of casual flat sneakers that I can dress up or down. These are the items that I default to when I’m not feeling brave about shoes, and the items I always replace when they wear out.  I tend to buy cheaper shoes because I like having that kind of variety. I have a couple of pairs of more expensive shoes that are significantly better quality for when I want to hold on to them for a while. I find it’s a lot easier for me to be adventurous with shoes than with the rest of my wardrobe, and I’m less likely to feel self-conscious if I try something new. This post does remind me though that I need to clean out my closet...	episode_done:True

text:There is no unmarked woman	labels:Thanks for posting this, it’s given me some gender presentation things to think about.   Like, I am a trans man on r/femalefashionadvice and not on r/malefashionadvice specifically because I prefer “marked” fashion choices. The mfa subreddit is all so safe and subtle. Fashion from that approach seems to be more about price and posturing than the sort of things that interest me—cut, color, silhouette, textures, prints, all these aesthetic considerations are largely absent from male fashion.  I agree with u/sunmoonnife that class definitely plays a role here, and with OP that queer identity definitely changes one’s ability to go unmarked and adds some nuance on how marked clothing will be interpreted.	episode_done:True
text:There is no unmarked woman	labels:I was an anthropology major and seeing good quality anth shared here had me taken aback! This read like a Margaret Atwood book, I really agree with and think about this sentiment a lot. The idea that every decision a woman or someone who appears feminine on the gender binary makes, in this case outwardly with appearance, is scrutinized and considered daily. I just started a grad program and when looking at the girls I thought “preppy and rich, alternative, athletic” but for the guys it’s just “they dress like boys”. It feels inescapable.	episode_done:True
text:There is no unmarked woman	labels:I'm not convinced that the generic male appearance is unmarked. I see it as a conscious decision to project an image of conformity. It's saying "I'm a committed company man. I'm not going to cause any trouble, I'll do whatever you ask with no complaint". This message is generally not aimed at women (usually at their male superiors), so perhaps we don't pay much attention to it.	episode_done:True
text:There is no unmarked woman	labels:I hadn’t seen this before, though I read her book on men and women and language.  To be fair, people didn’t reflect on the gender binary back in 1993 when this was written. It didn’t come up in the LBGTQ community until the late 90’s and didn’t become a popular concept until fairly recently. Back then Tannen was considered sort of progressive.	episode_done:True
text:There is no unmarked woman	labels:I think in my personal experience as  fat woman working in an image heavy career path (entertainment) everything is so stacked against me in terms of job opportunities that I automatically try and appear marked in a positive way. As I am very much an  'other' at work and stick out like a sore thumb anyway, i tend to peacock. I love bright coloured suits and dresses, purposeful makeup (as in, bright eyeshadow or lipstick) and I tend to over match in what is arguably an unfashionable way, according to FFA. It makes me feel good, and I think you can get away with more daring choices in hot climates. I am also very influenced by my recently passed grandma, who had an incredible amount of clothes and always looked impeccable- and very matchy like me!  However, since corona has struck and i've had my livelihood dwindle to nothing....I have take a pedestrian job for a year. The day I purchased my bland 'work wardrobe' of elasticated trousers and black jumpers I felt incredibly sad. I understand that I have a new role now but I just feel unattractive and basic in all the wrong ways.	episode_done:True

text:There is no unmarked woman	labels:A phenomenal read. I guess, for me, I try to have fun and manipulate my "markedness" by having a closet of radically different aesthetics. I never wish to be pigeon holed and one way I can help avoid such seems to never be notable in the same way - some days I have fashion forward eccenteic wear, other days it business formal with expensive jewelry, other days its "thot" fashion with big hoops and short shirts. There's power in not being predictable and if Im going to be judged regardless, I want to make it hard for them.	episode_done:True

Especially if they're the instagram baddie type and you like actually have to go to work and can't just wear bralettes as tops every day (this is usually my issue)  I would like to see a lot more size 6-8-10 people modeling clothes in general. Or see the target market of a brand modeling those clothes. If a brand skews older, show older people, not just skinny 40 y/os with dyed hair and barely any fine lines (looking at you L.L. Bean/Lands End)  On their website, places like Madewell usually have a 'standard size' (usually below size 4) model and a 'plus size' model (like size 14/16). It should be helpful to have the range of images but it kind of falls flat for me being right in the middle. It'd be nice to see even just a size 6/8 as a more 'standard size. '	episode_done:True

text:Maybe because my feed is a lot of plus size/fat bodies, but I find this type of thinking terribly depressing. I won't pretend that terms like "effortless" are meant for us, but it also can feel even more exclusionary in a way when I see other fat people being like "never will I be considered to look this good!! no matter the effort I put in!!!".	labels:I think the point is just that the idea of "effortless" is completely void and that's best demonstrated through the fact that it crumbles completely when applied to a fat body. It's not the body, it's the concept.  Because it's not *actually* about the clothes, or about the attitude, or about any of that. It's literally just the thin, desirable body.  You can put sweatpants on it and call it "athleisure", you can wrap it in clingfilm and call it "sexy", or you can drape a burlap sack on it and call it "high fashion", but that's just people projecting bullshit concepts on a desirable body.   None of these things seem to exist or stand on their own, *unless* they're on a thin, conventionally "hot" body. When sweatpants are on Kendall, it's "athleisure". When they're on my lumpy thighs, they're just sloppy. When Glossier "makeup" is on a 17 year old model is cool and "effortless", when it's on an uggo, it's just...uggo.   It's not at all about the plus size bodies being somehow less than. Plus size bodies are not the problem. These meaningless concepts are the problem and it's in no way a negative reflection on the bodies, when the concept disintegrates on them.	episode_done:True

text:How do ya'll express your culture or traditional fashion in modern clothing?	labels:I’m Vietnamese, and I’ve only recently been interested in my cultural clothing because of - well, internalized racism, which wasn’t great, LOL. But what I’ve done is save up for custom áo dài!  Traditionally, áo dài is pretty eye-catching, especially in the U.S. (where I live). I’m saving up to create tailor-made áo dài that’s more modern and something understated I could wear often: for example, switching out white silk pants for black ones, and the main dress for a crushed navy velvet. I find that modernizing cultural clothing can be a way to represent your cultural and ethnic roots without feeling strange or like an impostor, and seeing the same, familiar cuts in different prints and tones that I like fills me with a whole new type of joy.  I also follow other people who wear modernized cultural clothing. The first example that comes to mind is @asunnydisposish on Twitter, who is an artist but often posts pictures of her putfits (modernized hanbok). I have an album of Vietnamese clothing outside of áo dài (like áo nhật bình) and other designers’ takes on modern áo dài, and another album of textures, prints, and fabrics I would kill to wear.   Other ways you can incorporate this into your clothing is supporting artists and designers from whatever ethnic group/culture you belong to!  If anyone’s interested in seeing the albums, I’m more than willing to share; I just don’t know how to operate imgur yet, which seems to be the go-to for everyone here. I hope this helped! Best of luck!	episode_done:False

Works every time.  But actually, have they reacted to what you wear? Like, do they make comments, positive or negative, on what you wear?	episode_done:True
text:Feeling self-conscious with changing style around family - anyone relate? Tips?	labels:I tend to favor the approach that action minimizes self consciousness, not that minimizing self consciousness first will make you comfortable enough to do the action. You might catch yourself setting certain outfits aside, and those are key moments to train yourself to look out for. When you find yourself doing it, make a choice. Some days you may simply wish to be comfortable, no shame. But it may also be important to recognize it makes you feel uncomfortable for now, and then do it anyway. Chances are by noon you will not feel half as self conscious!	episode_done:True
text:Feeling self-conscious with changing style around family - anyone relate? Tips?	labels: I way overdress for my family and have been for a few years. Lately they have started upping their own style for things like holidays and family hangouts which is kind of sweet. My dad once saw what I was going to wear to a restaurant with him went "SHIT" and put on a whole new outfit with nice shoes and a suprisingly hip button-down.  You may face some comments, but eventually they'll just get used to it and may even start putting more effort in themselves!	episode_done:False

text:Feeling self-conscious with changing style around family - anyone relate? Tips?	labels:I'm exactly your age, and facing the exact same situation lol. My mom always makes comments on my clothes at home - both good and bad. It makes me insanely self-conscious, but one of the things that helps the most is compromising with myself. Like if I want to wear a pair of pants that I'm not sure how my family will think of, I'll try to pair it with a shirt that I know I won't feel self-conscious in and that my family/friends won't think is too out there. Call it a variation on the whole little shirt/big pants formula - unknown shirt/known pants, or known shirt/unknown pants. I know this isn't a perfect solution but it really helped me ease into things back home. Eventually, all your clothes will be known quantities and you'll be able to start dressing how you like almost all the time. :)	episode_done:True
text:Feeling self-conscious with changing style around family - anyone relate? Tips?	labels:I eventually transitioned from wearing men's band shirts every single day (seriously I had like 30) to feminine clothing (age 17-19). Generally, I didn't even bother bringing it up to my family and they never commented on it. That said, I still felt totally embarrassed going from tom boy to standard women's clothing.  I'd say if they aren't commenting on it, just do you. If they start acting weird, try opening up a dialogue with them as to why they're having a reaction to your clothing. But it's very normal for people to change styles, especially at your age. Even if they do care, just dress in whatever makes you happy and they'll likely drop it. You'll feel uncomfortable but it's easier over time.	episode_done:True
text:Feeling self-conscious with changing style around family - anyone relate? Tips?	labels:My family always comments on what I wear if it’s not super casual. My dad will comment if it’s revealing and my mom will comment if it’s fancier than the occasion calls for. And usually this will be done with a sarcastic question like “where are you going?” or similar when obviously I am not going anywhere because we are quarantined, and heaven forbid I decide to put on a nice outfit to boost my mood. I’m lucky that my family is at least a real-pants-in-quarantine family. If I couldn’t even wear jeans without getting a comment, I’d be sad.	episode_done:True
text:Feeling self-conscious with changing style around family - anyone relate? Tips?	labels:After a few times seeing you with your new style your family will get used to it.

But once you get past the first few initial comments it'll become the norm for them.	episode_done:True
text:Feeling self-conscious with changing style around family - anyone relate? Tips?	labels:This was me around your age (or about 15-21).  My parents (and all of my relatives) expected me to dress super preppy (like a walking J. Crew catalog-- those were a thing then).  I was secretly alternative and was more about band tees and late 90s era Hot Topic stuff.  But I had very few Hot Topic type things because of my parents.   I remember putting black lipstick on as soon as I got to school and taking it off before I went home.  I hid the lipstick in my locker.    They still give me a hard time about how I dress and I simply reply with "I'm not you.  If you want to see your perfect child, go see \[sister's name\]" (my sister is a clone of my mom in almost every way, shape, and form).	episode_done:True

text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism? I love it, but how do you do it?	labels:Based on that album, I guess I am maximal about half of the time! :D  I think the easiest thing to do is to start small.  If you wear a lot of solids and neutrals - dip your toe in with a great coat. A coat in a fun color, maybe even a patterned coat. Wear that daily.  If you don't want to commit to a coat, get one "loud" patterned item. The easiest way to pair it is to pull out one of the colors in the pattern and that is what you wear it with. Instead of using the neutral, use one of the accent colors.  And number 3 is color blocking. That one is super easy. You just pick two solids, but skip the neutrals. Tone on tone is fun, as well as things that are near opposites on the color wheel.  I have yet to master pattern mixing, that is one of my goals.	episode_done:True
text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism? I love it, but how do you do it?	labels:I wouldn't call myself a maximalist, but style theory is similar to any other artistic theory. When choosing how to combine pieces, always take into account the color, lines, patterns, and textures. From here, the aesthetic is completely up to the individual. For example, a maximalist may work within a certain color pallette and then intentionally incorporate a clashing accent. Pattern mixing might seem random, but the person may have taken into account the contrast between sharp lines and abstract patters. So I guess my answer is somewhere in the middle. It always takes A LOT of effort to make something look effortless. However once there are certain boundaries, it can feel effortless to put colors, patterns, and silhouettes together that make sense to the individual and are theoretically pleasing to the eye.	episode_done:False
text:It’s very similar to the MCM movement and the rams study homes in that sense. You don’t expect it, but it works.   I dress a lot like the photos OP provided and I don’t find most of them especially eccentric?	labels:I agree, the photos are pretty tame. I can see where for the average person pairing that many different colors together and including big statement pieces could be intimidating, but generally the color palettes are straight forward. Pattern including pink, yellow, and orange on the dress, orange coat, pink shoes, etc. I think it's just using more colors where some would choose a neutral. And pairing a very dramatic silhouette with more subdued pieces.	episode_done:True
text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism?

text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism? I love it, but how do you do it?	labels:I think I'm in between here. Not minimalist, but not maximalist. The one maximalist thing I'll do is with either accessories (scarf and jewelry and a hat and funky boots) or one bright/bold piece like a colorful jacket. Like, I have a mustard, navy and pink paisley jacket that I'll wear with jeans and a navy top, but I don't really have the stones to wear pink shoes and a green hat *also*.  Maybe try this on a smaller scale instead of attempting a full-on look?	episode_done:True
text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism? I love it, but how do you do it?	labels:I'm a maximalist with a lower case m. I love prints, colors, textures, and patterns! I don't push the envelope as much compared to these photographs. Maybe one day? These are gold medal swimmers, I'm still at the doggie paddle stage. But I also love having a lot of options, I'm the exact opposite of a capsule wardrobe.	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:What made a HUGE difference for me was slowly starting to separate what I thought was cute and trendy, and what was actually realistic for me. Like a lot of others I started with lots of pinterest browsing. I made two separate boards, one for a "capsule" wardrobe and one for a "wow thats cute". The capsule is in a color pallet that I like and fits my lifestyle (darks,neutrals, a few colors that look good on me and I'm comfortable wearing), where as the other cute board is just things I enjoy on others. There's TONS of styles out there that I adore, and might one day adopt parts of, but just because I aesthetically love and appreciate it doesn't mean it'll work for me and my lifestyle. For example, I love the super feminine, flowy light vibe. Its beautiful, looks amazing on other people, but on me it feels out of place and isn't a very good fit for me specifically. This goes on the cute board! I know I love it and can identify that now, while still realizing that its just not for me right now.   Visually splitting up /why/ I liked a look or outfit really helped me better understand what I was looking for in my own wardrobe. Maybe that could be a good starting place for you too!	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:I actually find most people are in the same boat as you, so I wouldn't worry too much.  It does take a lot of time and effort and money to keep up with fashion.  It helps to think of it as a hobby; and people who are really put together generally go about it with the zeal of, say, a stamp collector and stamps.  Just like how some people are basketball enthusiasts and others are gardening enthusiasts, there's really no reason you have to be into fashion.  I find that there's this really pervasive expectation that women all ought to naturally love clothes and fashion; and any failure to invest in that interest is a failure in some biological sensibility.     If you find yourself struggling, then I really do recommend getting a stylist or tailor or ideally both.  The stylist will push you to try things outside your comfort, the tailor will help you with fit issues, and having both can really be transformative in a very quick and immediate way.  But in terms of continuing your education or interest--that really depends on whether you want to make this a bit of a hobby.  It does take time and effort and money, after all.  And if you don't naturally find yourself interested; well, there's no sense in forcing yourself just in the name of "fitting in" to some perceived societal norm.       I assure you, from Paris to Shanghai, there are plenty of women who would rather learn the nuances of cement than spend any time pondering the fit of a pair of trousers; and there's nothing wrong with that.	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:Hmm....I think when it comes to feeling like you don’t fit in fashion wise, it’s helpful to realize people aren’t as aware of the details and flaws as you are, and most people probably think you look fine, or more normal than you would think. Besides that, experimenting with different cuts of clothing can be really helpful in getting started. For example, if you’ve been mostly wearing skinny jeans, you can try some more straight legged jeans with rolled cuffs and see how that looks. If you mostly wear tshirts, try tshirts in different cuts, or look for an outfit with a T-shirt on Tiktok or instagram, look for the details you like, then look for a T-shirt with similar details. Getting into fashion and finding a style involves experimenting, and starting with small changes with basics you’re already comfortable in might help with making fashion feel more natural.	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:Echoing some other comments: only follow instagram accounts that inspire you and make you feel good. Let go of the social media comparison game. Follow accounts from people of all different shapes, sizes, and ethnicities while you're at it.  I am not a fashion icon, but my one piece of advice to avoid being overwhelmed is to focus on one single clothing item or accessory you'd like to improve, and pair it with easy basics. For example, I wanted to improve my sneaker game a few years ago. I bought (over time) a few pairs of sneakers I LOVED and paired them with my basic black tee shirts/jeans. It was so much easier to focus on wearing cool and fun sneakers without feeling like I needed to overhaul my entire closet. Another example: I figured out how to do my hair one particular style that I really like. No matter what outfit I'm in, my hair makes me feel cute when I style it that way.   You don't have to do all the fashion at one time. Everyday fashion is not a contest, I promise. You have your whole life to learn what you like and lean into your personal style.	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:This is probably an unpopular opinion here since a lot of the ffa users think fashion is a manual that you have to study, but if you don't like colours? Don't wear em. Don't like jewelry or makeup? Don't wear em. It's just body covers- do what makes you feel good. Not everyone was made to be a timeless, effortless fashionista. We don't all need to look like an off duty Instagram influencer and shouldn't have to dress a certain way because someone on the Internet said it was 'right.	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:I feel that a lot of how to be fashion forward comes down to confidence and fit. You should never feel pressured into wear something you feel uncomfortable in. Sometimes having well-fitted T-shirt and jeans can make you look put together.  With colour, I find that you have to find the right colour that suits your skin tone. And tat involves a lot of trying on different colours at the shops. I used to hate wearing colour until I found the right shade of warm fuschia that really made my skin glow. Since then I've tried on loads of different colours and find that loud warm colours tend to suit my skin tone. I usually wear the bright colours on the tops and wear neutral bottoms (black, navy, grey etc.) so I don't have to think about matching colours.	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:Often all it takes to look put together is a good shoe. My daughter in her mid twenties spends very little time or money on clothes. She likes to wear whatever falls into her life (mostly friend’s castoffs); but she wears them with a nice pair of oxfords and a fun and eye-catching pair of socks and she looks great.	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:I promise, the effortless look takes SO MUCH effort.  I hear you though. Sometimes I feel myself getting stuck and I go through periods where I suddenly hate everything in my closet. I don’t think I ever established an actual style for myself. My tastes are so eclectic! Sometimes I like preppier, menswear-type pieces. Other times I’m into the ultra-feminine, curvy femme fatale schtick, sometimes I’m more boho/folksy, other times I’m a bit vintage/classic, and then sometimes modern and edgy. I can’t decide which style is mine!	episode_done:False

text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:I think there are some great posts on here, just wanted to add, if you're just starting to build a wardrobe that feels "you" dont feel like you have to go out and buy it all at once.  Same goes with jewelry. Rather than trying to find a bunch of pieces you kind of like, find one or two pieces you love and make them signature, featured pieces in your wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:That's how I interpreted the question as well.  The "third piece" rule pretty much would have you to put a third piece on top, and in winter, that third piece is a coat, and once you are inside you don't wear the coat anymore.  For me, I typically have an indoor third piece waiting for me, ie a neutral color cardigan at my desk, so when I take off my kickass outerwear I can still complete the look with a third piece for indoors.  If that's not possible for whatever reason I'll wear the indoor third piece under the outdoor third piece because if it's cold enough to wear the winder coat, a thin cardigan isn't going to seriously mess up the temperature calculus.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Yeah that's what I took out of this as well.  A lot of those inspo posts on Pinterest are Pepe at fashion weeks and they're notoriously under or overdressed for the weather because they want to have the look. I have so many saved of cold NY fashion weeks and people in mini dresses and open toed shoes. AFAIK they're just running from their car to the paps and then inside again or suffering through it otherwise.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Indoor layers	labels:I think what your serious outerwear is going to be depends on where you live. I live somewhere where the cute wool coats you may see in winter NYC or winter London are not practical. People where I live wear huge down feather coats in the winter, and we are definitely not wearing these coats inside. By extension, autumn is pretty brutal and people may break out their heavy jackets that are double-lined, but again, we’re not wearing these indoors. Since my area is super frigid, we’re not looking at outerwear trends to be cute. People who move here realize that they need multiple coats and jackets, and it’s to be practical and cover the variety of weather changes more than anything.  If I moved somewhere warmer, and didn’t need outerwear for the practicality reason, I would say that I actually love blazers and think they’re fine indoors (because you see blazers in corporate suiting, which is worn indoors). Your mileage may vary though, cause if somebody is wearing trenchcoats and leather jackets indoors, I would question if that individual is looking to leave the building.	episode_done:True
text:Indoor layers	labels:To be honest, I think this depends on your day to day activities. For me I work out of an office, my car, and since February, my house. If I am on an in the office day I wear something I don't mind leaving over my chair. It's trickier when I have appointments in other offices, and so on. If I'm only walking a short distance I leave my outer layers in the trunk of my car and tough it out.   I am in a northern (Canadian) climate for the record.	episode_done:True
text:Indoor layers	labels:I have these thoughts almost every Fall. My inspiration Pinterest boards are filled with photos typically taken outside with individuals wearing amazing outerwear. Last year, I bought a camel coat (faux wool, because I couldn’t invest until I knew if I REALLY liked the look). I loved the look with the coat and I was so sad and torn to remove once indoors. So I guess that’s the TL;DR, I remove my outerwear indoors. Unless I’m quickly stopping in somewhere. But it was always a bummer to do because I love the look.  Aside from outerwear, I try to achieve other interesting layers in the form of either mid length structured cardigans, chunky scarves, slightly oversized tunics with tight sleeves (Free People-Esque), and/or bomber jackets that I’m comfortable leaving on indoors.	episode_done:True
text:Indoor layers	labels:This was so weird to me when I moved to somewhere cold also because I hated being noisy with the inner layer of puffers/vests and it was so hot in some rooms and frigid in others! I only wore my giant wool turtlenecks on the west coast where people don’t turn on the heat that much vs having to wear tshirts underneath the giant parka cuz the heater would be oppressive on the East. Sorry I don’t think I helped but I understand your confusion!	episode_done:True
text:Indoor layers	labels:I think it depends on the garment. Winter coats get taken off always, but light, blazer-esque layers and denim jackets transition indoors just fine. I think my rough heuristic is whether I’d wear the jacket fully zipped/buttoned for warmth. If yes, it comes off inside.	episode_done:True

What bs that was, I can see it now. So yeah, thank you Docs for giving me that push for discovering and acknowledging my own self-worth.	episode_done:True
text:How do you challenge yourself?	labels:Not exactly what you're looking for but I've challenged myself to only buy thrifted, vintage, secondhand or bartered since the start of 2020. I've allowed myself to buy new if I cannot find the item on any of those sources.   This means I have to try really hard to make out of style items look in style haha. I'm lucky to live in a large city though, and there is a bartering app that is really widely used here.	episode_done:True
text:How do you challenge yourself?	labels:My fashion challenge for myself is to go the extra mile. I go to high school and most people wear leggings, sweats, and jeans and t shirts. I used to do that too, but my challenge is to add something unique to every outfit, think about my silhouettes and palettes, and maybe dress up a little bit. I’m also really into wider leg pants and denim jackets, so I plan to wear more of those	episode_done:True
text:How do you challenge yourself?	labels:About 90% of my closet is vintage, with wild prints. I've been trying to get myself out of all the tee shirt and jeans outfits and getting myself into at least one vintage piece a day.	episode_done:True
text:How do you challenge yourself?	labels:I branch out when I watch a new TV show and I really like the main character's style. I will buy one or two things that are really 'them'.  But then I always end up not feeling like myself. So I'll either immediately return those things, or I'll wear them a lot for three months and suddenly snap out of it one morning, like, 'what was I thinking?' and push them to the back of my closet.  So now, when I have that itch, I just add everything to my shopping cart and then close the tab and go to bed.	episode_done:True
text:How do you challenge yourself?	labels:Whenever I challenge myself to wear something different it usually ends up not being worn. Some may call my style stagnant but I do upgrade my classics so that they don't look dated.  I'm one of those crazies that loves fashion yet prefers to stay invisible in her preppy, black/navy/grey/white uniform.	episode_done:True
text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:The people in the comments on this thread are kind of... The OP is asking how looking at a garnment in a website, how you can gauge if it has quality.  The majority of websites don't list anything other than fabric composition and have a page on the company's ethics, which is likely filled with lies (EVERLANE, which many "ethics' conscious people were duped with bought)). Also, expecting the majority of people to research on said ethics, when most don't even read that ethics' page is being out of touch with reality.  This person is making an effort than the majority of people don't do. To which some respond with condescending remarks?	episode_done:True
text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:It's pretty hard to discern quality online, which is why I generally avoid online shopping for clothes. But I know that's not helpful advice, especially right now, lol. When I do buy clothes online, I make it a point to look at the reviews. If they're allowed to post photos, you get a better idea of what the item really looks like. Keep an eye out for common issues, are there multiple reviews complaining about the fabric being sheer, or the stitching being flimsy?	episode_done:True
text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:I will pay more for 100% cotton, linen, wool, cashmere and silk.  I will not pay more for anything else in 100% material including denim (uncomfortable), modal, tencel etc. I pay less for mixes, especially if it’s natural mixed with artificial, that seems to lead to pilling.  As for quality, the best way to tell is to literally feel it. It’s hard to describe but if you go to the most expensive (especially men’s clothes and minimalism/ethical focused) boutiques you can find and feel their fabrics, you will develop a touch for it. The material is almost always denser, heavier, and thicker than you are used to. That’s not to say $$$$ equals quality - but IMO it’s the best way to “learn by feel” is to find a large concentration of it. Quality is sometimes super affordable but relatively rare - for example, Hanes “ultra weight” t-shirts are some of the best quality 100% cotton tees you can buy and is very cheap (but also no design/super basic).  When I go into a new store - I don’t even pull out items on “sight”, I pull them out by feel, remember the brands that feel good and then see what else they have.  For online shopping, I stick to the same brands over and over. My favorite t-shirts, tanks and other simple tops for example are from Hanes, Wol Hide, Le Bon Shoppe, The Great, Tela9, Lilla P, and Sunspel. How do I know? I’ve felt them in person, bought them, worn and washed them, and when I need a new item, I go there first.	episode_done:True
text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:I'm of the belief that 90% of the time vintage is better quality than anything produced after 1980s.	episode_done:True
text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:See if the people will send you higher quality pictures before they send it off.  Some things that are really impacted by quality are: Shoe glue/soles, leather, coat lining, anything with wool or raw/natural fibers, hardware like zippers, detailing, straps.  Construction/craftsmanship is king/queen, bad/lack of stitching, thin liners, stiff scratchy wool, etc will make or break something. Look for brands or websites that give you macro shots of the stitching, seams, material, that way you can make an informed decision.  Many sellers will be willing to send you pictures if they think it will net them a sale.	episode_done:True
text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:I like looking at the Shein adds on my FB, but when I look at the price I can't help but be suspicious of the quality.  Seems too good to be true.	episode_done:True
text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:Linen, silk, hemp, organic cotton, wool, cashmere. Natural is always better, generally speaking (excluding rayon/bamboo which is a natural derived synthetic, but including tencell which is eucalyptus.) And construction matters too, as does fabric weave. It’s so hard to judge quality online! I usually judge by touch and fabric hand and stitching quality. I have a degree in fashion design though so touch is the easiest way for me to identify a fabric! Personally I avoid nylon or polyester and consider it cheap. It is rarely high quality unless it is a high performance weave or treated, and even then it gets stinky easily. I only wear it for technical outdoor gear, like for hiking or swimming, for everyday wear, natural is always worth paying more!	episode_done:True

It’s also a good idea to know your measurements in general if you’re buying secondhand as many sellers will list the measurements of the garment.  But overall sizing can be so wild within one brand, much less across multiple that I dint think there’s much of a rule of thumb.	episode_done:False

I have a very rectangular body, bog shoulders and chest and am 5’9” and get most of my clothing from them. As others have said, great return policy but the videos of the models wearing the clothes is the best bit. You see them move and how long they are. And you can tell if they look cheap or like they wouldn’t fit your bust/back etc. I love dressing all my friends and if you would ever like some clothing advice feel free to message me.

text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:You gotta take your measurements. Sizing can change even within a brand. However, if you have your measurements to compare nothing will w r be a surprise. Since I started comparing my measurements to listed I’ve hardly returned anything I’ve bought online.	episode_done:True
text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Great advice so far, another thing to take into consideration is fabric type. For example pants in a cotton and spandex blend are going to be more forgiving, fit-wise, than 100% cotton. So for example I could wear skinny jeans in size 30 if they had spandex/elastene in the fabric, where the same brand and size in 100% cotton denim might not get past my hips.	episode_done:True
text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Rectangular body shape checking in. I love Old Navy. So many other brands seem to make clothes for hourglass figures, but ON fits my straighter figure.	episode_done:True
text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Try brands or items with softer silhouettes like Eileen Fisher, drapey dresses, tunics as you ease into what your size is, and how fitted or loose you like your clothes. Welcome sis!	episode_done:True
text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Poshmark might work well for you once you find your ideal clothing measurements. Good sellers will either list measurements in the listing, or will gladly measure the clothing for you if you ask. This is awesome because you are getting the measurements of the EXACT item of clothing.   If you find a piece of clothing that fits well, you can use that as a baseline measurement for similar styles. For example, if I have some dresses that are a perfect length, or shorts that fit perfect in the hips, etc, I’ll search for similar brands or shapes and try to match the size and measurements of the item I have at home.	episode_done:True

Consider that most men’s pants fall midrise, they do not have high or low rise the way we do so I would size the waist based on the dimensions of your women’s midrise pants.  Men also have alot more inseam options than we do. Also check out brands popular in Asia - for example, Muji, even Espirit. My husband consistently has to size up a lot so they will be smaller	episode_done:True
text:Men’s clothing	labels:For men’s pants I generally add 2-3 inches to my women’s pants “waist size”. I normally wear a 27 in women’s jeans, and a 29 or 30 in men’s pants.

Measure your waist *on your hipbones* for pants, I have a 26" waist I think and I usually go for 28" or 29" waist pants. Occasionally 30" will fit with a belt. Old man slacks have fun silhouettes, I recently found a pair of khaki grandpa shorts that I love. Also large, cropped, thick fabric T-shirts hold their structure on my frame pretty well and I french tuck a lot of of my shirts. Oversized corduroy shirts, workwear, flannels, fisherman's sweaters....the thrift store is where I get most of my stuff.	episode_done:True
text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:There are a few brands that do this (Vince and Theory are the ones I've encountered...). Back when I worked in a more formal industry I was shopping for a Theory suit. At Nordstrom Rack the suit was unlined and a wool/poly blend. At Nordstrom the suit was wool with a poly half-lining. And at the Theory flagship in NYC the suit was pure wool with some natural or cellulose full lining (it's been a few years... but it definitely wasn't poly). This was ostensibly the same suit - similar silhouette and the same name, just a few numbers on the product ID differed. And of course the fit when I tried them on was noticeably different, from the Rack one being like a very cheap imitation, the Nordstrom one being pretty good, and the flagship one fitting like a glove.   Similarly, I recently bought some AllSaints moto boots from 6pm fully expecting them to be a diluted version. Instead they were the same cow leather lined with goat leather I tried in store. Considering how these things usually go, a happy surprise (no way in hell are they worth the $450 at full price). Side note: 6pm secretly lists most of their stock on Amazon with Prime fulfillment, which is great because their return policy sucks.	episode_done:False
text:I’ve definitely learned to check material content on the designer/non-house brands.

text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:I realized this during black friday sales a few years ago.  I think all retailers do it.

I'm done with big sales.	episode_done:False

text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:I've experienced this in the past, but am wildly happy with the quality of both the items I purchased this year (a Patagonia jacket and a Kut from the Kloth suede jacket). Both had extra details like lining, extra pockets, etc that I didn't realize when I ordered.	episode_done:True
text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:Zella is a one of Nordstrom’s private label brands that they develop themselves; the Live in Legging (which I’m guessing is the legging you know and love) is a replenishment item that they continually carry inventory of year round and increase their purchasing quantities to support the increase in demand going into the NSale, meaning that you’ll find a mix of inventory that was in their network before the sale started and inventory that flowed in to support the sale. Usually with replenishment items you’re not likely to see a shift in quality or production since the sale is a long planned for event and margin is built in across the year to support the promotion during the sale. Special items that are just purchased for the sale, or for any off price retailer, then yes - absolutely, you’re likely to be getting a lower quality product since buyers and vendors have margin targets they still need to protect so they need to make compromises somewhere when they’re planning to sell the bulk of the units at a discount.	episode_done:True
text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:I make clothing and sell it. Lead time on some fabric I wanted is 5 months because factories in China closed down and are behind and are now staffing with fewer employees. 3 months to produce and 2 months on a boat.  They may just be using different fabrics because of that. I will prob need to substitute.	episode_done:True

text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:It helps to look if the item is on sale anywhere else/if any other retailer is price matching. It’s less likely to be “made for the Nordstrom anniversary sale specifically” if you can find it elsewhere! Can’t speak for clothing per se, but I’ve noticed for example that their Uppababy Vista “deal” is also on the manufacturer’s website and at pretty much every authorized retailer.	episode_done:True

I have a lot of art and vintage stuff I love to death, but when it comes down to it I can't take it.  I am one of four people who would have to go in the same car, so I can't take too much. Here's my inventory. Nothing for work because if I have to leave my house my work is closed down too.   Clothing: seven pairs of socks, seven pairs of underpants, a comfy bra, a set of pj's (flannel shorts and nostalgic t-shirt), a cute comfy sweater, a pair of jeans, a pair of Adidas superstar shoes, a pair of bamboo leggings with pockets, two tank tops, 2 t-shirts, a flannel button up, and a rain jacket  Self care: inhaler, Advil, toothbrush , toothpaste, deodorant, face wash, face moisturizer, setting powder, fave eyeshadow pallet, waterproof eyeliner, waterproof mascara, lip tint, brow gel, hair brush, and fave scrunchie    Other: small box of photos, external hard rive, laptop, phone charger, box of important papers, cat carrier, cat kibble, cat blanket,cat treats, cat brush, box of valuable jewelry, favourite childhood doll  *edit: for those concerned, cat is not listed as packed because Winston does not enjoy being in his crate.	episode_done:True

I was so light headed from smoke inhalation that I didn’t even remember to pack any underwear, so I’m just really really hoping the house doesn’t burn down because I packed 4 shirts, 4 pairs of pants, and 1 pair of shoes, and if all my silk blazers burn I’m going to cry	episode_done:True

I was in charge of the basic necessities and while I had plenty of clothes and things for my son (5mo at the time), I just randomly grabbed an armful of clothes from the closet for my husband and I, and for some reason the entire contents of my husband’s sock drawer. I forgot to bring him any pants, but I brought every sock he owns. 🤦🏼‍♀️ So... it’s a great exercise to think of all this before you have to evacuate lol (ETA: also in CA, we couldn’t go home for a few days but our house and our stuff were thankfully fine)	episode_done:True

In case we have a tornado and have to go to the basement for shelter and our house gets obliterated I want a bag of essentials so we can be mildly clean. I mainly focus on underclothes and always a pair of sneakers. The idea of navigating a disaster in flip flops or anything but sneakers sounds awful to me. I try and throw clothes in that can be worn in public or around the house, so nothing too ratty. I'd also suggest a pair of work gloves in case you have to handle anything. I guess I'm not sure how life works during a fire disaster. Is it like a  tornado where if you get flattened then you're focusing on clean up? What about work? If you have work clothes consider packing an outfit or two in case you have to go into work. I'm sorry you have this stress to deal with, how scary it all must be.

That is irreplaceable and even though I only wear it to special football games I would cry over that jacket more than any other item. Her brown faux fur coat would be next. My "sentimental/valuable" jewelry collection (I'd pawn it if I had to), my black gypsy skirt that looks like moths have eaten the bottom from it snagging on things (it's survived me for 10 years, I ain't giving up on her yet), my made-in-Ireland hand-knit emerald green wool sweater, this ridiculously comfortable yet loud romper that I'm conveniently already wearing, my purple shawl, my lucky Lucky jeans, my space boot Doc Martens and my snow leopard Spirit Hood.  It's a weird list that doesn't seem to go together, but that's what comes to mind first. I've kept these items for years despite all my style changes and wardrobe rehauls. I could (and probably will) replace everything else eventually.  I hope you and your house stays safe - I'm in Cali too, gratefully far enough to not worry about having to evacuate but close enough to watch the ash falling like snow.

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting our 'Finding A Style and Building A Wardrobe' guide	labels:one thing i noticed in my fashion journey is the effect that location has on style, and to be aware of it. is it something you like, or dislike?  i went to college in the north east in the late 2000s and it was all prep all the time. i was in academia at the time, and fully embraced prep into my life, even though it felt like a facade.  then i moved to NYC and  i stuck out like a sore thumb lol. slowly, and without realizing it over the course of a couple years, my style went from typical new england prep with lots of fake pearls and plaid and corduroy and navy and JKP lusting, to all black all the time city girl.  i LOVE my style now, it just feels very "me" and can't ever imagine wearing a navy blazer again in my life. but if i was to move to the north east again, or down south or somewhere else with a different local aesthetic i would pay a lot more attention to my buying choices to make sure i   maintain my style in a way that i like, and if i ever decide to change it up to make it a conscious decision. it would have saved me a lot of money during that transition period when i had no cohesive items to wear together.  a navy wool blazer from jack wills doesn't really go with leather shorts!  &#x200B;  \[edit\] i'm not sure how it would be worked into the guide, though. maybe when talking about climate which heavily affects people's fashion choices and is also very regional, regional (even hyperlocal, different neighborhoods in NYC dress very differently) style trends could also be mentioned?   it would have been helpful for me when moving to a new city to have had that seed planted in my head. if you're freshly moved or have been living in a place for a while and want a new style, look at the people around you! they'll probably be wearing clothes that can be found locally, and if you like how people dress it's a great way to get inspiration on what's current in that area.   it's also great because if you DON"T like how people are dressing you can consciously make the decision to avoid those choices.	episode_done:False
text:For sure! I grew up in a rural area, where people dress very casually. Think a lot of camo, jeans for slightly dressier occasions, etc. I moved to a city that's much dressier, and even my casual clothes feel out of place when I visit my family. A lot more dresses, polished outfits, and business attire. And I noticed when traveling for work how much more conservatively people tend to dress in my current city versus in other parts of the country, even in the more hip/young/alternative parts of town.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:This is such a good point, I moved from a poor city in the Southwest United States to Montréal. This city is so European and it’s fashion reflects that- women look more put together while still being casual. My city before this was about 10 years behind in fashion, so Hollister mixed with ~country~ was how most people dressed. There’s also so much more variety here- I feel like I can experiment a lot more with what fits me and what doesn’t. But like u/Pitta_ said, if I ever move somewhere with totally different tastes like the West coast I think I would adapt my style to fit that a little more.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Good point! I'd love to see some recommendations in the comment section.	labels:In addition to the usual apps I've found that some mid-tier brands are waaaay cheaper second hand on designer consignment sites like TheRealReal and VestaireCollective than on ebay and Poshmark. Like Alice + Olivia or RED Valentino. Maybe because they're not luxury enough for the target audience on those sites, whereas on Poshmark/ebay they're considered higher value and therefore get marked up more.	episode_done:True
