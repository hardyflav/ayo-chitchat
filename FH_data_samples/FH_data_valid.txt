text:The first one was a little on the tight side, but the subsequent suits seemed well-fitted to me.	labels:The double breasted suit coat worn as a sport coat is a mess. I don't know why the right lapel is buckling in both shots, and the shoulders are a mess - rippling, and shoulder pads lurching out about the shoulder  The last photo is a better fitting suit, but also an argument against contrasting colored button on a business-y fabric - this medium-light brown buttons were the wrong choice

text:She wasn’t a billionaire back then when she first used nylon. In fact, it was a risk and it didn’t perform well at first because factories weren’t configured for such a fabric and people had difficulty accepting a fabric common in workwear and industrial uses (parachuting) to be anything luxurious. So yeah in a way it was a statement against bourgeois taste.  Most natural fabrics today are cheap to the point where priced competitively to synthetics. Just because it’s affordable or synthetic doesn’t make it less luxurious.	labels:Its not about luxury - I think we're missing the forest for the trees here. Its about adopting leftist language to Sell Product to the same bourgeois consumer its supposed to rally against. Here buy this at x order of magnitude markup and feel about yourself fellow working class comrade while I take the paycheck. Guess it worked

I think it’s time I let the thrifting and g r a p h i c t e e life go for a bit. I own way too many band shirts and shit that I just don’t wear anymore. I need to suck it up and start investing in my wardrobe to get it to a place I want it to be instead of buying a ton of shitty bandaids for 8 bucks a pop at thrift stores. Time to be a big boy and learn to go for a few expensive pieces instead of a ton of cheap ones.   Wish me luck lads.

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:I'm becoming more and more disappointed with JCrew and will only buy their basic t shirts at heavy discounts. Eventually, the tops always end up with a hole and stretch out quite a bit.  I've not shopped at GAP in over a decade, but I still own a pair of sweatpants from them that are now 20 years old. Yes, That's how well they have been lasting. I doubt that the current ones would hold up that well.  Anthropologie pants also always end up with holes and stretched out. The tops always feel very cheap to me when I look at them in the store. Even buying on sale is becoming not worth it.  I have tried Sezane recently and am very pleasantly surprised at the quality from the feel of it. It remains to be seen how well the pieces hold up. If they do, I'm ok with spending the extra amount if it's  going to last a decade.	episode_done:True

Finding knitwear with a similar silhouette, a voluminous sleeve on the shoulder with a long narrow cuff akin to a bishop sleeve has been an absolute delight.

I work in higher end retail and I wear these pants almost everyday so I need something that will look professional in the fashion industry and also hold up. I’m willing to spend more money (trying to stay under $250, but if I can get a few years out of the pants it’s worth it).

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:Hi! As a stylist I get this question ALOT. For starters don't get rid of too much before buying replacements. What ends up happening is we get rid of everything without establishing what pieces we actually need.   Start with establishing your personal style. What do your want your closet/style to be? What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping! Now that you have a moodboard and list of things you need you can shop to fin in the gaps and more importantly you can shop with intention!   &#x200B;  I hope that wasn't too much and was helpful haha. I'm always happy to help.
text:That's actually really helpful! How do you suggest finding my style? I feel like I have such a wide style that I wear (minimal, to punk, to cutesy, etc). I feel like I love all of my clothes but some go months without being worn.	labels:No I totally get that! A great way to start would be to hop on Pinterest and create a board of everything that speaks to you. Type in feminine type in punk etc.   It’s not terrible to not wear things for months but you mentioned wanting to create more of a capsule minimal wardrobe. So that’s something you should decide now to help you going forward.	episode_done:True

I might be wearing a beige tracksuit for the third day in a row but goddamnit at least I have pink glitter sneakers.  I'll be honest though, I dress pretty loud on the day-to-day (orange skirt, bright blue sweater, red jacket) so it's not that big of a change.	episode_done:True

text:BOF Op-Ed: How Luxury Became Fast Fashion	labels:Luxury used to be expensive materials and construction.   But it's much more lucrative to sell "looks", "styles", and "trends". When they can't even sew on the buttons without threads sticking out of every hole, some too tight that I have to re-do myself.  I do believe that you can have luxury synthetics, but also that few brands use them. Even brands that go "ethical" and "timeless" in marketing avoid "quality" now. Because it's easy to prove quality. Using unprotected fluff-words and reputations made decades ago is much safer and can be used to inflate prices.  H&M collabs used to be amazing. I regret I didn't buy a wool jacket 5 years ago. It was a bit too expensive and heavy for me then. But the quality for price was GREAT. It did make me realize how shitty midrange clothing is.   Picking the right stuff from H&M will be better then brands that costs 5-10 times as much. It's really only the label that is different. And if H&M can't pay their worker much for that price, more expensive brands just doesn't. Why would they?  Does Amazon pay their workers more, or take out a larger profit? No one with the means of starting up international brands actually wants to offer a great product, made fairly, they want max profit. Greenwashing is great for profit, no need to prove anything, and keep selling shit that needs to be replaced after a few uses for premium prices.	episode_done:True

They are fairly inexpensive for the quality of leather (compared to a chanel/gucci). I was in store a while back and they are seriously even more beautiful in person. They had a bubblegum pink one with the serpent on it and I want it so badly! I highly recommend everyone google their bags as I think they are less popular than they should be. I also like that they are less popular because they look like a super good quality bag but only those “in the know” so to speak, will know where it is from!   I am also curious about hunting season bags. They have piqued my interest a bit as well.

text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:* H&M mini-length black pencil skirt with floral embroidery.

I'm petit enough to fit into Zara's kids stuff and this trench was like half the price of a very similar looking women's trench (also Zara). It's very versatile, my cost per wear is \~$1.50  I have some pieces that I bought off Taobao (black pleated mini skirt, my only pair of denim shorts, a white short sleeve blouse, and a lavender knit top) that's also around the $1.00 per wear.	episode_done:True

text:Lately she is my pandemic designer. I love all of her patterns and pattern upon pattern and her comfortable to the max looks. And the shoes! No reason to suffer heels now. Even though restricted to the house and yard and sometimes a quick trip to the market I still get dressed as creatively and colorfully as I can. It lifts my spirits as well as the spirits of my family. We are a three generation household. My 13 year old granddaughter gave me the highest of compliments last week when I came downstairs.  "Wow, I wish I was an old lady so I could dress like that"! I told her that one of the benefits of being my age is that I can wear whatever I want. I'm retired and 76 but I still love looking good and I love fashion but I no longer worry about or want the latest trends. I know what they are and can work around them to get the look that I want, not what Madison Ave. tells me is IT.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:My heirlooms came from my grandmother, who was 5'2" in heels. I am built the same way, but have more inches than she did... so alas, that gorgeous Burberry trench coat simply cannot be made to fit.   However, Gram was a collector of cashmere and one of those people who believed that if you like a thing, you should have one in every color, and two in the colors you like best, against it wearing out. I have a handful of her sweaters, some of which are from the early 70's. These sweaters were everyday wear for her, and it does show, but they are SO soft and SO luscious that I wear them around the house on a regular basis. My cats don't care that they're two inches too short and have holes at the hem.   I did inherit some of her jewelry, including her engagement ring, which was put in a setting that my grandfather designed. Sadly, resizing the setting to fit me would have destroyed it, so I have that put away until I find a jeweler I trust to make it into a necklace with a new stone. I have an AMAZING opal bracelet of hers, also my grandfather's design, a silver wire cuff with the opals set in as the body of a spider. Gram never told my grandfather that the thought of a spider on her wrist freaked her out- she rarely wore it. I never met my grandfather to tell him how cool I think that piece is. Looks amazing peeking out from under the lace sleeves of my favorite LBD.
text:I’ve also inherited cashmere sweaters in all different colours. My grandma loved turtlenecks though so that’s the only format. On the plus side they don’t have any holes and they fit me just fine.  When I was younger and she gave them to me she would go on about how great the quality was in those sweaters. I, knowing nothing about quality clothing being a teenager, just nodded along and shrugged. Now when I’m older and seen the prizes for new quality cashmere, I feel a lot more appreciative. I’ve made it a point to thrift non-turtleneck cashmere sweaters though.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I have three basic outfits I go towards for casual Fridays depending on the time of year and plans:  * Long flowing maxi-dress with a longline blazer. With comfortable shoes. * Fitted Midi-dress. With comfortable shoes. * High waisted jeans, a dressy top/knit jumper depending on the weather and oversized blazer. With comfortable shoes.  All of the above are a marked improvement on my usual silk shirt, midi skirt, blazer and heels combo. I will note that I'm more inclined to go with either of the first two options. These are my preferred silhouettes.  I also go slightly bolder with my necklace choices. Instead of my usual gold Common Era necklace (which I wear every day), I go with my more colourful Lizzie Fortunado options.  My goal is to be my more colourful self, just a very polished version. With comfortable shoes.	episode_done:True

Thanks for the review tho bud, wouldn’t have any doubt that Schott wouldn’t deliver a quality product  also Orvis had a couple decent looking suede jackets on their website but when I went to the store they’re only carried online, kinda skeptical about their quality of leather
text:It's pretty hard to find a good one! I like the nubuck material as it is stronger than suede and gives a bit more structure. Good call about Orvis, also unsure of leather quality. Overland is another shop that has good leather jackets but didn't have anything in stock with this design.

text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers.

The North Face Chilkat boots- keep my feet warm even with thin socks on, also have great grip for ice and snow.   Columbia Lay D Down II coat- light weight but warm enough to wear in below zero weather, nice big pockets, but wish the hood had strings to adjust width. When I put the hood up on a windy day I can’t adjust it so it just gets blown back down.  Artix snow pants- warm and can take a beating, very durable.

text:General Discussion - October 25	labels:One of our old friend families we keep in touch with since they moved to the city beside ours has started to go off the deep end with COVID/qanon conspiracy stuff on FB. My wife is much closer to the wife and was really having some distress. My wife works in public health and directly with our COVID response.  Anyways, my wife posted a comment on a particularly inflammatory post and basically said it was affecting their friendship. They wound up having a phone call and it actually turned out positively, with the other person asking for some more information to look at contrary to her views.  Anyways, for now it was a positive outcome from something where I thought we’d have to cut someone out of our lives. Hard because our kids are friends too.  Also we had a provincial election here yesterday and our left-of-Centre (NDP) party absolutely wiped the floor with the centre-right party which is nice. They’ve done a good job with COVID and other stuff so happy to keep going with that.

text:Better With Age: 10 Things Better Bought Used – Put This On	labels:My vintage 80s Levi's denim sherpa is probably my favorite piece in my closet and was only like 40 USD on grailed.  Its nice knowing that it's made in the USA, better quality than new, perfectly faded and comfy for a fraction of the price of new.  Regardless, I feel that we're getting to the point where you're paying the same or more for vintage as compared to new due to the rise of vintage clothing stores and old pieces being trendy. Unless you get lucky at a goodwill or thrift store, but I find most of the stuff I find at actual thrift stores are pretty boring or not even all that old (lots of fast fashion crap at thrift stores now).	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:heavily investing in jewellery was a way for women who weren’t allowed their own bank accounts to acquire some form of financial security. now that that isn’t nearly as much of an issue, jewellery is moving more and more towards just being a fashion item.
text:This rings so true for my sister in law. They were saving up money to down a house. Then, her mom convinced her to use the money to buy jewelry 'just in case' something happens to her husband, my brother or they divorce. So instead of money towards a new home. She has a bunch of jewelry. :/	labels:i’m so sorry that happened to her, yikes.
text:Actually...she and her mom are selfish and greedy. I guess I should have explained. My brother and sister in law were saving up money to buy a house. My brother saved up around $80,000. Then, my sister in law and her mom took all of that money and bought jewelry. Their reasoning was because "in case something happens to my brother"... like he was going to die or something...  He was mad. But he couldn't say anything and just start over saving money again.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 18, 2020	labels:Recently got some Cole Haan bit loafers. Usually wear an 8 1/2 dress shoe some 81/2 wides and 9 1/2 running shoe. Tried them on and I have to use a shoe horn to get them on and could not wear them sockless only with socks. Not sure if it's cause I need to go a size up to a 9 or get 8 1/2 wide or stick with the ones I got and maybe they just need to be broken in. I still feel a lot of room between my toe and end of the shoe though, the heel is the only part that rubs once I put it on and walk in it, it feels a lil tight top to down wise too kinda like a glove like feeling. I attached some pictures of the fit, my toe hits at that rounded lip line near the end so about .75 of an inch or so of space so I don't think going a size up would help. What do you all think? It could just be the last too idk what do you all think?	episode_done:True

text:Stop Dressing For Your Height [Tim Dessaint]	labels:Great video, thanks for sharing.  Particularly liked this excerpt around the 3-minute mark that a lot of people need to hear:   > The problem I find with dressing to maximize your perceived height is that 1, it puts height on a pedestal-- it assumes that your height is the most important factor for determining your attractiveness--and 2, it assumes you should dress to maximize your attractiveness to others... you are dressing with one priority, to look taller and more attractive to the eyes of other people and the result of that is a sea of men dressing the exact same way... where is the personality in that? The soul? Creativity... do you know how cool it is to dress in a unique way that's authentic to you and walk around in the utmost confidence?	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:I think once you have your basics down, pay attention to the kinds of things that you find yourself wishing you had when you're getting dressed or when you're out.  If you keep consistently wanting the same things, long term, then it makes sense to add it to your closet.  It also helps if you get super specific about what you want and don't pick up things that kinda work, since you'll just end up buying a ton of similar things.	episode_done:True

I'm equally a fan of the sweatshirt/jean vest jacket, relaxed fit bottoms, and sneakers. I feel like I could pull that off on my 90s grunge throwback days. I already have all those silhouettes.

text:General Discussion - November 27, 2020	labels:Hot take: speaking from experience, fetishistically optimizing the most basic of basics (e.g. "the best plain white t-shirt") for maximum imagined value is not a meaningful nor worthwhile exercise. Your wardrobe is not more interesting because your white tee is better than another white tee, and by the time you've found the 'perfect' piece either the prevailing trend or your own preferences will probably have changed.  'Perfect tee' threads are usually highly-upvoted, but the answers have drawn from the same pool for the last goddamn decade:  - *Vintage/workwear (generally heavier, boxier, shorter):* 3sixteen, Buzz Rickson's, Lady White Co. - *Streetwear (generally lighter, slimmer, longer):* Reigning Champ, wings + horns, John Elliott - *"Normal" (somewhere in the middle)*: Naked & Famous, Arket, American Apparel when they still existed - *Edgy goth shit:* Rick Owens mainline for lighter and DRKSHDW for heavier, Kazuyuki Kumagai Attachment, Voidthebrand when they still existed - *Budget*: Muji, Uniqlo, Everlane, Bella+Canvas, etc., but no one really cares  It's functionally a solved question.

text:+J/UNIQLO SPECIAL COLLABORATION: What’s the verdict?	labels:the outerwear is all spectacular and i think much nicer quality than regular uniqlo outerwear.  i thought the sweaters were a bit thin, which was slightly disappointing.  all the cotton items are pretty standard uniqlo cotton (maybe slightly smoother) but the cuts were fun. the silk items felt nice, but not as nice as more expensive silks (obviously). the silk knit shirts were less soft than the bow blouse but i think that's just the nature of knit silks?  the wool items were all fab. i got trousers and the skirt and love them both.  also EVERYTHING WAS SO BIG? i know some of the items were supposed to be oversized but the sizing wasn't consistent. i was my usual size in skirt/pants and sweaters/shirts, but i had to size down in the oversized items because they were too big. the hybrid down coat which i got in a M (my usual uniqlo outerwear size) fit like a L or XL. the cotton shirtdress which i also got in a M (for non-outerwear i am usually between a s/m in uniqlo sizing because i am tall, and generally go with a M for sleeve length) fits like a L, but for that one i can make it work by styling it differently. if they had it in a S i would have gotten that instead, tho.  generally i am pleased with what i got. i think for the price it's not bad, and i like the cuts of the pieces and higher than usual fabric quality, although some pieces felt more worth it than others.   i do NOT think it is worth buying at a markup tho. none of the pieces were particularly unique (except maybe some of the outerwear) and you would be able to find similar pieces from other places at a similar price point i think.

text:"Which Sports Jacket Office Are You?" – Permanent Style	labels:Good article with some nice outfits. I've always been someone into tailored clothing and classic menswear, and honestly the odd jacket / trousers combination is absolutely the way to go. I own a single full suit, which I love, but generally it's a functional piece to be worn when a level of formality is *required* -- and therefore not as much fun.  Meanwhile, I have lots of different blazers / sports jackets and tailored trousers, and not only are they more fun to style and mix up, they're just that much more versatile that they become my go-to combination for what is basically my every day style. You can play around with the shoes, whether or not you have a tie, or a hat, and all of a sudden you have so many more options!  My suit simply doesn't have the same versatility, to the point that (when social functions were a thing) I probably wore my black-tie dinner suit more often.

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting our 'Finding A Style and Building A Wardrobe' guide	labels:one thing i noticed in my fashion journey is the effect that location has on style, and to be aware of it. is it something you like, or dislike?  i went to college in the north east in the late 2000s and it was all prep all the time. i was in academia at the time, and fully embraced prep into my life, even though it felt like a facade.  then i moved to NYC and  i stuck out like a sore thumb lol. slowly, and without realizing it over the course of a couple years, my style went from typical new england prep with lots of fake pearls and plaid and corduroy and navy and JKP lusting, to all black all the time city girl.  i LOVE my style now, it just feels very "me" and can't ever imagine wearing a navy blazer again in my life. but if i was to move to the north east again, or down south or somewhere else with a different local aesthetic i would pay a lot more attention to my buying choices to make sure i   maintain my style in a way that i like, and if i ever decide to change it up to make it a conscious decision. it would have saved me a lot of money during that transition period when i had no cohesive items to wear together.  a navy wool blazer from jack wills doesn't really go with leather shorts!  &#x200B;  \[edit\] i'm not sure how it would be worked into the guide, though. maybe when talking about climate which heavily affects people's fashion choices and is also very regional, regional (even hyperlocal, different neighborhoods in NYC dress very differently) style trends could also be mentioned?   it would have been helpful for me when moving to a new city to have had that seed planted in my head. if you're freshly moved or have been living in a place for a while and want a new style, look at the people around you! they'll probably be wearing clothes that can be found locally, and if you like how people dress it's a great way to get inspiration on what's current in that area.   it's also great because if you DON"T like how people are dressing you can consciously make the decision to avoid those choices.
text:This is such a good point, I moved from a poor city in the Southwest United States to Montréal. This city is so European and it’s fashion reflects that- women look more put together while still being casual. My city before this was about 10 years behind in fashion, so Hollister mixed with ~country~ was how most people dressed. There’s also so much more variety here- I feel like I can experiment a lot more with what fits me and what doesn’t. But like u/Pitta_ said, if I ever move somewhere with totally different tastes like the West coast I think I would adapt my style to fit that a little more.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:Personally, I would say it all boils down to feeling like I need a 'treat' when I'm having a tough time. I grew up with a single mum and money was kind of tight, so although she did the best she could, I didn't have a games console or label clothes or the latest trendy toys, and I only ever got anything at christmas or on my birthday. I learnt from very early on not to pester my mum for something in the shop, because the answer was always no.  When I got older and had my own money, I loved to save it. I didn't really get to go anywhere, and so if I did have the occasional day out with friends, I'd make the most of it and spend the money I had been saving up. I guess along the way it became like a special treat that made me feel like I had a chance at 'fitting in' with my friends and finding myself, because I got the chance to buy things that weren't picked out by an adult as a gift or second- third- fourth- hand from the car boot or charity shop.  Nowadays, impulse buys give me a surge of happiness that I can be who I want and buy what I want, and it just makes me feel better when I'm struggling.

When she's feeling herself and doesn't have to play a character she's usually wearing a patterned suit or some comfy black pants and a cool top. When she was playing Billie she wore two kimono-inspired jackets, which is pretty interesting and I just noticed the continuity for that character. When she was starting over after she thought Eve was dead she's wearing stylish romantic dresses which match her new villa in a way.    &#x200B;  **END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS**  &#x200B;  Anyway I enjoyed the album, she has a really interesting style and wears everything so well.	episode_done:True

text:Your 2021 trend predictions?	labels:The style of 2020 was so much more feminine and romantic than the trends of the previous couple decades, so it'll be interesting to see how this rediscovery of feminine softness will influence things going forwards. As others have said I think there will be more focus on beautiful and dainty ornamentation paired with simpler slightly more fitted garments of natural fibre. Pants and skirts sitting on the hips bones rather than being high waisted. Floral and nature inspired patterns and jewellery, I'm thinking the painting of Ophelia by Millais. But maybe at the same time there will be a swing away from this sweet, innocent look with more psychedelic, rave culture, lsd and 1960s art nouveau appropriation poster aesthetics emerging. I think this kind of psychedelic combination of delicate "nature goddess" looks with more vivid colours, trippy prints and interesting details will start to emerge.  Honestly I'm hoping some of the slow fashion, "timeless", ethical (and expensive) clothing that has been cool for the last 5 years will finally start to mean that people actually do buy less stuff and the fast fashion cycle will slow down with changes being more in the realm of accessories and hair than in buying tonnes of clothing itself.... But probably not right...   On another note: nike AF1s (and vejas) are surely done by now, and maybe this is wishful thinking but I feel the cool sneaker trend cycle might fizzle out a bit, with more trad leather and cute heels and basic canvas shoes coming in... Anyone here got speculation on what the new cool shoe will be?

text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:First off congrats. I'm curious how you made the transition during the quarantine, but that's a big accomplishment and give yourself a pat on the back.  It sounds like you have gone from chubby to skinny but you are about to put on more muscle. I wouldn't go super-slim if you're still gymming and putting on muscle. I basically went from  medium to a small then back to a medium from putting on muscle.  I probably would hold off on investing in more rigid pieces like jeans for a bit, but if you work out a lot I would invest in better gym clothes (i.e. Nike Tech Pack is something I really like), and get nice stretchy clothes that can accomodate your physique like cardigans. I would also invest in a good fleece (i.e. Patagonia or North Face). Essentially anything that you imagine stretches a bit and is something you wear every day, I would get nicer versions of. T-shirts should not be a big investment and I would just get from Uniqlo for slightly oversized from any brand really.  I think pants are a bigger question mark and for now it would help to go with an elastic waistband or wear something inexpensive that you can experiement with (i.e. Uniqlo, Levis, Unbranded, J. Crew if on sale). Honestly I don't really wear either much these days and don't recommend buying them if you're expecting to be at home for the majority of the time, as you'll want things that you wear a lot (IMO).  If you provide your height and weight I'm happy to provide my input there too. I went from \~170ish to \~150ish at 5'8" a few years ago, then put on muscle, then am back to being a fatass so will be making a similar transition over the next few weeks.	episode_done:True

text:I was going to say this - I “challenged” myself to buy only secondhand for a year but it’s been so easy it hasn’t even been a challenge and I’ve carried on with it!

text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:I think this system may work if you flip things quickly - almost like “renting” clothes - but would be an extreme amount of work. However, if you plan to buy luxury items and get a lot of wear out of them, they depreciate rapidly. I would never spend $300 on cashmere that someone wore for years - it’s just not worth it. Also, as someone who adores eBay shopping and Posh, it’s more of a “buyer’s market” - I just scored new-in-box Aquatalia and La Canedienne boots, each for less than 1/4 of original price, and these are styles that are still being sold full-price online.   The only area I really see this working out is luxury bags - bags get less wear and tear, and Chanel will always have great resale value. But for an entire wardrobe, it just doesn’t seem viable (or worth the time).	episode_done:True

text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:While we can't say for certain: is it possible that the second experience is the correct one? A lot of men believe that they need a fully custom suit to fit well, but in actuality for most body types the patterns are rather close. If an OTR size with alterations would look great, paying for MTM is a waste of money. I've done MTM suits and bought OTR suits and have generally found that getting OTR with alterations is a faster way to a well fitting suit than the low to mid level MTM stuff we're talking about here. I've done Indochino MTM which was generally a mess and a tuxedo from Black Lapel which eventually worked out well, following one full remake and $100 of local alterations (that they paid for). My OTR blue line suits from SS fit great after alterations.
text:I know this is hard to do, but I really think men committed to getting a great fitting suit within a reasonable price need to try on several OTR companies and stick with the one whose cuts fits the best with the least needed alterations. I've done that with SS; their Havana and Lazio cuts fit me perfectly, and I only need to get the pants hemmed.  Unlike Spier & Mackay for me, whose $199 liquidation suit needed $240 of tailoring in NYC. At that price, plus the extra slight risk of returns since they're in Canada, I'd rather stick with SS despite them lacking in more conservative fabrics when compared with Spier. But for some people, Spier fits them the best, whereas SS is too slim.	labels:Agree 100%. Most of the go-to's offer free exchanges as long as it's your first suit, so it's not at hard as it seems. At least based on my experience, I had much better lucky buying decent fitting OTR suits and turning them into well-fitting ones than sending my measurements out into the ether.	episode_done:True

Don’t know how cold we’re talking but up to around  40 F, I would pretty much wear any autumn-y skirt/dress and rely on my wool tights, knee high leather boots, and a long wool coat to provide warmth for my lower body. Personally, most of the skirts I chose to wear were 100% cotton denim, leather, or suede!
text:I like a mid-calf wool skirt that has plenty of folds, a wide hem, and a satin lining. The shape allows freedom of movement and room for other layers, and the smooth lining defeats friction so the hem doesn’t bunch up.   In the depth of winter, I’ll wear silk long johns and Cuddle-Duds pants underneath; the Duds are easy to pull off without putting on a show when I get to my desk. (I dislike changing in a bathroom.)  Lately I’ve had the thought that the ideal under layer might be those Indian-style pants with the crotch that comes down to the knee.	labels:Where do you purchase such a skirt??	episode_done:True

That’s what I can remember.

text:Indochino VS Local custom clothier (HM Cole). My fair review.	labels:I would agree with the overall sentiment to get an OTR suit and tailor but I will also add, in my own opinion, to avoid Indochino whenever possible.    I purchased a suit from them that was really bad because it was too small.    Then they sent a recut that was too large.  Both had arms set at different angles by a few degrees leading to weird darts of fabric showing up on the back and the chest.  One sleeve, out of the four, was wavy all the way down instead of a straight line with a bend at the elbow.  I'm not even sure how it was possible.    Then they sent ANOTHER recut that was again too small.    My local tailor I took it to said there was little chance of salvaging any of them, given the level of complexity it would require to do so.  Not a simple pinch-tuck-hem situation.  This process took over two months and when I got tired of the shot gun attempts they were sending me, I asked for a refund and they refused.  Even though their claim is  *"Every INDOCHINO purchase is backed by our Fit Promise. If your order does not meet expectations, let us know and we will make it right."* their customer service rep told me *"Yes, using alterations or a remake to get the right fit. There is no mention of refunds, as this is not something we offer."*  Once you drop $500 on a suit, you're stuck with it.  Even if they made it so poorly, the tailor tells you they can't do anything.  Today I'm down $500 on a wonky suit that I never wore and will likely end up giving to Goodwill.  I'd strongly advise everyone to look elsewhere and just avoid the hassle altogether. It's a gamble that's not worth it.

How do you dress like that here in the PH? I'm so interested by the possibilities of fashion but it's so frustrating not being able to put heavier fabrics on to experiment, lest I die of heat stroke.

text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:I don't think there's anything wrong with preferring dresses and leggings and it doesn't inherently signify that you are somehow unworthy for pants or "letting yourself go".   The thing is, historically speaking, dresses were actually far more practical for a woman's body due the cyclical changes we all experience, from menstrual bloating/cramping, to minor weight fluctuations, to pregnancy and breastfeeding (historically there wasn't much choice about the last two but obviously now there is), cuz you could cinch up or let out your dress depending on how you were doing.   It's only now that stretchy fabric is truly mainstream that pants have truly become as practical and cost effective in that they can tolerate a lot more cyclical size changes, which are *normal*.  Edit: not to mention all the times people would gain and lose weight due to the availability of food.   I'd say I have a pretty confident mindset and 90% of my non work wardrobe is dresses and skirts/shirt combos. I wear undersummers in the spring and summer, leggings and sweater tights in the winter and I've gotten SO MUCH MORE USE out of my dresses... They lasted me up until my 8th month of pregnancy, I barely had to buy maternity clothes.  I have been able to wear the same knit dress/leggings combo at 180lbs prepregnancy and later at 210 lbs post partum and still look cute.  What pair of pants could pull that off? Almost none, I tell you.  Saved me a lot of $$$.   No matter what I weigh, I always have a bit of a belly, so most pants dig into that anyways, which isn't comfortable. Only truly high waisted stuff feels ok, but I don't want to wear that in the summer.   It sounds like disordered thinking is creeping up on you, and you may have to consciously remind yourself that there's nothing wrong with enjoying comfy clothes that don't restrict your abdomen.

Or at least they won't spend time thinking about it. If I put together an outfit outside my comfort zone, I can take it off at the end of the day and it's like it never even happened. Same way makeup washes off, clothes come off in an instant too. The stakes aren't as high as they feel.  I used to feel boxed in by what I describe as "school picture day mentality," meaning I felt that every outfit had to be *just right*. It had to represent me perfectly as if that's how I would be preserved in other people's minds forever. But that's so goofy, idk why I thought that.

Thanks  Edit: for colorblind bros: apparently there are apps (f.ex color grab and kuler) that can tell what color things are. Super helpful if you wanna learn which skin tone you have.
text:Damn that's interesting insight.   I guess monochromatic looks (b&w) would be my go to style as well. Got me curious about what solutions are out there for colorblind people that are into fashion.  Gonna check that movie, thanks.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:When I was in my early 20's, my first priority was to look "cute" or "hot". 5 inch heels were just what I did. I had no money obviously, so it ended up being most anything I could find on clearance.   I'm in my mid-30's now and I simply don't wear it if it isn't comfortable. Not to say I live in sweatpants (well, pre-pandemic anyway), but I prioritize my comfort, looking relatively pulled together, and not tragically out of style but still not necessarily trendy. I don't wear heels.   I don't shop clearance anymore. If it's a well made item that I want and I've taken the time to think about it, I buy it. Otherwise, I do a lot of thrifting and wear what I like of that and sell the rest.	episode_done:True
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:Don't worry! You're most likely not going to look any older. Clothes do much less for your age than you think. Just imagine a middle aged lady that dresses like a teenager. She's not fooling anyone. If dressing like another age worked to look another age, we would all do it 😂 just enjoy clothes and experiment with fun looks, it's easy to pull most things off while young.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 27, 2020	labels:Hot take: speaking from experience, fetishistically optimizing the most basic of basics (e.g. "the best plain white t-shirt") for maximum imagined value is not a meaningful nor worthwhile exercise. Your wardrobe is not more interesting because your white tee is better than another white tee, and by the time you've found the 'perfect' piece either the prevailing trend or your own preferences will probably have changed.  'Perfect tee' threads are usually highly-upvoted, but the answers have drawn from the same pool for the last goddamn decade:  - *Vintage/workwear (generally heavier, boxier, shorter):* 3sixteen, Buzz Rickson's, Lady White Co. - *Streetwear (generally lighter, slimmer, longer):* Reigning Champ, wings + horns, John Elliott - *"Normal" (somewhere in the middle)*: Naked & Famous, Arket, American Apparel when they still existed - *Edgy goth shit:* Rick Owens mainline for lighter and DRKSHDW for heavier, Kazuyuki Kumagai Attachment, Voidthebrand when they still existed - *Budget*: Muji, Uniqlo, Everlane, Bella+Canvas, etc., but no one really cares  It's functionally a solved question. You can pick one from the applicable list for your style, and it'll be *fine.*

text:WEEKLY DEALZ	labels:I am still reeling from the Nordstrom rack sales on Everlane items. They are so good. The sneakers are really good quality for 19 bucks, and I do see sizes come back, if you check daily. I bought a pair for myself and a pair for my friend.  I also bought a few clothing items that is taking forever to ship though. I might cancel some of them and wait out the rest. I mean, 30ish bucks for dresses/jumpsuits and 40s for cashmere is a pretty good deal, and it's not like Everlane's style is gonna change much. They sell the same shit year in and year out.
text:omg thank you for sharing. just snagged 4 pieces for under $80 for my eventual post-covid work wardrobe	labels:That's great! I think Everlane's quality is better than regular mall brands, and some of the styles are good.

text:For those who define their style as "classic-traditional" (tailored, fitted, matching, sleek), what are your typical outfits for work, on the weekends, date-night, running errands or lounging around?	labels:I have a pseudo-capsule wardrobe. I technically own only a few clothing items, but in several versions. For instance, several white blouses: 4 x poplin (different fits and collars), 2 x linen, silk in a minimalist version and more  dressy one with flowing sleeves, you get the idea. I too like pencil skirts, and most of my pants are either dark jeans or straight leg or slightly tapered pants in black, navy, grey, and white, depending on the fabric and/or cut they are more or less smart/casual. I don't get too trendy so I can get longer wear without looking dated. I love scarves and if I want a pop of color I'll usually go for a colorful scarf.    Work is boring, most of the time dark jeans or dark pants and a blouse or tee and a cardigan. And flats. I need to feel comfortable or I won't get anything done. During spring and fall, when the AC isn't turning my workplace into a freezer, I get a lot of wear out of my grey wool sheath dress, 4 years and still going strong!  Going out: I switch out a cardigan for a blazer, flats to heels, and put on makeup. Grab a fancier purse than my usual work black leather tote. I have some pearl and gold inherited pieces of jewelry I might bring out for special occasions.  At home I'm a slob, sorry, I have nobody to impress. Yoga pants and tees it is, as well as  everyday clothing that shows signs of wear and is comfortable enough to lounge around.	episode_done:True
text:What is your go to/favourite belt?	labels:My go to is Sezane’s Artemis belt. Literally wear it about 4 or 5 times a week
text:Is the buckle more of a silver or gold tone? It says light gold but the picture looks silver. I’ve been looking for a black belt with a yellow gold buckle	labels:It varies somewhat depending on the color belt, but this is a pretty common question that even owning the belt won't always help answer. Basically it's between a silver and gold and looks slightly more gold in some lights, but is not a true gold. The black version seems to have a more silver tone to the metal, but the burgundy and beige are a bit warmer. It's hard to tell though.

text:Does anyone else have “irony pieces”?	labels:Unfortunately, my entire wardrobe as a construction worker.  I'm a construction superintendent, so I wear the same thing every day. Boils down to a thermal layer, hiking pants, a quarter zip fleece, a heated jacket, work boots, a vest, and a hard hat  After a couple years, I'm so used to wearing actually practical clothes that I'm annoyed to wear heels or deal with shitty pockets or worry about a skirt flying up.

text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:I regularly look like a time traveling medieval witch. My wardrobe includes modernized kirtles, stays and petticoats. So yeah.  I got started long long ago when I was a historical costumer who decided that I really liked the way my medieval gear looked for everyday wear. Plus it's pretty practical for a cold winter. I make most of my historybounding gear still though I'll pick up anything that I find randomly that I think I can reuse.   People around me rarely react to my outfits. Occasionally I'll get compliments on them but I can full on wear a late Victorian walking skirt in public and nobody notices that it's a Victorian walking skirt. They do notice the pretty embroidery and I get comments on that. This trick relies on having a fairly modern silhouette for most of my stuff though. No obvious bustles and corsets. Mix in the occasional modern style clothing and it just sort of blends into people thinking I have a quirky fashion sense.  I have never felt a desire to hand sew underwear for a guinea pig. I'm honestly not the biggest Bernadette Banner fan girl. She's cool enough but she rarely goes into enough detail for me to replicate her techniques. There are other youtubers I like better for showing off how to do stuff in more detail.   I currently working on a piece that's inspired by Victorian depictions of medieval witches that's almost finished though. Next up is going to be a dress that's kinda sorta based on a Roman stola but with elastic cord involved.	episode_done:True

My job was sorting through an actual mountain of scrubs in the basement of the hospital. So I spent around 100 hours seeing/feeling/folding almost every brand of scrubs you can imagine.   I agree that Figs are probably the top brand for scrubs. But I also want to plug a brand that I think did a great job on making more fashionable cuts/colors/styles: Med Couture. They have a lot of options for cut, and the fabric was softer than most of the other scrubs that I sorted (all had been laundered several times in industrial machines).	episode_done:True

text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Some websites (department stores, ASOS) have a true fit tool where you put in your measurements, body type, and well fitting item of clothing and that information is used to recommend sizing.   It’s also a good idea to know your measurements in general if you’re buying secondhand as many sellers will list the measurements of the garment.  But overall sizing can be so wild within one brand, much less across multiple that I dint think there’s much of a rule of thumb.
text:Oh, ASOS can do that? Wow, amazing. I'll definitely be shopping there. I have all my measurements good to go.	labels:They also have a TALL section. I have a very rectangular body, bog shoulders and chest and am 5’9” and get most of my clothing from them. As others have said, great return policy but the videos of the models wearing the clothes is the best bit. You see them move and how long they are.

Some things that are really impacted by quality are: Shoe glue/soles, leather, coat lining, anything with wool or raw/natural fibers, hardware like zippers, detailing, straps.  Construction/craftsmanship is king/queen, bad/lack of stitching, thin liners, stiff scratchy wool, etc will make or break something. Look for brands or websites that give you macro shots of the stitching, seams, material, that way you can make an informed decision.  Many sellers will be willing to send you pictures if they think it will net them a sale.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 08, 2020	labels:Yesterday we had in here a brief discussion on the potential impending resurgence of square toes (niche designers -> celebs -\*> big designers -> fast fashion -> regular people).  (\*you are here). Lurkers gonna be *mad*.  Upon reflection it really highlighted to me how downright insane the discourse of 10-years-ago-MFA was. Taking the square toes as examples, we had all this "teaching material" about how they were wrong, unflattering and just an all around horrible idea. With the implication that the people who make and wear square toe shoes simply don't know what they are doing.  Yeah, right. The people running one of *the* most profitable and most competitive markets simply didn't know that square toes "don't flatter your foot". They needed randos on the internet to find that out. *Insane*.
text:I'll admit, I'm not gonna be mad, but I'm never gonna buy in. I dunno if they're the right terms, but the squared off corners are too brutalist and inelegant to me, and shoes with a formality level higher than a sneaker seem to need softness and elegance in my book.  That said, I think I've been less open-minded about shoes in general for a long time. I've got a laundry list of shoe/boots styles that I don't like but can't really articulate why.	labels:Footwear is probably where I’m most picky so I get the sentiment, it seems like it’s the easiest item of clothing to totally mess up. All that said the fact that only low end brands have been putting out(poorly designed) square toe shoes for the past couple decades now is probably a big reason why you have that perception, once you start seeing better designed versions of them it may change that opinion

text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:Am I the only one that doesn't see how the Teddy jacket would give off peaked in high school lettermen jacket vibes like all the lurkers that were clearly bullied by jocks are claiming?  Obviously it's inspired by letterman jackets, but removing the contrasting leather sleeves and not having a TGI Friday's wall's worth of shit stitched onto it completely changes the vibe. I don't know, maybe I just associate it more with rockstar because it's an SLP piece and Alex Turner was the first celebrity I saw a photo of wearing it.
text:The SLP Teddy is minimalist enough to not give off that vibe IMO. I do get that costume-y feel from some of the others I've seen though.  Context probably helps as well. In high school letterman jackets are usually just thrown on top of whatever else someone is wearing, whereas the rest of the SLP aesthetic doesn't align with what most high school jocks would wear.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Anyone else missing party clothes?	labels:Yes! I have like a whole drawer of what I consider to be my ‘ho’ clothes. Totally impractical for wearing out right now, but I miss doing a full face of makeup (including lipstick people could see!) and getting dressed up.  Honestly I don’t think trends move the same way with going out wear as it does in other areas of fashion. A body con dress or some fun short shorts are usually good for a couple years imo. However I’m definitely the first to admit my taste leans more towards trashy and loud than special event most times, it also gets worn to rocky horror showings pretty regularly so that’s my kinda vibe lol.   I did buy a couple of pieces at the beginning of this when I thought it would just be a few months, but since then not really. It’s been more about comfy casual since that’s what my weekend look like now.
text:Haha to be fair mine are mostly “ho” clothes too, I guess college “special events” for me have mostly been big themed parties.

text:How to build an age-suitable varied chic wardrobe?	labels:I am a lot older (in my 30s) but in grad school and a lot of grad students also dress in athleisure. I also want to not draw too much attention so here are some of the things I do to dress down: 1. White trainers (Veja) with an otherwise dressy outfit, instead of black leather shoes 2. Pairing formal button-down with ripped or faded denim (more casual) 3. Wear loose outerwear (flowy) rather than a tailored coat or jacket 4. Add some pattern even if it’s basic like stripes, dots, plaid  5. Wear slightly cropped length pants, slightly cropped tops and sweaters with high waisted pants  6. Drop sleeves make everything look casual  7. French tuck / half tuck is more casual than a fully tucked in top  8. I’ve been wearing a lot less makeup since I’ve gone back to school - concealer, blush and mascara is a more youthful combo than eyeshadow, eyeliner, lipstick	episode_done:True

text:For those who define their style as "classic-traditional" (tailored, fitted, matching, sleek), what are your typical outfits for work, on the weekends, date-night, running errands or lounging around?	labels:I’ve pretty much been something along the lines of modern preppy, though I am incorporating more things as I get older (I am early 40s). I wear a lot of dresses and skirts. Weekend and workdays.   My offices have been casual for around a decade now, so work wardrobe has merged with weekend.  I tend to be more dressed up than my peers.   In the old days my weekend looks were basically less structured versions of my work looks. So instead of a pencil skirt I’d wear a stretchy tube skirt that functioned like a pencil skirt with more ease. If I wore jeans, I paired it with a blouse and cardigan depending on the weather.   Now I am kinda in hiatus from pencil skirts and that shape altogether. But the same idea applies, add a casual element.    I’ll wear a work friendly skirt on the weekend with a tee shirt, probably a graphic on.  Or a more casual tank top. Today I have on straight jeans and a floral blouse. I like t-shirt dresses, and will pair them with a nicer third piece: cardigan, bomber, or maybe a blazer. I love things like a jersey jumpsuit. Or a knit one.  It has a lot of ease and drape and adds a bit of polish. My “weekend” dresses are the same shapes as the work version, but with a casual fabric. Maybe that means a cotton shirt dress instead of a more structured one.   I wear a lot of flats but have also been embracing Birkenstock’s for some outfits.    My weekend purses still have a bit of structure, because that is my preference.   And to keep my outfits kosher for my casual workplace, I always pair something dressy with something casual. And that is a good rule for weekends too.	episode_done:True

text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:Why would it be tonedeaf? This is kind of a U.S.-centric view. Not everyone in the world is still struggling with COVID, and a lot of the rest of the world isn't nearly as casual as America is, fashion-wise.   Call me crazy, but I'm tired of shapeless billowy clothing in earth tones, and I am READY for some structure and interesting textures. All summer has been about beige and washed out green and brown linen, let's see something else.   Plus, it's a weird take anyway, because high fashion doesn't really target loungewear, either way. Do we really expect major fashion houses to all abandon blazers and leather pants and start showing PJs and sweatpants on the runway?   Others have already pointed out that these collections have been designed months in advance, but consider another point - fashion has always been reactive. When forced to stay inside and only wear sweatpants for 6 months, people will rebel and start daydreaming and longing for the opposite. This pandemic was always going to inspire a sort of glam rock aesthetic, imo. BRING IT.

The top I think would look really fun layered over a form fitting tube dress and then paired with some flat trainers.   The jacket would elevate anything for sure, byut what's stopping you just trying on a load of outfits you have and testing them out in the mirror? Have a fashion show!	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:I like a fitted piece with a looser piece. Two looser pieces look sloppy and too many fitted pieces look try hard to me. So slim trousers or skirt with a looser fitting top for example.   I like to mix stripes with patterns in similar colours and fabrics.   I wear sundresses with Sandshoes in coordinating colours all the time in summer. I am trying not to surrender to the need for little coordinated cardigans with using a nice denim jacket I’ve had for years.   In winter I love capes and wraps over either dresses or trousers. I don’t love jerseys and sweaters as the weather here changes all the time.	episode_done:True
text:Inspo Album: Pulling the Past Forward, Asian-style	labels:Those are some absolute beautiful designs in the album, thank you for exposing (some of us aka me) to new designers. That Mona Lisa Batik jumpsuit & those Dharma wrap pants are tdf. I'm also loving the silk scarf recommendations. I'm keeping Onlewo in mind cause my sister likes silk scarves  If you don't mind can I cross post this to ffacj_discussion?
text:Absolutely, go for it!	labels:Awesome, thank you! Great album and again thank you for sharing! I think the comments here did a fantastic job of also giving recommendations and introducing this sub (and me) to new designers.   I have to say I am really, really drawn to that Batik jumpsuit and like you they aren’t my thing.	episode_done:True
text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:I love love the concept of "Capsule wardrobes". Maybe other people find it restricting but I find it liberating. I get easily overwhelmed with too many choices (I also tend to feel guilty when I see a piece I haven't worn for a long time like I wasted my money and that it is harmful for the environment). I have put an effort in buying less but buying a quality piece (for the environment ya know) so all I need is 20 pieces of clothing.  I usually include a couple of trendy pieces. a leather jacket. a fur jacket. a nice tan color wool jacket. another beige wool jacket. 2-3 high-waisted trouser/tailored-pants. 1 denim jean. 1 white blouse. Sometimes I include dresses and skirts depend on the season. I usually don't include skirts and dresses though because they are not as versatile but I tend to keep a beige silk wrap skirt.  Since I own less, I am able to care for each item more. Each piece is very loved.	episode_done:True
text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:I have a couple pairs of pants that look like trousers/dress pants but they have a good amount of stretch in the weave and the elastic waistband doesn't show on the outside. My favorite pair is from Kohl's, but another good pair is from Lane Bryant. You could also try for a retro look with wide legs, pleats, etc if that's more comfortable through the leg.	episode_done:True
text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:It's totally dependent on the environment you live/work. 5 years ago I was dripping in "minimal streetwear" but now I wear suits every single day. Shit, I still have a closet full of Common Projects, W+H, etc. but I feel weird wearing that stuff even on my days off.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:Former goth/emo kid as well. Emo kid in high school, then clubwear/raver in college, with periods of normal and/or prep mixed in.   My aesthetic now is lagenlook/witchy/cozy. Nowadays I pay a lot more attention to quality and fabrics/materials. Having more disposable income I’d rather spend money on quality fabrics such as linen, genuine leather and sterling silver rather than polyester and fake leather etc. Comfort is also a much bigger factor as any uncomfortable garments never get worn. I haven’t worn heels in years. I stopped styling my hair and instead switched to hats. Makeup has slowly phased out except for special occasions. Color palette now leans towards earthy tones when they used to be loud and/or all black. I’ve been working from home full time for years, so basically my wardrobe has shifted from ‘meant to be seen’ to ‘cute but also suitable for going about my day without anything riding up/pinching/etc.”   I also shop with a lot more intention now too. Before I would just pick out tons of whatever I thought was cheap and cute. Now everything I bring into my wardrobe undergoes a LOT of scrutiny before I buy it, even if it’s cheap.	episode_done:True

text:>Damn here in Canada they can be $30+  dam....  i kept looking at the site thinking to myself, "no way it can be that much for 1 pair, how many comes in a bundle?" but did not see such thing lol	labels:When I switched to darn tough I did it gradually. Their sucks are tougher wearing so last longer than what I had been wearing before. Plus any time they wear out you just return them for another pair. Eventually my socks were all darn tough. And if you want very thick socks, look at the hiking section, that tends to have the most heavily cushioned options.	episode_done:True

Basing a whole wardrobe around one color - not just choosing an accent color for a neutral capsule?	labels:I think I sort of have one (raspberry).

text:What's the greatest length you've gone to obtain a much coveted fashion item?	labels:When I was in middle school, I saw a sweater on a fashionable outfits Twitter page. I reverse googled the image to find it came from a shop in the UK (I’m in the US). Forgot about conversion and I ended up paying over $60 just for the sweater, not including shipping. My parents were so angry I spent all the money I had on one single clothing item but I still have the sweater about 10 years later and it continues to be a staple item

text:Wish we could just ban people for this shit  Any conversation around "you have to be attractive/tall/skinny to pull this off", when taken to its logical conclusion, is just people saying that people that don't fit Western beauty standards look objectively bad *at all times* regardless of what they're wearing or doing  Like I've seen people say that if you're short or if you're overweight you can't wear "x", but the "x" is basically everything, and they never seem to reach the point where they admit that they just think that the best certain people can hope for is inoffensive or unnoticeable, which disgusts me	labels:I've talked about this before but a lot of these "rules" that people talk about like "don't wear $thing if you're $characteristic" have to main parts to it:  1. They're always about *not* doing something 2. They're always about a stereo-typically "negative" characteristic  > *Don't* wear $thing, if you're *$negative-characteristic*  You never hear the opposite, for any characteristic "positive" or "negative". It's always restrictive.  > Wear $thing if you're *$characteristic*

text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:Oh man I frickin love hats. I feel like I see beanies all the time (doubt these will ever go out of style completely), and berets become popular every few years. Sun hats are kinda like beanies, I think they’re always in for the summer.   I wear beanies all the time in fall/winter and have quite the collection. I recently have gotten into berets. In the summer I have a few caps, but I don’t wear them as often as I do my beanies.   Personally, I keep my hats on everywhere. No one needs to see my hat hair.	episode_done:True
text:Are there any actual fashion trends in 2020?	labels:we must be living on different planets.   lingerie as camisoles, fur trim everything, distressed tops, denim skirts, sweater vests, low rise pants, straight leg replacing skinny jeans, patchwork jeans, patterned tights, flared leggings, corset tops, fur lined boots, super tall platform shoes, juicy tracksuits, animal prints, tie dye, hand and leg warmers, fluffy bags, all were super popular trends last year. this has been the most trend heavy year in my memory, I could barely keep up.
text:Did you see this in real life? I’ve seen them on ig or youtube, but no one at the trader joes or coffee shop.	labels:well I wore a lot of these, so yes. I haven’t been to a lot of social gatherings this year for obvious reasons, but I have seen a whole lot of this stuff on my friends and on strangers when I have had the chance to go out.   and I don’t see why trends popping up mainly on instagram or youtube is a bad thing. during this year those have been the only real outlets for people to show off their outfits. the people posting on these sites are real people, and the brands selling those styles of clothes are making real sales.
text:I don’t think trends popping up on ig is a bad thing. I just wonder about the gap between practical real life wear vs social media. I see people wear more extreme things on social media that i seen irl.	labels:I think that’s true, but I don’t think any of the trends I mentioned are extreme. if you go on any fast fashion site you can find all of this stuff being sold.	episode_done:True

text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Honestly I think the best rules are the ones you come up with for yourself that suit you body best. Like for me, I only wear skirts or pants that are fitted to my waist, and my thighs are large(r) so I prefer straight cut jeans to skinny jeans to hide them. I think most people would come up with rules like “never wear 2 different plaids/ prints/ etc in one outfit!” But I do all the time because it’s fun for me	episode_done:True

And that was ok because that raw hem matched the raw hem on the flounce sleeves. I never got around to getting it fixed. And those extra 2 inches made it more versatile for biking and work. Most amazingly, this dress has worked as my size has gone up or down 2 sizes.  It goes in the dryer, it doesn’t wrinkle, and works equally well as a pool coverup and wedding guest attire. It is a magic dress.	episode_done:True

text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I have three or four distinct styles. Most of the time I like wearing dark, edgy punk-inspired clothes. However, I’m a style chameleon. If I need to be professional, I have a whole separate wardrobe of high-quality suiting. Take out my piercings, and I’ll have anyone fooled that that’s the realest me. In the summer and family gatherings I often wear more earthy boho and beachy surfer looks. Fashion is a great tool for self-expression, matching the mood, and setting the mood.
text:I'm convinced that there's something deeper than just boho styled, edgy, punk, professional styled etc. that we find ourselves liking, that creates our style.   Like music. There's something deeper than simply genre that makes me like a song. It's not genres that define my music taste. It's a combination of all my songs I like that creates my taste.	labels:My favorite songs blend two distinct genres together, like metal and synthwave (with a sprinkle of rap?!). And my style I can't have distinct very well, never straight up punk, never fully professional (I firmly believe I am a professional because I work professionally - they can take my badass spreadsheets and perfect grammar, but they will also get my dyed and shaved hair and eclectic clothing). I have to blend them because there's so much I want to express! Yes, I am punk/emo, glam, neon, normcore all at once. I was probably inspired by my early childhood fascination with Queen, and then Danger Days as an adult. Eclectic doesn't even begin to cover it!	episode_done:True

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I WFH permanently now, but when I worked in an office I wasn't able to escape dry-clean-only clothing; there are some things that just need to be dry cleaned. However, I used Dryel to great effect (awesome for things that aren't stained or stinky and don't really need to be pressed). I will also say, many many clothing items that say "dry clean only" can be washed either by hand, or in the machine on a delicate setting with wool wash or other gentle low-suds detergent. (My dry cleaner, of all people, actually advised me to start washing my cashmere sweaters rather than bringing them in for cleaning - she said dry cleaning dries out and breaks down the fibers and washing them at home would help them last longer. I am still wearing my cashmere sweaters and so far, she's been correct.) If something is very structured or has an acetate lining I never try to wash it, but I have washed other things that were poly blends or wool blends and were marked "dry clean only," and as long as you hang them up to dry, it works fine.

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.

text:General Discussion - January 10, 2021	labels:Out of curiosity what setups are you guys using to take and edit your fit pics? Phone in a mug? Professional camera? What focal length is your lens, are you using a tripod? Anything interesting you'd like to share?  I have a 23mm lens on a Fuji X-Pro1 (APS-C, so I believe 35mm equivalent) that I usually mount on a tripod with a 10sec timer & 6-frame burst-shot. It's time consuming to set up and get a good picture because the preview is tiny and there's no e.g. WiFi sharing so my alternative setup is a phone mount for the same tripod. Recently discovered I can get a live preview from my phone on my laptop so I've been using that to browse the pictures and check I've framed everything correctly etc.  I use the lightroom mobile app to crop and edit the photos. Basically every photo is cropped because I have to stand quite far back from the camera to get everything in without distortion.

text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:My thoughts are that everyone should wear whatever they hell they want, and nobody should feel like they *have* to wear something they don't enjoy, find uncomfortable, etc. Obviously it's not that "simple", but at the end of the day...it is. There's no magic pill you can take that will allow you to suddenly stop giving AF. It's a process of looking in the mirror, having those feelings, and then accepting that your body is the way it is and that is okay. Feeling bad about your body doesn't serve you in any way. It's not going to someday lead to you waking up with "perfect" tits if you just hate yours hard enough. All it does is make you feel bad. It's fine to have those thoughts, even the most confident and body positive people will have them. They don't need to dictate your behavior or impinge upon your happiness, though. It's a choice. It's a HARD choice, and it requires ongoing effort, but like many other things it becomes easier with practice.	episode_done:True
text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:obvious but i never throw items in a heap in my closet, especially not shoes. i think a lot of thrifted shoes have been abused by other pairs being stacked on them so the result is awful looking wear.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:Okay I am totally in the same spot as you. So tired of wearing grey, I want to rid my closet of the colour. The best solution and not to rid your whole closet is to buy colourful accessories or go to a consignment store and buy statement pieces to wear with your basic wardrobe that would be at discounted prices compared to online retail like Free People and Anthropologie  (I recommend not going to thrift stores because that's more basics typically). I also have a rule that if a t-shirt or any article of clothing hasn't been worn in the last 6 months its time to donate it, that's at least 2 seasons of wearing it not being utilized. As for up-cycling your own old clothes you can buy fun iron on patches that can be added on plain hoodies or t-shirts for a pop of colour much like the brands Comme de Garcons and Scotch and Soda.  You can also embroider shirt collars, or the pockets of jeans.	episode_done:True

That "shopping momentum effect" is big for me, I'll go weeks without buying a single thing and then I'll order from 5 online stores in 3 days.
text:Yep. This. I recently realized that my spending problem was extremely similar to the way Binge Eating works , and have been trying to do things in moderation (financial version of intuitive eating ) and it’s been working ! It’s frustrating though because a lot of people , my friends specifically, don’t realize how much of a problem it is , and mock me for not just “stop spending and use all your money to pay your debt” , the spending in moderation has been helping me pay off debt without accumulating more !	labels:This is super interesting to me because I’m in a unique financial situation. My husband and I paid off all debt except mortgage when we were 22 and 25. It was the crazy Dave Ramsey intense debt reduction on very small salaries (nonprofit work and jr enlisted military), but we paid off $35k in 20 months...and then we had to move and I lost my job. Things went from VERY tight (due to our priorities) to a little looser, but still no real money. Don’t think I bought new clothes except for running shoes, and a few bras in 2+ years. Now, fast forward another year+, I ended up going back to school and we are still living on one salary. Husband has been promoted so our budget is looser...and I have a hard time controlling my miscellaneous budget because I went through like a spending drought for SO long that every time I see a good deal on something, I’m like “Oh I should get that because idk when we might need it and not be able to afford it,” especially basics like jeans, bras, etc.  I’m worried for when I graduate in a few months and our income like quadruples. Ain’t no telling where that money is going to end up.
text:I can’t speak from experience with this, but according to a few people I know the book *I Will Teach You to Be Rich* by Ramit Sethi is really great if you have “enough” money but still have massive anxiety about how to spend it. I used to read this guy’s blog a million years ago and it was pretty different than most finance stuff—he was more about figuring out how to responsibly use money  in ways that made you happy, rather than, like, strict budgets and the evils of cc debt.

text:Is anyone into MBTI?

I like florals, colourful stripes and polka dots. I also wear other patterns if they are in a smaller scale. I prefer fitted/ cropped tops, with looser bottoms. So a typical outfit would be a cute top, mom jeans/ paperbag shorts and sneakers. In winter I'd also wear a cropped sweater/ wrap sweater (it's not cold where I live). Sometimes I wear dresses/ skirts, but it needs to be both comfortable and flattering. I only wear sneakers in every day situations, and when dressing up it's wedge sandals/ thick heeled booties. I walk uncomfortably in other types of shoes so I avoid them. Overall I might align with it? I wear cute things but nothing too crazy	episode_done:True

If it doesn’t work with just my regular underclothing (except for choosing nude underclothing for light pieces) I won’t buy it - I just know by now I’m not going to make the effort to wear it when I could just put on something easier that I like just as much.

How woefully unprepared they are for this entirely predictable coup is baffling to me.
text:I’ll be honest I just think it’s really funny that the right is probably going to tout this as some giant win lol.  Like, the capitol building is not that difficult to get into and apparently the only people present were DC metro police; which are basically just glorified mall cops. Not to mention the venn diagram of cops and trump supporters is pretty close to a circle so I doubt anyone had much of a vested interest in stopping them.

(If you do order one of their long sleeve tops, size up...My first order I got my usual size and wow that was a mistake! Lol) they don't have a great amount of colors unfortunately...  NAADAM is also a great place to get cashmere. They're ethical/sustainable and pretty reasonably priced for cashmere items. I have about 5 of their $75 cashmere sweaters and one that is $125. Totally cute, warm, and comfortable! Lots of colors to choose from as well!  I also have quite a few long sleeve tops from Target...I am trying not to buy A New Day long sleeve fitted tops ($10)..but they're pretty decent for the price. Fun colors also.	episode_done:True

text:Guidance organizing a suit for my fiancé for his father's funeral during lockdown	labels:In this case, you're not going to be able to find an exact match for the jacket fabric to turn it into a suit, so we're looking at a somber odd jacket w/trousers look.  To keep things somber, a dark, muted, monochrome palette would be my choice. I'd recommend a white shirt, dark matte grey tie with minimal pattern (could be a grey Glen check if you can find that).   For trousers, I'd avoid navy since it doesn't work that well as an odd trouser colour. Go with a pair of grey trousers a shade or two distinctly darker or lighter. Try a pair of charcoal or mid-grey wool flannel trousers, and pair that with black shoes. He'll get a ton of use out of those trousers in the future since they'll go with almost any kind of jacket as a blank slate. The jacket should be ok — any shininess will contrast with the flannel trousers, but that's actually what you're looking for with an odd jacket/trouser combo.   I applaud you for thinking and planning in advance for him; you seem like a great fiancée.

Currently I'm rocking my natural colour (brunette) with fluorescent pink tips.  I typically wear a wardrobe of black/grey/white, so my many hair colours never really clashed.  These days, I've opened up myself to a few new colours (green and burgundy mostly), and I like the contrast they give with my tips.

text:What high quality fashion or style related hashtags do you follow on IG?	labels:One that I like is #averagegirlsize to keep my Instagram feed somewhat grounded to reality.

My favorite is #zimmerman.
text:Thank you!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Where do you get good quality, legit wool sweaters that won't rip/shrink after washing?	labels:Here in NZ we have fine spun Merino wool jerseys (as we call them) that can be machine washed without shrinking. Reason being that the wool is pre- shrunk at the plant before they knit them up.  I went on a tour of a plant some years ago and it was super interesting.   anyway having said that i always hand wash my wool jerseys.   The thing that shrinks them in the machine, or if washed wrong is not the hot water but the agitation . This stretches the fibres out and then they bounce back even tighter, if that makes sense.   So even when hand washing you don't want to agitate or rough them up much, just soak, then squeeze gently.  No spin drying natch.    i did find a merino fine wool jumper on ASOS a while ago, it was mens but a pretty coral pink.	episode_done:True

text:This is unhelpfully reductive and doesn't really address the issue in a way that makes sense. Down vs. synthetic is a tradeoff based on use cases, not a simple matter of one being better for everything.	labels:If one wants to make an ethical argument, thats up to them.  But down in a parka that has a waterproof shell is never going to lose against synthetic. Especially down which has been treated to not absorb humidity.   In sleeping bags, or for technical layers, there are more tradeoffs. But the OP already put themselves into the bucket of style/weight where Down is going to win across the board.   Synthetic can win on price (and get close to matching other considerations). But not $600 synthetic.	episode_done:True

text:The joy of cordovan—and how to wear and maintain it	labels:Cordovan is an Instagram dream - it’s lustrous and has a ton of color depth. Unfortunately I find  actually wearing it is a different story. It’s extremely stiff and inflexible, especially during the first 20-30 wears. It’s the coldest leather I’ve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I’ve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I’m glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there’s no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.
text:I have maybe 25 pair of shell shoes from different makers & wouldn't call any of them stiff or inflexible. Never had an issue with spotting, but I do agree I don't like to wear them in hot weather.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:Hi! As a stylist I get this question ALOT. For starters don't get rid of too much before buying replacements. What ends up happening is we get rid of everything without establishing what pieces we actually need.   Start with establishing your personal style. What do your want your closet/style to be? What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping! Now that you have a moodboard and list of things you need you can shop to fin in the gaps and more importantly you can shop with intention!   &#x200B;  I hope that wasn't too much and was helpful haha. I'm always happy to help.
text:That's actually really helpful! How do you suggest finding my style? I feel like I have such a wide style that I wear (minimal, to punk, to cutesy, etc). I feel like I love all of my clothes but some go months without being worn.	labels:A more direct answer to your question, and something that may help you cull your closet, is through a lot of self reflection and analysis.   Personal style exists at the intersection of life function and self expression. Clothing is the way you define yourself to the world, but is also integral in how well you function in that world. What purposes do you need your clothing to fulfill— do you need to have good pockets? Easy movement? Hypoallergenic fabrics? Do you have a work uniform? What do you want your clothing to say about yourself to others?   Of the things in your closet right now, what do you love? Why do you love it? Is it the texture of the fabric? The construction? Certain stylistic elements? The way it fits you? Get really specific, put it on and think about the fact that you’re wearing it as you’re going about your day and how you feel in it and why.    Keep going: What do you wear all the time? Why do you wear it all the time over other things? What do you hate? Why do you hate it? What do you never wear? Why not? What clothing do you hate but wear all the time or love but never wear and why? Spend a lot of time on these questions because they’ll help you put the language to your needs and wants. When you have some answers, then you can start searching for trends amongst the things you love and the things you hate, and learning the details of clothing and construction that will best help you hone in on what you like. Review fabric composition; find your color trends; learn the names of structural elements that you see in several garments you love or hate; this will all help you seek out or avoid those better in the future.   Once you have some of those answers you can pointedly look for pieces to replace those that you hate but wear all the time with ones you love that align better with your needs or preferences, and you can cull accordingly.   Developing personal style is a journey and one in which there are no wrong answers. Your clothing should serve your wants and your needs.	episode_done:True

text:This an opinion that can easily be applied to every way to dress, but I feel like most people don't do athleisure well or interestingly. I don't expect it from an average joe but influencers need to do more than logos and prints.   What I like most about the basics of MFA is that you don't need to be a model to look good in clothes.

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I’m queer and get read as straight a lot, so clothing is a tool, albeit one I don’t always feel comfortable using.  The other thing for me is that I sometimes feel like my body is incompatible with queer fashion? I’m pretty fortunate to have a relatively “desirable” body, but I’m short and top-heavy, so I feel like the androgynous queer outfits I like are meant for people much more willowy than I am, the femme-er stuff is more feminine than I feel comfortable with, and the more masc stuff is too masc for me. So I default to just whatever I have that I like, which tends to read as straight, if not quite conventionally feminine and sort of sweater-heavy. And when I’ve leaned into what feels like queer fashion to me, other people tend not to read it that way.  Anyways this was kind of long but to actually answer your questions:  1) Yes I do, though at this point mostly in the form of jewelry and more recently hair 2) Sometimes it means signaling and sometimes it means wearing clothes that (joyously?)  reflect your authentic self even in defiance of cultural norms. I would probably be better off if I figured out which definition I want to define myself with  3) IMO sometimes the stereotypes are a way to signal because the media denies us representation and sometimes they exist because of the representation the media gives us. For people my age (20s) I think it’s more the latter  4) I always feel pressure to present gayer. I think impostor syndrome is common in minority groups and when the thing that makes you different isn’t immediately visible, it’s natural to want to either bury it or lean in and use it as a shield or a signal. I haven’t figured out what that means for me in practice, but the urge is there.	episode_done:True

text:Advice needed - Nordstroms Out of Stock items	labels:Have you called a store near you? With Nordstrom specifically, your best bet is to get ahold of a sales rep and pray that they'll want to help you. They can do a stock search and see if there are any units left in the company (aka did someone return it?) that can be shipped from the store to you. You'd probably have to call periodically to check.  If it's something super hype, like the latest Supreme shirt, you're SOL and would have better luck buying it after-market at a higher price than retail.  Calling and having someone ship something to you from a store doesn't work for every company - Sephora won't do it and I don't think most fast fashion places will either. Your chances of getting a sold out item go up if you have an established relationship with a sales associate.
text:I have some experience with this. when I worked at Macy's, our stock search was more accurate than the website. if you don't have a relationship with a specific associate, calling at an off-time (meaning not Friday night or Saturday, weekdays are a safe bet) is the way to go.   Banana Republic's website was more accurate than the stock search ~4 years ago, don't know if that's changed. they're willing to ship from a store, their infrastructure just isn't as good as a department store's. don't bother with Forever 21-type stores, but mall stores are worth a shot. I remember J. Crew being ok about this.  smaller stores/sites are generally good about this. Tuckernuck and Emerson Fry let you sign up to be notified when something goes back in stock (usually from a return). also, you can generally find out about restocks from smaller brands' social media.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Kibbe System and Body Inclusivity	labels:First of all, the Kibbe system is too dated to work - if you look at the suggestions for clothes to know what they are talking about, they usually involve dated styles. And the types I fell into the most - gamine and theatrical romantic - featured images of women who were heavily styled, whilst writing about those features as if though they hadn't been altered in any way. Didn't help that said women were from the 50's and most of the photos weren't even colored.  It is also sexist, but in a weird way. Like, if you look taller than you are or have long arms and legs with a short torso, then you are automatically 'masculine' - the opposite is also true, that stockier women are considered feminine (?). It's categorization is usually wrong.   I could go into the descriptions of the types I fell into, but I won't - they made me angry in their weird, smotheringly obsessive way, of describing traits, as if though you were a perfect fairy tale character in a book written by an incel.   This all combined with the fact that the people who take these tests are usually clueless about style, means that they will probably end up either confused or use a very limited way of expressing themselves. And so it appears with those who write about Kibbe in the first place - it's the blind leading the blind.   It's like those apple, pear, hourglass, thing yet again. They sound like all of them safe for hourglass, are freaks of nature, whose exaggerated proportion frighten everyone unless they are covered up. Only Kibbe takes the opposite position, where slight variation in how you are built, must be exaggerated hugely, yet again in the name of being harmonious.   It just doesn't work that way - almost nobody has this thing, where their face and body fit together in 'type', or at least I sure as hell don't.

text:General Discussion - October 27	labels:I think early MFA and the attendant blogosphere it spawned / belonged to / helped popularise is partially to blame for the whole "timeless" nonsense.  We've come a long way from "well dressed men wear suits" to "actually shirts and blazers can be dressed down" to "actually you can wear what you want and look good", and maybe the whole "timeless", "dapper", "classic", "gentleman" thing was a necessary part of the journey, but... would it just fucking die please.
text:I think people maybe forget what the culture was here a long time ago. Runway looks were *never* talked about. OCBDs literally were the height of fashion.   *Timelessness* was also very much a product of the post-recession mindset and attributing it to MFA seems a bit grandiose.	labels:> I think people maybe forget what the culture was here a long time ago. Runway looks were never talked about. OCBDs literally were the height of fashion.   As I recall it it was just a lot of noobs helping other noobs and trying to bootstrap an understanding of fashion out of that. Actually worked reasonably well for what it was, but the results were sometimes terribly myopic. I think it's better now.  > Timelessness was also very much a product of the post-recession mindset and attributing it to MFA seems a bit grandiose.  Yeah I wasn't sure about "spawned" -- "belonged to" seems definitely right, though. But many of the blogs really pushing for #menswear (DAE spezzatura) seemed to be posted here a lot and gained a lot of their community following from here. Can't really say how much MFA just sat within this zeitgeist and how much it helped shape and propagate it.

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:I have a diploma in fashion design and worked in the industry off and on for 15 years, and have been a hobby knitter for about 20 years, I would say creating something that looks store bought takes far fewer hours of practice, and there's far less to know with knitting.  Knitting is just so much more rudimentary.  Once you learn the basic stitches and get a decent tension, you are pretty much on your way, if you are patient and can follow basic instructions like a recipe, you'll make something good.  Be thorough, swatch and block, and buy good yarn.  I think one if the biggest issues I see with home sewists is incorrect fabric choice, it makes a very big difference in a finished product, and is usually my first tip that something is homemade.  Notions are another big one, good quality, professional looking notions are a lot harder to find in retail stores.  Stitch choices, stitch quality, proper cutting, finishing methods are also all big giveaways that make stuff look unprofessional, and unless you have industrial machines and tools, some of that is out of your control.  But with enough practice you can get some pretty decent homemade products in a lot of clothing categories.  Stuff like jeans, leather, fur, swimwear, I think are always best left to professionals with specialized tools.  Reading up on fabrics and practicing high end finishing techniques is a good start.	episode_done:True
text:Andrew Marc New York Leather Jackets -- exploring the different "grades" of this brand	labels:Most current Andrew Marc outerwear is coming out of a licensing company called GIII. They handle outerwear for labels like Cole Haan, Karl Lagerfeld, Levi’s, Tommy, and quite a few others. The quality is going to be low to medium at best.   I wouldn’t pay much for it.
text:THANK YOU! This is precisely the kind of info I'm interested in.  When I look at the quality of recently made Andrew Marc... I'm underwhelmed. Then go to their site and see. They'll have garments with a so-called MSRP of "$695" with a discounted price then a promo price reducing it to $295". So really, that original price tag is nonsense and not indicative of that level of quality.	labels:All of this should have been the first sign that it's garbage.
text:And your comment helps... how?  This article is focused on the vintage Andrew Marc. Have you owned one? The leather is terrific quality for the price, if you know which style releases to look for. The fact that recent production is a notable drop in quality means you can find "gems" in older releases.

text:Tucking in shirts	labels:Start with the French tuck!  Just tuck in a little of the front of your shirt to get used to it, then work towards the tuck you want.  I’m just getting comfortable with the full tuck now.
text:Everytime I try the french tuck, it doesn't look intentional, but it looks like I accidentally tucked my shirt in when I went to the bathroom or something. I don't know if it is my body shape or what but I feel like it always looks sloppy on me, even when I spend ten minutes in front of the mirror trying to master it.	labels:This! I feel the same exact way as you! Any type of tucking makes me feel even more short waisted, sloppy, and awkward. I have a really short torso/waist and bigger breasts, which seems to be the opposite body type made for tucking haha

text:What are your favourite ways to style a black leather moto jacket?	labels:People have already covered the dresses, but the dress/leather jacket combo is for sure one of my favorite ways to style them. If there's enough room in the sleeves/body, i sometimes layer a hoodie underneath during colder weather for a more skater girl type of look. I love wearing it with a white top, light wash jeans, and my black leather combat boots (for me, doc martens but could be any boot with a similar color/texture to the jacket) bc i feel like a rocker from the 80s.

text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I’m Op but I’ll share mine -  At around 14 I had a quick phase of really liking the very early sort of e- kid bright and trendy fashion. Hot topic forever 21 sort of edgy stuff. Skinny jeans only. Small wardrobe. Didn’t look great and got bullied a little for my new look. Lowkey wanted to look like a gorillaz character. Still kinda do though lol.  Then there was a transitional trendy masculine street wear phase from when I was late 14 to late 15 . I only really wore ripped jeans, graphic tees , always a belt , with vans or converse that matched the shirt. I started getting of compliments on my style from peers.  I then had an art kid style phase late 15 - 16 years old . Very similar to before but I started adding different style jackets and pants. This was an important phase because I started adding different accessories like print socks and hair stuff.   Really quick 90’s inspired phase. I tried dressing like 90’s Britpop singers lol. A small step back I’d say.   Late 16 to current ( I’m seventeen ) changed my style over quarantaine . Asking questions here changed everything. I realized how much I loved my more dressy clothes and fell in love with the l’ecole des femmes clothes. I stopped following trends and went for mature more romantic and currently Victorian styles. Man repeller slightly masculine inspiration too. I wear skirts, tights , blazers, dresses, hats, neck scarves and blouses now. I also sold my years worth of converse and vans to buy oxfords and heeled dress shoes. Though my peers understand it a little less I have never been happier. Very confident in my style currently.    [Quick note - It may seem crazy to change my style so quickly but when your young you tend to go through clothes more quickly as you grow and teens tend to be more rough on clothes ]   Thank you for reading : )
text:>I also sold my years worth of converse and vans to buy oxfords and heeled dress shoes.  Without sounding like I'm generalising, I really admire this! It's probably not common for that age group but IMO it's a great move towards the current style you speak of, not to mention quite sophisticated.  Are you a fan of the brogue style?

I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

In case we have a tornado and have to go to the basement for shelter and our house gets obliterated I want a bag of essentials so we can be mildly clean. I mainly focus on underclothes and always a pair of sneakers. The idea of navigating a disaster in flip flops or anything but sneakers sounds awful to me. I try and throw clothes in that can be worn in public or around the house, so nothing too ratty. I'd also suggest a pair of work gloves in case you have to handle anything. I guess I'm not sure how life works during a fire disaster. Is it like a  tornado where if you get flattened then you're focusing on clean up? What about work? If you have work clothes consider packing an outfit or two in case you have to go into work. I'm sorry you have this stress to deal with, how scary it all must be.

Get a large salad spinner and some gentle lingerie soap, put your really delicate stuff in with some warm water and detergent, spin a hand-full of times and let it soak for 5 mins, drain the water out and fill it with cold water, let it soak for 5, then spin, drain, refill, spin drain repeat till it comes out clear.

OP seems to be shopping at either crap brands like H&M or way overpriced/luxury brands, or she doesn’t know what sales are.

Edit: I did a quick search for women’s cotton sweaters at Nordstrom and they have many 100% cotton styles on sale in the $20-30 range...	labels:I can't remember if that is one of the brands that is made by forced labor (Uyghurs) in concentration camps (western China).

text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:No, I don’t think it’s tone deaf that fashion houses or designers are releasing collections that, like oconorris mentioned, were designed a year+ in advance.   As cities and *other* countries begin to re open people will begin to adapt to the new norm and resume their day to day activities so that will present more opportunities for them to go out and wear new clothes. I’m in America so don’t expect to relate any time soon lol  Having said that, there’s something for everyone. There’s quite a few brands that offer natural fibers, minimalistic looks, but no guarantee that greenwashing isn’t involved or that they aren’t treating their employees like shit.   The world doesn’t revolve around America so I’m not sure that more affordable brands will drop whatever collections they had designed for 6+ months just to adapt to whatever image people have in mind during this pandemic.
text:I do wonder about how fashion will acknowledge the recoveries of different countries.  Like Wuhan's throwing pool parties now, so--you know, it's a different vibe.  The fact that China also consumes a lot of luxury goods also complicates things; and I wonder if the Chinese consumer would be interested in some of the more drab utilitarian offerings I've seen trickling in.  On the whole, Chinese consumers don't exactly get excited about dropping big dollars on depression chic (and does anyone really?).	labels:I think, like when the discussion of size inclusivity in fashion houses comes up, they’ll cater to the rest of the world vs the US. If the fashion industry relied on Americans for trends and what works, they’d be SOL  FFA just needs to accept that they are not BV, Hermès, Gucci or Balenciagas target demographic. They are for people who don’t need to ask “how much?” and don’t flinch at the thought of dropping 4K on a leather jacket. Much of FFA is American, so...that explains a lot of this subs issue with life going on during and after this pandemic	episode_done:True

text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:Don’t forget to check out thrift stores. This is where I stock up on cashmere sweaters for a few dollars a piece, wool skirts, kilts, sweaters, vests, and cardigans, and amazing wool blazers and coats. I’ve found mint condition mohair and camel hair 3/4 coats for as low as $10, black cashmere sweaters for $2-3 and up, and cable knit pullovers for as low as $4. It’s amazing what people get rid of, not realizing how expensive it all is new. I also loooove wool in the fall and winter, and so this has been a super affordable way to build a dream cold-weather wardrobe.   The only thing wool I buy new are socks for the most part, everything else I’ve found at estate sales, garage sales, and thrift shops. When/if you go, definitely go through the boys and men’s departments, too. A bit of tailoring can make anything look custom like some of the pieces on Walker Slater maybe.
text:I have a Salvation Army thrift store near me that always has a great selection of brand names for the same price as everything else!

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting our 'Finding A Style and Building A Wardrobe' guide	labels:I think the fundamental advice of this guide holds true. The way to build a style and wardrobe that works for you is to pay attention to what you like, and try to explicitly recognize *why* you like it, and then try to incorporate those details in what you buy, and then try out those details yourself.   Where I think this guide falls a little short is where to find inspiration for all sorts of bodies, and how to use people who are built differently than you for inspiration. If you're a curvier or plus-sized person, how do you look at images of celebrities who are largely slim and use those for inspiration?	episode_done:True
text:Derek Guy: The Crown’s ‘Balmoral Test’ Barbours Are Not Just Jackets	labels:These scenes from The Crown made me think of a Barbour coat less as a piece of clothing, and more as a piece of equipment.

Good article thanks for posting	episode_done:True
text:Brands Want In on the Vintage Fashion Boom	labels:At least to me, the thing I love so much about shopping around at  vintage and thrift stores is that it feels so much less "corporate" than just going to a mall or ordering something off the internet. The more companies dip their hands into this area of fashion for profit's sake, the more life will be sucked out of it
text:I don't know, I know a lot of people who enjoy the process of going to vintage stores and never knowing what you're going to find. The clothing is also frequently significantly cheaper than it would be for you to purchase something of comparable quality new, and there's also the warm moral assurance that you are not contributing to the growing problem of fashion's unsustainable ecologic impact.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:Shoes and other accessories can be much cheaper to own and can completely change the vibe of an outfit. A different pair of shoes alone can take basically the same outfit from grandpa-core to vintage feminine to streetwear. For example I have pretty basic black cotton blend dress that I can wear with platform sneakers for a streetwear look, with flats or booties with pearl or diamond earrings for a "classy casual extra feminine" daytime look, and thigh high boots and berry lipstick for a "baddie" look on a night out.  Jewelry, makeup, and shoes are just fun easy ways to play with being someone else for a day without own multiple different sets of actual clothing. In my experience costume jewelry and second-hand or outlet retail shoes (like from places like TJ Maxx, Ross, Burlington, etc.) hold up much better for the lower prices than fast fashion fabrics do. So I like to get quality clothing and basic accessories, but then have cheaper more "out there" accessories/stuff for variety and experimental/trendy moments.  That ends up being way cheaper and more sustainable than buying a new top or skirt that will fall apart or be out of style in a year every time I want to feel different for a little bit. A change in hair and makeup is even cheaper and more sustainable because often you can use the same products, but just with different techniques/styles.	episode_done:True

text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:I was into fashion from the age of 11 — back then it was mostly just looking at magazines and doodling my own designs in the margins of my notebooks at school.  For me a big thing is definitely being able to highlight the things about myself I like, and — as cliche as it sounds — to express myself. I was never confident before I started dressing the way i LIKED (not the way everyone else did).  I’m a very short and petite girl and in my teens I struggled with not feeling feminine. Fashion was kind of an outlet, like roleplay! The first time I wore heels to school was transformational. I also enjoyed putting together outfits that are more ”masculine”, and juxtaposing feminine with masculine. I get kicks from matching little details, like lipstick and a purse. Fashion is just something that seems really trivial in the grand scheme of things but that actually has a bigger impact than we realize!	episode_done:True

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom didn’t care about fashion until she started watching What Not to Wear on tlc. Then she threw out all her embroidered sweatshirts and appliqué jeans and got some more stylish clothes. She maintained this for a few years and now that she’s in her late 60s, she wears what makes her happy- embroidered sweatshirts and appliqué jeans.   I don’t wish she taught me anything but I think if she kept a pulse on trends it would’ve saved me from some teasing in middle school. But, on the flip side, is it fun to fit in? Middle school sucks regardless.
text:What Not to Wear was a big help for me. It helped me see how things should fit together and flatter the figure you have.  My mother has serious issues and we never talked. She was very authoritarian and would not allow me to wear makeup at all through high school or wear anything other than baggy clothes. My sister showed some fashion sense and ended up mercilessly mocked and told how vain and shallow she was.  It would have been nice to have some kind of guidance, but that's not the person she was.	labels:I grew up with a mom with mental health issues. She still won't let anyone cut her hair, won't wear makeup and refuses to spend money on clothes, even if I've offered to pay for it. She made comments like, "Isn't my daughter pretty? She doesn't look anything like me." And she made me feel bad for taking care of myself. I think she wanted to be seen as attractive, but her mental illness won't allow her to admit that.I realized it was a set back pretty young. I even paid for "modeling classes" when I was 15 with the money I made working at a pizza place. I feel really lucky to have had shows like that and internet access to learn skills I didn't get from her.	episode_done:True

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.
text:I love this answer, and I think that’s also why certain looks on certain people end up looking so costume-y. If a look is not authentic to your life and to who you are, it’s not going to have the effect you’re hoping to achieve.  The notion of appreciating fashion without feeling compelled to wear it yourself also ties into the conversations around cultural appropriation. As beautiful as I find traditional attire from other countries and cultures, or as cool as the fashion is in many countercultures, I don’t NEED to wear those outfits on my own body to appreciate and enjoy them.	labels:	episode_done:True

If you do choose to buy I'd suggest 1-3 sizes bigger than yourself.   I've bought from them before and while I like the styles, I'm pretty bad at not destroying things so buy at your own risk.  Quality on par with Forever 21 which also manufactures based out of asia.	episode_done:True
text:Topman is now a part of ASOS	labels:I just received an email myself from ASOS stating that the Topman brand is being brought under their website. I also had a couple of Topman items I had my eye on, and their website has been replaced with the "part of ASOS" message.  Generally not a problem for me; I only made an order with Topman once and it was because I had some vouchers to heavily reduce the price. I only considered Topman items when they were in the sale anyways.  Since I shop semi-regularly at ASOS, this change won't affect me too much. I'm not concerned about the uality of ASOS products either; they seem fine enough for what I need. I'd rather have a good quality item at a sensible price, than an excellent quality item at a much higher price than what I could possibly afford.	episode_done:True

text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:Honestly I think you have to give way more detail on your old pair and what you’re looking for.  In my mind the biggest hurdle to perfect jeans is the fit, and since every body is different this is highly individual. Some people might prefer stretchier denim for a more forgiving fit, while others look for stiffer fabric, and have less leeway.   Personally I still struggle to find a high rise, non cropped, fits my thighs and waist, plain dark wash, straight/skinny, 90% or more cotton, pair of jeans. But hopefully I’ll find it eventually!
text:Have you tried Dear John jeans? I'd never heard of them before but got them in a wantable box recently. They're either 92 or 98% cotton, high rise, skinny, and flexible.

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:Several reasons:  It depends on who "you" is. Some people do wear runway-esque looks on the day to day (usually the same kinds of people who are really in to looking at runway shows). E: actually I don't think I made this point strongly enough: even for the weirdest, most abstract, least practical runway look you can think of there are people who are looking at it and thinking "that's dope, I want to look like that". People who are fans of that sort of thing aren't looking at them like paintings in a gallery, in many cases they really would dress like the runway looks if cost and practicality allowed.   Couture starts at like five figures, so it's a good guess that "you" can't afford it.  Runway shows are in part about image making, i.e. producing photos that will look cool on social media, or in trade magazines or coffee table books down the line. Sometimes this takes priority over displaying clothes you can actually buy, which is how you get things like Craig Green's sculptures, or Gucci's severed heads, or Thom Browne in general.   All of the looks on a runway will consist only of the clothes from the brand, for obvious reasons, which is not necessary how people wear the individual pieces IRL.	episode_done:True

text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:My advice is to notice what people around you are wearing.  Take notes!  Are you in school?  Glance around the classroom to get ideas.  Do you have a job?  Are your coworkers wearing mostly jeans, or something else?  You can balance that with what you see on pinterest.  I was in a similar boat in that my family was super poor growing up, so I just had to wear whatever was given to me.  It took me a while to figure out what to buy, I would end up in situations where everyone else would be dressed one way and I would be dressed another -- like, say, wearing jeans and a sweater while everyone else was in dressier attire.  It also helps to notice what you find yourself wearing a lot.  For example, if you start with two pairs of shoes, heels and sneakers, and you notice you wear your sneakers way more, then you've learned: you should own more sneakers than heels.	episode_done:True

The quality is excellent and holds up well through the wash. Plus, they let you preview and customize your box before it ships, which is great when you’re on a budget.

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:I moved from Seattle to the Midwest about a year ago and everything on my Christmas list was warm clothes because I kept being told how cold it gets. Thusfar they've had some of the mildest winters in years and NOW I am moving again to England where I have been told the weather is basically the same as Seattle. I definitely second what others have said about waiting until you need something to purchase. I am also glad I kept the clothes that I could wear freely in Seattle but get weird looks for in Nebraska for traversing the UK and Europe (post covid)	episode_done:True

That being said, I have a pretty hefty key chain, so I keep quite a few keychains on it (all of them are sentimental or associate with specific friends/family)  and I like using sturdier ones for distinguishing my luggage.	episode_done:True

I have a couple habanero plants on the go and one thai chilli. I made hot sauce this year out of the former (my attempt was lousy. the recipe I used resulted in apple cider vinegar being WAY too strong), and I shall continue next year! The Habanero plant is about 2 years old now and can result in winter peppers, so I highly recommend	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 16, 2020	labels:Every time I purchase dress shoes, they have lacing that is quite odd, and I am trying to figure out why they are that way. The lace comes out of the top right eyelet, but the other side does not come out of the top left eyelet (across from it) which is needed for tying the shoe. Instead, the second lace comes out of the bottom eyelet on the left side, meaning the a lace exits from top R and bottom L. This has happened with multiple pairs of shoes now, and I am wondering why the stores sell the shoes like this. Any ideas? Do I just re-lace? Is there a reason for this?

It's kind of a bummer being excited about clothes and not being able to talk about it. Makes me actually want to start posting pics on WAYWT.   Been slowly replacing my closet with a lot of Todd Snyder and don't know how to feel about it lol, always wanted a "cool designer" closet but from a cost and functionality stand point it's not very doable.

Went crazy on walmart camis so I could wear them under button downs and also go braless.  Got a bunch of portofino/express button downs because the fabric is flexible, they are very wrinkle proof, and it's comfy.	episode_done:True
text:NYT: The Very Right-Now Allure of Going to Extremes – Reviews of Rick Owens, Loewe, and Dries' SS21 Presentations	labels:I love this! Especially this quote from Dries van Noten  >“I think we need beauty, but not beauty that is nostalgic, that says the past was a better place. Beauty that gives you energy.”   That speaks pretty directly to how I’m trying to navigate fashion right now. I’m not exactly going out anywhere, but I try to wear clothes that make me really happy to be awake and doing things. And I’ve been consuming a lot of fashion media, history, shows, etc because some clothes—including a lot of these!—are so engaging even just over the screen.
text:Interesting. I’m exploring nostalgia to the nth degree this year. I love the past reimagined for today.

text:Excercises for personal style	labels:Friends helped me narrow my style over the years. The most important is knowing what Looks Good on you. I love many pieces that don't fit my body. Someone had to help me by pointing out things that look bad & good. I also dressed way too conservatively for my shape and situations. They had to help show me - it's ok:)   Now I'm confident in my choices and help others. A clue that you're on the right track is when people compliment what you are wearing- not just what it is but how the color/style suits  you. Or the way you put it together. Complimenting other people is not only a nice, decent thing to do, it's also a good way to get them talking about clothes/styles/etc.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have moved for extended periods of time on 1 or 2 suitcases only, how did you do it? Here's the beginning of my process	labels:I'm an Australian who moved over to the other side of the world to London in January, and I was only limited to a 30kg suitcase, a small cabin suitcase, and a backpack.   I'm not much of a minimalist person either, but I brought all my basic t-shirts, a few skincare products that I couldn't live without (I'm a skincare junkie, and my skin breaks the fuck out when I'm stressed so that was important to have for me), and I also brought my summer clothes over. Why? Because Australian winters are quite different to UK winters, and I didn't think my Australian winter clothes would hold up in a UK winter, and I figured that buying winter stuff in London would be better than buying winter clothes in Australia and bringing it over to the UK.  The UK isn't as cold as I expected, but I don't regret buying my winter stuff in London. If I was gonna blow my money on new clothes, I'd rather spend it on winter clothes than summer clothes, since the UK doesn't really have long summers.  I also brought a couple of shoes over: black heels, black flats, my Docs, one pair of fashion sneakers, and my running shoes. I ended up buying Chelsea boots in London for work, and a pair of sandals during summer.  Try to make sure your stuff is as versatile as possible when you first move, because chances are, you'll be too busy to shop in your first week of moving!
text:Shoes are one of my biggest problems because of space. So far I'm taking white sneakers, docs, point-toed booties and a pair of sandals. I'd travel in my docs for space and weight, but the other boots are just as heavy and I they're my favorite pair of shoes (too hard to put on and off for airport purposes).   I'm moving from 6months of winter to 8months of summer, so I won't have to have a huge division between summer and winter clothing. I'm finding hard to adapt the way I wear clothing with layering, color scheme, etc.	labels:	episode_done:True

They vetoed me posting pictures (we have public facing jobs, these pictures are all over social media, too easy to reverse image search etc.), but they wore a Rick Owens dress (that I picked out) while I went full minimalism with a collarless shirt with onyx studs, a sleek blazer and cropped trousers. I put this together from my existing wardrobe, since we didn't want to spend a lot. Covid measures made things a bit weird, but the court officer made a real effort into making it nice, which was great. (edit: just so nobody thinks we are totally irresponsible: it was literally just us at city hall, no guests, no party. We'll catch up with that after vaccination.)  It was fun seeing all y'all Americans count down to my wedding day.

text:Shitpost Saturday: Naughty or Nice?	labels:I am on Fashion Santa's **Nice** list this year! Even though I'm home all by myself and the only person who ever sees me is the Amazon delivery guy who I wait for by my window because *oh my god, I need human contact,* I'm still putting on a full face of makeup, doing my hair, and wearing spanx, a push-up bra, a sheath dress that fits like a second skin, 4" heels, and perfume.  I'm doing it for *me*, you know, because feeling sexy while I'm all by myself is much more important than being comfortable. Sure, it's easier to get coffee and cheeto stains out of my bathrobe than a 100% wool dress, but cheetos aren't sexy either.   For Christmas, Fashion Santa is going to bring me a brand new dress for every zoom event I have scheduled in 2021, because I would just die if people saw me wearing the same outfit week after week, which is definitely the kind of thing people are thinking about these days.

text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:Yes. I’m kind of somewhere between an hourglass and an inverted triangle shape, and only 5’4. So many outfits online have like 4 layers on top and then my shoulders look huge and it’s not cute. Or I look like a big blob because they billow out over my round hips/butt rather than draping all pretty like the stick thin girl I saw the look on online.   I wouldn’t say I have “solved” it but I’ve found a few ways to imitate the looks I like more successfully. Finding a slightly cropped version of a blazer or sweater I admire is helpful given my height, and also because I have hips and a round butt, long sweaters and blazers tend to look boxy and strange on me. I have also been learning about and experimenting with tucking shirts and sweaters a lot. Finally, minimizing layers or choosing blazers and sweaters that don’t have dropped shoulder seams helps keep my top half looking sleek. Unfortunately dropped shoulders seem to be all the rage everywhere I shop 🙄  I know you’re pear shaped so it’s different but I think you can look at the “vibe” of an outfit and imitate it in a way that suits your body. Mainly I try to look at a few outfits I’m drawn to, and figure out what elements they have in common or what it is that I’m liking. Maybe the colors, textures, silhouettes, etc. I like to save them on Pinterest and make note of what I want to find when I shop to pull those elements into my wardrobe.	episode_done:True

I find the primark slim fit muscle tee's for men to be actually pretty good, as in not noticeably masculine when I wear them, but then again I'm not the girliest of girls either so I don't mind wearing mens clothes, or mens watches for that matter	episode_done:True

Reported it to the DoL but I don't expect them to do anything about it.     In unrelated but equally bleak personal fashion news, In my search for some VERY obscure soviet-Czech trainers I accidentally stumbled across a sketchy forum of people selling battle-worn combat uniforms, complete with burns, bullet holes and blood stains. It's always fun to imagine you're living in a Blue Ant book until you actually start living in a blue ant book and life becomes very depressing! The first rule of the forum is you are not allowed to ask how these things were sourced.     Lastly the embroidery studio i work at was contacted for a large order of Rhodesian flag patches. I contacted the client to see if it was for a film or something and he was very cagey about their purpose, so I cancelled the order and refunded his deposit, which lead to me getting chewed out by my boss, who is apparently fine with making White Nationalist memorabilia if it's obscure enough to not get him in any trouble.

And yeah, the surface web is underrated as a truly vile place. This forum in particular I forwarded to bellingcat since it seems like there's probably several war criminals active on it. Your friend's dad is from Zimbabwe? or does he consider himself a "Rhodesian Expat"? If it's the latter, that's a pretty big red flag (even though a lot of white "Rhodesians" were genuinely not racist people and mere victims of circumstance and the extensive media blackout by Smith's government, anyone who identifies as a Rhodesian is sus to me). Rhodesia is an insane (and totally depressing) story, but yeah the Rhodesian flag has been rising in popularity over the last couple years as a white nationalist symbol, specifically because of its relative obscurity to the general public. I'm a conflict history/general history nerd and one of my obsessive hobbies is tracking right wing extremism around the world, which is the only reason I recognized it when the order came in.
text:Yeah he says he was born in Rhodesia rather than Zimbabwe but I’ve never heard him wax poetic about it or anything. Both of his parents are older white folks and grew up in apartheid era South Africa/“Rhodesia” so I wouldn’t be surprised if they were pretty questionable politics wise.

text:Future of fibers?	labels:Personally I don’t find it very difficult or expensive to shop for clothing made with natural fibers — if anything it’s gotten even easier to do so with online shopping and websites showing fiber content right in the product description. I don’t have to seek out brands that specialize in natural materials either — my clothing is mostly from Madewell, which doesn’t really market itself as being all that environmentally conscious or sustainable, and is definitely not a high end brand, but they have tons of options for clothing made of cotton, silk, etc.   I will say it’s gotten harder to find sweaters made of 100% wool over the years, however. I have several wool sweaters from mall brands that I bought just a few years ago. I gained some weight since then and have been looking for replacements from the same exact brands and it seems like they don’t even bother with 100% wool anymore, all of their sweaters are now made with acrylic, nylon, polyester, etc. That’s the only natural fiber that I feel has all but disappeared from the mainstream for some reason.   I will also add that I don’t think man made fibers are necessarily “cheap”, either. We’ve come a long way from man made materials of the 80s and 90s. When I think of man made fibers of today, I think of technical clothing and gear such as outdoor or sportswear. Patagonia for example is the poster child for environmentally friendly brands, but most of their clothing is made from man made materials, and their products are far from cheap. Partly because it performs better for its purpose, and partly because it’s supposed last a lifetime.  Which leads me to my last thought — IMO man made materials aren’t necessarily bad for the environment. It’s really our habits that are bad, and the industries that cater to these habits. If we all bought a few items of clothing that were all man made and lasted our lifetime, that is arguably *more* environmentally friendly than if we were constantly buying and throwing away natural fibered clothing.
text:I think there's a very good reason for 100% wool sweaters being harder to find: wool is a very weak fiber, difficult to care for, and itchy. Cutting it with other fibers makes clothing that is more wearable, increases longevity, and minimizes all those negatives.	labels:That makes sense. Unfortunately for me synthetic fabrics in non-technical clothing tend to make me incredibly sweaty. Wool works better at regulating my temperature while being breathable and moisture wicking.	episode_done:True

I get that fashion and fit are important no matter the body type of the wearer, but for people without a gut, a baggy midsection is a huge barrier and negative to actually having streamlined looks.	episode_done:True

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:Short of getting a bit of insider info, I think the only way to really have success at those stores is to browse them at least once a week (probably twice).  My aunt tends to go every other day and finds some amazing stuff…because she goes *every other day*.  She says it doesn’t take her long because she’s so familiar with their stock, but it still seems exhausting to me.  (As opposed to spending three hours scrolling through Poshmark in bed every night…)

text:How do you guys find your style if you can’t try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:I’ve been going through my closet and donating/selling everything to clear space for when I can get some new stuff to go with my style changes from 20’s to 30’s. I’m teaching college now, so I really need to change my style so the students stop mistaking me for a student.   I took advantage of Zara’s big end of year sale online and got three amazing new coats that needed replacement in my wardrobe to begin with. I can risk buying tops online because the sizing is usually correct, but for pants, dresses, skirts I’ll have to wait for the case count to go down. I’m in AZ, so like, they don’t really have precautions right now, but I’m limiting my going out to just selling stuff and leaving. Built up some huge store credits!  Edit: right, I’ve been trolling style blogs, insta, and pinterest for months to decide on my new style.	episode_done:True

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Had something similar happen, and let me just say - the first step is to find two or three good pants that you feel good in. For me, it was to leave behind shops like forever21 or New Look, and I started shopping at shops like Torrid. I know some people hate torrid, and some of their clothes are cheesey. But let me just say - they do the BEST jeans. I have bought them in size 10, 12, 14, and 16, and they fit and grow with me as my body changed and fluctuated, and then when I lost some weight, the smaller pairs still fit.      Just remember, you have to ignore the size on the rack, and instead go based on what feels good. Good, buttery jeans that make your butt look rocking are a huge confidence booster for me. Tops that hid the ladies which grew sort of uncontrollable after changing the pill also helped. Structured blazers with t-shirts and dark jeans = perfect office look for any size. Statement necklace or simple earrings always a bonus. However you are, as you said, you deserve clothes that fit, so get em, girl!	episode_done:True
text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:I don’t plan to save any. Sounds terrible but after the pressure I got from my mom and MIL to wear some of their own wedding stuff I am just going to live my life and let my kids live theirs. Sure they might miss out on some vintage stuff but there’s no guarantee that my stuff will become cool again, that my things won’t be damaged by mold, bugs, yellowing etc. in decades of storage, or that they will be the same size as me
text:Fair enough. With Asian weddings there are often multiple events and clothes are so expensive that no one in my family has gotten rid of them. Also, Pakistani clothes are pretty much always tailored so they're bespoke too. But this means that you can usually upcycle something and reuse it to suit new fashion which I get isn't as much of an option with Western wedding dresses.	labels:I had both an Asian and a Western wedding. Western dresses can be tailored too but it didn’t need much tailoring to fit me, I just didn’t like the styles or fabric at all. Super Shiny Satin TM was very in-in the late 80s😅
text:In my experience Asian clothes can be totally remade or at least the expensive neckline with beaded work for example can be reused, the lenghaa can be reused, the kameez can be altered to suit the fashion and paired with something different whereas a white wedding dress is probably always going to be a dress.	labels:Sometimes people use lace generational wedding dresses to make veils or accessories - it's less common but still very possible! That could be an option for someone whose mother wore a lace monstrosity lol	episode_done:True
text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "A Primer on Materials"	labels:There’s a lot of information about which fabrics keep you warm, but not as much about which fabrics keep you cool.  Cotton, for example, gets a bad rap because it fails to keep you warm when wet - but the same properties make it a very cooling fabric to wear in hot and dry climates.

However, I can’t stand the prints of monsteras on everything. To me it feels a bit lazy and literally just sticking it on because they know plants are popular now. the monsters pieces I’ve seen have not seemed thoughtful in the pattern choice. Anyone else feeling that?   I think a lot of it will burn itself out as a fad, but hope the fun prints with leaves and different florals stick around a bit longer.

text:"Can people just hate fashion again" - Synecdoche When Talking about the "Industry" Discussion	labels:> Should spaces & industries for fashion lovers, clothes lovers, and people that have to wear clothes be completely separate?  I don’t think that any of these groups should be completely separate however I do find them all being lumped into the same spaces very frustrating as someone who does love fashion as a form of art and creativity.  I like harsh and blunt constructive criticism in pretty much all areas of life and I most certainly want it for my outfits as well. I want to hear what other fashion lovers and artists think of my colour choices, proportions, textures, fit, etc. and be able to refine those things and really flex my creative muscles when creating an outfit. Instead, many fashion spaces are dominated by ‘you do you hun!’ and ‘so long as you like it, that’s all that matters!’ which is great for someone *who has to wear clothes* and doesn’t actually care about fashion but joins fashion spaces because they feel some obligation as a woman to care about it but... those spaces just become unhelpful and bland for those who really love fashion and want to get better at it.  I’ve been an off and on follower of FFA for a few years and I feel like it’s definitely dominated by the “people who wear clothes” group and unfortunately it limits the amount of critique that is acceptable to give.

I throw a smaller handbag inside so I can take that to lunch or coffee instead of the whole backpack.	episode_done:True
text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:Hi! As a stylist I get this question ALOT. For starters don't get rid of too much before buying replacements. What ends up happening is we get rid of everything without establishing what pieces we actually need.   Start with establishing your personal style. What do your want your closet/style to be? What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping! Now that you have a moodboard and list of things you need you can shop to fin in the gaps and more importantly you can shop with intention!   &#x200B;  I hope that wasn't too much and was helpful haha. I'm always happy to help.
text:That's actually really helpful! How do you suggest finding my style? I feel like I have such a wide style that I wear (minimal, to punk, to cutesy, etc). I feel like I love all of my clothes but some go months without being worn.	labels:Why exactly are you aiming for minimalism? Minimalism isn't a virtue and it's only valuable in so much as it matches your lifestyle, needs, and desires. You don't have to aim for minimalism for the sake of minimalism, or just because it’s in style. It's ok to own things that make you happy. It's ok to only wear something once every couple of months (or less often). You don't have to get rid of things just because you are not living up to some arbitrary standard of use.
text:I just feel like I have too many clothes, and it has lead to a pretty bad laundry habit because I know I have more to wear. I'm not trying to be 100% minimalistic just trying to lower the amount of clothes I have. I'm not one to shop very often so it's not a shopping habit but I have a hard time getting rid of clothes. I know it's not wrong to have a big closet, I just want to have less. I enjoy donating clothes that I no longer have purpose for but I somehow still have a hard time getting rid of things. I haven't really thought of how it's okay to not wear everything ALL the time.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:The Best Ways To Style A Blazer This Autumn.	labels:Lol, let's play.  1. "Go for a soft blazer" -- shows a gold button blazer with clearly structured shoulders over... an awful full-zip cardigan, for some reason. 2. Awful photo, the jacket could barely sit worse if they tried. 3. One of the least bad things here, and the dude is literally wearing his blazer with a white tee and sweatpants. 4. "Layer it" -- ah, the standard cliche. 5. "Wear it with this expensive moncler vest, who cares if it looks good? That logo is GIGANTIC!" 6. Two completely different suggestions, one of which is their second unhelpful cliche. Somebody clearly took the photo first and they wrote the tip afterwards. 7. "Play with color." Oh, gee, really? I was only going to wear a white shirt and gray trousers with a navy blazer, ever, but gee, you want me to *consider things*? Cool. Thanks. Super helpful, Mr. P. 8. "More formality" -- shows a wide-open denim shirt, sunglasses, a mess of bracelets under an open wrist...  Yay, I caught 'em all, what do I win?

I regret nothing! If you have the disposable income to pay up front and wait for the refund to be processed, I highly suggest getting all your options so you aren't left wondering if you really have the right size or ordering another pair to try on.    Edit: as /u/fartymcfly22 pointed out, you might want to check that the company doesn't just throw away their returns before ordering duplicates like this!
text:I do this all the time when shopping online. Sizing, even for different styles from the same brand can be off, so I pretty much always buy two sizes to decide which fits better.

text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:The clothes they are wearing are actually the least important part of them looking elegant.  Ignoring genetics (it's a lot easier to look elegant if you're tall and thin, imo) there's a few things that can help someone look elegant regardless of what clothes they're wearing. Also ignoring the fact these three probably have teams to help them look how they want ;)  First off is how you carry yourself - how you walk, how you pose for photos, how you sit and stand etc. It helps to have a friend, a good sized mirror, or to record yourself - then watch how people you see as being elegant move and hold themselves, then copy them and practice.  Second would be presentation. The instagrammers you mention have long, clean, shiny hair in simple styles. More neutral colours for makeup - but be aware it takes a lot of time and product (and practice!) to get their kinda looks. Clean, well manicured nails - they don't have to be too long but no chipped polish, dirt under nails etc. Clothes that fit (find a tailor if you can afford to alter clothes for you, or learn to do it yourself) . A cheap shirt that's been altered to fit you will look better than a more expensive one that fits badly.  And thirdly would be mindset - this also ties into the first because no matter how much practice you've had, if you feel clumsy and nervous you will find a lot harder to pull off looking elegant.	episode_done:True

text:What would you wear to elope during a pandemic?	labels:I would still wear a wedding dress. I sort of eloped and the airlines lost my wedding dress for 5 days and I got married in a sundress. It's been 11 years and I'm still sad about it. We always said we'd go back and have a do-over, but things happened and life continues to happen and I'll never get to run around Vegas in my wedding dress. I have worn it any chance I get though! Holiday parties or other random events. People are always weird about it "um. Is that a wedding dress?" Me: hell yeah ! I love my wedding dress. I'm gonna wear it as long as I can! I feel like a mother fucking princess in it!" Also, I'm happy I work hard to stay fit enough to still fit into it. Haha. I bought it on Craigslist for $400. I love it. I will continue to wear it as much as possible without any cares because I feel good in it.   That being said. Wear what you feel best in! If it's a wedding dress or sweat pants. YOLO it with all your confidence.	episode_done:True

text:Goals and Resolutions Check in: February	labels:My goals are going well! A couple of ours are essentially the same. Good luck, we got this!  1) Wardrobe Overhaul  At the beginning of the year, all I owned was athleisure. I was a very cozy, but very bored, person. So I’m working on filling my wardrobe with clothes that really make me happy, and it’s working! I’m in a fortunate position right now, so I’ve been spending the last stimulus check on ThredUp and Poshmark. I gotta say I am loving online thrifting.  2) Dress for my emotions rather than comfort.  Part of moving away from athleisure. My clothes really influence how I feel, so dressing up to look like a badass bitch makes me feel like a badass bitch. Even on days I work at home, I wear outfits to emotionally prep myself to enjoy being productive. I change into pjs when my work is done for the day, so I actually get to look forward to my comfy clothes rather than feel like it’s just another lazy day in leggings.  3) Focus on fit and proportions.  This one is harder but is making me feel the most ~fashionable~. I’m trying to identify how/why certain pieces work on me while others look slightly off. I take videos of myself where I make a bunch of tiny adjustments to my outfits to identify the little details I do or don’t like. This is definitely the biggest of my goals, and will take a long time to really figure out. I can often tell when something isn’t right about an outfit, but identifying that element is tricky.
text:Yessssss to all of your goals! Your reasoning definitely resonates with me... I feel so much better and more confident the days I put in effort as opposed to jeans a company polo or leggings and a shirt.   You’ve totally got this :) cant wait to see the end of year progress.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I do not like black opaque tights very often. I love a patterned sheer-ish tight - with polka dots or some other thing. A loose enough pattern that hints at your skin below.. I have also had grey sheer pattern tights and other shades, but I a dark skinned black woman, so I have some different color constraints. I generally prefer darker tights over paler ones since I am darker.   As for ankle boot height? I prefer right around the ankle, or even something that has more of a profile of a shoe. I am not a big sock wearer, but if I do want ones to be visible, the need to be an interesting pair,   I'd pick colors that mimic your skin tone or pickup a shade in the dress/skirt you are wearing. I also do not love big contrast between the sock and the tight. But it depends, if the tight matches the dress/skirt - then contrast in the shoe is fine. But otherwise I like the shoe and tight to be closer together.	episode_done:True

If you get rid of all your meh work clothes would you be stressed out over buying a new wardrobe when you're called back to the office? If so, just go the purge-n-store route.

Every. Single. Day.  But I don’t have time for that BS.
text:Maybe because my feed is a lot of plus size/fat bodies, but I find this type of thinking terribly depressing. I won't pretend that terms like "effortless" are meant for us, but it also can feel even more exclusionary in a way when I see other fat people being like "never will I be considered to look this good!! no matter the effort I put in!!!".	labels:That’s not what I’m saying. Plus size can be beautiful, but never effortless. I don’t wear makeup, mostly wear sneakers because good luck finding feminine shoes in 11.5 women’s, and I alternate between jeans + T-shirt and dresses. I still look like a hobo, with expensive taste.	episode_done:True
text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:The people in the comments on this thread are kind of... The OP is asking how looking at a garnment in a website, how you can gauge if it has quality.  The majority of websites don't list anything other than fabric composition and have a page on the company's ethics, which is likely filled with lies (EVERLANE, which many "ethics' conscious people were duped with bought)). Also, expecting the majority of people to research on said ethics, when most don't even read that ethics' page is being out of touch with reality.  This person is making an effort than the majority of people don't do. To which some respond with condescending remarks?	episode_done:True
text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items have all been high quality copies of items I have in low quality but wore out the wazoo.  For example, I knew I was ready to invest in some high end Chelsea boots when I found myself going through a cheap pair every year. Or to invest in a nice leather-looking jacket when I found myself grabbing mine 70% of the time I went out.  The expensive items were hard to wear at first, maybe on date nights or to a nicer event, but as I got more used to wearing them I wore them more often. I think it took me a hot year before I wore my Red Wings more than like once a month.   My recommendation is keep the items in your comfort zone (so no wild dresses or Colors at first) and to force yourself to wear it at a regular interval. These days, just wearing nice jeans while I go shopping seems to be my “date night” when I dress up!
text:That’s a really good idea, buying cheap versions and seeing what you rewear. Can’t believe I haven’t thought of that.   The thing that I want to spend money on is leather lined shoes, especially chukka boots. But I also teach elementary school. All day, they step on my feet and it destroys my shoes. So I don’t want to spend more than $100 if 7 year olds are just gonna wreck them.	labels:My dad always told me to do that with tools, as well. If you use it a lot, then invest in a high quality piece. If you rarely need it, a lower cost tool will be fine! I try to take that advice for all parts of my life!	episode_done:True

text:Do you have a childhood fashion icon? If so, does their influence show up in your wardrobe today?	labels:The first time I remember being aware of fashion was when I was obsessed with Harriet’s outfits from the Harriet The Spy movie. I was 9 when the movie came out. I still love a good striped shirt and I dress pretty casually, haha. My teen years were shaped by the Olsen twins boho style. I still keep some boho influences and still pin recent outfits of theirs as inspiration.	episode_done:True
text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:Literally gave up my colored hair for this reason :( it's so hard to wear any colors with neon hair...

text:Thoughts on Shein?	labels:Controversial opinion, but, they aren’t that bad.   Let’s have some empathy for a moment: it is an absolute privilege to be able to shop at a sustainable store and/or to be able to buy secondhand. Imagine being someone who hasn’t bought new to them clothing in years because they can’t afford to and then fast fashion prices are waved in their faces on clothing that fits them and is their style. I’m not going to tell someone to not buy clothing from a place they can afford. I’m absolutely not doing it.   People demonize fast fashion because they look at it as black and white and don’t understand that, if you’re shopping at SHEIN, you likely can’t afford the more sustainable sources/you can’t find what you’re looking for secondhand. I’m plus sized. I can’t fit into and afford a lot of the sustainable brands out there. And, people buy out the “fashionable” plus size items in my local thrift stores to sell on Depop, so, I don’t blame people for shopping on SHEIN.  I’ve bought SHEIN secondhand and I’ve had items for years and I haven’t had any issues. I haven’t bought first hand from them in a long time but when I did, I never had any long shipping times or anything, either. I found the same defects I’d find at Target, like, a long thread here or there that I can easily snip off.   This goes for fast fashion in general—if you take care of your clothes and wear the appropriate size, you can make them last. It’s not like they spontaneously rip apart, you have to do something to make them do that. Steam your clothes to get out wrinkle. Tumble dry, hand wash, etc.
text:You raise good points, but I’m going to respectfully disagree - I don’t think there’s ever any valid excuse to buy from a company who openly profits from exploitative third world labour. We can all do better.   Sustainable fashion is expensive, yes. But *usually* buying quality clothing is cheaper in the long run than buying lots of cheap stuff (I know this is easier said than done for people living hand to mouth).   Secondly there are options that don’t exploit people. Namely second hand shops and Depop. I guarantee - no matter what the item is - someone’s already bought it or something VERY similar and wants to get rid of it. Even when I have money I buy from there because... why wouldn’t you?   The “what about poor people” argument always gets made but it just doesn’t sit right with me. What about the people who are being paid 40p a day in sweltering and unsafe Bangladeshi factories? Factories that are dumping toxic dyes into water sources? We all have a responsibility not to perpetuate the monolithic success of these horrible fast fashion conglomerates.	labels:Regarding the poor people argument, what finally resonated with me is that looking at the profits for these fast fashion empires like shein is that poor people simply do not have the purchasing power to be responsible for those types of profits. Fast fashion businesses are profitable because, overwhelmingly, not poor people buy from them, and they buy a lot of items from them. I first heard the argument from a fashion activist called Aja Barber and it really got through to me that my support of fast fashion was a choice even at the times in my life where I struggled financially. Poor people are not responsible for fast fashion even when they buy it. Aja has a fantastic Instagram and Twitter if you are interested in the topic!

text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:Ok so quick and dirty - shoulder seams are supposed to hit at your shoulder bone. This can be hard to determine if that bone isn't visible, but if the jacket is poufing out past your shoulder its too big at the shoulder and if there's a weird crease line or dimple when your arm is straight down it is likely too small at the shoulder. Armholes should be comfortably sized, not digging in to your pit but also not having excess folds of fabric around and inside the sleeve.  Pants should sort of skim over your hips and bum/thighs depending on the fit. This doesn't apply to skinny jeans and leggings which are meant to be tight fitting. If youre getting lines whiskering out from the crotch towards your hips, your pants are probably too small. If you get a fake penis bump, assuming you don't have one, the pants are probably too big (if you do have one, this tip does not apply!)  Ease is important. Just bc something fits over your body doesn't mean it fits you, especially with stiffer, non stretch fabrics. You need room in the butt and thighs to be able to sit down reasonably comfortably. If you can't bend without fabric digging in (especially at creases) it does not fit. If it balloons out significantly when you move or sit, the garment is likely too big.	episode_done:True

text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:For me, it was the opposite... so I am still young but I grew up staring at magazines and with no one that had the same body type as me- what is now called ‘medium’. Where companies have a bunch of skinny girls and will through in few plus size girls just to get some diversity... but yet, still don’t see any medium sized girls... Nonetheless, many desi girls (desi refers to south asian).   In middle school, wasn’t a fan of makeup but my best friend was. Since as long as I could remember, she would tell me about everything she was doing and how much she loved to do her makeup. One day in 8th grade, I was staring myself in the mirror and was like hm, I want to start trying to use makeup. And from there it started... From then until about the next 4 years, I taught myself and watched video after video after video. This is what fueled me into fashion. Around my Junior year in High School, the confidence makeup gave me transferred into just wanting to look my best. I became obsessed in streetwear and just looking really cool...   From then on my style has changed a bit, but overall it was my friends and what they were into that inspired my first looks. I would take those and find things similar that seemed more like me :)	episode_done:True

text:(Man) Repeller: A postmortem	labels:I started following manrepeller around when it started - it was around when I graduated college and fashion blogs were still big. I always liked Leandra' styling, and later the style pieces on manrepeller. it never bothered me that they often showed clothes that were expensive - I mean, have you ever read a fashion magazine? you expect that in well-curated fashion content people will be wearing things that you yourself can't afford. it's inspirational, not a how-to.  Anyway, I felt like the lifestyle content they were trying to expand to more and more was their weakest point. We expect our fashion magazines to show us $900 items, we don't necessarily want to see models flaunting generational wealth and writing a 1,000-word thinkpiece about it. And the more they pushed lifestyle pieces and less fashion, I worried that they wouldn't last too much longer.  But also, maybe Leandra's time just came? It's rare for a blog or website to stay trendy for 10-ish years. MR started as a sort of hipster-gossip girl hybrid and I feel like that era is just over. I think the events of 2020 made MR's demise faster, but it was probably coming.	episode_done:True

text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I think the size of your wardrobe is going to depend on your climate, job, hobbies, and general lifestyle. I have a lot more clothing than that. I also live in a place with four seasons. I have outdoorsy hobbies that require some tougher clothes. I can‘t wear my casual clothing to work (and I’m also holding onto some more professional clothing from a past job in case I return to that field). I don’t have a lot of disposable income either, so I always keep things like dress pants even though I never wear them in my everyday, because I can’t afford to go shopping when interviews and funerals come up.  For instance, I probably have at least 15 dresses alone, once you count all the strappy sundresses, nice work dresses, wool sweater dresses, the cocktail dresses, and the evening gown that’s in the back of my closet - and everything in between.  I swap out my clothing with the seasons and have one closet that I share with my husband, so I try to be judicious about what I keep, while giving myself grace that I don’t need to get rid of something just because I don’t wear it regularly.
text:Really feel you on the past job clothes. I invested in classic pieces and tailored almost every item when I worked in a much more business professional role.

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:My opinion is that money cannot buy style and taste. Growing up, my family wasn't well off but my mom always dressed nicely even though she didn't buy expensive clothing. She also made sure my siblings and I had decently nice clothes, albeit "unbranded" things for the most part.   As I got older and started working when I was 19, burying clothes on a limited budget while paying my own way through university was such a thrill. Been very lucky to be financially comfortable and then some in the past 8 years but I still don't like to splurge on clothing - anything past $50 is something that will make me pause and think for a few days. The amount of money I have, or the lack of willingness to spend it, has never stopped me from having a rather good sense of style and friends and colleagues always express disbelief that my clothes are not high end nor expensive.   Conversely, I know of many people who are rich or splurge only on high end or designer clothing and accessories as I come from a very affluent Asian country. But this does not guarantee good taste or a fashion sense when they put outfits together. Having a good eye and a keen sense of personal style is seperate from having money in that sense.  I do not shop at thrift stores as there's nothing good in my area and I also have very limited time and patience for it, however, Poshmark has been absolutely fantastic! With the advent of the Internet, access is not much of a limitation for me.	episode_done:True

Ready for action floor staff with snappy tennis shoes and an athletic headband?

text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:Nope, they are completely separate. When I wear makeup, it’s always minimal and designed around hiding my flaws and making me look healthier.  Maybe if I’m wearing black near my face, I’ll use a bit more blush and maybe a lip tint, but I simply don’t wear enough visible makeup for it to be a consideration.	episode_done:True

text:[Inspiration] Pearls	labels:Pearls used to be more valuable than diamonds or gold. For a time in the late 1800s to the early 1900s they were considered he most valuable jewelry you could own.

text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:I hope you're not asking this because of rude comments from others - if so, it's worth learning to ignore those people.  That said, I've found lightening up the hairstyling and makeup is quite helpful if you want to look more relaxed.  I also have a personal rule about shoes and skirts: the higher the hemline, the less sexy the shoe. This keeps miniskirts looking relaxed, and prevents longer skirts from skewing frumpy. Obviously rules are meant to be broken, including this one, and it doesn't really apply in the evening.

text:Tucking in shirts	labels:i tuck everything in. literally everything. shirts, blouses, sweatshirts, sweaters.. even my kimonos. it’s fun to me to play around with what works and what doesn’t work.   as someone said, chuck on a cardigan and see how you feel with your shirt tucked in. it can be weird at first, especially if you‘ve never done it before	episode_done:True
text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I'm just... still getting dressed up. This has actually given me a nice opportunity to try new combinations of outfits and pull out pieces that I wasn't sure about before. The routine of getting dressed and feeling put together is really important for me with regards to getting into the work mindset.
text:Agreed.   Definitely was starting to feel some depression/Groundhog Day while not getting dressed every day.   Picking out an outfit and doing makeup really help.   I’m also doing “date night” with my husband where we both get dressed up and put shoes on and have dinner at a real table and use our serving dishes.   Making more elaborate dishes and getting into the presentation has also helped me. I’m not feeling the need for time savers/convenience since I don’t ever leave the house.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:Whenever people have to work with an all-black or neutral look for work, I always tell them to look for patterns and textures instead of color to make the outfits more fun. If your style is more gothic/steampunk inspired then maybe look for items that feature velvet, zippers, or black damask print. Or if you’re feeling more ethereal you could try some lace or satin.  You might also be able to get away with fun accessories as long as they’re not distracting.	episode_done:True

text:How would you store sentimental clothing?	labels:If you want to be able to look at it, depending on how well it folds up (like if there is a design on the torso that could be arranged on top), you could potentially put it in a shadow box to reduce the amount of wall space it takes up.  You could also get a decorative dress form and display it on that.	episode_done:True
text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I have a lot of environmental allergens (especially pollen and animals) and pretty much anything that I wear outdoors for even a few minutes has to get washed after every wear to keep my exposure to those allergens as low as possible. I also work (pre-pandemic anyway) in a business formal office.  General, I find that "dry clean only" items are fine if they're washed in the machine on gentle cycle, with a little bit of detergent (think half a cap instead of a full cap) on gentle cycle, in COLD water, then hung to dry. This works well for blazers, dresses, pants, and blouses. I try to pick styles that don't have ironed-in pleats, and I gravitate toward fabrics that don't wrinkle easily (although a hand steamer is far easier than ironing). If a piece has delicate lace or is something that can snag easily, throw it in a mesh bag to protect it. And make sure that more delicate items are washed in small loads that don't have heavier fabrics like denim to reduce the wear and tear on them. I do try to shop clearance racks (and places like TJMaxx are my favorite for blazers), because I do just kind of assume that every now and then I'll purchase a dud item that doesn't take to laundering as well as I'd like.  I tend to stick to fabrics like polyester, cotton, and rayon. I avoid wool, cashmere, and silk.	episode_done:True

text:WEEKLY DEALZ	labels:Re: Black Friday, I personally like having as much time as possible so I can research the item and sit on it before deciding to buy. It’s easy to make impulse purchases when the deals are hot.   The discounts will be big this year due to the decrease of retail sales and the increase of online shopping. I think it would be helpful to post the deals as soon as they’re announced by the retailers, which could be as early as next week.
text:I also think the discounts will be big this year but don't retailers often sell lower quality products for Black Friday?	labels:Sometimes, but only for certain items and merchants (e.g., Levi’s sold at Walmart vs. Levi’s.com). It’s more common to see inflated MSRPs to think you’re getting a good deal. If everyone knew retailers sold inferior products during BF, no one would shop then. That said, outlets and factory stores do sell lower quality items year round that were made specifically for them.   Stock photos that change right before sales can be another indicator that they’re selling a different version of the same item. All the more reason to have extra time to research your purchases.
text:I did not know this, so this is great advice. Are there more examples of retailers who do this?	labels:Electronics like TVs, computers, and appliances are known to have inferior BF counterparts. Cosmetics too, especially if they're sold in holiday kits. Not sure about clothing though; the Levi's were just an example I made up. I think it's more common among mass market/fast fashion retailers who have high turnover and can push out tons of product in a short amount of time. Think H&M, Forever 21, etc.  A good rule of thumb is that if it's too good to be true, it probably is. If you have to shop at all, go with stores that have generous return policies so you're not stuck with unwearable crap. A quick Google search pulls up lots of guides about what to avoid on BF, so that's a good place to start.
text:Nordstrom's anniversary sale is notorious for this - most of the clothes and shoes they sell special for the sale are lower quality than they would be otherwise.	labels:That’s a bummer, seeing as I purchased quite a few things during this year’s sale. Is it just their in-house brands or does it extend to other name brands too?   I bought some Nike tights that were discounted more than I’ve ever seen anywhere (including Nike’s website) so I suspect it’s the latter. They don’t feel too different than the ones I already own in other colors, but perhaps longevity will tell a different story.
text:I think most of the lower quality items are the items made for Nordstrom, like their Madewell items made exclusively for Nordstrom. If your Nike leggings are the same leggings sold by Nike on their website and feel similar to the ones you own then they're probably fine.	labels:Cool, thanks for the heads up. I try to buy directly from the brand whenever possible, but it’s easy to miss when a good deal is distracting.	episode_done:True

Its much easier to move belts than a lot of clothes.	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Camoshita | January 23, 2021	labels:I've owned (emphasis on owned) a couple of Camoshita pieces over the years and while I have good things to say about them, I will also add that the brand is practically laser focused in what I think it does (that is, casual contemporary #menswear). I hesitate to use casual because of its manifold definitions in clothing, but I'm talking about bold patterns and detailing, not pretending a chore coat is a suit jacket.  Anyway, the one suit I've had is excellent, though maybe only appropriate at weddings because of its general boldness. In detailing, it is almost identical to my normal United Arrows suit. The buttons are really nice, "lighter" than my american and european suit options with a nice iridescent glow. Is it mother of pearl? I don't know, but it's definitely flashy if you know where to look. The sportcoat I had was similarly detailed and it made me look like a used car salesman with its bold, brown check. This is a good thing, but I unfortunately rarely have call to look like a used car salesman so I moved it on. What made me give up on the brand were the shirts: twice I bought them on deep sale but found them far too trim, especially through the sleeves, and too fussy with the buttons. I can't exactly recall but I remember there being more than one place on both shirts that had more buttons than should be there. More than I care to put up with.  Anyway, the point is to say that if Camoshita fits your life, it's great. I love my suits and still wear them. The materials, work, and design details are, in my limited experience, unimpeachable. But of course, if what Camoshita does isn't what you want, the infinite steez of Kamoshita-san isn't suddenly going to rub off on you and make you the Prince of Pitti.	episode_done:True

text:[Inspiration] Sculptural Jewelry	labels:FAQ:  * "Why did you make this album?" I saw u/mcqueenofthehill's jewelry album yesterday and decided to share mine. His is practical wearable everyday jewelry, mine is all over the top extravagant absurd cocktail jewelry.  * "Are you stealing this format from /u/cdot5 and u/mcqueenofthehill?" Yes.  * "Why is this on a sub for men's fashion advice?" This album is inspiration, not advice. I'm not suggesting anyone wear this if they don't want to. This stuff isn't for everyday wear or even traditional men's cocktail attire. But if your style is out there you can make it work on occasion. I plan to get a couple of these eventually (if the artists ever reply to me).  * "It looks ridiculous/like a costume. No one will take you seriously." The necklaces in particular are **really** out there. But I wouldn't wear any of this to work or anywhere I need to be taken seriously. But if I'm going to a party or a play and I want to dress up, something like these pieces would be fun.   * "But this is women's clothing!" Yes. I wear womenswear. I combine it with menswear. You don't have to if you don't want to.  * "This may be cool on the runway, but nobody would leave the house like this!" I would.  * "Who makes these?" Orr, Cheryl Eve Acosta, Sara Barbanti, Wendy Yue, Leyla Abdollahi are the ones who have functioning web stores and/or stockists.   * "Is this a comprehensive compilation?" No. But this kind of stuff is really hard to find.

I'm very eclectic in my preferred styles though: like ethereal/fairy-esque (which it all depends on the color), military chic (which i can sometimes get away with), Gothic/steampunk inspired... theatrical is probably the best way I can describe it.

text:FAQ: What is the environmental impact of different fabrics?	labels:Anything that's sustainably farmed will have a positive or neutral environmental impact. Traditionally raised cattle for example extract carbon from the atmosphere so therefore the environmental impact of suede would be positive unless you're shipping the fabric long distances.
text:Eh, that's not really true. There are a number of environmental impacts from leather/suede. Even when sustainably raised.  1. Cattle actually suppress growth of native grasses(coming from a US centric perspective) due to the shape of their hooves. Buffalo have a different shaped hoof (more of a spade) and actually stimulate growth. So if you got your hands on some buffalo hide boots thats a great start.  2. The dyes and softening agents can be incredibly toxic and harmful. Traditional practices actually employ human excrement (both urine and feces) but modern practice focuses on more... palatable but also less environmentally friendly chemical agents.  3. Discerning origins of hides is difficult. There is quite a bit of disingenuous advertising as far as what is sustainably farmed and what standards it meets. There are many different verification organizations, looking into who has partnered with them (ie. NGOs or government programs) and who provided foundational funding is a good start to finding a reputable org.  So, you are totally right. But only if you account for all of those point as well as sourcing the materials/labor/sales locally. To be honest I think just making sure what you buy lasts a long time, taking care of your clothes/shoes, and limiting your future purchases will have a more meaningful impact.	labels:so, I'm an ag and soils researcher, and the research is really up in the air right now as far as grazing and soil carbon. we havent really figured it out yet, and the field is in a major state of flux with new research coming out all the time. maybe we can grow cattle in an environmentally friendly way that is carbon neutral or even positive (this would require much lower stocking rates and innovative new techniques that are far from common today), but maybe we can't	episode_done:True

text:Athleisure button down shirts	labels:I've had good experience with Twillory shirts.  Good stretch and it travels really well.  I find that it may wrinkle a little but if you spray with a water bottle and let dry it'll come out.  My biggest complaint is that I'm normally a 14.5 / 32 with a 38 chest and 31 waist, and i think i'm in between sizes so mine are a little oversized at 15 and 32/33 (since they don't make a one number sleeve length) rather than my buttons popping off.    I haven't brought myself to buy any of the others since they are 40% more at best and if you buy 2 or more you can get the same as the others but a 2 for 1.  I've tried on mizzen and main but they are just way too big for me even at their small / trim size.  You could find those on nordstrom earlier this year for less than $100.	episode_done:True
text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:It seems the current census is that no brand can be trusted to keep a high quality, and 30+ year old vintage is the only way.  Brands might be lauded for their quality/price for a few years until the constant push for higher profit every year makes them produce the same disappointing clothes as all other dying mid-range brands.  I never really see quality as a selling point for clothes anymore. It might be hidden in some company statement with promises of green washing. But all brands want you to come back the next season, not encourage you to buy and use something for *years*.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:Here is what I recommend:  1. Spend time in your closet regularly creating outfits. Most people know how to dress themselves, know what they like, etc. but they do not put the work/time into working with their wardrobe, or they do not do it enough. Set aside a time every few months to do it, even if it is just a mental effort of thinking out ideas and writing them down. 2. Constantly experiment. Wardrobe items turn into outfits and looks when there are elements and aspects to the look -- layering items, color combinations, mixing prints, etc. If your style tends to be neutral/basic, then this can be achieved with elements to the items like different necklines, trim and details, etc. 3. Try to create at least 3 outfits or more with each item you have. Make it a practice including when you are considering making a purchase -- i.e, what three outfits can I make if I buy this? 4. It is good to look for inspiration, but if you don't take time to make looks, it will not be useful and effective. 5. Understand your default/go-to looks and items and work them differently. Next time you french tuck the sweater with the jeans and boots, maybe try cuffing the jeans, or layering the sweater with something, or doing something unexpected with the look. This will broaden the use of your wardrobe items.  It can be helpful to have someone else you know come into your closet and show you how they'd work your wardrobe items. You could post photos of items here and ask people, "how would you wear this?" that could spark some new ideas as well.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:Going for good materials is definitely the way forward if it's something I'd want to wear for years to come. I prefer solid gold or silver to plated pieces which will barely last a few months before coming off. However, if it's a fun fashion style I'm not adverse to cheaper options like gold filled or vermeil.  Same goes for stones - e.g. diamonds or pearls over CZ or plastic pearls.  There is a wide spectrum of 'real stuff' depending on your budget and brand preference. E.g. a Tiffany diamond is more expensive than a non branded one from Costco. A lesser quality diamond (based on the 4 C's) or lab diamond is cheaper. 14k gold is cheaper than 18k gold and sterling silver is cheaper than 14k gold...  Not sure if I'm still considered young anymore but I've certainly always enjoyed jewelry! Sterling silver is cheap to buy typically if you don't go for branded (Tiffany, David Yurman) - Etsy is a favourite. Plus second hand saves a lot. Gold is a lot cheaper in Asia if you buy non branded as the labour markup is a lot lower. Given the weight method of sales, solid gold earrings and rings are quite affordable as a result.   And cultured freshwater pearls are a lot cheaper than say Akoya pearls of AAA quality. When I was on holiday in Asia, it'd be common to pay £5 or something and pick some oysters that they'd open up and you get to keep all the little seed pearls they had inside  Typically there were quite a few! Goes to show how easy it is to farm them.  Overall, I think if you're savvy about how to shop and willing to compromise on quality, these items are all affordable.  I'd say have a browse for what you enjoy wearing and like the look of and go from there. Some people might enjoy a single classic item and save up and others have a wide range. I'd say pawnbrokers, eBay and Etsy are some of my favourite go-to places depending on what I'm looking for.
text:This is the highest comment right now, so I just want to point out to other casual jewelry owners that fine jewelry holds value. It's highly unlikely that freshwater pearls you buy at retail are going to resell at a similar price, vs AAA Akoya pearls.  >Goes to show how easy it is to farm them  Farmed pearls aren't as valuable as natural pearls - similar to natural vs synthetic (aka lab) diamonds. The rarity of a natural pearl drives/retains its value.  >if you're savvy about how to shop and willing to compromise on quality, these items are all affordable.  This... really confuses me in a thread about investment grade jewelry. Store of value investments typically don't suddenly become more affordable; they aren't considered sound investments if this is the case. (There are exceptions, like copper, whose value is tied to demand for construction, but that's different than gems.) This statement is like trying to claim you can buy a blue chip stock on sale. Happens with recessions or a major event, but the majority of the time it can be counted on as a stable store of value.	labels:Fine jewelry really does not hold its value, I certainly wouldn't say (as a jeweler) that "the majority of the time it can be counted on as a stable store of value". Buying jewelry as an investment is like buying a car as an investment. You aren't going to get anywhere close to a full return on it unless it's a particularly rare or sought-after piece, which is the vast majority of cases. You might get what the materials are worth but that's going to be notably less than the retail value you paid. This is especially true for diamonds, which are relatively abundant and artificially marked up. Other gemstones like emerald, ruby, and sapphire hold their value better but even then, unless you have a truly remarkable one I wouldn't hold your breath about seeing a return on it.	episode_done:True
text:Thank all of you	labels:Do not do what you are thinking about doing in the last part of your post. You are experiencing the beginner's high; you found something new and exciting and want to replace everything with it. One common rookie mistake for people that are new but not limited to fashion is to throw everything away and buy a completely new wardrobe only to regret it down the road because when the high went down, they realize they did not really enjoy some of the pieces.  You need time to process and enjoy your first part of AE. Let the initial 'honeymoon phase' calm down and see if you really like shoes. If you do and want to spend money, there are thousands of great shoe brands ($$-$$$) that you can read up on /r/goodyearwelt. AE is just a starting point.
text:As I mentioned to another poster I am going to give it some time to make sure. But at this point I am less trying to go ‘all in’ on AE than I really never want to put on my old shoes again. I wear dress shoes to work every day plus a few evenings for work commitments. Assuming the ones delivered are as comfortable to wear as the ones in the store my choices would be keep wearing painful shoes most of the time or spend a bit on AE’s.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:I'm from Japan and a male in those age categories, would likely dress quite differently.  Japan is a land of 'Uniforms'. many spend much of their grade school to high school in a uniform.  when they go out and get a job.. they gotta wear a 'uniform'.. either a suit and tie, or some company uniform.  College is usually the time for experimentation, but because people have such a strong hard-on for fads and trends, they end up being in a uniform again.  maybe in 2017-18 ish. the trend for college age men was a wool chester coat and a hoodie underneath (a mix of very casual and slightly formal).  fast forward 2-3 years later, it nearly completely fell out in favor of oversized fleece jackets, or North Face Nuptse and other similar puffers.. usually in black and yellow.  guys 30s to 40s stop dressing like that  guys 40s and up tend to focus more on brands to flex their income and status, but often wear ill fitting stuff.. as well as strange color stuff (likely went to a Ralph Lauren outlet and could only afford that bright yellow shirt that was on sale because no one would buy it)  People often judge you by what you wear as they think it reflects your occupation or status. For example some one wearing shiny black with a lot of accessories is perceived to be involved in the night industries and probably of lower education or culture.
text:Thanks for your reply. I see what you mean. Here in the UK people in Primary/Secondary school wear Uniforms, and most workplaces, but in College and University they wear anything, back in college and University a few years ago people usually wore jeans and hoodies etc. Sometimes I feel people wear things to reflect the event they are at (e.g. college or a party) instead of how old they are.  And I notice a lot of celebs wear things to make they Unique, and really stand out. Like a bright white hoodie and white trousers. I guess it's probably whilst they perform and they change afterwards? But its interesting as people within their age group wouldn't always wear the style they do.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I've got to admit I'm more than impressed at those recommandations, they're so detailed I can even picture some in my head somehow!  Thanks a lot for this, I'll try to check what I already have and then get some that I'm missing	labels:Glad I could help! Let me know if you have any questions about any specific pieces!   Also word of caution, don’t but everything st the same time. Get a pair of pants, wear them a couple times, make sure you like the fit and everything then start adding more. I have gotten overzealous so many times and doubled down on something that I later decided I wished fit different.  Good luck!
text:Love your comment mate, some really good basic foundations to build on.  Totally agree with the chinos, although I don’t always like the modern fashion of halfway up your ankle. I have a few pairs of this style for summer. But generally I prefer longer trousers.  T-shirt’s kept plain, keep the logo style ones for at home.   I would add a suggestion for a nice peacoat for winter, it’s a classic item that goes well with casual and smarter outfits (not a suit though, go for an overcoat for a suit).  I love a good pair of double monkstraps as a winter shoe, the right colour can make a casual outfit and it fits with smarter looks.   Great advice though!	labels:	episode_done:True

Super warm and comfortable yet also breathes a bit. Been wearing it mostly for early morning dog walking and hiking rather than truly fashionable moments, but super happy with it.

text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:So, look, I don't want to tell you _not_ to do this, but if I've understood correctly you're looking at creating a bloodborne-inspired victorian/traditional wardrobe. There are elements of that style that have mainstream appeal today, high-waisted wool trousers being one example. However, when you take them in context with the more "interesting" elements you picked out it gives off serious cosplay vibes. Perhaps you should take the fact that the only places offering this sort of clothing are Etsy/cosplay stores as a hint that you should reconsider this idea.  You might be thinking, _what about the cyber goth vampire Rick Owens fits I see on this sub?_ It's a valid question. The key difference is that the style you're going for here has _such_ a strong association with cosplay and videogames and so little mainstream appeal that the number one association people are going to make is that you are cosplaying. Doubly-so if you're wearing cosplay-quality clothes from cosplay vendors. While the Rick Owens aesthetic may not have mainstream appeal it _is_ very accepted within fashion circles and _doesn't_ have that strong cosplay association.  So with that said my advice is to take what you've got and tone it down. Treat it like a high-fashion runway show and take inspiration from it instead of trying to recreate it 1:1. High-waisted trousers, great. Gaiters? Maybe just get some actual boots. Bloodborne-style woolen collars/scarves/hooded shawls? Wear a regular scarf that has an interesting shape or texture, or a shirt with a more exaggerated collar. Maybe the fact that you can't find retailers selling this kind of stuff is the limitation you need to make it work in the real world.  Or maybe I'm just talking complete shite and someone smarter than me can help you more. I hope that I've at least broken the ice and said what needed to be said so that people can try to constructively help you.
text:I agree with you 100%. The sleeve thing, gaiters, and video game style collar things are a recipe for disaster. Maybe the aesthetic is possible to pull off, but it would require very high quality pieces and someone who is really good at this kind of thing. It's one of those, if you need to ask for advice, there is no way you could pull it off scenarios. As terrible as it is, I'd probably chuckle if I saw someone wearing any of those accessories at a bar or something. I'm just picturing someone alone at a dive drinking some shitty (or very oddly expensive for the bar) single malt whisky alone approaching random people and trying to talk about outdated philosophers. Even just the high rise pants look seems very intimidating to me. I'm always very impressed by the people on MFA who pull it off. It seems like one of those things where if you pull it off you look incredibly fashionable, but if you fuck it up just a little you end up looking  wholly ridiculous.	labels:What is an "outdated philosopher"?	episode_done:True

Maybe a continuation of that trend, plus your idea of matching sets. beyond jewelry, i think it will stretch to all accessories. matching masks and scrunchies, matching jewelry, matching hats and scarves as we roll through winter.	episode_done:True

Now that I’m an adult and making decent money I’ve actually purchased a few of these items second hand on Vestiaire Collective or Vinted. The top two are an Alexander McQueen silk skull print scarf and a Mulberry Alexa bag. Certainly not the trendiest of items nowadays but I am thrilled with them and younger me is so happy I finally own them after all these years of wanting them.
text:I’m in the same boat! The Alexa was THE bag back in the days (along with the Balenciaga moto bags)! They’ve both been reissued - the Alexa in new mini sizes, and the Balenciaga has a new “neo” model!

text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:I sometimes YouTube people with my similar size and watch reviews on certain clothing/items before I purchase them. I think it would help to find fashionistas with your similar body/taste to start.  Taking measurements is also really helpful!!! I bought a dress online for the first time using measurements and I was very happy with how well the dress fit. It's soooo much more accurate than just going off small/medium/large sizes.  I also want to add that, at least for me, my clothing and fashion sense was *extremely* awkward (and at times unflattering) at 21. It's a bit of a strange age because you're transitioning from being a teenager to being a "young adult". The way you express your identity can change radically from teenage to young adulthood to adulthood. So I guess I bring this up to say that it is totally normal to be frustrated with your clothing at this age. People on social media will typically post themselves looking their best; please know that they too have days where their outfit doesn't look right, where they feel insecure. Fashion is ultimately a never ending process of learning and expressing one's identity as we age and grow.	episode_done:True
text:How to wear nice casual clothes with a cotton allergy?	labels:Have you tried looking for clothing made out of hemp or linen? You can find casual tshirts and whatnot that are 100% hemp fabric.

I bought a sweet waxed canvas pencil case from SFBags that can hold my gear and maybe some small stuff for my wife.   Heading to work, I have a nice laptop bag and drop that case in there. During the day, I carry the case around with me.  It’s nice enough not to look out of place, but also blends into the environment enough not to generate a ton of questions.	episode_done:True

No shipping codes available, no threshold I can cross to get free shipping. $20 period, no exceptions.  It's a $300 pair of sneakers discounted to $180, I guess should be able to rationalize that at $200 (including shipping), I'm still getting a better deal than what's available anywhere else online (only a few select retailers got this colorway, and all but one are sold out in my size), but still, $20 shipping feels *wrong*. My brain has been trained from years of online shopping that there should always be some way to get around paying for shipping, or otherwise, shipping should be cheap.

text:What were the fashion finds that made you cry of happiness?	labels:That has happened a few times - I found a pair of Giuseppe Zanotti stilettos in my size once for $70 at DSW too. Still own them and my most comfortable high heel. It was relatively conservative looking too so I can wear it with lots of things. The other time was a long knit circle skirt at Winners. It wasn’t the right size but I might have been able to squeeze into it since it’s a knit but someone bought it while I thought it over. Fast forward 6 weeks and I found one in my size on clearance for 60% off. I don’t think I snatched something that fast before...

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:Hello there I am new here in this subreddit 😅  Anyways I have been eye-ing for a shoe that I have been interested for a while now, that particular shoe are the "Nike Cortez Leather" (Red And Blue Varsity) which I very have grown accustomed to. I have researched this shoe and even watch certain reviews for it that I conclude that I want to buy it.  However in my case getting this variant of this shoe and to my proper size has been quite a challenge for me. It's availability is quite rare in my Country (SEA) and all the shoes that I have found are either fake knockoffs and well soldout ads for other shoe websites.  Recently within my dedication to get this shoe, I thought of just buying the "Basic" Variant of the Cortez, and dissapointment follows as I picked the wrong size for my shoe (in my haste to buy the shoe) I measured my foot and it is exactly 26cm and and alongside with the confusion for the knowledge of the older shoe that I bought which is US 12 and EU 44 "World Balance Freeman" it confused me and well....... I bought a Large Shoe 😂 (specifically I bought the size 12 Basic Cortez). Although I placed an exchange size for an US 11, I might be in a pickle since it will still be big for me lol.  Now anyways to finally ask my question, If by somehow the exchange US 11 were still too big for me, Can I wear a WOMANS "Nike Cortez Leather" instead???? For that I will also need advice for the sizing and basically an expert knowledge in this situation. In my case all that is available for this shoe are for Womans Shoe, and within my research I read that Nike Shoes are Unisexual (but for now I need an Experts Advice on this matter) really in a pickle, so pls help ma dudes.	episode_done:True

It's awkward to ask for refunds on bad stuff, they dont open 7 days a week, poor/niche selection, dress rooms are mostly closed for obvious reasons.

text:Yup. For the longest time I had black frames because they go with anything. Once I worked at an optical shop I got to play around a bit and try on different frame styles. Also got some tips given my prescription and face shape. I had 3 pairs that I rotated with, 2 round and one squarish-round (?) for a more professional look. And none of them were black. It was also the time I got the most compliments regarding my frames.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 01, 2021	labels:Hi all! I think this is the place for my comment/question. I've always been told my magazine and fashion outlets that dressing for my bodytype (atheletic boyish rectangle no stomach hips or boobs lol) that I needed to focus on creating the illusion of having curves and wear aline or circle skirts and frilly tops that put emphasis on my boobs. It works and I feel good, but when I take it off I start to feel like a fraud. Like I'm selling a body or image that isn't me and feel bad about it. I know its all about self love but I want to start dressing for MY body and feeling good not dressing to create a body I don't have
text:I have a similar body type, though recently it’s gotten very slightly curvier. I’ve felt the same way, but literally everyone does this, not just us! Clothes create illusions. You’re not a fraud at all.   I’d also consider who you’re dressing for, like the other reply said. If you love what you wear obviously don’t do different because of something I say! But I felt a lot better about myself when I stopped trying to change my body type with clothes (which doesn’t mean I stopped wearing all of my more “flattering” pieces). But I actually found a lot more confidence dressing in clothes that are easier for us to pull off. For me, that’s 1920s and 1960s inspired dresses. The “sack” shape and drop waists are actually often really flattering on us (even with my short legs) and it’s unique because most people don’t find them flattering.   Yes, I probably look less traditionally sexy. But I’ve gotten lots of positive comments on the style that mean more to me anyway. I’ve gotten “Mad Men” comments so some people think it’s sexy anyway!   My advice is to step out of your comfort zone and try to find things that make you feel wonderful outside of people’s expectations of what your naked body should look like.   Good luck! I’m sure you look stunning.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 13, 2021	labels:I (M) am looking for a leather jacket that will last me many years.   - Budget: $300 US, with about $50 in wiggle room if absolutely necessary. - Color: prefer black, but I'll flex if I love another option. - Fit: slim, but I'm willing to compromise if I genuinely love the jacket.  I'd like to be able to buy from a physical store, so something at a common US chain like Macy's or Men's Warehouse would be fantastic. I live near Dayton, OH, so access to boutique shops isn't stellar.  At this price range, I'm not buying something I wouldn't wear every day for the rest of my life, so being able to try it on is extremely important to me. I would love to go bespoke, but I can't justify that, especially given how much more that would cost.
text:I'd check out Allsaints on sale in that price range. They use a softer leather and it won't last you decades like something vintage or a Schott would, but with your budget they aren't bad. Big step up from what you can typically find at dept stores anywho.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:I think if you see the same clothes on Shein, then the boutique is not being honest about where the clothes are coming from. Someone on this sub linked a cute “handmade” smart watch band from a shop on Etsy. When I went to buy it, I found the exact same watch band on Amazon for $10 cheaper. It was clear the Etsy shop was just marking up a mass-produced item and claiming it was handmade. They even used the exact same pictures as the Amazon listing. When shops aren’t honest about that stuff, I have no qualms purchasing the exact same product somewhere cheaper.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:I know that social media can subconsciously influence the way we perceive ourselves and the world around us. Perhaps try taking a little break/limit time from exposure to social media? It might change the way you dress. Also, I find that educating myself about the world of fashion has really opened my eyes to all the possible things that one can wear, so maybe try reading up on some fashion history/watching educational videos to hopefully gain a deeper appreciation for garments? But honestly, the "real you" should be the you that you feel most comfortable and happiest in. Good luck!	episode_done:True
text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "A Primer on Materials"	labels:Hum it’s definitely an interesting read. I guess nowadays there is more emphasis on ethics and environmental cost when we choose our fabrics, so that would be an interesting add. For example cotton being so much more water hungry than hemp and linen. I was a bit thrown back by the thinsulate entry. Having spent a few years I outdoor retail, I do not really think of it as a textile, more of a insulation, and it’s certainly not the only synthetic insulation or trademark of the sort available.  Edited to add: I re-read my comment and realised it seemed a bit negative overall which is not the vibe I was going for. I think it’s tremendous work and already really helpful, so kudos to the person who wrote it in the first place :)
text:Maybe some quick pros and cons that include environmental concerns? Cotton is a big one I’m familiar with, but polyester is a petroleum product, micro fibers can shed their micro fibers during laundering, etc, etc. I’m sure there are issues with mass wool production or linen too that I’m just not aware of. It’s not really possible to not have any environmental/social impact, but a guide like that could help people make their own choices to balance some of the harms being done. (And it’s independent of brands which may or may not be making things better. Some issues are fairly universal to cotton or poly or whatever and could help guide other consumers as they try to interpret what companies are saying.)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Covid Dilemna - Finding my style	labels:I have been using Le Tote for three years now as a way to try out new styles. It’s a rental box service, but it has “normal” clothes - things I would wear to the office or to dinner with the hubs. Even during quarantine I’ve continued because it gives me new things to look forward to wearing without the need to shop outside my home. And I’ve found brands I really like that I wouldn’t have discovered in my normal routine of Target and JCPenney runs.   I discovered I actually can wear column dresses with my super curvy silhouette as a result. And I’ve tried cropped pants, cold shoulder tops, paper bag waists (they are awful on me), and all sorts of trends I would never have purchased without wearing for a day to make sure it worked for me.  I average 2-3 boxes a month with 5 clothing items, so that would be a slower but safe way to try lots of things.  I’m not trying to spam or anything, but I do have a promo code that gets us both a discount, if anyone has interest.

text:I think it can look amazing regardless of your shape. It's a stiffer material that falls in a very flattering way.	labels:I think they mean for weight gain. Because it's a stiff material, you have to maintain the weight and shape of your body, because the teeniest change will make it uncomfortable/ill-fitting.

text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:I often use:  Short necklaces in gold and silver Long necklaces in gold and silver Watches that match gold and silver Chain bracelets that match gold and silver (but might be string or leather) Diamond (CZ because I lose them so often) stud earrings Pearl stud earrings Gold and silver ball earrings  Gold and silver hoops I only really wear my white gold wedding rings or silicone ones, but I like minimalist gold and silver rings too I wear a camel? Cognac? Colored leather crossbody purse with everything. It’s light enough that I don’t think it looks super weird with black outfits. I do have a black leather tote for things like interviews though.  I have a couple plaid blanket scarves for when it’s really cold out.  Also, I’m not sure if it counts as an accessory, but I love a quilted vest. I live in the south and most of the fall is too hot for a real coat, so I wear a lot of knit long sleeve tees and sweaters with a vest on top. Juuuuust warm enough, makes me feel more put together because of the layers, and has giant pockets.	episode_done:True
