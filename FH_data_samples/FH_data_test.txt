text:Is your username from around when Mad Men was big and blogs everywhere were claiming you HAD to do these 10 things to be extra *dapper*?	labels:I made a tumblr years ago Back in high school  (like 2009) and I called it the the teenage gentleman. It wasn’t for #menswear specifically but more so the whole Barney Stinson/Ted mosby/ how to be a gentleman thing. When I made an IG I kept it the same for consistency, which worked out when I started getting into clothing and posting fits.   I made a Reddit back in college (I graduated at nearly 20 so I was a teen all through university), so I kept it for this too lol

text:Handbag conundrum: lesser know (and lesser seen all over the place) or standard luxury designer bags (think the usual Gucci, YSL, LV, etc.)	labels:Definitely buy what makes you happy. The fact that you have looked at the high end, well known brands and came away disappointed indicates that (this season at least), they aren't for you.   To answer your question directly: for me, personally, showing my own style is 1000% more important than showing the status of a luxury brand. Do the two sometimes overlap? Yes, and that's fine. But I don't personally get buying something *just* because it is a certain brand. Who are you trying to impress? What are you conveying with that logo (wow, you're well off? What kind of message is that, on its own?) I just feel like people who are super into labels, not the design or the style or anything else, just come across as kind of immature? The truth is, anyone worth spending much time with isn't overly concerned with what logo your bag has. (Now! I will concede there is a difference between showing off luxury brands and having higher end items, in some circles. Like, there could be some tension if you're hanging out with super millionaire socialites and everything you wear is from TJ Maxx...but in that case, I'd still say its important to focus on personal style first. And knowing about smaller higher end designers, rather than designers you can buy at a mall, is a whole different thing too...)
text:I feel like showing off the logo is more of a poor person trying to look rich thing. Truly wealthy people don't try to show off like that. Also, a lot of the purses with very prominent logos are fugly.	labels:Truly wealthy people wear whatever they want because they don't have anything to prove or disprove. The Kardashians are very rich yet they have no problem wearing leggings and a t-shirt or being all decked out in Balmain, Gucci, LV.
text:Yeah, I know people with millions of dollars and they definitely have branded clothes/accessories. The main things are they aren't buying them *because* of the brand logo alone and they don't show off the logo. Like, if they're carrying a Chanel bag or whatever, they are just carrying it like a purse, they aren't shifting it so the logo is always visible and holding their arms funny so anyone passing can tell what it is (which is legit something I've seen people do)...but yeah, the idea that every really wealthy person is just minimalist and discreet is pretty laughable.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:The Instagram Account Showing “Ivy’s” More Eclectic Side – Put This On	labels:First point; /r/NavyBlazer is cringe because people legitimately think it is a lifestyle. The other day there was a post and some guy said that he should be trusted because;   -	He drives a Subaru -	Plays Lacrosse  -	is from New England  Instead of saying “nice dog”, the people there say “your dog is so NavyBlazer”. It’s really a cesspool.   Ivy is a breakdown of ‘Trad’ style, whichever way you cut it leaves room for interpretation and that’s the beauty of it. The whole point of Ivy style was rebellion. Kids were tired of wearing the same uniform their fathers wore, so they decided to wear their sweaters under jackets, sneakers with ties, etc.

text:Can You Wear a T-Shirt Under a Blazer and Not Look Like an 1980s Leftover?	labels:I still maintain that a t shirt with a tailored jacket is not a good look. It's a clash of formality.

text:Thanksgiving Outfits	labels:My uniform for thanksgiving tends to be a nice sweater with a necklace paired with leggings so i can eat all day long and not be uncomfortable, but still look decent doing it. But this year it may very well be pjs since nobody is coming over :(
text:I usually wear a t shirt dress, scarf, tights (not the shaping kind), and booties for this reason.	labels:This is brilliant.  I used to always be a dude at Thanksgiving and wear slacks or jeans, so I'm really loving this idea of wearing something that isn't constricting around the waist!
text:I hate pants unless they’re leggings, so I never wear them. I have all kinds of dresses, but for something like Thanksgiving I definitely prefer a looser dress. I’ve also done a wrap dress for Christmas, because I can slightly loosen the waist.	labels:I can get down with jeans that are comfy, I kind of enjoy the feeling of wearing jeans actually. Mostly I live in shorts and skirts, but there is also something comfy to me about wearing something longer and which kinda hugs your body. But when you're celebrating a holiday that revolves around eating a huge meal, it's pretty much the worst thing. Everyone in pants just sitting around being uncomfortable after the meal until they leave Grandpa's house and finally get to undo their fly. Lol. A loose dress does sound a lot more pleasant.  While I transitioned years ago, I usually see conservative family on the holidays, so I still try to dress up en masc, and it's a little ridiculous. Will be nice to have a smaller gathering with just close fam this year (siblings and my mom only, all of whom live together).	episode_done:True

text:NYT: Jil Sander is back, with a new Uniqlo collaboration and a lot of opinions.	labels:Here in Canada all the sizes were pretty much cleared out online by 8AM EST.   I did however, make it to my local Uniqlo and managed to grab some of the pieces I couldn't get online.  &#x200B;  * White Light Down Volume Hooded Coat: Really nice and a lot thicker / more durable than I expected it to be. I have a black Veilance Down jacket which gets a ton of mileage so I'm not sure where this "fits" in my wardrobe.  * Black Merino Cardigan with the Cloud: Surprisingly love this. Looked a little strange / quirky online but actually has a nice drape, interesting hem and a nice contrast patch at the bottom of the buttons.  * Black Oversized Ribbed Blouson: Love the details on this piece (especially the sleeve ribbing). Definitely looks more expensive than your average Uniqlo piece. I got an M and it feels potentially a little TOO oversized. I have a Green S on the way as well so at least will be able to compare.  * Navy Double Faced Work Jacket: Looked boring online but I put it on and loved it. The fit is on point and the drape is amazing. Definitely on the expensive side as it is only 70% wool, but it's like a a nice modern & minimalistic work jacket which can be a little hard to find.	episode_done:True
text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:I'm probably somewhere in $300-$400 per month territory once it's averaged out. I tend to mostly shop during the end of season sales so my spending is heavily weighted in January and June. I'm in my 30's though, so don't feel bad about barely buying clothes, at your age I think experiences are a much better spend. Were I not in the financial position I'm in, clothing would be a fairly low priority item.	episode_done:True

text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I’ve tried to make it exiting by changing my style. We moved from NYC to London just before the pandemic hit so I’ve tried to take the opportunity of working from home and being in a new place to experiment.  I bought some things that are comfy and I actually want to put on without actually just wearing my pyjamas or sweats all day and that’s helped a lot. Stuff I probably never would have worn before like crazy patterned dungarees, doc marten boots and sweaters with clouds on them, etc. I figure now is a good time to experiment because no one is really seeing me anyway	episode_done:True
text:Do you have a childhood fashion icon? If so, does their influence show up in your wardrobe today?	labels:The first time I remember being aware of fashion was when I was obsessed with Harriet’s outfits from the Harriet The Spy movie. I was 9 when the movie came out. I still love a good striped shirt and I dress pretty casually, haha. My teen years were shaped by the Olsen twins boho style.

text:Style rut: Pinterest vs reality	labels:Okay, so people are heckin' rude. What inspires us can be unwearable on our particular bodies, and we're not obligated to wear it. Or maybe we don't want to wear that exact item, but some part of it excites us. It's okay to translate what you loved in a picture into something you feel fits into your everyday life. What gives with your "friend"?  Now, if you find yourself unable to do that -- you're STILL okay. And if you need help, obviously that's why Daily Questions etc exist. Because we weren't any of us born knowing how to style.
text:I love dusty pinks and mauves.  I cannot express how badly those colors look with my skin. I've had *strangers* ask me if I was ok because they assumed someone who resembled a corpse that much must be actually nearing death.   I love heels and very sleek business casual as well as what I can only call ho-fits. I have bad ankles fr from working on concrete floors too many hours, and take public transportation. It's too much of a risk I could sprain my ankle from how much I walk, and I can't afford another sprain. My office is not business casual or sleek, but a no fuss "just don't wear t-shirts with slogans or anything" type of place. I am decidedly over my ho phase, despite my continued love of the clothes.   My fantasy of wearing heeled booties with a structured fashion blazer over a mauve dress is not any less real just because I have the common sense to not go through with it.  Fashion fantasy is still a valid form of participation!	labels:>I love dusty pinks and mauves.  >I cannot express how badly those colors look with my skin. I've had strangers ask me if I was ok because they assumed someone who resembled a corpse that much must be actually nearing death.  My way around this is that over the past 12-8 months Athleta and Lululemon have had a lot of merchandise in these colors so now I have a bunch of athleisure leggings, joggers, and culottes in shades that would make me look dead if they were anywhere near my face but are okay below the waist.
text:I made the mistake of buying dusty pink gym leggings once... followed by a horrifying gym session where every time I spotted myself in the mirror I looked naked from the waist down.

text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:I'm hoping those "Is it Wine o'clock?" shirts (or anything involving  women drinking wine to deal with life) you find at any mall store/Target directed towards adults.   Perhaps it's because I can no longer pass as a youth and will no doubt get thrown into the demographic these companies sell to, but it's always painful when you start to see a trend in clothes and you hate it, and it lasts YEARS.

text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I buy/sell on eBay, Poshmark, depop, and Mercari. There are pros and cons to all of them. For me I’m not trying to make money or save money necessarily—I just want to recycle clothes that didn’t work for me and from everything I’ve read most donated clothes end up in landfills. I also prefer to buy secondhand for similar reasons.   Poshmark definitely has the best customer service. I’ve dealt with a lot of bad sellers (listing the wrong size, clothes not as described etc) and whenever I’ve reached out to Poshmark they basically refund all my money and let me keep the item. On the flip side, as a seller people have unnecessarily complained (item didn’t fit) and Poshmark didn’t allow them to send the item back for a refund—maybe Poshmark gave them a refund and let them keep the item but I wasn’t effected. This is something that REALLY irritates me about eBay—they always take the side of the buyer and u end up having wasted time, money etc shipping something even when u aren’t at fault. I really wish eBay would absorb the costs like Poshmark does, but this is probably why Poshmark has the highest fees.  Ultimately I think the downfall of Poshmark will be the wholesalers and people who are doing it as a side hustle. It’s becoming harder and harder for sellers with 20-30 listings from their actual personal closet to sell things because there’s so much garbage for buyers to sift through. It’s also hard for me as a buyer to find bundles anymore. In the early days sellers closets were made up of actual clothes from their closets so they were all the same size and the style of the person selling. Now if I find something I like it’s impossible to find another item in someone’s closet because there are 500 random listings to sift through.
text:Exactly my problem with it.  I get so excited now when I find a closet that's just a few items all clearly the same size.  Those sellers are usually more reasonable on price too because the items would just get donated.  The people selling full time as a job on there have kinda ruined it for me.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:For a while I struggled with this as well. But then I realized that If you see something that someone else is wearing or is admiring someone’s style, in a way that really is your style too. If you like it on you, you can wear in and have it be a part of you. IMO it doesn’t matter if your style differs from day to day. One time I saw someone with a super cool black outfit on the street and straight up copied it from what I had home, and I loved to wear it! Next day I wore something flowery inspired from a fashion commercial! Felt great in that too.   Clothes can be very fun if you let them! Best of luck.	episode_done:True

text:Sounds like a solid outfit. Any pics?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:I think an important question you should ask yourself before just trying to incorporate color is  are you actually dissatisfied with neutrals/does color really inspire you? I think the biggest reason I wear color is because when I look at it, it makes me happy, it inspires me to want to wear pieces, and I get excited shopping for it.   In looking for color to incorporate in with your neutrals, I would just first find out what colors you feel drawn to - sure maybe some you’ll find will be things you like, but maybe aren’t the most “flattering” or versatile, but I still think that’s a good place to start, because fashion should be fun.   As far as practical advice, wearing color is a lot easier when you have neutrals to pair it with. I tend to wear one bright color/color family with neutral tones and tie it in also with my accessories. Things like earrings or accessories can be good places to introduce color if you are feeling nervous about it as well.  Also, learning about the color wheel and the undertones of colors can be really useful for color matching.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:I think it’s a must but I don’t think it has to technically be a “LBD”. As long as the color is a dark neutral like navy, burgundy, or charcoal it’s fine and a very subtle pattern or texture is okay too, like an obvious woven or tweed. As for the dress part, it could be a non-little dress or even a jumpsuit. For me, I think it’s a relief to have a go to outfit for certain situations. Here are some imaginary ones for someone your age: your boyfriend/girlfriend’s conservative parents decide to surprise visit them at school and they want to take you both to a nice restaurant for dinner tonight; you need to attend a wake for someone who passed away suddenly; you get a call that there’s a new spot open for a highly competitive summer internship and interviews are only a couple days away. In each of these scenarios, it’s so much easier to know that you have a go-to look that is always appropriate especially since some of these can be stressful without worrying about your outfit.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:Whenever possible, I try my match my shoes with my purse, and if that doesn’t work out I try to match with shirt/jacket. Doesn’t have to be an exact match but as long as both are either warm or cold toned I think it usually looks nice!	episode_done:True
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:Just dropping in to say that I find it funny that a 14 year old is afraid of looking older than their actual age. When I was 14, all I wanted to do was to look like a college freshman. People look down their noses at teenagers, (especially teenage girls) and so I tried to fake maturity and experience, because I thought it would be beneficial to me. But then again! I only enjoyed my early twenties for a few blissful years, after which I discovered that I should apparently be grateful for stuff like getting carded (ohmygawd you guys, I'm so happy this stranger thinks I look too young to be legally drinking!!). So I actually get that someone would panic at 14 years of age, if they were aware of the small window of time in which women are allowed to feel satisfied with their looks.   However, there's no way someone is going to mistake you for being in your 20's just because you're dressing "old". You could dress like a truly old woman complete with all the muted/pastel colors, curly short hair, and kitten heels you desire - people would just think you have alternative style.   The reason some people worry about dressing old, is because once you hit your mid-20's, people start aging at much different rates than they did before. So, 35 year old woman could be mistaken as someone in their early 40's who just looks good for their age, because of styling alone. But you are way too young to be worrying about this.   And dark academia isn't even an old-ish style - it reads as slightly naive (mostly in a good way) to most people who actually went to university. In fact this look has more to do with private schools than uni.	episode_done:True

(\*you are here). Lurkers gonna be *mad*.  Upon reflection it really highlighted to me how downright insane the discourse of 10-years-ago-MFA was. Taking the square toes as examples, we had all this "teaching material" about how they were wrong, unflattering and just an all around horrible idea. With the implication that the people who make and wear square toe shoes simply don't know what they are doing.  Yeah, right. The people running one of *the* most profitable and most competitive markets simply didn't know that square toes "don't flatter your foot". They needed randos on the internet to find that out. *Insane*.
text:I'd be down for square toed boots but I don't think I could wear square toe dress shoes with a suit. it's prolly because I've never seen a high quality square toe dress shoe but I can't wrap my head around wearing that with a suit even if it's looser/more relaxed fit	labels:	episode_done:True

text:People who work in the fashion industry - what do you wear?	labels:Congrats on the new job! I'm also working in Toronto, albeit as a production seamstress and studio assistant to a designer right now. I probably have some idea of which factory you might be working at! Since I'm carrying bolts of fabric up stairs, Laying out and cutting markers, as well as working with machinery I just keep it to simple skirts/dresses/turtlenecks that allow for ease of movement. I'm assuming you will be doing a lot of running around and trying to ensure everything's on schedule and things are organized so I would say comfort comes first. Maybe you can keep dressier shoes at your desk so you can wear sneakers while on the factory floor and change out of them if you have to meet clients. My friends who work in corporate offices for Toe Flesh and Canadian Water Fowl are able to get more dressed up because there's less risk of ruining your clothes at the office.	episode_done:True
text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:Not actually a crazy color, but I dyed my hair a natural-looking red for a while. But burgundy looked weird with it, so I dyed it back blonde because burgundy is my favorite color to wear.	episode_done:True
text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Some websites (department stores, ASOS) have a true fit tool where you put in your measurements, body type, and well fitting item of clothing and that information is used to recommend sizing.   It’s also a good idea to know your measurements in general if you’re buying secondhand as many sellers will list the measurements of the garment.  But overall sizing can be so wild within one brand, much less across multiple that I dint think there’s much of a rule of thumb.
text:I second this! I made a note in my phone with all of my measurements and it's saved me a lot of time and money. Before I buy anything I compare my measurements with the websites size guide (I do it for each individual item) and select whatever size *they* have listed for my measurements.   These are measurements I keep personally:  Height Bust Band Waits Hips Hollow to Hemlines  Hollow to floor  Inseam:   For some of these (mainly bottoms) I jotted down my true measurements using a tape measurer and also took measurements of jeans that I already had that fit well.	labels:I did that too, but I don't have all of these. What are the hollow ones?

text:Light Down Jacket Inspiration Album	labels:For me personally, I really like light down jackets.  I know a lot of guides have solidified around the usual classics: harrington, denim, biker, and bomber jackets  but I find myself wearing my light down jacket more often.  They are super light. they fit well and have that same short cut like the others that looks cool. I don't have to worry about piling or shaping as much. they can be very warm too.    and more importantly I find them easier to layer under another coat, while the others fit a bit weirdly.  So light down jackets in fall and spring. then in winter, put them under a wind/water proof coat.  also pairs well with a sweater or fleece vest.	episode_done:True

I had my plants, my floral dresses/blankets, and I started knitting because I loved the look of chunky homemade knits with witchy floral prints.

Got myself a bunch of sweaters and some items from their 1969 line. I'm particularly stoked for the railroad stripe worker jeans, buckleback raw selvedge jeans, and a raw denim peacoat (not sure I'm gonna keep that one, but it looked interesting so I figured I'd check it out and return if I don't like it).	episode_done:True
text:Moncler acquires Stone Island	labels:Unexpected, but interesting. I'd rather Moncler became more like SI than SI became like Moncler, but genius and the RO collab shows that they're willing to be adventurous.
text:My take on this is that it’s easier for Moncler, a premium/high fashion brand to venture into street wear realm with collaborations, than to elevate SI, a streetwear/sort of techwear brand into high fashion - where Moncler operates. I also love how Moncler is pretty selective with who they collaborate with, and on that note, I’m weary of the route Arcteryx (one of my favorite brand for outdoor wear) is going with their recent collaboration with Palace. My fear is they diverge away from their outdoor focus and become another The North Face. But there is still hope - there’s apparently a Jil Sander x Arcteryx in the works.	labels:	episode_done:True

And part of that is wearing something other than sweats. Are there Jean's that are almost as comfortable as sweats?
text:No. But you don’t actually need to be at max comfort every second of every day, most clothing out there isn’t really uncomfortable, but if your baseline is “just as comfortable as sweats” you aren’t gonna find anything.  Anyway, corduroy, heavy cotton twill, and wool are all equally or close to as comfortable as sweatpants ime, and def look more presentable, wool especially is super comfy	labels:>But you don’t actually need to be at max comfort every second of every day  this is my goal tbh	episode_done:True

text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:Honestly the biggest issue with hats for me is wind. Especially in England. I pretty much exclusively wear extremely wide brimmed hats because I'm still doing the  'wide brimmed hat for a witchy vibe' thing - especially on a bad hair day. I find that very feminine romantic looks really suit hats like this and I have similar large straw hats that kinda go with anything soft and flowy in warm weather. The appearance of cottagecore really helped bring back big beautiful straw hats, including ones with large ribbon ties for the neck/chin.	episode_done:True

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I am a bi woman. And while I know it doesn’t hold true for most wlw, I am definitely the ‘femme’ one in the relationship. (Or I would be, if I wasn’t single.) So for me, I would feel the need to dress in a more feminine way. Not saying I would go all 50’s housewives in heels, but even if I wear jeans or dark colours, I would incorporate things like hair ribbons, makeup or even mannerisms to look more ‘feminine’ I guess.   I am aware that I am contributing to the idea that ‘someone in a wlw relationship must wear the pants and the other the skirt’, and I do feel a bit bad for that sometimes. But where I live, the most common wlw relationships (not that you see much of them because Asia), consist of a butch and a femme. I suppose this plays a hand in it.	episode_done:True
text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:1. I'm ambivalent. Tbh, I've been ambivalent about the ownership both pre and post WalMart. I have a lot of friends and family in the Pittsburgh area, which was one of the places where ModCloth is based, and there was a big trend of hiring young grads then mass layoffs. I don't love that in a company.  2. I love the old Modcloth aesthetic. I feel like in the past couple years its lost its vision of what it is or who its customer is. I'm having flashbacks to the awkward 80s officewear that was in all the ads a season or two ago. \*shudders\* But my older Modcloth clothes were all decent quality, with pockets in dresses, and the fit and flare dress aesthetic is very flattering on my body type. I still have quite a few ModCloth pieces, even after changing sizes since my ModCloth heyday, and they are still some of my favorite items that I own. 3. I hope so. But to survive, they're going to have to take a hard look at who their target customer is, and build a vision for themselves as a brand that fits that. And they should be better to their employees, because if you want to build a quirky and fun brand, you want to have all the institutional knowledge you can get to help your business grow. 4. ModCloth in its early days was so good at appealing to quirky but classy customers. People who wanted clothes that were good quality, had a unique aesthetic, had pockets, and were size-inclusive. I think that if ModCloth could embrace the "quirky but high quality" niche that it would grow and retain loyal customers. Brands lose customers when they hit that point where the quality goes downhill but the prices stay the same. And it would be even better if there would also be a focus on ethical and sustainable clothing that still fits the ModCloth vibe, kind of like Madewell but make it vintage.	episode_done:True

text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:I think it would be good to start with some gold and silver necklaces that you can layer like basic chains with charms and some some hoop earrings, pearls, or diamond studs. You can even get some colorful jewelry for statement pieces or a pop or color. And I would say get a black belt and a brown belt cause they can go with anything almost.
text:Great ideas, thank you! I just realized...I don't own any belts! Haha so that's on my list now too.	labels:If you're into thrifting, belts are a great piece to buy second hand! So many cool statement belts, and almost always tons of classic leather staples belts too.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: What is the difference between off the rack (OTR), made to measure (MTM) and Bespoke?	labels:/u/blackstrider has a great TL;DR but I'll add a bit more detail to MTM and Bespoke.  MTM: The pattern/style is generally pretty fixed, often there aren't fittings, and you make adjustments by changing standard measurements like "I want to add 0.5" to the leg opening". Pretty flexible format but I find it takes a couple of garments to really figure things out which can be tough.  Bespoke: Often a pattern is created for *you*, there are multiple fittings (in-person). This is where you can get really specialized tailoring looking at the pitch of you arms, how much you round your shoulders, etc. Bespoke tailors/cordwainers will also have styles that they specialize in so don't go to a tailor that specializes in structured "English drape" if you're looking for a casual unlined jacket or something.
text:I would make the analogy to a custom home.  There are your garden variety semi custom home builders that build large communities.

text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:I suggest you to watch movies or tv shows.

text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I'd get a really nice piece of outerwear, either a coat in a quality material like wool or a leather or shearling jacket. If you live somewhere with colder weather during part of the year, outerwear is something you'll be wearing all the time so it's worth investing in a piece that's great quality, keeps you warm and makes a statement. I think an amazing jacket or coat will elevate even the most basic outfit, whether it's a more classic piece, something utilitarian like a puffer jacket or something more extravagant. Personally I think Acne, Chloe and Tibi are brands that make great high-end outerwear in a variety of styles.

text:General Discussion - January 01, 2021	labels:Hi all! I think this is the place for my comment/question. I've always been told my magazine and fashion outlets that dressing for my bodytype (atheletic boyish rectangle no stomach hips or boobs lol) that I needed to focus on creating the illusion of having curves and wear aline or circle skirts and frilly tops that put emphasis on my boobs. It works and I feel good, but when I take it off I start to feel like a fraud. Like I'm selling a body or image that isn't me and feel bad about it. I know its all about self love but I want to start dressing for MY body and feeling good not dressing to create a body I don't have
text:I have a similar body type, though recently it’s gotten very slightly curvier. I’ve felt the same way, but literally everyone does this, not just us! Clothes create illusions. You’re not a fraud at all.   I’d also consider who you’re dressing for, like the other reply said. If you love what you wear obviously don’t do different because of something I say! But I felt a lot better about myself when I stopped trying to change my body type with clothes (which doesn’t mean I stopped wearing all of my more “flattering” pieces). But I actually found a lot more confidence dressing in clothes that are easier for us to pull off. For me, that’s 1920s and 1960s inspired dresses. The “sack” shape and drop waists are actually often really flattering on us (even with my short legs) and it’s unique because most people don’t find them flattering.   Yes, I probably look less traditionally sexy. But I’ve gotten lots of positive comments on the style that mean more to me anyway. I’ve gotten “Mad Men” comments so some people think it’s sexy anyway!   My advice is to step out of your comfort zone and try to find things that make you feel wonderful outside of people’s expectations of what your naked body should look like.   Good luck! I’m sure you look stunning.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:As I wait to hear if I have to evacuate due to CA wildfires, here’s a hypothetical I had to do: you have time to prepare before your evacuation and pack up your car. What clothes do you bring and why?	labels:sneakers, tons of undies, and lots of socks, bra  Every spring I pack a "basement bag". In case we have a tornado and have to go to the basement for shelter and our house gets obliterated I want a bag of essentials so we can be mildly clean. I mainly focus on underclothes and always a pair of sneakers. The idea of navigating a disaster in flip flops or anything but sneakers sounds awful to me. I try and throw clothes in that can be worn in public or around the house, so nothing too ratty. I'd also suggest a pair of work gloves in case you have to handle anything. I guess I'm not sure how life works during a fire disaster. Is it like a  tornado where if you get flattened then you're focusing on clean up? What about work? If you have work clothes consider packing an outfit or two in case you have to go into work. I'm sorry you have this stress to deal with, how scary it all must be.

text:BoF: J. Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:i just feel like their price points are so high and the quality can be kind of mediocre. they’re stuck in a weird place where their pricing is too expensive for the average consumer who’s trained to expect bargains and too cheap for someone who buys luxury or higher end pieces.   even with their random extra 50% off sales, it’s still above what people expect to pay. but then again, madewell is thriving. (though i think that has more to do with being able to capture an on-trend aesthetic.)
text:The wildest thing to me is that Madewell has really consistent sizing and I'm able to order online with confidence about what will fit. I have ordered a bunch of things and haven't needed to return or exchange a single one. By the end of last year, J. Crew was the most inconsistent sizing of any brand I think I've ever encountered. I could take 15 items of the same size into a dressing room and all 15 of them would fit like shit in totally different ways. It means online shopping is essentially unavailable to me - in this economy, no less. They've maintained those price points while spiraling out re: their supply chain.	labels:I feel like JCrew *used* to be more consistent. I used to have faith that a size 6 Perfect Shirt was, indeed, a perfect fit for me. I owned three of them in white alone. That hasn't been the case in recent years, and it's a shame.   Besides inconsistent fit, there's also just been some bizarre merchandizing decisions. Last March, right before all this (gestures at 2020) went down, I went into a JCrew looking for work pants. I did not find a *single pair of full length pants.* I mean, I can understand gearing up for spring, but ... no pants? at all? Some decisions just don't make sense.

text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:There are a few brands that do this (Vince and Theory are the ones I've encountered...). Back when I worked in a more formal industry I was shopping for a Theory suit. At Nordstrom Rack the suit was unlined and a wool/poly blend. At Nordstrom the suit was wool with a poly half-lining. And at the Theory flagship in NYC the suit was pure wool with some natural or cellulose full lining (it's been a few years... but it definitely wasn't poly). This was ostensibly the same suit - similar silhouette and the same name, just a few numbers on the product ID differed. And of course the fit when I tried them on was noticeably different, from the Rack one being like a very cheap imitation, the Nordstrom one being pretty good, and the flagship one fitting like a glove.   Similarly, I recently bought some AllSaints moto boots from 6pm fully expecting them to be a diluted version. Instead they were the same cow leather lined with goat leather I tried in store. Considering how these things usually go, a happy surprise (no way in hell are they worth the $450 at full price). Side note: 6pm secretly lists most of their stock on Amazon with Prime fulfillment, which is great because their return policy sucks.

text:Fall/winter shoe trends: what's your dream wishlist?	labels:I always end up just wearing the same couple of pairs of boots during the winter, and I think that will probably continue because of the pandemic... comfort will be king! But these things are still on my vague wishlist:  * some sleek OTK black suede boots with a flat heel  * black, comfortable sock boots with a low heel * some slouchy flat gray suede boots, I don't know if these are in this year but I just kind of want to look like Robin Hood * a new pair of really soft, insulated, waterproof pull-on winter boots. I have a pair of dark brown UGGs (not the classic style, they look more like regular boots) that have served me well for years but for whatever reason I'm itching for a new pair. Was thinking of Mukluks but they're really A Look and I guess something more neutral might work better with the rest of my clothes. (But should I care? I don't know)  * A pair of soft suede moccasins as casual slip-ons for Fall--I'd go ahead and buy, but I can't quite decide on a color, black or cognac or warm brown or gray...? * Allbirds in a bright color with a colored sole. This one is particularly frivolous, because I already have neutral-colored ones, but I saw a friend wearing some teal ones with teal soles and they looked so cool	episode_done:True

text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:The first step is knowing what you have - colors, shapes/silhouettes, patterns, etc. and what makes you feel comfortable. The best outfit means nothing if you're uncomfortable/self conscious in it.  A few tricks that have worked for me until I got more comfortable with my closet and could slowly evolve it and venture out:  \- Black or other neutrals are your friend. Pair with a pop of color or a fun pattern. This made breaking things down for me much easier.  \- Find complementary accessories. Statement bracelet, necklace, earrings, scarf, blazer. Whatever you like. Even adding this one element can tie things together.  \- Try different combos of what you have together. Figure out what you feel comfortable in and what shapes work together and what colors you actually like together. One concept that works for me is if I wear more fitted on the bottom, I put something a little looser on top or vice versa.  One thing that really helped me when I had to elevate my wardrobe game for work stuff was a trick I heard they teach associates at a fancy pants store. I don't know if this is actually true but I still found the concept helpful: every outfit should have 3-4 pieces. Skinny Jeans/camisole/cardigan/statement earrings- wham! Leggings/sweater/scarf. This has helped me when I'm staring at my closet with a sweater and jeans wondering if I can do something else to snazz it up.  If you're interested in working with color, I would suggest just browsing about color theory to see if there are some ideas there that may inspire you on things that may work together. Also figuring out what colors work with *your* skintone/hair/eyes is very helpful in narrowing things down.  **That was a long way of saying, try things out and observe the types of styles/outfits you like, what works for your own lifestyle/needs, and just have fun with it!**	episode_done:True

text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:Where are you from? Are you a student or a working adult? What is your budget and purpose of dressing up? Do you have any spare weekend to go into a megastore (e.g. Zara, your local department store...) to try out all types of colors and silhouettes to see what suits you? You're not obligated to buy even if you try it on. If anyone ask, just say you're just trying out and still thinking about it.             I suggest knowing your measurements (use a measuring tape!) and sticking to a capsule wardrobe. Black/White top + colorful bottom or colorful top + black/white/brown bottom with neutral shoes.       Keep in mind the stylish people on social media spend a ton on their clothes or rent/return them after taking photos so they are not exactly appropriate comparisons for everyone.	episode_done:True

text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Hi! Former stylist.  1) Pay attention to the fit of things and figure out what cuts and shapes look good on you. Paper bag pants and some joggers have similar fits. Some mini skirts and shorts hit the same place on your legs and can have the same waist height. Find your sweet spot and don’t be afraid to buy multiple things in silhouettes that work for you.   2) Get some statement pieces that you would die for. If you are wearing a pair of jeans that fit well and a t-shit purchased within the past 3 years with some awesome earrings you going to look and feel great. If you are wearing an amazing dress and simple white sneakers you are going to look and feel great. Don’t overthink things but try and wear at LEAST one piece you are excited about at a time.   3) Don’t buy things just cause they are on sale, you saw your friend wearing it, or you feel like you “need” something in your wardrobe. You should love everything in your closet in its own special way unless it’s workwear and you hate your dress code for work. Something as simple as a T-shirt has so many different factors like cut, material, neckline, sleeve length. Purchase what feels good and don’t bother with the rest.
text:This is a perfect list, I would also add that you should not be afraid to break out of any style rules that you have. One thing I do when making myself break a random “rule” I made up for myself is to buy a realistic version (a color/fabric/style I already like/own) and wear the new/weird thing somewhere easy. I just forced myself to buy and wear a kimono top/jacket this way. It was a matching set and I had already bought the pants and had worn them, but didn’t buy the top because I just don’t wear kimonos.   So I bought the kimono top and wore the outfit to my sister’s house first for just a regular hang out, and then I wore it “publicly.” (It’s not really public rn but I wore it to see someone in my non-fam bubble LOL.) After wearing it around at my sister’s house I felt comfortable in it and it no longer felt like a weird thing to wear.   This doesn’t always work, sometimes I just won’t like something, but if I’m drawn to it and the only reason I’m not getting it is because of some internal rule I made up, it usually works.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I have at least 20 frames.  Some of them are no longer my prescription but I don’t want to get rid of them. I buy them from zenni but also wherelight and some other places. They are most definitely an accessory because sometimes I need them to stand out more or less depending on my outfit.   My eye doctor has me wearing progressive lenses now so the price has gone up significantly on my everyday glasses so I don’t have the same selection I used to. However, I can see just as well out of my $60 zennis as I can out of my $400 frames from the eye doctor.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 20, 2021	labels:My partner is now officially my spouse.

They vetoed me posting pictures (we have public facing jobs, these pictures are all over social media, too easy to reverse image search etc.), but they wore a Rick Owens dress (that I picked out) while I went full minimalism with a collarless shirt with onyx studs, a sleek blazer and cropped trousers. I put this together from my existing wardrobe, since we didn't want to spend a lot. Covid measures made things a bit weird, but the court officer made a real effort into making it nice, which was great. (edit: just so nobody thinks we are totally irresponsible: it was literally just us at city hall, no guests, no party. We'll catch up with that after vaccination.)

Like I wouldn't wear a sequined micro mini or ballgown to my office job, but I would absolutely wear a velvet suit and a bunch of brooches. I have also noticed that when I wear pieces that I love, my confidence increases throughout the day. Sometimes I have moments in the day where I look down and think "dang, this outfit is cool and I feel cool!" Those moments just give me a boost of confidence all on their own. The last thing is that people are generally too busy with their own lives to notice what you're wearing. They're doing them, so do you and have fun with it!   edit-words

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:Hi! As a stylist I get this question ALOT. For starters don't get rid of too much before buying replacements. What ends up happening is we get rid of everything without establishing what pieces we actually need.   Start with establishing your personal style. What do your want your closet/style to be? What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping! Now that you have a moodboard and list of things you need you can shop to fin in the gaps and more importantly you can shop with intention!   &#x200B;  I hope that wasn't too much and was helpful haha. I'm always happy to help.
text:That's actually really helpful! How do you suggest finding my style? I feel like I have such a wide style that I wear (minimal, to punk, to cutesy, etc).

A great way to start would be to hop on Pinterest and create a board of everything that speaks to you. Type in feminine type in punk etc.   It’s not terrible to not wear things for months but you mentioned wanting to create more of a capsule minimal wardrobe. So that’s something you should decide now to help you going forward.	episode_done:True

text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:I’m in Toronto, Canada.  By January, no one is wearing cute outfits anymore... it’s all goose-down water resistant parkas, balaclavas, Uniqlo heattech long-johns under thick jeans and heavy boots.  But before it gets to those super extreme sad months, I like wearing a short fitted puffer jacket with a winter down miniskirt over leggings and doc martens.  The short jacket makes me feel like I still have a shape and the down miniskirt keeps my bum warm and looks cute.

text:Google a work around or pay for the subscription. Writers deserve to get paid for their work.  For the record, I didn't run into a paywall.	labels:I would agree if it were the writers benefiting from paywalls. The writers are on an annual salary.
text:The reason the NY Times can pay their writers a salary is that it makes money from subscriptions, this isn't hard to understand.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What rockstar(s) you take fashion inspiration from? What do you like about their style?	labels:For me, early Cat Power.  White T-shirts, vintage men's jeans and vintage jean jackets.  Chan Marshall was my style icon circa 2000.  The cover of the album Moon Pix was IT for me.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:Short of getting a bit of insider info, I think the only way to really have success at those stores is to browse them at least once a week (probably twice).  My aunt tends to go every other day and finds some amazing stuff…because she goes *every other day*.  She says it doesn’t take her long because she’s so familiar with their stock, but it still seems exhausting to me.  (As opposed to spending three hours scrolling through Poshmark in bed every night…)
text:mmmmm the Poshmark doom scroll. MOOD	labels:my poshmark routine:  searches for specific brand  includes filter for only the specific brand  is shown listings for 30 different brands and barely anything for the one I chose, become agitated, close window	episode_done:True
text:Where do you get good quality, legit wool sweaters that won't rip/shrink after washing?	labels:I haven't washed my new wool sweaters yet but I handwashed the armpits of one sweater using woolite and it worked really well. I've been wearing t shirts or undershirts under my sweaters so they last longer between washes - this also reduces the scratchiness. Maybe this would help preserve your sweaters?	episode_done:True
text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:Decent homewear. Especially robes that aren't bathrobes nor these dainty fragile satin/chiffon thingies. Something cozy enough to set up shop on your couch in, that won't break on the first scoot, actually keep your arms warm.   In loungewear there's apparently four types with no middle ground: For mothers-formerly-known-as-women,  for girls, for seduction purposes only, and Jeff Lebowski.
text:I got a Natori robe as a gift that was perfect! It’s a nice t shirt like material with a very flattering cut but not seduction level sexy.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How to combine colors	labels:To be honest, a lot of these resources read like the kind of infographics MFA used to upvote; there's the trifecta of pseudo-objective diagrams (e.g. color wheels), dubious pop-psychology (e.g. colors' subconscious associations), and simple but misleading theory (e.g. "seasonal" color schemes) for lurkers looking for 'rules' to bind them.  And like those infographics, I feel that most of these are, at best, an attempt to transform the act of "looking at things and using your brain" into tractable but useless theory (compare: any time someone tries to create a head-shape matrix for glasses), and at worst pretty much junk (particularly the psychology bits). They're also usually based on the fucky assumption that a conventional white American beauty standard is objectively "correct."  Prevailing trends and cultural/subcultural context are way more meaningful determinants of how to use color than a set of temporally/culturally specific rules, and frankly I think the only way to understand those is experience: looking, doing, and thinking. "Caucasians shouldn't wear all black because it offsets their undertone and makes their skin look less vibrant," for instance, sounds reasonable up till you look at actual people who look perfectly fine in it.	episode_done:True

text:Best of Techwearclothing 2020	labels:I dig techwear. I think it is probably the style most likely to bring lasting change to what we consider normal.  I bought an Acronym 3rd Arm bag back in like 2010. Still think it’s awesome. Just the perfect mix of tech and milspec.  You don’t have to go all in if you don’t want. But it’s the people pushing the boundaries that get it to the point where it becomes more accessible.	episode_done:True
text:Rick Owens Wearing Rick Owens	labels:I don't own a single piece of his clothing, and I probably never will, but one of the quotes attributed to him that really stuck with me when I first started browsing mfa was "No outfit is going to make you look or feel as good as having a fit body. Buy less clothing and go to the gym instead." He was right.
text:Hadn’t heard the quote, but it’s something I naturally came to realize about myself and the people I was aspiring to dress like.  They often do more for the clothes than the clothes do for them. Confidence is just as crucial as fitness.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What’s your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:I wear a cuddl duds bodysuit under almost every outfit. It really makes a difference and is sold at a reasonable price point.   I agree it’s hard to be fashionable up north! I don’t wanna expose my ankles!! Wide leg styles let too much cold air on my precious legs! Put a scarf on it!	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 22, 2020	labels:So uh...capes.
text:Honestly really fascinating to me.   MFA lurkers *love* to talk on and on and on about bringing back capes but literally anything else that's outside the box is met with weird stuff like "My shitty negative opinion of a general concept is equivalent to constructive criticism for a specific case of advice." Aka "I don't like this thing so no one should wear it ever."  Everything from pearls to no-show socks, henleys, denim jackets, etc. are all controversial but man capes. *Capes*. We just have to bring back capes.	labels:This is the weirdest part of it by far, the fucking white tee shirt album got flak and yet everyone is clamoring to wear a fucking cape again?
text:All of these weirdos talking big shit about how they'd laugh at someone wearing $thing on the street but at the same time just want to be told what clothes to wear to "walk into a club and get some pussy" I fucking can't.  They want that "sweet spot" where a random internet collective can recommend to them exactly what to wear to their local dive bar to instantly "get pussy" when walking in, but it can't stand out "too much" but also can't be "too boring" otherwise the guy wearing a different button up shirt is going to get "all the pussy"  I'm gonna go jump off a cliff now.	labels:MFA, how much pussy (on a scale from some to A LOT) will I get if I walk into a club with Ryan Gosling's Drive jacket or Blade Runner coat?
text:Blade Runner Coat: +10 pussy  Talking about getting pussy unironically: -1,000,000 pussy  Thinking about dating and clothes like it's DnD: -1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.... pussy	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 23, 2020	labels:I'd like to expand my knowledge about 90s fashion, brands, and styles. Particularly the way Jerry Seinfeld dressed on his show.   I would like to be pointed in the right direction on:  1. Brands of this style (jackets, shirts, bottoms, etc.) 2. Fit for men of this style 3. any other resources!  &#x200B;  Thanks!
text:I was just watching a bunch of Seinfeld episodes with my kids and took some mental notes on Jerry’s style. He kind of has a uniform consisting of a baggy OCBD (often in unusual bold or pastel colors) tucked into slim-fitting jeans. The current oversized trend doesn’t really replicate what Jerry is doing with his shirt fits, as his button-down is generally too big all around — his shoulder seams often extend well past his natural shoulder and his pit-to-pit is a full 4 inches or larger than his natural chest. Check out the J. Crew 1994 line, which uses patterns from around that time period and can capture that billowy silhouette. The jeans are probably just Levi’s.  For outerwear, LL Bean and Eddie Bauer capture the vaguely outdoorsy casual vibes he usually gives off, things like barn coats and parkas. You never see him in a sleek wool topcoat.  When Jerry is performing, he’s usually in a loose-fitting sportcoat with big shoulder pads — your best bet there would be to look at vintage Gucci from the 90s on the secondhand sites.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:This is probably an unpopular opinion here since a lot of the ffa users think fashion is a manual that you have to study, but if you don't like colours? Don't wear em. Don't like jewelry or makeup? Don't wear em. It's just body covers- do what makes you feel good. Not everyone was made to be a timeless, effortless fashionista. We don't all need to look like an off duty Instagram influencer and shouldn't have to dress a certain way because someone on the Internet said it was 'right.	episode_done:True

What you can do is not support them.  The fashion *blog* alone will not survive. The future is social media. That's unfortunate as I don't really care much about social media.

text:General Discussion - November 13, 2020	labels:I’m start to get a hair across my ass about people getting obsessed with the “quality” of potential purchases. Especially when it’s in regards to entry level brands.
text:I don't think it's going to go away. I think that's going to be the Millennial version of the Greatest Generation's relative pack rat and frugal mentality.   Two recessions in twelve years when we're in our 20s and 30s... if we're gonna spend money, it better be worth it.	labels:For me it's more the refusal to accept that a $100 leather jacket can only be so good, and that a $500 leather jacket can be objectively better in terms of quality.	episode_done:True

text:When did skinny jeans go out of fashion?	labels:skinny jeans haven't been on trend since at least 2015-2016 imo. that's when mom jeans became all the rage.  That being said, skinny jeans are pretty much staples for most people. They go with a lot of outfits and make a lot of looks.   Just because something isn't currently on trend, does not mean it can't be stylish.
text:I don’t think it’s mom jeans but straight legged jeans that are currently popular	labels:Yeah plus wide leg jeans. Not JNCOs, but still wide, high waisted and long. I see wide and slightly cropped jeans too.	episode_done:True
text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:H&M is pretty good! I have a lot of dressy stuff from there. It’s not dirt cheap but it is pretty cheap, especially when things are on sale.

text:General Discussion - December 01, 2020	labels:lol I just remembered I wrote fan mail to Thom Browne and he never replied  Edit: before you jerks make this into copypasta let it be known I did this in middle school
text:I’d like to preface all this by saying I don’t know where else to post this on Reddit. I figure the best method to achieve the end goal is to branch out and see if anything comes back. I’d also like to preface the following: I rarely ask favors of people as it’s always been my understanding not to lean on others for help. However, I’m dead in the water. I’ve attempted to complete this mission myself, but it’s not lead anywhere significant because of level of importance this person possesses. I was hoping the Reddit community could play a part in accomplishing it with me. I’ve always seen Reddits and watched a bunch of the videos of the community on YouTube. Honestly you are a bunch fun loving individuals and have accomplished crazy things from what I’ve seen.  From working on a nuclear reactor, to climbing Mt. Everest, and even diving in a submarine to 1,500 get below the oceans surface: nothing has made me shake or to be as nervous as my dream of meeting Thom Browne. I would like to meet Thom Browne.(Fashion designer and business mogul) I have two of his known addresses but as a man of that importance I’m sure he’s not at either typically with all the international business he conducts. I’d also like to point out that I’m currently a nuclear engineer in the U.S. Navy. There are a few restrictions I have due to this. Therefore, I cannot have a computer. I’d further my investigation through those means if those were viable.  Since I’ve joined the Navy, I’ve not been able to keep up the development of my programming and hacking skills. My heart would have immense renitence if I didn’t ask you this: Can you find a way to put me in contact with Thom Browne? Anything would help; from his personal cell phone, to being in the same room, or his future known future location, etc... You will be compensated handsomely at the end of this daring mission. I do know how difficult this is or could be, but I would not ask if it wasn’t important to who I became today.	labels:I should’ve fucking known someone was gonna do this to me	episode_done:True
text:How to build an age-suitable varied chic wardrobe?	labels:>French chic and preppy school girl  Have you ever heard of the brand Claudie Pierot? It's suitable for your age, but it's really perfect for this. It's probably too pricey, but maybe you can copy that style elsewere. Also, I am East Asian - women tend to look very young and our fashion is geared a lot towards looking youthful as well. Maybe you can get some inspiration with how we style stuff too.  Anyways, I remember how hard it was as a teen to hear "dress however you want and don't worry about it" from people and have it mean anything (hell, that's the case for me even now in my mid-thirties). So I'll just say this - people will definitely notice if you dress differently than them, but they are less likely to think you're trying "too hard" if you don't act differently (better or different than them, seeking validation, etc. etc.) because of how you dress or if you avoid drawing attention to your clothes specifically (like name dropping brands or styles or being not willing to go certain places or do certain things because you're not dressed appropriately).	episode_done:True

text:What ultimate-splurge fashion item would you buy to reward yourself for achieving a big milestone?	labels:I usually buy solid gold jewelry. Something timeless that will last forever and I'll wear forever. My most recent purchase was a pair of simple 45mm 14k gold hoops.
text:Why 14k vs 22k?	labels:22/24k is more popular in APAC, 18k is the most popular and common  in Europe and the Americas. Partially attributable to different skin tones, partially due to hardness, partially due to diff cultural value placed on gold as store-of-value.
text:Thank you for your reply!   I’m getting downvoted but like ??? I’d never heard of anyone buying below 22 k and I’m Indian. Jewelry isn’t just a pretty thing to look at, it’s an investment	labels:People who're not aware of differing cultural preferences likely interpreted it as snobbish rather than a genuine question rooted in curiosity and desire too learn about another culture's jewelry preferences.   I'm white AF and exclusively buy white or rose/pink gold, which to my Indian friends is seen as sacrilege (have to replate things?!?!), but I assume any fine jewelry I buy will at-best be passed down to my children and most likely have its value trend to zero. In my culture if you want to gift a safe investment, you buy bonds or straight up cash.	episode_done:True

text:My Gucci Addiction: Vanity Fair editor Buzz Bissinger's essay about spending $638k on clothes	labels:The line in the piece that stuck out for me was when he said he was on medication for "mild bipolarity."  The out-of-control spending, the hypersexuality, the losing a job due to temper outbursts...I'm not a psychiatrist, I just play one on the internet, but all of that put together  sounds like, at the very least, untreated hypomania.  To pass it off as only shopping addiction or "discovering himself" seems like underplaying some serious mental illness.

text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:Honestly, I can tell you are still young (mid-20s) from the nature of the question. It depends on lifestyle much more than age. Plenty of 40 and even 50-somethings wear trendy non-conservative clothing especially in creative or tech industries, while plenty of 20-somethings dress like dads because they have more corporate jobs. But as you get older, you do shift brands a bit. For example, currently, 20-somethings might still desire streetwear brands like Supreme, Vetements, and Yeezys while those older might still be hip but shifted to Fear of God, Balenciaga, CDG or more upscale brands that still have a casual street vibe.

text:What is your favorite clothing/accessories subscription box?	labels:I got free Stitchfix credit from a friend, so I've used Stitchfix a couple of times. (disclaimer: I haven't tried anything else). I was very specific about my body type in the profile section, and after the first box I was very specific to the stylist about what types of clothes I wanted to try and what I didn't like. There's also a small extra info box on your profile where you can mention specifics, e.g. looking for more business casual pieces, would never wear X things, live in a warm climate, etc.      I think styling services like Stitchfix work best when you know yourself well— for example, I'm petite, proportionally really short legs, and I know what doesn't work for me (animal prints, dots, shift dresses, low heels). I specifically noted items that I felt like had a low chance of success in terms of fit (e.g. jeans, blazers) and casual items (not worth the $$) as items that I did not want to receive.     The more specific you can be, the better a box you'll get. This does mean that you're less likely to need the help of a stylist to find pieces for you, but it can be fun to try on things you wouldn't have picked up on your own.	episode_done:True

I would probably judge more on whether it is too overpowering.   I've always worn one that I think is nice, but I now wonder if it's too smoky when my clothing choices aren't overly feminine, so I'm wondering if I should mix it up with something more floral. Perhaps wear the smoky one when I'm in feminine outfits and wear something more floral when I'm in less feminine clothing.	episode_done:True

text:Do you feel the black Friday sales better or worse than usually this year? Is it worth to buy clothing you won't wear until next year?	labels:The sales are about the same as last year.

Looking forward to never having to replace these black tights ever again.  I’ve been in the market for a camel coat and black leather jacket for a couple years, but haven’t found the perfect one to pull the trigger on either yet.

text:Shitpost Saturday: the Festival of Clothing	labels:Well I have this dress I got at Kohl’s I think 12 years ago. It is a floral dress. After maybe a year the hem fell out. And that was ok because that raw hem matched the raw hem on the flounce sleeves. I never got around to getting it fixed. And those extra 2 inches made it more versatile for biking and work. Most amazingly, this dress has worked as my size has gone up or down 2 sizes.  It goes in the dryer, it doesn’t wrinkle, and works equally well as a pool coverup and wedding guest attire. It is a magic dress.	episode_done:True
text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:I used to do modeling and wore a lot of designer stuff for shoots. They're just clothes, some are comfortable and some are not. I was never overly impressed.	episode_done:True

text:What ultimate-splurge fashion item would you buy to reward yourself for achieving a big milestone?	labels:Probably a Cartier Tank or Panthere watch.  I love the little Fossil watch that my husband bought me four years ago; but something about it is getting wonky, like it'll stop and start randomly and the second hand has fallen off twice.  It might be time to invest in a "forever watch" in the near future.     Edit:  The ultimate spurge would be a Chanel classic flap for my mom.  When I was in law school (and pretty broke), I gave my mom two Chanel lipsticks for Christmas and wrote in the card:  one day, this will be a bag.

Other days, I catch a glimpse of a saggy tit in a bralette peeking out of my dress and wonder if that's like...the least sexy thing in the world for a 28 year old woman?  I feel you here in many ways, except a bit of the opposite with my A cup boobs. Some days I can rock the no bra look and feel like a million bucks, and some days I look in the mirror and think "who is that little boy trying to wear grown up clothes?" I've been trying to ignore that voice and I'm having less of those days as time goes on.	episode_done:True
text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:A well fitted black wool coat in a cut that flatters you. It goes with any outfit. You can dress it up or down, and on early mornings taking the kids to school or late night runs to the store you look like you have your shit together even if your sans bra and wearing 3 day old leggings.
text:This! Though it could really be any colour that flatters you and goes with most of your wardrobe. I have a bit of a wool coat obsession, but it started with a black one back in 2010. The longer and more luxurious, the better...  Come to think of it, a good wool coat, a cashmere turtleneck and a pretty pair of block heeled ankle boots all landed in my wardrobe at the same time that year. I didn't have a lot of clothes at the time, so it was a big, instant level-up.	labels:	episode_done:True

I'm willing to spend up to 200$ per article of clothing IF it is something special, but I would like to spend between 50-100. I live in seattle. I am 6'4, have black thin oily hair, and medium to dark skin. I'm of pakistani descent. I'd rather not post a picture if myself here but I can dm if the information isn't enough to make suggestions. I'd like suggestions for clothes for all four seasons	episode_done:True
text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:I'd say to some degree yes. Most fashion houses are rtw/couture first and accessories second. They dipped into the handbag and accessories market to make more money, but the real quality (and bread and butter) for most fashion houses is their rtw.   Chanel is in this weird spot where they're trying to outrun the secondhand market and regain the exclusivity they once had. They're trying to be Hermes but they could never be Hermes because Chanel is not known for their leather.   So yes, I think when it comes to handbags/SLGs/accessories most luxury houses are trying to put out the latest and greatest and kind of mimic fast fashion to some degree. They're appealing to a market that can't afford to become their regular clientele. The people whom they can't text when the latest $7000 tweed jacket is released each season and know that they can walk away with a $10,000+ sale. So brands are trying to push out the latest and greatest handbags, SLGs and shoes.   In terms of rtw, I do think the traditional fashion calendar is very fast paced, but several brands have said they will step away from the traditional calendar and cut it back down to 2-3 releases per year. It will be interesting to see what this means for S/S and F/W collections.   Commenting more on the handbag/accessories market:  I say this as someone is kind of handbag crazy, but I do wish people would do more research about the brands and bags they purchase. People assume that just because a bag is marked up it's handmade by an artisan who specializes in leather but that isn't the case for most brands.   If anyone is looking for Hermes alternatives I highly suggest Delvaux. Valextra and Moynat also have fantastic craftsmanship. But I bought my first box leather bag from Delvaux last year and it's on a completely different level from Chanel.

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Disclaimer-- I know myself well enough to know that a capsule wardrobe is not for me.  When I get back from traveling, I cannot wait to wear different clothes.  Consider your laundry situation.  Having a smaller wardrobe means that you will be doing laundry more often.  If you're one in a family of 6, it may not be a big deal.  But for a single apartment dweller (pay per load), the additional costs can add up quickly.   Because I pay per load, I make sure that I maximize the capacity and only wash full loads (I'm paying the same no matter the capacity).  I am not one to hand-wash clothes in a bathroom sink.  Not now, not ever!   I do laundry roughly every other week alternating lights and darks.  (Sheets and towels are their own ballgame, and I will sometimes throw things in with them.)
text:Just curious but why didn't you get a washing machine for the apartment?	labels:I live in the Bay Area of California. Only apartments built in the last 15 or so years have in unit laundry. Most places are older because the bay never wants to build any housing and has under built for 40+ years now.    They cost anywhere from 50% to 100% more if it is in a more urban part, or you can move to a more suburban place further out. If you have rent control like me the price delta is 2.5X what I am currently paying for rent.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:I see it as a part of nature with my frame, there's tolerable not fitting quite right then there's fits so off it either isn't bought or is tailored depending on how much I like it.

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.
text:I’m the opposite.  People assume I’m a lesbian for my love of distressed denim, nicer t-shirts, leather jackets, converse and Birkenstock’s. I also have an undercut residing beneath my bob (was a pixie pre-pandemic) and pay a lot of money to have my hair dyed untraditional colors. I’m not a lesbian. I am queer in the fact that I’m ace, but it’s always pissed me off that people assume your sexuality based on the way you dress. I just like to be comfy, my dudes.	labels:I feel this too.

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:Several reasons:  It depends on who "you" is. Some people do wear runway-esque looks on the day to day (usually the same kinds of people who are really in to looking at runway shows). E: actually I don't think I made this point strongly enough: even for the weirdest, most abstract, least practical runway look you can think of there are people who are looking at it and thinking "that's dope, I want to look like that". People who are fans of that sort of thing aren't looking at them like paintings in a gallery, in many cases they really would dress like the runway looks if cost and practicality allowed.   Couture starts at like five figures, so it's a good guess that "you" can't afford it.  Runway shows are in part about image making, i.e. producing photos that will look cool on social media, or in trade magazines or coffee table books down the line. Sometimes this takes priority over displaying clothes you can actually buy, which is how you get things like Craig Green's sculptures, or Gucci's severed heads, or Thom Browne in general.   All of the looks on a runway will consist only of the clothes from the brand, for obvious reasons, which is not necessary how people wear the individual pieces IRL.	episode_done:True
text:Tucking in shirts	labels:I switched to tucking in my shirts a couple years ago and I've never looked back! What really helped me was to  1) Be strict about only tucking shirts in to high-waisted pants. That way, it shows off my waist, rather than my food baby from lunch. I was tempted to cheat with mid-rise jeans at first, but have felt so much better about myself since I stopped.  2) After you tuck your shirt in, raise your arms above your head to create a slight blousy look-- not being skin tight helps get rid of any insecurities.  Hope that helps! Oversize men's shirts tucked into high-waisted shorts are pretty much my uniform, so I never miss an opportunity to evangelize 😄

text:How to Talk About Collared Shirts	labels:Brilliant guide, must have taken a lot of work to put it together so thanks for all the effort you've gone to.  Would it be worth a mention on sloped shoulders?  I went through loads of brands and fits (even custom) because every shirt I wore would fit well in most areas, but I would always be left with big diagonal creases from my collarbone.  It was only the last custom company I found, asked me if I had sloped shoulders.  Turns out they are quite severely sloped which was the cause of all my issues.  Nice to see wool mentioned as a material, its not very common but is brilliant for shirts.  My mum found a Ralph lauren Polo shirt on sale in a department store about 7 years ago, it was reduced to £15 so she just bought it.  It was originally for my dad but was too small so I got it instead.  It's pure wool, heavy, but feels like silk and breathes brilliantly.  The fit is perfect and it never needs ironing.  Only problem I have now is that I've worn it so much that the button holes aren't as secure.  I've added a bit of weight too so they are prone to popping open when I sit/stand!	episode_done:True
text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:I've bought two suits from SuSu and had the rush treatment almost every time I go. It's especially challenging when it's a busy day for them. I would first try a different location if possible.  One thing I'll advise against is going without a strong idea of what you want.

text:General Discussion - January 13, 2021	labels:The king is dead. Length is but a means to be longline or cropped or cuffed or stacked. All shoulders are raglan. Chest is where I put my delicate knits for safekeeping from the prying mouths of intrepid moths.    Measurements are pathetic quantifiers of a qualitative experience. The extra inches will drape from my anatomy pleasingly, like a banner proclaiming that fit's regime has been toppled dancing in the victorious breeze. M and L and 2 and 3 are guidance enough (S and 1 being made only for the woodland sprites who derive disgusting sustenance from their plentiful options on Y!JP).   While your tailor sleepily shaves another inconsequential centimeter from your shirt sleeve, mine envelop my hands, sheltering the delicate palmskin from the sear of a tea- filled mug. While you salve your chafed thighs from those jeans that "just need to break in", my pendulum swings within its harem, emancipated from the confines of low rises.   Will you hear the call of my silhouette, and learn how to breathe? Or will you continue to ride up the crevasses behind the aging corpse of the old king?   The post-fit era is upon us.

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:Great responses already. I'll rant a little bit about footwear since that's my specialty so to speak.   I think people still spend far too much on footwear generally. GYW and stitched construction is nice and all, but it's not a cheap option by any means. You get quite high quality leathers from plenty of makers in the <$350 range and there are good options in the $200 range as well depending on the type of shoes/boots you're looking for.   I'm working on a post that talks a bit more about the individual economics of owning even a single pair of "high quality" footwear. Cost of ownership is vastly under estimated by newcomers and expectations overall tend to be set too high.   I still agree that footwear has pretty high diminishing returns, but I also think that a *lot* of people talk themselves into buying stitched construction shoes that are far far too expensive for what they really want.
text:Good idea for a post. I wonder how many people who buy GYW shoes have actually had them resoled... and how many don't wear them enough or baby them too much to have worn through the soles.  "Buying for life" doesn't make sense if you're not going to wear it for life, and most of us don't.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Covid Dilemna - Finding my style	labels:I have been using Le Tote for three years now as a way to try out new styles. It’s a rental box service, but it has “normal” clothes - things I would wear to the office or to dinner with the hubs. Even during quarantine I’ve continued because it gives me new things to look forward to wearing without the need to shop outside my home. And I’ve found brands I really like that I wouldn’t have discovered in my normal routine of Target and JCPenney runs.   I discovered I actually can wear column dresses with my super curvy silhouette as a result. And I’ve tried cropped pants, cold shoulder tops, paper bag waists (they are awful on me), and all sorts of trends I would never have purchased without wearing for a day to make sure it worked for me.  I average 2-3 boxes a month with 5 clothing items, so that would be a slower but safe way to try lots of things.  I’m not trying to spam or anything, but I do have a promo code that gets us both a discount, if anyone has interest.

text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:I have an excellent tip for this! Get a large salad spinner and some gentle lingerie soap, put your really delicate stuff in with some warm water and detergent, spin a hand-full of times and let it soak for 5 mins, drain the water out and fill it with cold water, let it soak for 5, then spin, drain, refill, spin drain repeat till it comes out clear. Takes maybe 15 mins total and you don't destroy your clothing. You can even spin it again once the water is out to speed up drying if you let it air dry.
text:I handwash all the time--the salad spinner is a great idea!  Most of the clothes that I handwash call for cold water only though, so I never use any warm water.  As for detergent, I use Woolite.  Threads are more delicate when wet, so I avoid any rough wringing--I roll them up in towels to get most of the water out.  With knit sweaters etc, I let them dry laying down, put back in their shape, as they get very heavy with water and hanging could cause them to lose their shape.  Since I already have many pieces that I handwash, I just end up doing that with all of the pieces I care about/really want to last and it works great albeit a bit time consuming!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Why Did Bottega Veneta Delete Its Social Media Accounts?	labels:All these thinkpieces serve to do is mystify a transparent marketing strategy dovetailing neatly with the ethos of the brand. As a brand Bottega Veneta is fashion's equivalent of your friends on social media who announce to the world that they're going to be moving in silence from now on  – a brand for those who want to be lowkey, *but not really*.  Social media makes sense for brands like LV for whom the core ethos is in your face flaunting, as Instagram is both chief flex medium and ultimate marketing tool to an aspirational public. Bottega Veneta's courtship is a bit different. If I'm BV I don't even want to be seen as attempting to court that customer, and so the retreat from social media makes sense considering the brand's appeal to aspirational customers who want to be perceived as more sophisticated than those of LV. In reality BV is every bit as accessible before (just type it into the search bar) but it's the *illusion* of withdrawal which is key, both in attracting more aspirational customers and retaining your seasonal clients, for whom discretion – especially in LVMH's major growth market of China – is key.  I don't have any experience in marketing or the luxury sector but what this tells me is that LVMH believes either that a social media presence was a waste of resources or that this'll help cultivate a fake sense of "in the know" among their growth demographic, particularly with COVID exposing the full extent of income inequality's social rot.  Considering influencer fraud, flexing, and the danger of being mixed in with the bland minimal luxury aesthetic running rampant on IG, it makes perfect sense for them to pull back.  &#x200B;  TL;DR: It's just good marketing. The brand will still be very present in all the relevant outlets that actually generate sales.
text:Bottega Veneta is owned by Kering but yeah the same thing still applies to them too.  I noticed that right after Phoebe Philo left Celine and that brand changed the whole look with Hedi Slimane, there was influencers on social media etc calling BV the 'new Celine' and hyping the brand, it was getting pushed on places like GQ and other mags too. Maybe that was an organic shift and the Phoebe Philo Celine fans just wanted a new brand to love after she left but also, it could easily be inside marketing from BV and Kering to take advantage of that space. And I remember Celine never used to have an Instagram page, social media or much of an online presence at all that kept it kind of mysterious, now BV is trying that.

text:Feminist clothing	labels:IMO supporting your local seamstress is way better than most organizations.  To me a big part of feminism is supporting local communities and the women in them. Buy used or from ethical companies (as advertised) and do alterations and even custom clothes from local vendors.
text:Agreed! I like to buy from a few local resale shops in my area that are women-owned. Therefore supporting women, my local community, and much more eco friendly than buying new. Try finding ways to support women of color’s businesses, especially!   Instagram resale is big now, too. This can support individual women rather than companies, and again is more environmentally conscious.	labels:depop could be a good bet if you like the social resales.	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:Going through the same thing right now - same age range and a student as well :) Honestly, COVID has helped my mindset a lot. I'm not wearing real clothes as much anymore, as I mostly live in PJs and sweatpants, so I'm re-evaluating why I have so many fast fashion pieces in the first place. Do I really need ten pairs of cheap jeans? No, and I don't even like wearing most of them anyways. There's a thrill of buying things on sale "just because," but after that fades, I'm left with a piece of clothing that I don't really **love**. So I just gravitate towards the same few pieces that I really **do** love, and I realized that I should just invest in a few quality things that I'll always go for.  Donating and selling a ton of my old clothes over the past few months has really helped me settle into a more minimalistic mindset. I also think about the ethical and environmental impacts of fast fashion a lot more nowadays, which really puts me off from buying things online from cheap sites. Thrifting is also a great way to save some money and be more sustainable while still getting quality pieces!	episode_done:True

The fabric was thin, the cuts and seams were weird as hell, sleeves were short, and more. It was obvious that it was just a "straight from crappy manufacturer" product with lies on the website. What's unfortunate is that I had a feeling prior to ordering it that it wasn't going to be good.

text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:Oof, I definitely know those thoughts. I'm sorry your brain is being a jerk right now. <3  Something I've had some success with (and YMMV) is to constantly remind myself that "Clothes are supposed to fit ME, I'm under no obligation to fit THEM." If a pair of pants doesn't fit me comfortably, then the problem is with the pants, not my body. Items of clothing are inanimate objects and I owe them nothing. It's far from a perfect system and I don't always succeed, but it does help sometimes.  On a more practical front, have you considered using a tailor? From the problems you describe it sounds like you've got more of a waist-to-hip/leg difference than most brands allow for, and if that's the case, it's actually something that a tailor can fix pretty easily (and often relatively cheaply.) You would just buy pants that fit your legs comfortably and get the waist taken in. Fair warning, though: once you've worn clothes that actually fit you the way they're supposed to you'll never be satisfied with ill-fitting pieces again.	episode_done:True
text:Indoor layers	labels:I think what your serious outerwear is going to be depends on where you live. I live somewhere where the cute wool coats you may see in winter NYC or winter London are not practical. People where I live wear huge down feather coats in the winter, and we are definitely not wearing these coats inside. By extension, autumn is pretty brutal and people may break out their heavy jackets that are double-lined, but again, we’re not wearing these indoors. Since my area is super frigid, we’re not looking at outerwear trends to be cute. People who move here realize that they need multiple coats and jackets, and it’s to be practical and cover the variety of weather changes more than anything.  If I moved somewhere warmer, and didn’t need outerwear for the practicality reason, I would say that I actually love blazers and think they’re fine indoors (because you see blazers in corporate suiting, which is worn indoors). Your mileage may vary though, cause if somebody is wearing trenchcoats and leather jackets indoors, I would question if that individual is looking to leave the building.	episode_done:True
text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items have all been high quality copies of items I have in low quality but wore out the wazoo.  For example, I knew I was ready to invest in some high end Chelsea boots when I found myself going through a cheap pair every year. Or to invest in a nice leather-looking jacket when I found myself grabbing mine 70% of the time I went out.  The expensive items were hard to wear at first, maybe on date nights or to a nicer event, but as I got more used to wearing them I wore them more often. I think it took me a hot year before I wore my Red Wings more than like once a month.   My recommendation is keep the items in your comfort zone (so no wild dresses or Colors at first) and to force yourself to wear it at a regular interval. These days, just wearing nice jeans while I go shopping seems to be my “date night” when I dress up!

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:Don’t feel pressured to be something you’re not. Less is more. If you’re happy in simple things, wear simple things. Try to buy things that feel high quality. Then, if you get bored with simple things, and see something interesting that you like, try it on and see if you like it on you. If so, you’re finding your style. If not, don’t force it. “Well-dressed” doesn’t have to be “distinctive” or “interesting.”	episode_done:True

text:If you could only have one overcoat, what would it be?	labels:pea coat  &#x200B;  Can fit virtually any occasion	episode_done:True
text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:I think it could be because skirts and dresses more easily fit a wider variety of body proportions, especially if it's mid-length and loose at the hip. With trousers and jeans you add in the factor of thigh size, calf size, rise, inseam length... more factors that can mess up the fit and be uncomfortable if you aren't "average".  Personally, unless they're very stretchy, I have never found a single pair of jeans or trousers that fit well off the rack without a lot of tailoring. Like, they are completely unwearable. So dresses and skirts are just easier from that perspective.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Are there any alternatives to a suit that you know about or your culture uses?	labels:You can check out Jodhpuri Suits and Sherwanis. They are quite cool replacement for suits in case you want to throw some diversity into your wardrobe. But both are generally non work, formal function attire. Next time you are invited to an Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi/Sri Lankan or even middle eastern wedding, you can wear it. If you want to wow people even more, you can try Angrakha suits. They are predecessor of above suits and were worn in courts of Mughal emperors of India.
text:Wow those Jodhpuri's are fly! Out of curiosity, although I get confused for indian/middle eastern pretty often, I know that there's a lot of sensitivity right now when it comes to cultural appropriation. Would you say it would be generally accepted to wear these outfits to a Indian or Pakistani wedding, or that it isn't that common outside of the people?	labels:Of course man. It's not cultural appropriation, it's cultural appreciation. As long as you refer to the suits with their original names (Jodhpuris, Sherwanis etc.) you are good. When Justin Trudeau visited India on a state visit a year or two back, he and his entire family dressed up in Indian attire. If you are attending this wedding with  gf/wife may I suggest Lehengas for her.	episode_done:True
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:While my wardrobe is fast turning as black as my soul, I’ve enjoyed two pairs of colorful pants: a pair of mustard cords, and a pair of salmon boyfriend chinos, both from Gap. I’m glad colorful pants exist! I’m heartbroken the mustard cords didn’t hold their color for more than a few years—now they’re just an odd yellow shade, like Charlotte Perkins Gilman picked out the shade—but in their prime I loved wearing them with Weejuns or midcalf boots, a chambray or blue plaid shirt or a lace cap-sleeve and denim jacket, a chunky necklace. Granted, this was the early/mid 2010s. I styled the salmon chinos about the same. Now, if I were to choose a pair, I’d go for a jewel-toned pair, perhaps Eileen Fisher lantern pants in that gorgeous red color, and pair with black. I’d pair a high-contrast pant with a high-contrast/clear top, and muted pants with a muted top.	episode_done:True

text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:As far as creating outfits for myself---I think it had to do being uncomfortable with my weight and skin (I had normal acne, but I scar really easily, so I have "shadows" of where pimples used to be years later...) and just never really feeling "pretty." So I'd try to put together outfits that maybe were interesting or looked polished, because I knew (or at least firmly believed) that **I** was/am not interesting and polished. I "knew" that no one would ever compliment or be attracted to me, so maybe I could trick them into noticing my outfit at least...I don't know. I think in a lot of ways I've come pretty far in this area, but I definitely still use clothes as a kind of armor almost. Like, don't repeat outfits and don't wear what other people have and don't do the expected combinations and all of that are hard habits to break, especially since I *do* get complimented/validated regarding clothing and not so much about my body, so I get caught in the mind trap of it all. It's gross and I'm still struggling a lot of days...  As far as fashion in general--I think watching Project Runway! It spurred me to find other fashion shows and documentaries and things of that nature. I love the creative minds behind the shows. I'm less interested in the final product, but just hearing how people, especially on a show like Project Runway, are inspired and (pardon the reference) make it work with so many limitations the show throws at them...it's so fascinating. I'm equally enthralled by cooking shows, where they have such knowledge and talent to do the seemingly impossible.	episode_done:True
text:People who work in the fashion industry - what do you wear?	labels:I’ve work as a senior designer for apparel/accessories/shoes for several large corporations.

I avoid clothes and accessories with prominent or all over logos on them.	episode_done:True
text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:I think you're thinking either avant garde or couture runways? These are different from regular season fashion shows. Mainstream labels like Gucci, Versace, Tom Ford, etc show very wearable pieces in their regular fashion shows IMO.  Now designers like Iris Van Herpen and Guo Pei do very couture almost avant garde fashion that is not meant for daily wear. These fashions are more for their high end clients who want to be inspired and who may place orders for their pieces as a COLLECTORS piece.

What it did for me was made me realize how much I didn’t need to buy clothing like I had been, and it made me transition to buy almost solely secondhand.

text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:I would't consider Sezane a paragon of originality at all. They are also copying someone.  Every season there is a grab bag of trends for people to interpret. This year we have big sleeves, chunky knits, and 70s office wear as the inspirations.   And each brand takes their spin, and washes it with their point of view. Sezane does its rendtiion in the classic, same for brands like J.Crew and Banana Republic. Madewell's version is a little hipster and boho takes on the same classics. Anthropogie is quirky femme takes on the trends. Gap would do the plainest version - yes to chunky knits but not super statement sleeves.  It is hard to deem a solid knit sweater as a knockoff, there are only so many versions you can make.
text:Yeah Sezane didn't invent bodysuits and pom sweaters, they're all copying from somewhere else and EVERYONE is making these. I think it's bullshit that it's only ever cheap brands that get called out.  When Sezane sells rip-offs, it's "inspired" or "trendy" (but in a ~timeless~ rich person way ofc), when a cheaper store does it, it's a "blatant rip-off" and "stolen intellectual property"? Girl, please.	labels:Exactly.  I’ve seen both things a million times before.  But it’s overpriced so I guess it’s theirs?	episode_done:True
text:I'm Not a Watch Guy I Swear - Street x Sprezza	labels:I could not agree more about 36-38mm watches. I've always worn watches, inexpensive ones but I've always put one on first thing in the morning and worn it until I'm getting in bed at night--even if I'm doing nothing beyond sitting around the house all day. My small collection was all 40mm or 42mm.  A couple of years back I decided I wanted to take a slight step up from my $125 Orient automatics. I purchased a 42mm Hamilton Khaki Field and it just didn't feel right. I loved the aesthetic of it but I couldn't pinpoint what was wrong so I reluctantly returned it a few days later.    Fast forward to this summer and I couldn't get the Khaki Field out of my head. I read more about it, mainly forum posts, and read a good conversation--I can't recall on which forum--about the 42 vs the 38. I read enough to be coaxed into trying the 38. I remember opening the box and thinking, "this is SO tiny. It looks like a toy." One poster said to expect that reaction and wear the watch for a week and you'd come around on its size. Man, was he right. With 7.5" wrists I absolutely love 38mm watches. I ditched my older Timex Chrono Weekender (40) for a classic Weekender (38). My Orient Bambinos (40) now feel too large even though I thought they were too small when I bought them several years back. Every time I wear them I look at my wrist and wish the watch was smaller. Every time I see a character in a movie or show wearing a watch I think to myself about how bad and how huge the watch looks.  As for price, I also agree that most expensive watches are too busy or simply don't appeal to me. Even if I was loaded I wouldn't buy luxury watches.  A quick thought on wearing a watch in the smartphone era, at least in my profession, I sneak a glance at my watch during meetings or at times when it's not appropriate to pull out my phone.	episode_done:True
text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:1) The most foolproof way is to try on every combination of clothing possible. Especially the things that you’re like - there’s no way that will work. Because that’s how you discover new combinations. Or you’re like... well, that didn’t work but if the top were like slightly longer, it’d actually be amazing - and that’s a great way to build a shopping list of stuff that would work with what you already have.   2) Trying on clothes is actually a lot of work. If you’re lazy and would rather lie around instead (cough what do you mean, I’m not talking about myself at all), if you put all your clothes in a closet app (I use Stylebook) you can look at what’s in your closet on your phone and make up different combinations to try out later. This isn’t foolproof, you will need to still try them on irl to see if they actually work (although the more practice you get the better you’ll get at creating successful outfits). Actually getting all your clothes in a closet app is a whole lot of work to start tbh, but if you want to go that route I find it’s best to use as many stock photos as possible and don’t bother with background removal.   3) If you really want to be a geek and see everything in your closet laid out, do a visual wardrobe. People posted them occasionally a couple years ago so search the sub if you want to see examples - but you basically take a picture of yourself wearing every piece of clothing you own. This takes a long time but you have the advantage of being able to see what your clothes look like on you and I feel like that makes it easier to pick out good outfit combos, because at least to me, silhouette is so important. Also it’s kind of fun to see what types of clothes you gravitate towards and you can sometimes discover things like “I really need a bright yellow jacket, that would tie together so many of these outfits” or “I actually hate green so why do I own 24 green t-shirts???” that’s kind of hard to parse when all your clothes are tucked away in drawers and stuff.

For that you can also "randomize" your outfits! Count how many tops and how many bottoms you have, then let something choose 2 numbers for you (Google has a random number generator when you search for "random number"). If you get, let's say, 8 and 3, take the 8th top and the 3rd bottom in you wardrobe, then try to make an outfit out of them by choosing a jacket, accessories, etc.	labels:	episode_done:True

I don't have a perfect description for it, but I do think that the style Andrew is wearing there is a lot more coherent. I think there are ways to do that style thoughtfully, and not randomly.

text:I have made a realization that, apart from school uniforms, I only ever wear polo shirts	labels:I think as long as you avoid the synthetic fabric blends and look for high quality pique or sweater knit styles, polo shirts make an excellent staple.   I would explore polo shirts that have minimal branding and instead explore visual interest with contrast ribbing, or through muted sweater patterns.
text:This is the reason I've recently come around on polo shirts, especially when paired with soft/casual tailoring.

It's summer, it's hot so you're wearing shorts, but the shorts are made from denim which is a hot and sweaty material. It's an oxymoron to me, like have you got your legs out to stay cool or have you got the denim on to stay warm? What's going on here?

I love having a grungy girl moment, a colourful LOOKATMENOW moment, a classy neutral I'm a big girl moment and a floaty yes I am a fairy and I just tiptoe about in pretty midi dresses moment.

text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I bought/sold on Poshmark when it was starting to get popular, and found great deals and sold pretty easily on it. I stopped a year later - by that time, I had started seeing wholesale distributers flooding the site and making it alot harder for me to find actual used clothing for decent prices. I'd agree that there are likely too many sellers now compared to buyers - or at least too much merchandise compared to buyers. To me, that makes Poshmark too much like Ebay, and is no longer as distinct a platform as it used to be.  Edit: typos
text:There's far too much merchandise, too much of the same stuff, too much complete junk to sort through, and a lot of sellers who have no idea how to sell their items. The categories and filters aren't that well thought-out, so you need to have a pretty specific idea of what keywords to search (or the patience to go through multiple categories). They could seriously improve the site for sellers and buyers by reorganizing their categories, adding boxes for measurements (and a checkbox for "listing contains measurements"), and removing items that don't sell after 6 months (the seller could always relist, but there are hundreds (probably thousands) of items that haven't even been updated in a year and sellers who seem to have abandoned their accounts).  As far as I know, you can't even set alerts for certain keywords or filters, which makes it even harder to use than Ebay--that said, when I do secondhand shop/browse I prefer Poshmark because it's easier to see at a glance whether the information is all there, which is a key aspect in whether I even consider buying an item.	labels:Yes absolutely with the old listings and abandoned accounts. I feel like everyone and their mother is jumping aboard the selling train right now, but the wholesalers grind my gears. No escaping them in this day and age, but eBay is worse than Poshmark because it’s nothing but Chinese scammers and drop shippers from Ali express and Taobao. Same for Etsy. Poshmark seems to have less of that (for now) at least in the categories I browse. But I agree there’s way too much crap on there. You can pretty much only sell if it’s a higher end brand name piece of clothing and not just general clothes because there are so many accounts with literally 1000 pieces of fast fashion garbage eternally listed   I’ll also add the constant invitation to go to peoples dumb selling parties and people constantly sharing my items is weird as a casual seller. I get that they’re trying to make it like a social media thing but it’s pretty transparent people are sharing my stuff so I’ll share theirs but I don’t have time for that and it clogs up my notifications so I’ve missed people bundling my stuff  Edited because i fumbled trying to correct it and hit send too soon!
text:> Same for Etsy.  This kills me on etsy. Look at this 'homemade' antique style ceramic cup set! $45 for a set of 2. And then you buy it and it says ikea on the bottom.

text:Thank all of you	labels:It sounds like you had an outstanding in store experience and I'm delighted for you. Congratulations on finally having shoes you're excited to put on and I hope they live up to every little bit of that excitement for you.  The best bit is that good quality shoes get *more* comfortable as you imprint on the cork inside and the leather conforms to your feet. It's joyful to slip on a pair of shoes that you've owned for a few years. It's like working in a butt groove on your favourite chair but for your feet.	episode_done:True

I'm quite tall and it's hard to get any distance between me and the camera for a fully-body shot. There's one place in my apartment that gives enough distance with a 23mm lens.   I bought a phone attachment for my tripod because my phone has a wide angle lens but it hasn't arrived yet. I assume it'll give me weird proportions anyway so I'll probably just use it for quick photos.

text:/u/pieface777 is right, and there's also eBay.  That said, trad is the dress style of the American old-money elite. The ethos is to buy well and then wear it into the ground, so there's a thriftiness there, but it's not one based on seasonal fast fashion. It's more based on buying a good pair of shoes and then taking care of them, having them resoled when necessary. It's buying a great Shetland sweater but then having it darned, or patched with leather, as it wears out (or just wearing it with holes).  Back during the #menswear days of 10 years ago there was a kind of fetishization of that sort of thing. I think people by and large are aware now that it still takes money to have this sort of relationship to your clothes. I also think there are a lot of 3/2 sack blue blazers and repp ties that are not getting quite as much wear as people might have expected when they bombed out big bucks for them, because the style isn't as in fashion anymore. Thus, more opportunities for the rest of us on eBay.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:I’ve tried to resell my previously second-hand clothes that are higher end, i.e. Ferragamo, Dolce and Gabbanna, and Ralph Lauren Black Label. I’ve only made 1 sale out of all the clothes that I’ve listed on Poshmark. Although I did recoup most of my money on that sale, it was more work than it’s worth. As some people said below with the luxury market sometimes you get a fraction of the price that you bought it for, even if you bought it used prior. You will probably have more luck with luxury handbags than clothing. I wouldn’t use the value I could probably resell the clothing item for as justification to buy.  If you like the item and have the money just spring for it.	episode_done:True

Commom problems I face with t shirts are length (I’m 6’2 and sometimes shirts don’t quite reach the middle of the fly on my jeans), torso flare (which I’m hoping to allieviate with the athletic cut), and sleeve flare.

text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:On a good month I have £120. This is to be split on everything that's not groceries & basic household consumables, healthcare, rent or bills. So it's spent on going out, clothes, skincare, stuff for the house that's not consumables, presents, etc. I would spend £100-£200 on a new item of clothing, less on second-hand. So as you might guess, I don't buy a lot of clothes! What I buy I wear until THE END.   Edit: I should mention that I work part-time so I would spend less than an average person. It's a trade off - more time, less golds.	episode_done:True
text:Is it just me, or does it seem like the clothes being sold since the pandemic began have become very limited?	labels:Yes, this is a combination of you not liking what is in fashion right now and also the world suffering a devastating and globally disruptive disaster that has severely damaged the supply chain and killed a lot of people. Try second hand shopping? Ebay and depop have been good for me.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:There's that saying that "you don't know what you don't know", right? I couldn't conjure up a completely original and personal style out of thin air without pulling up inspiration and learning about all kinds of different styles and clothes and fabrics and aesthetics et cetera et cetera. My style is just a big mix of all kinds of trends from the last five years, but it's personal to me because I curated it.  I like to think of personal style as an iterative process similar to design, you build on top of what's already there, see what works, what doesn't, remove unnecessary things until there's nothing left to take away. What remains is just right. The one thing to realise is that it's not something that happens overnight, most people who have a really strong sense of personal style have been doing it for years or decades.	episode_done:True
text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:Custom made dress shirts - I got 4 made a few years ago and I literally never reach for my off the rack ones unless I have to. Worth every penny.  Ralph Lauren Slim fit OCBD - I find these the perfect balance between small collar uniqlo ones and old school baggy Brooks Brothers  Black bit loafers - the one dress shoe to go with if you don’t have to wear suits all the time.  Technically too casual for suits but it’s 2021 and no one cares, plus you can wear them with jeans with more casual outfits and get a whole lot more for your buck. I like Gucci but all brands make these at every budget.   One pair of black, and one pair of dark blue slim jeans  A nice wristwatch - I’m partial to a vintage Omega, vintage Rolex Datejust or a modern Panerai depending on your style that will go with everything and where you can mix and match different straps  Lululemon ABC Joggers - live in them when I don’t have to dress up, and they still don’t look sloppy  Uniqlo Merino sweaters - so cheap and does the job as a mid layer  Abercrombie sweatshirts - no logo options fit me great and are super cozy. I regret paying so much for John Elliot ones I have now  Suede biker or trucker jacket - that’s the one piece I go to when I want to look a bit “extra” and it always does the job  Denim shirt - go to casual piece to throw on a tshirt. I think Levi’s are cheap and fantastic   LBM blazers - great modern slim fit blazers with casual textures, fits perfect and you never look like you wore your suit jacket. Incredible value on sale for how much I wear them	episode_done:True
text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:Underwear/socks/masks: 1 wear  Tee shirts/tanks/cotton tops/flannels: 1-3 wears, depending on sweat level  Blouses (silks, fragile rayons, etc): As infrequently as possible--basically if I spill or they smell  Sweaters: Similar to blouses, but I tend to do all of these in one big go (delicate cycle in garment bags with a gentle wool/cashmere detergent then lay flat to dry), so some get tossed in earlier   Dresses: pretty much never unless I spill   Jeans: once a month ish, or when I spill on them. Washing helps get them back to shape if they start to bag out too much, and eventually they will start to smell  Workout clothes: 1 wear  PJs: 3 ish wears   Jackets: rarely--fleeces, sweatshirts, really anything soft will be more often, but if it's anything heavier than that I just spot treat stains	episode_done:True

It puts me off when the buttons are sewn in places that look like they might serve a function but are actually purely decorative. I have a full length wool military topcoat with big buttons and each button is functional even if I never use them. It can be buttoned up with 6 buttons but I usually only use 2 even in the coldest weather. I even added a couple buttons in order to button down the corners of the lapels. The quarter belt in the back has the same big buttons. I frequently get compliments on my coat as I've customized it quite a bit.	episode_done:True

If your normal clothes still fit you comfortably could put on a bold accessory to possibly distract from the area you feel insecure about.	episode_done:True
text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:Note-- I have to do laundry offsite and pay per load.  I air dry my clothes, but draw the line at hand washing ANYTHING.  Underwear, socks, masks, gym clothes (in normal times), cotton facial pads-- after each use.    Bras-- 2-3 wears depending on how sweaty I get.  Shirts, bottoms, skirts, dresses--- Usually 3-4 times depending on use.  Skirts-- 5-6 times (these don't touch the crotch area so they don't get as dirty as other bottoms).  Outer layers (sweaters, sweatshirts, etc)--- As needed (I always have something under these).  PJs-- 3-4 wears  Sheets-- Every 2 weeks or so  Towels-- Washcloths-- after each use (I use two a day to wash my face), body towel-- after about a week.  Hair towel-- when I remember to (I only use this towel for my hair and wash my hair twice a week).  Hand towels, dish towels, etc-- as needed.  Other bedding-- (blankets, comforters, etc)--- twice a year (Spring and fall).	episode_done:True

Most expensive things are jacket and shoes which make up about 3/4 of the price for me.  Shoes I always buy new and expensive cause my feet suck. So £50-150.  Jackets are second most expensive and I try to always buy second hand. Got a few Barbour's and vintage coats for £10-50.  Jeans/trousers are a pain to buy second hand because the fit is normally crap. Maybe £50.  The rest is all second hand. Jumpers/shirts/t shirts. Can easily find that all super cheap on eBay, depop or in thrift stores.  Or my full suit which is £300 including tailoring. SO used to work in a suit shop and got discount on that one. I think it was 50% off.	episode_done:True
text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I typically wear contacts, and glasses when my eyes need a break. As you can surmise, the pandemic means a lot more glasses time. A couple of years ago I thought about how my glasses were much more boring than my outfits. So I started to mix in more fun and colorful frames. It also helped that my eyes have hardly changed over the last few years. So I started getting fun colors. I had a brown pair with neon trim as the first "weird" pair. Then a wood grain, which was the neutral, then a bright blue pair, and later yellow metal frames. Now a pink and black pair is leading....I can't seem to find the yellow! I am not sure what I'll get for this year.   Anyway for me, I realized I needed statement glasses to go with my love of pattern! I still mostly stick to solids and either cat eye or narrow rectangle shapes, but I find attention attracting glasses are a nice exclamation point on an outfit.	episode_done:True

I originally bought the Bushacre just because they were cheaper, but ultimately came to like it better.   The crepe sole looks nice out of the box, but it just gets dirty and nasty looking IME.

As soon as clothes come out of the dryer, I go through each item (including underwear and snip any loose threads, check for any loose buttons and quickly resew, and check for any pulled threads or stains that didn't come out.

text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:There is a disconnect for the general public. I don’t watch many shows anymore, but I often find in US based shows they look good but I know most people (especially teens?) wouldn’t always wear high heels, designer dresses and 10 different accessories with a perfect smokey eye and styled hair. Most people get that ain’t nobody got time (or desire) for that.   Not me though... I mean to be fair in high school I was overdressed and had a reputation for it, but I didn’t care because I personally loved dressing up and was seen as a stereotypical teen in series lol. I did take inspiration from shows like Sex and the City/Carrie Diaries and Gossip Girl + a few k-dramas or k-pop mv looks. Now I dress more normally, but I get the conception that Europeans are better dressed than Americans which I find funny. I live in Scandinavia though, I feel most people underdress where I live.	episode_done:True

text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession). I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession 🤣
text:Boring neutrals have been "in" for like 10 years though. Recession or not, this isn't a new development.	labels:Heck, after years of black, black & more black, the boring neutrals are comparatively colorful.   Personally, I'm thinking about wearing boring neutrals with a strong color. Like greys & beiges with a red coat/shoes/purse (or all 3). Or olives and sages with a purple.

In Kraków check out Mapaya, they do Avantgarde yet minimalist clothing that is for the most part handspun and plant-dyed, and the designer is a really nice young woman.

The bare, white walls and flickering fluorescent lights remind me to never show a shred of personality to my coworkers, lest they suspect that I occasionally engage in activities outside of work. My dog's despondent whimpers recall the helpless cries of teenagers on the brink of a nervous collapse as they juggle arbitrary deadlines, crushing debt, and the insidious suspicion that it's all a bunch of bullshit. One big advantage of working from home is the ready supply of cheap coffee to keep me alert now that I'm expected to be available at any time--day, night, and weekend.

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:One of the big things I learned is that there's a lot less room for error or experimentation with investments. I feel pretty fortunate that I had a pretty good idea of what I liked and didn't like, but I think if you're still wanting to experiment then it may be best to stick with very specific investments. For example, I started just with shoes (I have strong preferences) and outerwear (I wanted to upgrade shapes/colors I already loved). That'll help build confidence in moving to other areas.
text:This is a good point. I started by replacing things I wore all the time with better quality versions. I also started with shoes	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What pieces would you love "backups" of?	labels:This is pretty uninspired, but I have a lot of basics that I wish I had bought in duplicates, but didn't buy in duplicates, because I figured they were basics and I could always just get more.   Alas. The styles changed just a bit, and now I can't find the plain white tanks and tees I want because the sleeves and the neckline and the length are all just a tiny bit off. Thank you for reading along, this not-a-real-problem is very frustrating at times.

text:Victorian, but Make it Fashion - Fashion Week Spring 2021 Inspo Album	labels:Honestly I’m so into the volume sleeves going on. I’ve been a fan for years since I was a little goth teen and now as a sorceress fashion fixated adult they still utterly delight me. Finding knitwear with a similar silhouette, a voluminous sleeve on the shoulder with a long narrow cuff akin to a bishop sleeve has been an absolute delight. Normally I’d only ever find blouses with that sort of look and half the time it’d be from my old romantic goth suppliers.	episode_done:True
text:Top of WAYWT - July 2020	labels:Man, I’ve been lurking this sub for a few months, and frankly I’m at a loss. I can’t figure out why people are rolling their pant legs.

text:I have to agree. It feels like they're playing a joke on us.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:No, no, no and no. I hate the aesthetic thing. Buying things bc 'they fit in with my aesthetic' and not bc you like them is weird to me. You can be all of those styles all at once. I love having a grungy girl moment, a colourful LOOKATMENOW moment, a classy neutral I'm a big girl moment and a floaty yes I am a fairy and I just tiptoe about in pretty midi dresses moment.

I've stared at Pleaser boots (about 120€) for hours already but never went through with it. About a year ago (when I was 21), Asos dropped a similar pair of boots for about 60€ and I went for it. I can't wear them often (lack of occasions), but I use them as decoration and they make me very happy.	episode_done:True
text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process? What would you prioritize?	labels:You know what?

I have all kinds of office appropriate slacks and cardigans and button up shirts in cutesy patterns, casual jeans and sensible shoes. I want to wear plastic corsets and fluorescent clip in braids and platform combat boots.
text:Yes this! I have  worked in all kinds of office environments and my style was rocker-professional.

text:Schott 538 Nubuck Cowhide Mechanic Jacket	labels:What perfect timing! I also just received this Schott mechanic jacket! It's my first Schott jacket and I love it! People here don't seem to appreciate the contrasting collar, but I think it makes the jacket stand out! It's a little touch that makes the design more unique and not as likely to see the same jacket from other makers. And the goatskin leather for the collar makes it very comfortable against my neck, and I wouldn't want the waxy/oily cowhide rubbing against my skin.  *** I love the chambray liner on the inside. I was turned off by a lot of other Schott jackets having the warm flannel liner as it would make the jacket harder to wear in the warmer seasons.    The buttons are definitely a stand out too! Makes it a lot easier to layer, which I believe was their intention. ***  And I'm very satisfied with the fit! I typically wear size M in my shirts, and I juggled over what size to buy, but eventually settled on sizing up to a L for the Schott, and I'm glad I did! The jacket has enough room to layer a sweater for the winter, but still looks great by itself. I was worried sizing up would make the jacket too boxy, but to my surprise it actually does have a slight V shape in the body, with a slight taper from the chest to the sweep. and the sleeves are not baggy, despite sizing up. If this was a moto or cafe racer style, I would understand the look to keep it super slim. But I feel this jacket style is more of a work-wear style, and that looks better a little boxy. ***  If I had to be very picky, I wish the sleeves were shorter, but I get it's for bikers to keep their wrists warm when riding. And the liner in the sleeves is polyester, which I thought was a little cheap for a 810 dollar jacket.  ***  Overall I'm happy with it. I  did not pay full price either. It was on sale at Nordstrom but it sold out very quick.
text:Nice! I also got it from Nordstrom on that sale! It definitely went out of stock very quickly. As for the sleeves liner, i agree it feels a bit cheap but i think most jackets like this has a polyester lining to keep your arms cool and also to make it easy to slide in and out. Glad you are enjoying it!	labels:What do you think of the fit? Did you get your typical size?
text:I think the fit is pretty good. The sleeves are long like you said, but you can roll up the cuff one, and the thick leather keeps the cuff pretty much in place so it's not flapping about. I also took a gamble on the size and got a medium. I measure about 37-38in in chest, 33-34 sleeve, 5'11 and about 160lbs. Definitely not the V shape athletic build, but this still fit pretty well at a medium. Overall, definitely happy with the fit as it is not too tight but also not super big on me.	labels:I have a 40 inch chest with broad shoulders, 6'0 and 180 lbs. And I got a L, which seems to be in proportion with the size M you got.  I'm pretty excited to start wearing it! I've been trying on outfits in front of my mirror this morning lol. Think it looks great over a flannel or thick denim shirt!

text:Is Money Important for Style? - The Style and Direction Podcast	labels:I was thinking about this in relation to my own style -- where I spend and where I don't. For instance, I'm really particular about how dress clothes fit, so I spend a lot on tailoring because it matters there. Other big ticket items are outerwear, because they tend to dominate an outfit. However, I definitely spend less on casual/basic things like jeans, tees, and chinos. Often, I'll wear $20 chinos with a $50 sweater, a $600 jacket and $200 shoes, so the price-per-piece for certain outfits are often from the different tiers. To me, it's about knowing what items are truly "making the outfit" and spending the most where it matters.

text:FAQ: What are the different use cases of boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes, and loafers?	labels:There's so much overlap between all the handsewn types, they're largely interchangeable. A lot of what people will tell you are rules or use cases are largely based on association and nothing really concrete.  Moccasins are a really good first step from "not a sneaker" without being a dress shoe. I find them incredibly easy to wear in most seasons, they pair well with many things that are fairly casual, they're pretty comfortable, and age well.  **Boat Shoes** have negative associations with prep/frats but just by association. In areas other than the Northeastern US (imo) they are much more neutral. No one associates them with frats on the west coast of Canada where I am, for example. But, of course, frats are a fairly uniquely American institution.  They tend to work best in warmer weather as the lower vamp and commonly sueded interior is quite light and good for wearing barefoot. They were, of course, designed to be worn on sailboats, so they're at home around the water and make a good beach shoe.  **Camp Mocs, Ranger Mocs, and Blucher Mocs** all fill a particular niche of being nicely casual shoes that are a bit more refined than sneakers, but pair easily with most non-synthetic casual wear. They make great seasonal transition wear (spring/fall) as they're lighter than boots but can be worn with thicker socks. They also have a variety of sole options from simple leather to treaded Vibram that can be selected for your environment and use case.  If you're used to wearing sneakers all the time, they can be a great introduction to leather shoes - imo in many cases better than boots, as they are often less expensive and easier to wear in many situations.  **Loafers** are often a bit more formal (but not always!) and can transition into business casual/formal wear. Some loafers can be worn with tailored wear (sport coats/suits). It will depend on the exact form, sole, leather, and color. Loafers can also be very casually, having a lot of crossover with moccasins, but again depending on the above factors.
text:This is the correct answer imo. There's a really really wide range of just hand-sewn moccasins, they're generally all some level of casual wear while some loafers can be a lot more formal and worn with a suit even.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:Some of mine in no particular order; I don't think about it all the time but my dressing habits are based around this:   * No more than 3 colours (I don't wear much black and have a lot of different neutrals, so I have to be aware of this). * Try to have something more interesting than just a crew neck sweater + pants. I am so guilty of falling into this when I get lazy.  * Don't wear the same colour pants and coat. People can probably pull this off no problem but it is something I avoid for some reason.  * Like someone else said, for tops and bottoms no tight/tight or loose/loose. I just don't feel comfortable that way. I feel better when I emphasize either my waist or my hips.  * Only wear 1 uncomfortable item at a time. Ideally you would have no uncomfortable items but unfortunately I have a few pieces that I am not willing to get rid of. If I wear them all at once it's like I am crawling in my own skin, so I try to be aware of this when I dress to leave the house.	episode_done:True

Well constructed items are not shot in this manner. Brands want to show off their excellent construction. It is known.  Hope that helps!
text:This is why I love nordstroms videos they attach to many goods, they flip the item around and usually hang it normally so I can see at least basic construction.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:DAE feel they made incredibly ODD fashion purchases, this year in 2020?	labels:I’m usually a bigger shopper but since covid hit I haven’t bought a single item of clothing beyond face masks. I lost my job and am still unemployed, and just don’t see the point right now. I daydream about when I finally get a job and am able to replace my clothes that I got the most part don’t like anymore. But when things are safe enough to go places again I want all new clothes completely free of the memories of this year.	episode_done:True
text:Online Styling Services?	labels:In addition to all the wonderful advice above, some stylists on Instagram regularly have weekly blog posts or stories posts where they ask their followers to send in any styling questions and they give their advice for free!   Personally I recommend waiting if you decide to try any paid styling services until after the pandemic because it opens up the option for meeting with a stylist in person, and also it makes it easier to try on the various things they recommend in a shop/mall as opposed to getting a couple things in a few sizes shipped to you and dealing with returns. Plus, sometimes colors differ from screen to screen so if they are trying to give advice about colors that suit you, the monitor differences could potentially cause problems.	episode_done:True
text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:men’s fashion is like a glacier- moving in one direction, not fluid, extremely slow moving- and women’s like an ocean, fast moving fads, extremely fluid, moving in all directions. Also men don’t go shopping as often, so if their clothes give out before they are due for another shopping trip, men will perceive the product’s quality to be bad. I feel like brands know these things and so they make what appeals to their consumers. They don’t need to sell women quality because most of their customers want to buy something new before the old wears out. Men don’t buy that way, I would imagine.	episode_done:True
text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:Decent homewear. Especially robes that aren't bathrobes nor these dainty fragile satin/chiffon thingies. Something cozy enough to set up shop on your couch in, that won't break on the first scoot, actually keep your arms warm.   In loungewear there's apparently four types with no middle ground: For mothers-formerly-known-as-women,  for girls, for seduction purposes only, and Jeff Lebowski.

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:I spent like two months investing in a bunch of nice wool sweaters that I could wear through the winter, put them in a separate laundry bin after wearing so I could launder them myself, but my ex washed and dried them on high heat and they all shrunk so badly that I couldn't even fit them on my dog. About $1500 gone.
text:I bought a gorgeous teal wedding kaftan with matching floor length vest and beaded waist belt in Morocco. It was really unique from all the others as it was much more understated and all the beadwork was also done with teal beads (different from most which have a lot of gold accents). I was particularly proud because I bargained down to 450 dirhams or around $45 for it.   Wore it once in Jardin Majorelle but without the floor length waist coat but was so excited to wear that piece with western clothes. Was even considering wearing it at my wedding.  Well, we make it back to a hostel in Madrid and since I can’t sleep, I take a little thc tincture to help put me to sleep. Well, I wake up high, 5 min before checkout and obviously, since my bag is quite full with gifts and Moroccan goodies now, my clothes are having a hard time fitting, so naturally, I put MY FAVORITE REFORMATION OUTFIT AND NEW MOROCCAN GOWN IN A PLASTIC BAG AND TIE IT TO THE OUTSIDE OF MY BACKPACK.   As we’re walking through the train to go to Seville, I realize that, SURPRISE!, bag is no longer attached and I lost it somewhere on the walk.   Obviously we called the hostel but it wasn’t there...3 hour train ride with my fiancé was SILENT. I don’t think I’ve ever been more angry and everytime I looked at that backpack for days it would make so angry.   Teal Kaftan, please know how sorry I am and how much I miss you.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts on Shein?	labels:As others have said, it's very unethical (but I think most places are at this point) and extremely hit-or-miss. But it can be much more cost-effective than similar places like Forever 21. You need to look at the reviews to make  sure you're getting a decent quality item, and even then the sizing is inconsistent, so be prepared to give some items to a friend when they don't fit. I would absolutely not purchase anything that doesn't have a lot of reviews since a lot of things they carry seem to be straight garbage.	episode_done:True

Just anything but Jedi chic!

text:Brooks Brothers's Future Looks a Lot Like Menswear’s Past	labels:* Less SKUs. The amount of stuff BB sells is overwhelming.  * Do away with there weirdly named fit system. Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.
text:Red Fleece is fantastic and distinctly different from the main line. Skews younger and has better cut of jackets in my opinion. Most of their main line suits are padded, lined, and boxy. They’re good but the overall result is pretty conservative, even with lighter fabrics and fits. It’s good stuff off the rack for sure, just not terribly flattering. You look dressed up in a BB suit – but you don’t necessarily look your best.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I've been inspired by the ladies in the lab that choose to do their hair nicely.

They mostly involve braids or just one to add a little something extra. They are more akin to easy bridal updos.	episode_done:True
text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:I've been pretty much every colour of the rainbow, hair wise.

These days, I've opened up myself to a few new colours (green and burgundy mostly), and I like the contrast they give with my tips.

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.

text:Why Ralph Lauren Never Goes Out of Style	labels:I f***ing love old Ralph Lauren. I eat that stuff up. I agree that the quality is part of why it never goes out of style. But also Ralph Lauren is still huge and relevant today, so vintage pieces feel both en vogue and archival, a very "intellectual" take on an American classic. Like an old Herman Miller chair. It was cool then and it's cool now. And RL has infiltrated all sorts of cultures, namely hip hop and streetwear meaning the demand for it isn't just bankers. And RL has been a titan of American fashion in that he sort of figured out his formulas a while ago and hasn't changed that much. RL from the past is just as recognizable as RL from today. In my opinion it's aged unbelievably well. Old RL pieces are like darling Americana that can styled with anything. An old RL knit hangs just as well with streetwear as it does with jeans and boots. And while similar brands like BB are nice, they are one trick ponies. RL has and continues to offer an expansive product line from tech skiwear to western clothes. I think this huge line up means that even if there are duds, they are hidden by the massive catalog of hit pieces like the bear line up.

text:Bags that are actually beautiful - what are you loving?	labels:I got a Strathberry Allegro in their midi size and in the vanilla colour. I love it, the quality is fantastic. It’s versatile, a great size, really secure and wears perfectly crossbody or works on one shoulder (I’m 5’2).   I think it’s a really classic style and is a bit different to other bags I’ve seen.
text:I've been debating on making Strathberry Allegro midi my next bag. Keep going back and forth, between the more structured Allegro or one of the chain styles- East/West or Stylist.	labels:Size wise I can get a bottle of water, wallet, phone, keys and a small makeup case/a thin jacket in my Allegro. I think you’d be able to fit a fairly similar amount in the East/West. I don’t think you’d fit much more than your phone, wallet/card holder and keys in the Stylist.   I had plenty of smaller crossbody bags in a similar size to the Stylist and wanted something a bit bigger that could hold a few more things for longer days out without being a giant handbag (a size of bag I don’t currently have) and also able to be used at work, which is why I settled on the Allegro.
text:Thanks for the insights! Similarly I have a lot of smaller crossbody bags but also a few large totes so the Allegro would be a good middle bag. Good to know what the Midi fits- I keep questioning if it would be too bag or small.  I do also want a purse on a chain so trying to be more conscious and intentional on how I am acquiring my collection of purses been frustrating.	labels:	episode_done:True

Every. Single. Day.  But I don’t have time for that BS.
text:Maybe because my feed is a lot of plus size/fat bodies, but I find this type of thinking terribly depressing. I won't pretend that terms like "effortless" are meant for us, but it also can feel even more exclusionary in a way when I see other fat people being like "never will I be considered to look this good!! no matter the effort I put in!!!".	labels:I think the point is just that the idea of "effortless" is completely void and that's best demonstrated through the fact that it crumbles completely when applied to a fat body. It's not the body, it's the concept.  Because it's not *actually* about the clothes, or about the attitude, or about any of that. It's literally just the thin, desirable body.  You can put sweatpants on it and call it "athleisure", you can wrap it in clingfilm and call it "sexy", or you can drape a burlap sack on it and call it "high fashion", but that's just people projecting bullshit concepts on a desirable body.   None of these things seem to exist or stand on their own, *unless* they're on a thin, conventionally "hot" body. When sweatpants are on Kendall, it's "athleisure". When they're on my lumpy thighs, they're just sloppy. When Glossier "makeup" is on a 17 year old model is cool and "effortless", when it's on an uggo, it's just...uggo.   It's not at all about the plus size bodies being somehow less than. Plus size bodies are not the problem. These meaningless concepts are the problem and it's in no way a negative reflection on the bodies, when the concept disintegrates on them.	episode_done:True

text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:>Do you think there’s an age where the concept of what looks “dated” changes? This has been on my mind a lot and a comment in the “what will be obsolete” thread played into it - someone said that skinny jeans will vanish... except on women around or over 40.  Some women kind of freeze their style in their 30s or even 20s. I am not sure why though. But I have friends who are like fussy children eating, they want just this or that precise cut. I think it is fun to try stuff just to try it out but no they want precise duplicates or very similar items to what they had. I think a lot of women can kind of research "flattering" for their body type or coloring (that horrible season theory...) and then it is like they graduated it, no more thinking about it, they stick to the rules they know. With a friend of mine it is massive list. I try to not push things at people, but once it was fun to see her revelation that OK, yes, horizontal stripes do look good on her (and she bought it and wore it lots) just because she thought she knew she was too heavy to wear stripes (no.... depends width, cut but it can look very nice).  I think datedness is a thing in general for every item, everything kind of is in an environment and we can not even see details which seem so obvious and only right way to do something but which will change in a few years. But unless something is too extreme, often there is ways to wear different waist lines, different pant width or hemlines, different things more timelessly. It helps though if the whole outfit is blended, if the shoes or bag or other pieces are more modern...  Getting a piece in a new trend, and combining it with older pieces can produce a lot of very different "new" right-now outfits.	episode_done:True

I just don't feel like wearing bell bottoms and tight tops with wide lapels, but then again if people are into it, good for them.	episode_done:True

text:Can I see your casual natural-fabric outfits?	labels:Sounds like we have similar styles and preferences. I don’t have pictures, but here’s some of my common outfits in case it helps:  - loose canvas carharrt dungarees with a soft cotton knit shirt (t-shirt or similar), sometimes layered with a merino baselayer and/or sweater depending on weather   - stretchy jeans (cotton with a bit of spandex) in a close fitting taper cut, plus an oversized cotton button up shirt and logger boots. I usually layer the shirt over a camisole/tank top/t-shirt for versatility   - sleeveless tencel (?) midi dress (sort of full skirt with a tie at the back of the waist). Depending on the weather I might layer it with an Oversize button up and/or base layer shirt on top, and if it’s really cold wool leggings or jeans on bottom. With leggings I’ll usually add some fun socks.

I'm a 37" chest and a 29" waist with a pretty long torso (I'm 6', but my torso is longer proportionally) and a sleeve length of like 34-34.5", so I usually buy medium, but a lot of stuff off the rack is either kind of loose around the middle or too short somewhere.	episode_done:True
text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:The people in the comments on this thread are kind of... The OP is asking how looking at a garnment in a website, how you can gauge if it has quality.  The majority of websites don't list anything other than fabric composition and have a page on the company's ethics, which is likely filled with lies (EVERLANE, which many "ethics' conscious people were duped with bought)). Also, expecting the majority of people to research on said ethics, when most don't even read that ethics' page is being out of touch with reality.  This person is making an effort than the majority of people don't do. To which some respond with condescending remarks?	episode_done:True

text:The Terribly High Cost of Cheap Goods	labels:Don't believe companies when they say something domestically produced will cost tons more. They lie! It's pure green. Unfettered capitalism. Maximum profit, minimal expense. I've discovered many high quality brands that have their goods made ethically and away from China! They do not cost a lot more and I'm happy to support locally made. No I'm not rich. The problem is that big greedy companies have the marketing budget to promote their cheaply made crap and thus make it hard for smaller independent brands to compete. But we have reddit which has been super useful in discovering such independent brands.
text:Please share the brands!

I just had to keep receipts, and subtract the cost when we got home. Besides cutting down on “you don’t really need this” arguments, I actually ended up learning some useful lessons from the process—in order to set my budget for the year, it was my job to figure out what I needed and lay out a proposal, which was negotiating practice (my sister and I competed to see who could get a bigger one approved!), and we had to use Excel to log everything. I might’ve whined a bit about the process in the moment, but now I see that it was a neat strategy, and I’m grateful for it.

If I like the look/style of some pieces, I'll invest in higher quality pieces from there. That way if something is not for me, I don't feel bad about throwing it away.
text:Good suggestion! Thanks	labels:Also look at second hand/thrift shops/eBay. You can get some good deals without buying items you intend to get rid of later from AliExpress or similar. When you’re ready to upgrade (or if it’s not for you), just give it back to charity/thrift shop for them to sell on again.	episode_done:True

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:This is actually such an interesting topic. As a bisexual teenager i often fit the “fashion stereotypes” of a bisexual because I look extremely different everyday. I dress in a number of styles, some being more masculine and some more feminine. I use pinterest for all my outfit inspiration, i never really think about whether or not it’s “queer fashion”, I just kind of like what i like.  I will say i consistently feel pressured to dress a certain way. Because I dress in a number of styles I’ve realized the way you dress will tend to attract different kinds of people. For feminine women who like girls it’s hard to get attention from other women because most are going to assume that you’re straight.  Edit: Just letting everyone know because I think it’s funny. Ive recently noticed that i also walk differently depending on the way I dress. When i dress more masculine my walk is more relaxed, i have my hands in my pockets, and i slouch v.s. when i dress feminine i sway a bit when i walk and have good posture.	episode_done:True

text:Feeling self-conscious with changing style around family - anyone relate? Tips?	labels:I'm exactly your age, and facing the exact same situation lol. My mom always makes comments on my clothes at home - both good and bad. It makes me insanely self-conscious, but one of the things that helps the most is compromising with myself. Like if I want to wear a pair of pants that I'm not sure how my family will think of, I'll try to pair it with a shirt that I know I won't feel self-conscious in and that my family/friends won't think is too out there. Call it a variation on the whole little shirt/big pants formula - unknown shirt/known pants, or known shirt/unknown pants. I know this isn't a perfect solution but it really helped me ease into things back home. Eventually, all your clothes will be known quantities and you'll be able to start dressing how you like almost all the time. :)	episode_done:True
text:What are your fiction and or nonfiction plans and outfits? What are the things you want to wear just to wear?	labels:We've been talking about doing a family portrait for some time and I bought the dress and jewelry for the event prior to Covid.  It's hanging in my closet untouched.  It's a 3/4 sleeve ruched scoopneck 50's style dress in bright happy yellow.  I have royal blue velvet kitten heels for it.  I bought Swarovski (the touchstone stuff) off my neighbor- the All Around Necklace I think it was called- over the summer so when we finally do this I have all the right pieces for the goal look.    Now that you mention it, I've been buying pieces I haven't touched because they're meant for public not sitting at home browsing Hulu in my infinite boredom.  There's a mauve mini dress with tie sleeves, a blue and white "porcelain" print dress, an ankle length plaid A line skirt...   Realistically I'm going to end up wearing my local coffee shop shirt and heat retaining leggings most of this week.  No dresses, no parties, no big deal.	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Beauty is Pain	labels:Okay, so there are these totally beautiful shoes. Like they are absolutely to die for. The biggest problem I have is that they don’t fit me. They are just the tiniest bit too small for me. My mom’s solution was actually really simple. Just cut off a part of your feet! Long story short, I did that but the guy I am interested in, totally saw that and is now completely grossed out and it also kinda ruined the shoes. So now I cant stand on my feet without being in agony and I am single. On the upside I can now fit in my stepsisters’ shoes.

text:What’s your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:I'm waiting until we get to the part of the baggy jeans trend when people learn about the ripped, soggy backs of their pant legs that come from the jeans dragging on the ground.

text:Does Anyone Ever Feel Like It’s Hard to Find Basic Clothing Items That Were Plentiful in the Past?	labels:I don't know if I'd consider a velvet dress a basic item.  My basic item is a good quality fitted tee and tank.  Old Navy used to be the place to buy these things but their quality has gone downhill a lot.  I just want a tee or tank that is good for layering, but is not so sheer that I can't wear it alone.  Is something made with fabric heavier than tissue paper too much to ask?  (And by fitted, I don't mean the Everlane oversized/boxy fit.  If I wanted that, I'd shop in the men's section.)

text:This year, I don’t even wanna wear leggings anymore. Just sweatpants/joggers, or actually any loose pants that don’t touch my skin 99% of the time.

If I’m going to be outside for more than ten minutes, I wear a very warm and sort of ugly life coat that goes down to my knees.   Also, last year I invested in a real shearling jacket and I’ve never been so warm. I can’t wait to wear it this year!  Edit: life coat = puffer coat.

text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:One thing I do is remind myself that whatever I want isn't usually one of a kind. This helps me with makeup buying, because I fall in love with colours and buy them and my lipstick collection is out of control. I have to keep reminding myself that whatever beautiful colour I just found out about is either a dupe of something I probably have OR if that colour isn't something I own but the brand is garbage, that other brands will definitely have that colour too.  So for fashion, if you fall in love with a bag from a brand you can't support, just remember that no bag is unique (unless it's like an awesome bag that looks like a giraffe or something). If you love Chanel flaps but refuse to buy from them, there are so many other versions. I have one by Rebecca Minkoff but luxury brands make chain flap purses too without the ickiness of supporting Coco Chanel.  I'm a knitter and weaver, so most knit and woven things I can make myself if I don't like the brand. Same with yarn, if there's a yarn company I don't support, there are millions of other yarn brands out there where I can find something similar enough.  In general, no matter what you're trying to buy, there will be other brands that make something like it. So if you must have it, you don't have to buy from the brand you hate.	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels: Top Apres ski pic is Aspen, isn't it? Unless every resort town has those sidewalks.  Honestly, if really unsure here, I'd look at hashtags and gallery pics from local bars to see what people are wearing.  Denim is COLD in these climates and unpleasant if you're going to be outside a lot.   I feel as if Gorsuch and Alp-n-Rock do these looks well, but yeah, expensively. I would probably look for similar on Asos and maybe Tommy Hilfiger for "sporty but make it sweaters."	episode_done:True
text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:I wear beanies and baseball caps a lot. I leave them on inside usually (usually my hair get messed up by the hat, so I actively avoid taking them off). I know my grandparents used to have a rule about no hats at the dining table, so I’d take mine off then (this was when I was a kid and had a sunhat - it was also impolite to put your hat on the table even if there was room).   I want a bucket hat but haven’t found one I like yet!	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 20, 2021	labels:I was recently awarded a 40 Under 40 award by a regional magazine. Part of the award includes a photoshoot to be printed in said magazine.   I'm a creative director for a living, I work in an environment that prides itself on comfortable dress. I have tailored suits, I know how to put together a nice outfit. However, I'd like to do something a bit different for this shoot. The suit is obvious, it's expected. How can I switch it up? Show off some more creativity in patterns, materials, or unexpected pieces.
text:Start with a classic look that you know works, and then think about what little twists or subversions that you can make.   Could be pattern mixing, an unexpected colour (saturated/deep purple? pink? teal?), unexpected material (denim, velvet), or unexpected pieces (unusual tie clip? tie tack/pin? collar pin/bar?)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:The company already made money off of the original purchase of the shirt, so you buying second hand doesn’t really benefit them in any way. If you really want the item, buying it second hand is probably the most ethical choice you can make. If someone asks where the piece is from, just say you don’t know so they won’t be tempted to buy from the brand lol
text:If you like a piece of clothing but don't want to support the brand that made it, buying it secondhand is a win-win-win situation. You get the clothing you like, the problematic brand doesn't make any money off of your purchase, and you're saving that piece of clothing from ending up in a landfill.   Another option for how you can reply when someone asks where your clothing is from is to say you thrifted it. It's the truth and it might also encourage that person to shop sustainably and secondhand instead of supporting fast fashion or otherwise unethical companies.	labels:Agreed! I love the point of stating that you thrifted it instead of focusing on the brand. It's similar to buying fur secondhand.	episode_done:True

Stop trying to pretend you only speak ching chong”. Turned around after rounding a corner and he was running at me. Had to run into a construction site at grand central station to shake him. Not very fun.
text:What the fuck man, I’m so sorry	labels:All good. Shoulda known better to not walk around midtown at night. People are wack.

text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:There's something between form fitting and loose fitting and it's skimming the body. This looks more like that.   Skim fit can include looser fit items that aren't intended to be overly baggy but aren't intended to be skin tight. u/amelisha is describing this well, but also think about Audrey Hepburn and Jackie O and how their clothes fit them. They weren't skin tight. They were skim tight. Aka as "fitted."  We don't see that as often today with stretch being built into every fabric, and tailoring (beyond hemming) being rare.	episode_done:True

text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:I buy a lot of clothes with special washing instructions.  To me, "hand wash only" usually means "put in in the washer on cold and gentle cycle and hang to dry."   Exceptions: anything made of wool or silk must be washed in the bathtub by hand with The Laundress Wool and Cashmere Shampoo instead of detergent. This is what I do for anything labelled "dry clean only" as well.  Leather is the only thing I do not wash either in the gentle cycle or the bathtub.

I'm thinking a really nice chunky cardigan in a color I don't already have, but I have so many cardigans already and it's only cold here like 3 months out of the year.	episode_done:True

text:How do you guys find your style if you can’t try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:I think you can still return clothing you buy at the store that you aren’t feeling once you try it on at home!

This might not be the case at every store, but at the stores around me they take returns no problem.	episode_done:True

Tips?	labels:I tend to favor the approach that action minimizes self consciousness, not that minimizing self consciousness first will make you comfortable enough to do the action. You might catch yourself setting certain outfits aside, and those are key moments to train yourself to look out for. When you find yourself doing it, make a choice. Some days you may simply wish to be comfortable, no shame. But it may also be important to recognize it makes you feel uncomfortable for now, and then do it anyway.

text:What’s something you wish you could tell clothing manufacturers to do differently?	labels:More jackets with inside pockets.  More raglan sleeves and fewer drop-shoulder sleeves. I prefer a regular shoulder seam, but I think a raglan sleeve looks better than drop sleeves while also making for a more forgiving fit than a regular seam.  This isn't really a manufacturing issue but I wish they'd just size men's and women's shoes the same in the US--an 8 should be a certain number of in/cm rather than changing with the shoe's "gender."  I saw a couple comments about more elastic in clothing and I think this is actually way more common than it was 10-15 years ago because of the effect of the athleisure trend (and it's probably cheaper). It used to be that elastic waists were common in clothing marketed toward older women, plus size women, and young children, but they weren't standard and it was supposed to be embarrassing if you wore elastic-waist pants.
text:I agree with you about everything except the sleeves, I personally would like to throw all raglan sleeves into a fire, and love a dropped sleeve. It’s all preference of course, I swam and rowed for years and have massive shoulders and am very self conscious about how raglans emphasize my shoulders.   Ditto on the elastic! I bought some fancy selvage (ie no stretch whatsoever) jeans and I a) can barely sit in them and b) cannot for the life of me fathom how I wore jeans prior to them containing spandex/elastin or some variety of stretch- I did, but I don’t know how.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:oooooh,so apparently my friends all consider me the laundry queen. I also have the strictest dress code out of all my friends. I will say that much of my wardrobe is machine washable,but even with those pieces I try to limit damage from washing. I have a couple of ways:  1. wearing more often and hanging up between wears to air out and limit wrinkling.  2. Depending upon the item,using an undergarment to protect from sweat etc.  3. Using a steamer to help remove wrinkles and refresh clothes.  4. If having to wash in a machine,gentle cycle on cold and air dry. I use a mesh wash bag for the most delicate articles. I find for a lot of "dry clean only" this method is usually ok.  5. For wools and silks etc. I use Eucalan.   edited to add: I don't really havs brand recs - much of my wardrobe is thrifted and even when I've gotten recognizable brands I don't think I'd be able to say with confidence if they were indicative of the brand's current quality.	episode_done:True
text:Indian factory workers supplying major brands allege routine exploitation	labels:The crux of the article (and exploitation in general):  > #'Brands are to blame' >  > These kinds of brands do not own or operate factories in India, which creates distance between them and working conditions there, but one owner of a clothing supplier - who did not want to be named - told the BBC that if brands push for cheaper clothes it can leave suppliers with no choice but to cut corners to meet orders. >  > "It's the brand who wants to maximize the profit. So, they push you to a level wherein you have to do the exploitation in order to survive," he said. >  > The owner, who used to supply a major UK brand not mentioned in this story, described some factory audit processes as a "sham". >  > "The factory is aware when the auditors are coming, so they keep everything in perfect condition before," he said. "The moment the audit is over, everything goes back to normal, which means exploitation and non compliance." >  > He said that poor checks and balances, combined with a lack of responsibility by the brands, makes it hard to stamp out that exploitation. >  > **"It is the way of working in the textile industry, it's just not India, it's everywhere."**

text:It’s 2021. A vaccine for the virus has been made widely available and businesses may operate at full capacity, including bars, clubs, salons, etc. How will this influence fashion?	labels:People will go ALL OUT. This sub usually salivates at the thought of athleisure taking over and killing fashion (and fast fashion) but that 100% wouldn't happen. Almost every woman I know is bloody sick and tired of not getting to dress up, not being able to wear lipstick, not having places to wear heels and vacation outfits. People would literally go crazy and it truly would be the roaring twenties. Dresses of all types, miniskirts, sparkle and glitter, heels for days, fun fabrics, bolder colors, leather pants, blouses with impractical sleeves, statement earrings – women would really be dressing to the nines *and* wearing bold lipstick colors to compliment.
text:I totally agree. I haven’t bought or worn heels for years because I was spending so much time doing day to day tasks I wasn’t willing to commit to wearing something inconvenient and uncomfortable 5-7 days a week. Now that my work has moved to permanent WFH I feel so much more free to focus on less practical “going out clothes” that don’t need to double as everydaywear. If I’m only visiting the office once a week (by my own choice) it’s a treat, not a chore to wear something nice	labels:	episode_done:True

A velvet cami from SheIn before it was popular haha, I eventually got more colours and they’re still holding strong a couple of years later.  Knit sandals from amazon, fav purchase ever!

I get the opposite too where I can’t let go of dresses because I wore it on a first date or to a memorable evening with friends I don’t want to forget. I think about these events whenever I’m rifling through my closet and come across these pieces and it makes me smile.

text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:This isn’t a direct answer to your question, but I’ve found I have a ‘hopeful’ sense of style and a ‘realistic’ sense of style.  Hopeful-me will think about buying a teal floral wrap dress because it’s gorgeous. Realistic-me knows it will sit in my closet untouched for 3 years because I don’t wear teal!   I’ve learned to differentiate between the two while I shop, at least. If I was a celebrity suddenly, maybe I would lean towards hopeful-me’s style, but for now I am normal and realistic!

text:How Japan's Best Men’s Magazines Gained a Cult Following in the US	labels:I love these magazines for their pictures and some articles, but I always felt a lot of them just end up being big ads for their friends stores/brands. Many of the ones made by the same publisher like Clutch, 2nd, Go Out, Lightning also just focus on buying with some short flowery description of the product and not much else. I’d like to see more stuff that involves lifestyle, articles, and stuff. Although it makes sense that the lack of this has brought in more readers from the west, more product pictures and less blocks of text. I also understand that the magazines scopes are limited so therefore they must retread the same discussions over and over.  Also the fact that Go Outs focuses mostly on glamping (glam camping, it was a top searched word in Japan last year) kills me as some one who loves outdoor stuff. It doesn’t have much in the way of actual camping, just setting up huge luxurious tents in an open field for the most part.  Maybe I’m just salty because all the magazines show cool stores but all of them are in Tokyo while never here in Kyoto.	episode_done:True
text:How do ya'll express your culture or traditional fashion in modern clothing?	labels:I am Danish, and unlike our Scandinavian neighbours (and Greenland and Faroe Islands in the kingdom), we dont have any national attire per say.

text:Seconded, it's also just an ugly style.	labels:Harry is such a genuinely sweet person I don't like how he's made up to be some fashionista because I find it doesn't always look natural on him.

text:Best of Techwearclothing 2020	labels:!mfaimagebot 17 49 74 93 95 71  I'm into these. The westernish vibes from 17 and 49 are cool, 74 is channeling a bit of Harrison Ford (Indy or Han, take your pick), and 93 and 95 are quite close to modern tactical "greyman" wear, but aren't super militant, and I wouldn't necessarily pick 93 from a crowd, that sweater does a good job of casualizing (there's gotta be a better word for this) the outift. 95 does look a bit like a GoRuck ad. 71 looks a bit like he drank all of the greyman coolaid.   I'm seeing lots of room for people to blouse their pants into their boots and I dig it.   I got into MFA to get away from costumey clothing but I'm finding it might get me back into it lol.

There's like, 12 feet from our front door to our back sliding door and it goes through our living room space. Ruggable, while not plush, appears to be durable and has done a great job of protecting our wood floors and not allowing dirt to track too far into our house.   We also have one in the kitchen space because I am chaotic af in the kitchen and often accidentally drop knives.

I'm working on figuring out what 'styles' I enjoy, and a few pieces that would fit each style, so that I can have maximum options with a minimal(dish) amount.       I've been working on creating a capsule just for work though - even though my job skews casual, there are some safety rules that I should abide by when I'm in the lab space like long pants and closed toe shoes.  Plus, I seem to be more productive when I'm dressed more business-y.  I haven't figured out how to separate them in my closet though since we don't have a ton a space in our loft.	episode_done:True

I just want a tee or tank that is good for layering, but is not so sheer that I can't wear it alone.  Is something made with fabric heavier than tissue paper too much to ask?  (And by fitted, I don't mean the Everlane oversized/boxy fit.  If I wanted that, I'd shop in the men's section.)

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Disclaimer-- I know myself well enough to know that a capsule wardrobe is not for me.  When I get back from traveling, I cannot wait to wear different clothes.  Consider your laundry situation.  Having a smaller wardrobe means that you will be doing laundry more often.  If you're one in a family of 6, it may not be a big deal.  But for a single apartment dweller (pay per load), the additional costs can add up quickly.   Because I pay per load, I make sure that I maximize the capacity and only wash full loads (I'm paying the same no matter the capacity).  I am not one to hand-wash clothes in a bathroom sink.  Not now, not ever!   I do laundry roughly every other week alternating lights and darks.  (Sheets and towels are their own ballgame, and I will sometimes throw things in with them.)
text:Just curious but why didn't you get a washing machine for the apartment?	labels:Some condos either don't have space or they don't have the right connections. I do wonder if some rental apartments mandate coin laundry.
text:It's weird to control what appliances go into places you rent out in my opinion.  I only want to know what conditions lead to her not owning one because it is common where I'm from even in the cheapest type... People are so overly sensitive here they downvote anything that has the slightest possibility of being offensive	labels:Washer and dryers aren’t so common in a lot of rentals in Canada- not sure about the States. There are communal paid spaces in a lot of rental buildings. Condos and houses usually have them though and if you are renting a place with your own washer and dryer you are paying a premium and it can be a difference of a couple hundred dollars more a month in rent.
text:Is it actually that ridiculous? Granted I'm in a major Canadian city so rent is rather ridiculous anyways.	labels:I am too. I am in Ottawa and that is just the reality. A lot of apartments are older buildings and would need to be completely retrofitted to accommodate individual washers and dryers in each unit.	episode_done:True
text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:I spent like two months investing in a bunch of nice wool sweaters that I could wear through the winter, put them in a separate laundry bin after wearing so I could launder them myself, but my ex washed and dried them on high heat and they all shrunk so badly that I couldn't even fit them on my dog. About $1500 gone.
text:This pisses me off so much. Something tells me he never made that mistake with his nice clothes.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:This is small but one piece of shopping advice I still use is, ‘will I wear this tonight?’ Obviously for many items that is not a literal question but I find if I say no that may not be the right item for me.  Helps me pass on things that are nice but not right for my personality or lifestyle. I actually learned a lot from Ines de la Fressange’s book Parisian Chic. It’s a very general style book, it’s less about her taste, which is great, and more about how to have a quality collection that fits you.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: How do I know my clothes weren't made with slave labour?	labels:Same as always, buy used, you can’t trust corporations to tell you the truth about their labour practices, in part because they have a very vested interest in not telling you the truth and in part because actually tracking he supply chains for clothing is incredibly difficult to do accurately, and, yes this applies to the cool mid range denim brand that replies to all your posts on ig. Even Patagonia got busted for using Slave Labor, if you look past the long winded apology letters they put out since they got caught, the reality is that it’s basically intrinsically locked into the supply chain of modern clothing production unless you're paying thousands upon thousands of dollars to have a local tailor make all of your clothes using locally sourced materials.  Buying used is the single most ethical option you have, and, frankly, is the better option anyway	episode_done:True

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:Secondhand all the way! 90% of my wardrobe is secondhand. Poshmark, ebay, depop, thredup, the list goes on. Thrifting too!
text:I was going to say this - I “challenged” myself to buy only secondhand for a year but it’s been so easy it hasn’t even been a challenge and I’ve carried on with it! The downfall is the occasional thing doesn’t fit or look right, but I either re-sell it or practice my (rudimentary) sewing on it. If I buy something off eBay that’s high end and good quality fabric - and would be way out of my budget new - I take to get tailored, because I’m scared I’ll botch it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Closet Organization By Color	labels:I do style of clothing and then color within that  So short sleeve/tank blouses by color, then long sleeve by color, then dresses by color and so on.   Definitely helps me find the item I am looking for and identify where there might be gaps in my wardrobe
text:This is my system! I go from lightest to darkest color within each clothing category. I love the way my closet looks—meanwhile my husband’s half of the closet is 90% blue 😂	labels:Dark blue is a neutral and you can’t convince me otherwise!	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 08	labels:Found a lovely YSL coat on Grailed, only issue is that it is too long for my taste... Would it be heresy to tailor it shorter? Yes. Am I considering it? Yes.
text:Is the model as intended too long for your taste or do you feel like it would be too long for your frame/height?   I’m not sure you really would want to make a major alteration in the first case like alter one that falls below the knees to have it fall above them or whatever. It’ll look off is my feeling.	labels:Both tbh.  I only plan on cutting an inch or two at the most. But only if it feels like it when wearing. It is hard to measure that sorta thing.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 20, 2021	labels:My partner is now officially my spouse. I now wear a ring which will look good with my fits, but feels really weird being just ... there on my hand, all the time now.  They vetoed me posting pictures (we have public facing jobs, these pictures are all over social media, too easy to reverse image search etc.), but they wore a Rick Owens dress (that I picked out) while I went full minimalism with a collarless shirt with onyx studs, a sleek blazer and cropped trousers. I put this together from my existing wardrobe, since we didn't want to spend a lot. Covid measures made things a bit weird, but the court officer made a real effort into making it nice, which was great. (edit: just so nobody thinks we are totally irresponsible: it was literally just us at city hall, no guests, no party. We'll catch up with that after vaccination.)

text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:I think the pressure is to not be "strange/unaware of your appearance" or more likely not to look "poor/can't afford more clothes." Some people do notice, and the rude ones point it out. This perception starts young. Growing up, there were teachers and other school staff who repeated outfits and other children loudly pointed it out.  I repeat outfits as much as possible if I'm not seeing the same people (my household doesn't count). The internal pressure is strong to not repeat within a few weeks of seeing the same people to avoid potential comments.
text:I had a teacher in high school who I realized basically had a capsule wardrobe for work - she had like 7 tops, a few cardigans, a few dresses and a couple pairs of pants/jeans and like one skirt. They all matched each other and she mixed them up so that she had a different outfit every day. I didn't notice until like halfway through the school year but once I did I thought it was pretty cool, and a great way to look nice for work and save money. She always looked good!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:Assuming you wear jeans and a t shirt now and then, go out and buy a cheap t shirt or two in a colour you like. If you find yourself wearing them regularly, buy some more bright items. If you don't wear them much, then perhaps bright colours are not for you, at least now, and you won't have spent much to find out.	episode_done:True
text:Does your language affect how you wear colors?	labels:I describe the colours in my wardrobe more specifically than their overall category already, so I'm sure I'd do this no matter how many categories there were.	episode_done:True

text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:I wear it at home. So I can get used to it without others seeing me. After a bit I suddenly feel more comfortable.   Also, avoid mirrors! This helped massively when I was trying to get comfortable wearing bright lipsticks.
text:I will definitely keep this in mind, thank you! You're right, now that I think about it, pretty much all the time I spend in front of the mirror has always been to criticize and never to be satisfied.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Do you have any pieces that "should not" work with your body that just seems to work?	labels:I find most rules are trash, and ascribe to shaming women for having different features. If you have broad shoulders, a padded blazer with sharp lines can be such an aesthetic.   I find if you don't believe in fashion rules, there's always a version of something that will work for you.
text:I don't find that at all. I watched a video where 4 women with different body shapes all tried styles that weren't supposed to be flattering. At the end of the video, the opinions hadn't changed.  I do see how that can be limiting & believe that people should wear whatever they want regardless though.	labels:I mean, a video intended to prove a point is going to select examples that support their argument, no?	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I play in my closet a lot. Just take a Saturday and try on different combinations. Layering really helps too and trying out different color combinations. And of course I use Pinterest and IG for inspiration, I really like what the women wear at Fashion Weeks so I try to re-create those looks. I follow style that's like mine and then of course where I aspire to be or just that I find interesting and different.	episode_done:True

I don't know why the right lapel is buckling in both shots, and the shoulders are a mess - rippling, and shoulder pads lurching out about the shoulder  The last photo is a better fitting suit, but also an argument against contrasting colored button on a business-y fabric - this medium-light brown buttons were the wrong choice

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.
text:This is the right advice. I've been a ski racer for many years. Most of the best jackets like Arc'teryx, HH, etc will prioritize their shells with all the nice features like Recco, pit zips, pass pockets, goggle cleaners etc. Shells are excellent for cutting through wind and then you can have more or less layers depending on the temperature for insulation.   My current setup is an under armour (Costco has great ones from a brand called 32 degrees or something like that), a Hot Chilis quarter zip, a vest that I got as a gift from Marker, and a patagonia poly fill that I swap out for down if it's cold all under my shell. If I'm in a GS suit it's mostly just the under armour and then two coats because it's a bitch to carry layers around as you have to shed them to race.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.
text:Band tee, jeans/shorts (sometimes "fancy shorts"), flip flops/sneakers/boots. A lot of my clothes come from the thrift store. When it comes to shoes and coats, I prefer classic and quality over quantity. A great wool peacoat and converse for example. Quality leather boots and bags that last for years. I have a few dresses that I wear on occasion. The irony is that I used to get in trouble all the time over uniform violations growing up. Like OP, I love fashion and the fashion other people wear, but it's just too much of a whole "thing" to try to express myself through fashion, especially because shopping for "new" clothes is part of that. Music is a huge part of my identity, so whatever t-shirt I choose to wear that day says something about me.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you challenge yourself?	labels:Whenever I challenge myself to wear something different it usually ends up not being worn. Some may call my style stagnant but I do upgrade my classics so that they don't look dated.  I'm one of those crazies that loves fashion yet prefers to stay invisible in her preppy, black/navy/grey/white uniform.	episode_done:True
text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Congrats! I did this in 2019 and I bought so much less in 2020 than I did in 2018. It's still really hard to resist buying clothing, but knowing I did it for a whole year without losing it does help.	episode_done:True
text:Closet Organization By Color	labels:I organize in order of my thought process of what o want to wear. Typically I think about the type of clothing, the color I want, and then the sleeve length, dress length, or pant length. So each category of clothing is separated (tops, jackets, dresses, skirts, pants) then each category is organized by color. Within each color I order from shortest to longest (sleeve length, dress length, etc). Within each length I go lightest to darkest.   This method works well for my style of thinking, and I LOVE how it looks so organized and visually pleasing. I would really try to track your thought process when picking out an item/outfit and organize from there!	episode_done:True

They go out of style quickly and leave you with regrets.  Usually a basic/timeless base with a one or two trendy pieces shouldn't leave you embarrassed two years from now	episode_done:True
text:Elk IV Parka from Wuxly Movement	labels:I don't see how canada goose promotes animal abuse. The down is never live plucked and the fur is sourced from animals that are killed by the state because of overpopulation
text:The issues people have is with how the fur is obtained, and a large portion of CG's fur is obtained through trapping. And trapping is generally looked down on as the animal can remain in the trap for days or even weeks at a time suffering. Are coyotes extremely overpopulated in a lot of areas of Canada and need to have their population culled? Yes, absolutely, and anyone trying to argue otherwise is a fool that doesn't understand the negative effect coyotes have on local animal populations. But allowing these animals to suffer for so long isn't the way to go about it. So the main crux of the issue is that yes, the fur is technically obtained legally and from a severely overpopulated species, but the way that it's obtained isn't ethical and shouldn't be encouraged.  This being said, CG has pledged to switch to "reclaimed fur" (whatever that means) starting in 2022.  Oops, kinda glazed over the down part. I've personally never seen anyone slate CG for how they collect their down, it's the fur that's the issue. Apologies for misreading at first. Though apparently it took them until the end of 2019/start of 2020 to become 100% RDS (responsible down standard) certified so maybe there were issues I haven't heard about...	labels:	episode_done:True

text:BoF: J. Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:i just feel like their price points are so high and the quality can be kind of mediocre. they’re stuck in a weird place where their pricing is too expensive for the average consumer who’s trained to expect bargains and too cheap for someone who buys luxury or higher end pieces.   even with their random extra 50% off sales, it’s still above what people expect to pay. but then again, madewell is thriving. (though i think that has more to do with being able to capture an on-trend aesthetic.)
text:I'm a J. Crew loyalist, so I'm acknowledging my potential bias but I'm also a fan of Banana Republic and went through a hardcore BR phase. However, I've kind of forsaken Banana (my young professional wardrobe was full of it) and returned to even more J. Crew -- I've found that, in general, my pieces from J. Crew last longer and hold their shape/quality more than what I have bought from Banana. Also those 50% sales are usually goldmines for me! Just my experience!	labels:I loooove BR - they’re in my price range and their clothes just fit me well - but quality is absolutely hit or miss. I have stuff I’ve had for years, and I also have a dress that I wore twice and then a ribbon on the back just fell off haha. But for my budget, if I’m picky, I do very well there. (Love J Crew for linen pants and shorts, though!)
text:The crazy variations in quality seem to be there across the whole BR brand family. I have some things from Gap that have held up for literal decades, while others started looking like crap after a few washes. Then there's Old Navy which is mostly very low quality (though probably about on par with the price point for most of their stuff), but occasionally something of theirs will last forever.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:In my experience, lower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose) and spending more tends to lead to a more noticeable improvement in quality up to a certain point. That's painting with a broad brush though... leather dress shoes and boots scale much better than sneakers or sandals, where mid-range options are going to be good enough for most people.  T-shirts, dress shirts, denim, and accessories in low-to-mid-range are generally good enough from a quality perspective IMO and I've only really paid more in those categories for a design I like rather than because I think I'm getting something higher quality. There's nothing wrong IMO with buying something because you like the way it looks even if a similar quality alternative exists at a lower price, but that's harder to do if you're shopping on a budget.  I'll also add that for all of the above, your dollar goes a lot farther if you're willing to shop used. Sites like Ebay, Grailed, reddit/styleforum B/S/T threads, etc. have made it a lot easier to buy preowned clothes without having to set foot into a thrift store.  TL;DR When shopping on a budget I'd focus first on having a high quality pair of shoes and jacket. Consider buying used clothes to stretch your budget further.
text:I'd say it goes Shoes > Coat/Jacket > Trousers/Jeans > Socks > Shirts > Underwear > Tshirts.  I'm not saying that you can get away with crappy tees but you can definitely find a tee for £10 that's better quality than some of the £80 ones. Favourite tees I've ever owned are Uniqlo U at around £13 and a JCrew washed pocket tee they did maybe 10 years ago that I bought in the US for $20.  If your coat and your shoes are good, you can generally get away with budget on everything else provided it fits. I do think people underestimate how much of a difference a quality pair of denim and good socks make though.	labels:Seconding socks. Good socks are life changing. I read on reddit years ago not to skimp on anything that gets between me and gravity. Tires, boots, mattress, and socks. I rarely wear shoes (boots only) so my socks are purely for personal comfort, and nothing beats a good pair of wool socks. Go darn tough or rag wool knit socks from someone like LL Bean, and learn to darn them, and you'll never go back.	episode_done:True

All the celebrities do it during award season, why can't we???	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:Filters are your friend. I like to start with brand - otherwise the search is way too broad and overwhelming. If you fill in your sizing the app will automatically filter out things that will not fit you (which culls the list quite a bit). If you find an item you like try looking through the seller’s other listings as well- often I’ll find other items that appeal to my taste or discover new brands this way. I think you can suss out a lot about the seller based on the way they describe the items & pics they take too - someone who just Marie kondo’d their closet will have different kinds of items than someone who sells as a side hustle  The big appeal to me is the thrill of the hunt!! Happy shopping :)	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - October 27	labels:I think early MFA and the attendant blogosphere it spawned / belonged to / helped popularise is partially to blame for the whole "timeless" nonsense.  We've come a long way from "well dressed men wear suits" to "actually shirts and blazers can be dressed down" to "actually you can wear what you want and look good", and maybe the whole "timeless", "dapper", "classic", "gentleman" thing was a necessary part of the journey, but... would it just fucking die please.
text:I think people maybe forget what the culture was here a long time ago. Runway looks were *never* talked about. OCBDs literally were the height of fashion.   *Timelessness* was also very much a product of the post-recession mindset and attributing it to MFA seems a bit grandiose.	labels:> I think people maybe forget what the culture was here a long time ago. Runway looks were never talked about. OCBDs literally were the height of fashion.   As I recall it it was just a lot of noobs helping other noobs and trying to bootstrap an understanding of fashion out of that. Actually worked reasonably well for what it was, but the results were sometimes terribly myopic. I think it's better now.  > Timelessness was also very much a product of the post-recession mindset and attributing it to MFA seems a bit grandiose.  Yeah I wasn't sure about "spawned" -- "belonged to" seems definitely right, though. But many of the blogs really pushing for #menswear (DAE spezzatura) seemed to be posted here a lot and gained a lot of their community following from here. Can't really say how much MFA just sat within this zeitgeist and how much it helped shape and propagate it.  You've been here more consistently than most, perhaps you have a more refined impression on how that went?
text:> As I recall it it was just a lot of noobs helping other noobs and trying to bootstrap an understanding of fashion out of that. Actually worked reasonably well for what it was, but the results were sometimes terribly myopic. I think it's better now.  Pretty accurate.  >But many of the blogs really pushing for #menswear (DAE spezzatura) seemed to be posted here a lot and gained a lot of their community following from here. Can't really say how much MFA just sat within this zeitgeist and how much it helped shape and propagate it.  True as well.  It's hard and uncomfortable to think about, but at that time you really had to couch things in such ways because men (straight men) were generally just uncomfortable thinking about/caring about their appearance. "Metrosexual", as a term, came about (much earlier, in the early aughts iirc) because it was so hard to imagine *straight men* caring about their appearance.  Whereas now someone saying "I just don't want to look gay" is a borderline bannable offense, at the time it was the mindset of the entire ecosystem, really. Mad Men, lumberjacks, James Dean, and Steve McQueen; nothing to worry about, there. The couching of these things in terms of *timelessness*, or *classicness* or *investment*, or *gentlemanliness*, or whatever, was a way of making it acceptable for you to care about your appearance and work on it.	labels:Oh, yeah, *Mad Men*, I forgot about that. Showing to everyone that back when men were men, it was okay for *these* men to care about their suits, but in a *manly* way. It's coming back to me. I think some even went all the way back to chivalric virtues in their quest for manliness.  I guess it was a necessary step to go that route so men could see that it is and has always been okay to care about one's appearance. Perhaps we can transcend the leftovers in a few years.	episode_done:True

text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:So what works for me is whenever I'm getting dressed and there's an item I wish I had to complete the outfit I mentally note it. Make sure to think of the category of item Ex Black Cargo pants, Brown hoodie w/ no drawstrings and no logo, white chunky sneakers. Etc.   Then as time goes by, the categories that come up over and over are the most important to grab first and would improve the most outfits. I add them to a list  If I'm shopping and I want something but it's not on my list then I try to pass on buying it. When a deal pops up and it's something on my list it's a no brainer instant purchase.   I try to be patient and wait for items that meet all my picky criteria. If I'm not in love with it I don't buy it. If even one thing is not right, I pass.   And final thing is I aim high whenever I buy for these categories in quality and spend time hunting. Ex: If I have $250 for a jacket I try and wait till a $600 jacket goes on sale for $250.

That being said, skinny jeans are pretty much staples for most people. They go with a lot of outfits and make a lot of looks.   Just because something isn't currently on trend, does not mean it can't be stylish.
text:I never got on the mom jeans bandwagon to me they seemed both uncomfortable (no stretch) and unflattering. If a cut of jean even looked unflattering on the runway models probably not a good sign for the rest of us.	labels:And for me, the mom jeans look really washes out what little butt I have!	episode_done:True
text:Those of you who, like me, don't have a closet (sob).. how do you organize your clothing/shoes/accessories/jewelry?	labels:I store 90% of my stuff in drawers in a sideboard that also functions as a nightstand. Winter jackets are in an ikea tub/drawer thing under the bed in summer and on a door mounted hanger in winter. 2-3 blazers/formal clothing that I only wear on special occasions and don't like to crumple up are in my boyfriends closet though. If I didn't have that space I'd probably buy dust covers and a small rack or another door mounted thing.
text:Same here drawers for in season clothes.  I store my off season clothes in another room (out of sight out of mind).  Even in the drawer I try to keep 2 months clothes in main 2 drawer and then back up in another 2.  This way I only see 2 months worth of clothes at same time	labels:	episode_done:True

I realized when that calamari dude was wearing the fisherman sweater, it struck me as being out of place. I love how most of the robes and things seem very interesting, but also lived in and functional. Everyone just wears whatever they want or whatever suits their lifestyle, and no one else pays it much mind. Dude walking around in shiny battle armor? Sure, I’ll just mind my own business  Also the cinematography of todays episode was dope. Amazing vibes and colors (clearly in debt to old samurai films )	labels:	episode_done:True
text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:Clothes are never ever an investment. With the extremely few exceptions like Birkins and limited edition Chanel bags or stuff like that, it's not a thing.   Clothes will not retain their value and it's naive to think that you can buy something and expect to recoup more than half your money after *5 years* of wearing it. Especially since it's probably already a few years old when you buy it.  Pret a porter does not do as well as bags on the resale market. No one gives a shit that your old cardigan is designer because in another 5 years it will not only be worn out, it will be really outdated. If someone is paying hundreds for one single item, they're not buying worn from a collection 10 years ago AND still be willing to pay half the original price.
text:Seconding this	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I like wearing completely insane looking things. My day job (pre pandemic) is in museums and I'm a specialist in historical textiles and fashion. My last job had a running joke that I was actually a time traveling medieval witch on the run from the inquisition. I wear adaptations of freaking medieval kirtles. I look like a very well dressed mad woman and it's awesome.  Outlandish and soulless are not the same thing. To. Me honestly they're opposite ends of the spectrum. What feels truly soulless to me is trying so hard to appeal to someone else in that you lose a sense of self.  Be bizarre and outlandish. Just do it for the right reasons. Wear your witch hat and make petticoats cool again. Fashion is not the enemy. Small wardrobes and neutrals are not the holy grail. Finding out that some people try to cheat and buy their way to an image doesn't matter. You can still make it awesome.  Now I'm off to try and find somewhere to wear my purple satin kimono with cream and gold brocade trim to.

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.
text:Evidently, I present as “an upper middle class lesbian” (quote stolen from a FFAer). I’m not but whatever. Assume away. Clothing style is a combo of conservative/traditional New England/androgynous except for shoes ;-)  Pros: Was never sexually harassed at work. Also, lesbians were treated very well *in my division* of the aerospace corporation I worked at (more than a few in mgmt). Suspect there was some “honorary man” caca going on but it certainly benefited other women that did not behave/present traditionally.   Cons: None that I noticed but I’m pretty clueless. Took me until my late 40s to figure out I present this way.  ETA - I have discovered that now that I’m technically “old” dressing better is to my advantage. See invisibility & condescension.	labels:hahaha "honorary man" hahaha wtf

text:Hedi Slimane’s CELINE- an idealized look at 1960s rock & roll (large inspiration album)	labels:Love the inspiration folder, showing the clear influences and understanding of Celine under Slimane.  I do really enjoy Celine before Dancing Kid, but the latest collection wasn’t targeted to me.  The Dancing Kid is really to appeal to a new generation of buyers, when the past collections were to appeal to people who knew him as a designer.  I do like Dancing Kid though as a collection, I think it fits in with his more androgynous side that used to be more common with his days at Dior.  But it’ll be interesting to see where the brand goes post S/S 21 because I honestly don’t know what will happen.  I personally love the style and influences he had for Celine pre Dancing Kid.  As a kid who grew up watching French New Wave and listening to music from the British Invasion, I can definitely see myself transitioning to wearing clothes like that when I get back into an office.  It’ll always look cool.
text:I completely agree with your assessment- there is not a lot from The Dancing Kid that is cohesive through his earlier collections, but also recognize that it was calculated to broaden the appeal of the Label beyond Hedi devotees. I'm very excited to see what the FW21 show will look like, and if it extends the Dancing Kid, or goes back to his more historic influences.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:You Need A Budget. No, really - it's the best money-management app/process I've found. I signed up when I realized that I had promise to pay for a family Italian cruise because I had my first well-paying job - But I didn't seem to be getting ahead even though I was making twice as much as I had before. Zero-based budgeting in general is the way to go but I love YNAB for making that system easy to manage.  The thing that works for me about zero-based is that I can really easily prioritize the things that are important to me and also see the trade-off I'm making for every purchase if I change those priorities. It keeps those little windfalls or pay raises from just vanishing into the ether. I got paid $64 last week for a poshmark sale, and I immediately put that money in my March rent category. Before, I would have gone and bought a new shirt, or spent it all on soup dumplings, or bought a new shirt and then spilled the soup dumplings I also bought on the new shirt. 😅  If fashion is important to you, then you can prioritize that and invest in a wardrobe that will give you joy. If it's travel, put your money toward that instead, and you'll feel the power to walk away from a good sale because you know it's just a distraction from your real goals. I still spend a lot on clothes and eating out, but I no longer feel guilty or stressed about it, because when I spend it's a conscious choice.  I guess this is more general financial advice than specific to OP's situation, but I find it useful for any of us who have expensive hobbies (aka all of mine) or potential big expenses like OP's.	episode_done:True

text:Best White T-Shirts for Men 2021 - Wirecutter	labels:I am currently wearing a Lady White Co white t shirt, I love the fit and material.. but I dyed it brown lmao.  These are great t shirts, except something about them is just impossible to keep white. Maybe they havent been bleached as much ,or for some reason the fibers absorb more color, but it has been a real pain since day one. I don't really understand it  After the first wash left these weird extra white blotchy patches, which only showed up in direct sunlight. After many washes, these seemed to have gone away, though I'm not sure if the overall color has changed.  These shirts are constantly getting discolored by the wash (admittedly high in iron), and picks up all sorts of residue from the drying rack, or normal wear. Compared to every other white garment I've had, they are just super finicky. Like, its not ever been an issue with my other shirts, but these are always finding new stains to show off. One might say that I'm more critical of a $50 shirt than a $10 one, but I feel like this is an objective observation.  Ultimately, I'm much happier having dyed them to other colors. I prefer clothes which look better with age, so I tend to avoid white generally, but these are extra frustrating given the price and the hype. It dosnt matter to me how great the construction or fit is if they are a pain to keep clean.  The article says they are "offwhite", maybe this has changed? I feel like mine were very white to begin with.  It makes me wonder if something is different about the bleach or dyeing method compared to other brands	episode_done:True

Women often complain about the sexism of pockets (and that's legit) but can we also recognize that it's nice to be able to carry all this handy stuff all the time, which is totally socially acceptable for women and not for men?	labels:Yes, for sure - I’d be lost without half this stuff, and in my opinion, these are such handy items that a lot of people would be hard-pressed to find in an emergency type of situation and would be appreciative to have.

text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:I love their (Amy, Dione, and the Tibi brand) style but sometimes their pretentiousness irks me. They go like oh you can wear whatever you like but then they come up with 1000 rules about what should not be worn together. Anyway, if you like that style and also like to DIY things you can totally adjust regular items to look like Tibi ones. For instance, the asymmetrical shirt that closes a bit on the diagonal, the buttons that are used to pull up the sleeves, the ankle bands on some of their pants, etc. can all be recreated relatively easily and you don't need to spend 100s of $ on their "affordable" items (Amy's words, I always crack up when she boasts about how affordable Tibi clothes are).
text:I have to say I don't see them as hard rules, but more like principles of how to understand what looks good and what looks tired/tried-too-hard. For example, the rule of having only one white thing or not wearing necklaces and earrings or similar. I think it is a way of simplifying a formula of how to dress well, rules are easy to remember. At least it is my perception of what they are saying.  Yeah, concerning affordable items... It is above my reasonable clothes budget. I don't have to look expensive for my job and I would rather splurge for a good trip, books or a course. This is pragamtism for me.	labels:I know they say they that they are not hard rules and that nobody needs to follow them, but sometimes they sound condescending when talking about things that don't work for them and that's what I don't like.	episode_done:True

text:Has consulting a stylist really been a revelation to you?	labels:A few years ago i was feeling badly about myself following the end of a 4 year relationship. I decided to find a local personal shopper to go through my closet and help me decide what to keep/donate. She also provided me with ways to wear what i already had. From that, she created a list of things she thought i would need to add to my wardrobe according to my lifestyle and wants/needs. We then went to the mall a few days later and she brought in tons of things to try. The rule was that i had to show her everything, but i had the final say as to what i wanted to get. This was great because it also provided me with an opportunity to get more styling tips on items i don’t currently own but might consider moving forward.  Since then, i have felt so much more confident in how i dress and i constantly receive tons on compliments. I would 10/10 recommend this to anyone who wants to change their style or learn more about what looks best on them. I figured the $400 i spent on her was equivalent to how much money I’d spend on items i would never actually wear, and in the long run became an investment :).
text:Great story and valuable insight! Thanks for sharing.  While working with youe stylist, when you decided on color and styles, what criteria did you use?

text:Trying to get into jewelry	labels:It depends on the person, so ymmv. But when I'm trying to branch out and try different styles of jewelry, I get super cheap stuff on AliExpress. If I like the look/style of some pieces, I'll invest in higher quality pieces from there. That way if something is not for me, I don't feel bad about throwing it away.
text:Good suggestion! Thanks	labels:I'd try to avoid AliExpress (and Shein etc) for jewellery (or in general) because they shamelessly rip off designers and artisans' own original designs and then sell them at a pittance. I also avoid buying from sellers on etsy/depop/eBay who are using AliExpress charms for similar reasons. It's not always easy to know whether something has been stolen (Etsy is flooded with AliExpress-type stuff)  but ruling out places where this is the actual business model is a start. Especially if you don't want loads of pieces you may as well spend the few extra ££ supporting designers, or at least not harming them.	episode_done:True

Naturally, I tried on a $5,000 Bottega Venetta coat that SCREAMED my name from the rack.   The fabric, weight, feel, and look were so so so much nicer than any other coat I had ever warn. Before I even saw the price tag ( I thought it must cost no more than $1k bc I'm an inexperienced dummy), I felt so luxurious and confident in it.

Good thread on the SLP teddy, but just about nothing in there is surprising. Is it well-constructed? Duh, it's SLP. Does it have little refinements all over, compared to everyday varsity jackets? Yeah, that's kind of the point. Is it "worth" $2,000? No, obviously not.   Like...at some point we need to acknowledge that these efforts are misguided, even if well-intentioned. You're buying SLP because it's SLP (or Ackermann, or Dick Ovens, or whatever your thing is). *That* is the justification. And that's a fine justification in and of itself! An analysis of the materials and construction is unlikely to throw up surprises that'll make people go "damn, that really makes it worth the obnoxious price tag!"   (This observation does not apply to bespoke clothing, where the justification genuinely is that you get something more or less customized for you, and you alone.)  What do people think?

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "A Primer on Materials"	labels:There’s a lot of information about which fabrics keep you warm, but not as much about which fabrics keep you cool.  Cotton, for example, gets a bad rap because it fails to keep you warm when wet - but the same properties make it a very cooling fabric to wear in hot and dry climates.
text:same for wool! people think wool is only good for winter to keep you warm, but some wool garments are great at keeping you cool as well!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Anyone here has the habit of needing to buy a new clothing/set of clothings when attending an occasion/going somewhere?	labels:I was in the habit of thinking I need something new when attending a fancy event like a wedding. I would then donate the items. Nowadays, even before COVID, I wasn't getting invited to much so I don't have this problem anymore. In the future, I plan on wearing the same things again. If I thought I could get things that fit well in my size and don't need tailoring, I would rent instead.	episode_done:True

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I got my first fancy bag after calling off my wedding lol I figured it cost around the same amount as the dress I wouldn’t ever wear so why not? The woman at the LV store thought I was on drugs ... “are you celebrating something?” And I’m like as a matter of fact, yes, yes I am. I just lost a ton of money on a wedding but I dodged a bullet and left that POS. All she said was “well you can always make more money” anyway, I’m getting a Chanel bag for my next milestone birthday. Not sure which one but it’s gonna happen soon.

text:What are your go-to basic fall tops? I’m talking long sleeve tees, sweatshirts, turtlenecks etc!	labels:Thanks for asking this :) i have the same question! I used to get all my long sleeve shirts from Target but I’m trying to shop higher quality/more sustainable. I just bought 2 long sleeve shirts from Prana and they are very soft and flattering. They were on sale when I got them, I don’t remember if they’re within your budget if not on sale.	episode_done:True
text:Alternative to bras?	labels:I basically live in bralettes right now. In the summer I wear a lot of camisoles with built-in support. Traditional bras, in addition to being less comfortable, somehow also make me feel fatter and look fatter, and no amount of r/abrathatfits or department store specialists' assistance has ever solved that issue better than the bralettes and camisoles.

text:General Discussion - December 30, 2020	labels:I dunno if this is dumb or not but having a real pair of good winter pants has changed how I approach fashion in the winter a bit.  I got those uniqlo wind-proof lined pants back in oct and they've been amazing, last week I wore them in -25 for about a half hour and my legs stayed cozy. The real benefit though is now when I buy new pants I don't have to worry as much about whether or not I can wear them in the winter. If I'm spending more than like 5 minutes outside I'll take off whatever I'm wearing and put the warm pants on, it's great.
text:i bought my first wool flannel trousers last year and they completely blew my mind. i wore them as much as i possibly could in the winter. i ended up losing them in an international move but i plan on buying another pair pretty soon. winter pants are really the best	labels:	episode_done:True
text:My Gucci Addiction: Vanity Fair editor Buzz Bissinger's essay about spending $638k on clothes	labels:The line in the piece that stuck out for me was when he said he was on medication for "mild bipolarity."  The out-of-control spending, the hypersexuality, the losing a job due to temper outbursts...I'm not a psychiatrist, I just play one on the internet, but all of that put together  sounds like, at the very least, untreated hypomania.  To pass it off as only shopping addiction or "discovering himself" seems like underplaying some serious mental illness.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 10, 2020	labels:What are your first thoughts when you see someone wearing a nice, name brand watch?  By name brand, I mean brands that are universally recognized (Rolex, Omega, etc.).  By nice, I mean the watch appears to cost a lot of money.
text:I don't.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Formula for a put together outfit that works for most aesthetics	labels:I don't use this sort of rule, but to plays into my choices indirectly. For example, I am semi-maximalist. I like pattern and color. So I keep my jewelry simpler - I rarely use colored jewelry. I prefer the statement from the jewelry to come with size or shape, and just stick to metal only. Same for shoes they are generally one color, something neutral. They can have details with a little bit of texture, but I can't do a multi colored show with embellishments. It would be too much with one of my patterned items.  I do love how animal prints are moving into neutral territory, and I have been working not thinking about how animal accessories can be incorporated into a patterned outfit	episode_done:True
text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:Here's the best advice I've ever heard in my life: No one is looking at you, thinking about you, critiquing you as much as you think they are.  Everyone is busy looking at, thinking about, critiquing themselves.  So wear what makes you happy! Try new things!   Edited for concision.
text:I find it helpful to go out and really look at everyone else. I realize that I a) don't look that closely at people usually b) I don't care what they're wearing, also most people aren't perfectly styled but look fine. When I go out in my new outfit, I really pay attention to everyone else but usually no one even glances. Honestly, no one cares.	labels:	episode_done:True

What do the colors give off to others as they see you with them on?   As for myself, I am mexican, so my skin tone is roughly around a light/moderate brown. I bought a pair or gun metal and gold and am trying to decide which would suit my style more. What have your experiences been?	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 19, 2020	labels:So I know this has been a problem since the dawn of online multiplayer, but it really bums me out how disrespectful people are in these online competitive games. I was in a situation where our team had won the match but because I wasn't playing \*as\* optimally as a few of my teammates would have liked, they all started trash talking me over voice comms after the match was over. It's such a bummer because it turns me off from wanting to play, even if I enjoy the game itself.  /end nerd rant

text:I (M/39) just bought some bright yellow, women's, terry loungepants from August November. What wonderful "non-female" fashion items have you purchased recently? Do you ever dip into the men's section?	labels:I always look in the men’s section for tshirts, hoodies, and flannels! Men’s flannels are so much better than women’s flannels
text:One of the oldest and most-worn pieces in my closet is a men's flannel I thrifted almost a decade ago now. Not even a button has come loose and it still looks nearly new. The quality and warmth literally blows my mind. Best $5 I ever spent!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:It’s less about the value of the item and more about the stars aligning perfectly.  I wear a size 12-13W shoe, plus other things that make my feet really hard to fit, so I am used to buying formalwear to match the one maybe two pairs of formal shoes I own at any given time.  So when I was 17 and going to prom in 2006, my mom tried really hard to help me find shoes, any shoes, that were suitable. But we could only find casual flats or runners, and I realllly wanted to dress up nicely for the first real time in my life. So she said “you know what, let’s buy a dress and then we will just have to find a way.”  So I picked out a black and pale pink dress that just made me swoon, and I figured black heels would be easiest to find. Lol I was so young and stupid.  Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn’t find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I’d just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.
