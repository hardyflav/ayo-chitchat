text:Yeah the album is lovely but only a few details on some of the outfits say "Y2K" to me.	labels:That's fair! My main goal was to show how to incorporate some of the big Y2K trends (like shoulder bags, color palettes, accessories) in a more modern style, but I can definitely see that a lot of it may not read as very Y2K.

text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I actually started working from home June '19, so I've been trying to hone in my look from "working retail in a major city, commuting on public transit and being gone for 14-16 hours a day, to living on an isolated mountain and only leave the house like every 10 days and being in my home studio.   I started an Ootd instagram I've hidden from all my family and friends to kind of... Keep track of what I'm actually wearing? Also my weight fluctuates A LOT. (Summer hiking and lots of walks, winter were snowed in....) So picking clothing now that changes with my weight and still feels... Pretty.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 08	labels: Assuming budget is not a factor and temp/climate is appropriate (ie spring/fall/winter), is there any reason to choose cotton over wool for everyday wear? I guess what I'm getting at is, after finding out about merino, I'm wondering why I would buy cotton going forward. Merino is anti-stink, temp regulating, handles moisture and precipitation well, and doesn't need to be washed much. Cotton needs to be washed every other wear, doesn't regulate body temp well, absorbs moisture, but at least is easy to wash and is cheaper.  I guess what I'm getting at is, if I want to build a simpler, more sustainable and higher quality wardrobe, why wouldn't I choose wool (from brands like Outlier, Wool & Prince, etc)? The main reasons I can think of are that if it's hot in the summer, merino might be a little warm. Also since I have a kid, vom and other accidents occur - with a cotton shirt, that just washes right out.  Anything else I'm not thinking of, or reasons you wouldn't totally convert to merino or other wool fabrics?

text:What was your first 'expensive' fashion purchase?	labels:I'd have to say the Doc Martens I bought almost 4 years ago. I was between jobs at the time and was on the verge of a panic attack when I left the store because of how much they cost, but I needed sturdy shoes for the winter and my favorite boots had just fallen apart. Probably didn't need the pack of socks I was coerced into buying, but I digress.  However, I've always done this thing where I punish myself for spending too much on something by not wearing it, which just makes noooo sense. So, they haven't been worn nearly enough. I cleaned and polished them recently, so they're gonna get some hefty use this fall/winter.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 07, 2020	labels:Is it really necessary to get most of my clothes tailored? I'm 6'2 and 180 lb, and I've noticed that if I stick to certain stores, I can get clothes off the rack and not have to tailor them. I get tailoring formal clothes, but just seems very time-consuming to get most of my casual clothes tailored.
text:no reason to get things tailored if they fit you off the rack	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is your 2021 style resolution?	labels:I've noticed my choices of how to dress getting lazier and my passion for choosing a good outfit fading. This is due to be working at home, no restaurants, bars, meeting with friends, concerts... So my style resolution is to get back into making an effort on how I look once life gets back to normal and breaking my lazy habits.
text:Somewhat related, my goal is to work on dressing less lazily at home. I've worked about 90% at home since long before COVID, and I've had a lot of nice clothes, but mostly clothes better geared towards being out and about...so I've spent much of time in pajamas. I want to refocus to things like pants made of softer fabrics so that I can step up my at-home game while still being comfortable.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:You could be me, only I am about 4 kg heavier. But I was also never comfortable and tried to hide my hips and nothing fit right and all the pants were too short on me. I now mostly wear sweater dresses and skirts to work, since it's more comfy and not too tight. Plus you can't really tell I have knock knees if skirt ends right at the knees.  But my best tip for pants is S'Oliver. Not the cheapest, but they have decent sales and their 36" length jeans were the only ones that were long enough. I would stay away from high waisted dresses and skirts, as they make me look completely disproportionate, but that depends, maybe your torso isn't that short.  Sorry for the ramble, I am just excited to find someone with the same problems I had.

text:No (New) Jawnz January: 2021 Edition	labels:When I'm really hyped up over a new garment I just found online, I ask myself this armor-piercing question: *Do I already own this?*  It forces me to shift gears out of hype mode and take a mental stock of my wardrobe. While I may not own an exact copy of the garment I'm considering buying, I probably own a piece that fulfills the same purpose already (with regards to utility or aesthetics), and if the comparison is too close with the new item then I know I should wait a week and see if I still feel the same attraction to it. In most cases this allows the glamour of novelty to fade, and I've saved myself money and a potential redundancy in my closet. It's helped me a lot over the years.	episode_done:True

text:Feminist clothing	labels:I have to laugh at a request for feminist clothing being downvoted on a women's fashion sub.    The ladies who fought tooth and nail so yall could vote, own property, have careers, and take for granted the notion that you can be your own person would be *so proud*.
text:I was not expecting this to apparently be controversial.	labels:Because it's honestly a bit weird? Like why wouldn't you simply donate money/goods to a charity/shelter? Or volunteer? It doesn't take much effort on your part, and it helps your local community. Or as someone else said, support local seamstresses and use their services.  Idk, to me clothing with feminist statements will always scream "i need to let people know how woke I am without actually doing anything"
text:I think people in this comment chain are making a lot of assumptions about what other activism OP does and does not engage in.	labels:I don't see what's wrong with pointing out potential issues and flaws in other people's posts, such as performative feminism, which has been an big issue in social politics lately. OP might not have meant anything bad in her post but it's pretty reasonable to be wary. I don't see why people are so overly defensive about OP, it's not like discussion hasn't been civil.  Edit: And I guess I got downvoted for just simply pointing out what I'm seeing. I really think y'all need to chill.
text:Maybe we should start from a point of generosity rather than wariness? Particularly when OP's first words were "I know this is not a substitute for real activism." People may have been civil, but no one asked her what other activism she engaged in, they all started with the assumption she didn't.	labels:Well being wary is a natural reaction though. We don't choose whether to be wary. I think educating others is generous enough. I feel like bringing up people's "feelings" when discussing important social topics, while good-intentioned, is not the way to go. So immediately downvoting people (as I see someone already has) who have legit things to say is just overreacting and shows a skew in priorities. I really don't think the criticism here was that bad.	episode_done:True

Wings + Horns or Reigning Champ tiger fleece hoodie. Indestructible material, texture looks great. Nothing fancy, but looks great on it's own with just jeans.   Uniqlo jeans. Amazing quality for its price. I've now own two of the same black jeans and I wear them almost everyday   Uniqlo basic tees. After W+H these are what I wear. Super simple but lasts long for its price and fits great. Soft material.   Engineered Garments wool cinch vest. Very flexible. Can be worn over a long sleeve tee, sweater or even a hoodie.

text:Maybe challenge isnt quite the right word, i meant it sort of like buying and wearing "something you like but doesnt conform to your usual sense of style".    Although i like it something in my head is screaming its gaudy/tacky/bland whatever...so it takes an extra push to convince myself to wear it.   If you dont have those kinds of conflicts though then count me jealous!	labels:Oh, I see what you mean! I have those situations, especially when I go to op shops, lol. But I kind of came to realise that if I have a though that something if off, it means something is actually off. Like maybe, I like that thing just in general, but not on me (e.g. Florence Welch kinda dresses), or something fits perfect, but the pattern just doesn't feel right (e.g A-line dresses from brands popular with old ladies), or maybe the thing actually fits and the colour is ok, but gives me strong tired-boring-middle-aged lady vibes (e.g. some clothes I got from my mother).

There is one I really like, but it's quite baggy on me around the bottom. The shoulders and arms are fine, though.  How would they even do that? By taking fabric off the side or back panels, and then re-attaching them?

Total: 50, by accident hahaha. Oh! And 5 tops, 1 trousers, 2 shoes and 1 cardigan for work!

Was wondering if I could get away with something slightly slimmer.  where I live gets cold but not terribly cold.  at worst maybe -7 to -10 C or between 10 -20 F.  the problem is more of cold winds.  think a thermoball hoodie would be enough?

Ive even found the exact same pairs on ebay but it seems they've been changed and are all tight fitting now (I wear smalls and bought mediums, the mediums are more tight fitting)  I think the fact I have a huge ass contributes, I'm otherwise pretty skinny.

I know midriff scars are on a more noticeable part of your body, but I think you should work on being less self consious of them so you can wear the styles you want. If the scars bother someone, its on them not on you!	labels:I don't know if I'm self conscious or I just don't want anyone pointing at it and asking and having to tell the whole story! I wrestle with the idea of showing them or not
text:I say come up with a few totally wild explanations, and then in your back pocket have a response in case someone say 'no, really, what are your scars from' that totally puts them in their place like 'I'll tell you if you can tell me why its any business of yours' or something like that.	labels:	episode_done:True

They were half a size too small so I sold them on eBay for $300.   This was...15? years ago before people were flipping things online and I felt like a genius.  Oh and an $8000 Kiton coat for $15.99. I kept that one.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 15, 2021	labels:# How acceptable are tailored shorts really as you get older?  I am reconsidering my outfits for my planned summer vacation in Italy.  I had planned for the daytime white, light blue and light pink slim-fit polo shirts, paired with light blue, pale red, and pale yellow tailored shorts. Boat shoes and Espadrilles for footwear. Basically my tried-and-true combos for hot weather vacays.  But as I reach the tail-end of my late 30s, **I wonder if shorts are appropriate at all anymore**. I always strive to look extremely put together, rarely wear anything without a collar, no denim, etc.  Shall I just wear my night-time outfits (pants and long-sleeve button-down shirts, both in linen or linen-cotton mix, in white and light pastel colors) during the day also?  Looking forward to feedback mainly from well-off guys my age or older.

text:I got this one on deep discount this fall. It is not super thin, but it was not as thick I expected, either.  And, yes, it started pilling very quickly. I think the best descriptor for the sweater is "adequate". I would definitely not pay anything close to full price for one.	labels:Guess I won't be getting it for 75. I'll keep looking around for alternatives too. Thanks.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing for “housework” vs “working from my house”	labels:My working from home clothing is different from my house work clothing. Still more casual then I would if I went into the office (finance/corporate environment). My bottoms might be the only thing somewhat the same as you can't see my pants, but they are still presentable if I must stand up.          Also no shoes in my home. Ever. Slippers yes. Unless they were designated indoor shoes with soles that stay inside, and won't scuff the floor. I got a pair of UGG-copycat slippers from Walmart, that have an elastic back and are about an inch thick soles. Super comfy.	episode_done:True

text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:The current reality won't be reflected in the styles until 2021. Fashion collections are produced and created 12-18 months ahead of the actual season.   I think as designers are creating the upcoming seasons, with all of the challenges get and changes in this economy, we will see way more seasonless clothing. Those will be brand staples and hallmarks.  And a few special pieces each season. It will feel a lot like direct to consumer brand drops. A lot of standard shapes, special seasonal colors.	episode_done:True

text:Stop Dressing For Your Height [Tim Dessaint]	labels:Great video, thanks for sharing.  Particularly liked this excerpt around the 3-minute mark that a lot of people need to hear:   > The problem I find with dressing to maximize your perceived height is that 1, it puts height on a pedestal-- it assumes that your height is the most important factor for determining your attractiveness--and 2, it assumes you should dress to maximize your attractiveness to others... you are dressing with one priority, to look taller and more attractive to the eyes of other people and the result of that is a sea of men dressing the exact same way... where is the personality in that?

text:Bruce Boyer on Finding Your Wardrobe and Sustainability in Fashion – Put This On (Derek Guy )	labels:Really good read as expected from Bruce. I know that sustainability is thrown around a lot and it can be a bit hypocritical or at least out-of-touch in regards to classic menswear. On the surface it can even seem elitist, since its a luxury, though Bruce here has shown that even he experimented and seems to encourage people to try different modes of menswear apart from trying to be timeless all the time.  I think it would be great if Bruce talked more about his taste, like why he liked George Cleverly and Anderson & Sheppard (I know he mentioned sensible lapels, etc).  I think diving into taste (or POV as it were) a bit more as it relates to menswear details would help show guys that while J. Crew suits and Meermin are fine and can last a long time with proper care, sometimes aesthetics for the sake of aesthetics win out in how we acquire clothing.
text:yeah that creeping need to want to 'upgrade' or have the 'best' is a big contributor to the unsustainability of fashion i feel like. Even though you could sell/donate the item, it may just end up being thrown away or shipped out. I still have a donegal crewneck from j.crew i bought 9 yrs ago that i still love to wear, but I can't say that I've kept every piece of clothing like that.	labels:	episode_done:True

Truly waterproof, keeps me warm, is the perfect length, and looks polished/sleek for work.
text:My Patagonia 3 in 1 Snowbelle jacket that I purchased in 2014ish is still looking fabulous and still waterproof.

I also hate built-in liners which you probably need for short shorts.	labels:I'm the same way. I've got relatively long femurs so I prefer longer shorts. Never had issues in distances up to and including marathon length, even compared to the shorter stuff I had to use back in my XC days.

This lipstick does not budge, at all, even after hours of wearing a mask. I still miss my other, gentler lipsticks, but this is a good stop gap.

text:What's the greatest length you've gone to obtain a much coveted fashion item?	labels:I'm in Canada. I once spent more on shipping  then the actual cost of the skirt.   I've also spent more on import taxes and fees then on the product itself. how does that happen? Imported items are taxed on their original, non sale price. Nevermind that retail in Canada charges tax based on the price at the register, even if it's on sale.    And the Canadian companies that ship out of the US and charge insane shipping fees to Canada - if they can even ship to Canada at all can bite my arse! (looking at you Bite and Holotaco (though Bite ceased to be Canadian in the mid 2010s))

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:I had a white jacket in high school, sort of a cross between a blazer and a chore coat, and a really nice, thick cotton. It fit perfectly.  I left it in my friend's hatchback, and she had her car battery die and have to be replaced the next day, and the thing shifted to on top of my jacket. The dirt would have been bad enough, but battery acid literally ate through it. :(	episode_done:True
text:Harry Styles wears a Gucci gown as Vogue’s first solo male cover star	labels:I've got nothing wrong with a guy wearing clothes that are traditionally for females, but I don't think any of those looks look good, though I don't know the typical content of Vogue.
text:I agree that there is something that feels off about it but I think part of that is that the articles of clothing are actually very conventionally feminine rather than the typical very masculine jacket dress or avant garde androgynous style. While this causes a whiplash that's kind of the point, it's far further outside the norm to see conventionally feminine gowns paired with a blazer. Is it bad or are we reacting instinctively to violated convention despite pretending on the outside to be aesthetically open minded.   It's putting more emphasis on the clothes gender tension rather than trying to subtly make it masculine.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:I've found that having more time in the mornings lets me put more thought into my outfits and accessories. Although there's not many people to see the outfits, I've also had time to take photos from different angles so I can appraise how they look and adjust them to be more pleasing to me. It's a small silver lining as someone who enjoys putting outfits together but it's not really exercising my eye for outerwear and footwear. Maybe I need to forsake my upbringing and become the kind of person who wears shoes around the house.  I do miss getting dolled up for weddings, birthday parties and nights out. I've got a couple of weddings coming up next year (hopefully) and honestly, what I wear is going to be the most extensively planned outfit ever. When it's possible to have a big house party again I'd like to celebrate with a "fuck it, wear your most fabulous clothes and accessories, all of them at once if you like"-themed party.	episode_done:True
text:Experimenting With Different Focal Lengths & Landscape || Portrait	labels:I think I prefer the 70 in both landscape and portrait. The wider angle lenses distort the features to the edge of the frame (head, feet) and force you to position the camera at an unflattering angle.
text:cool cool, thanks!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:I still own a few dressy blazers that I used to wear on first dates (both winter and summer). A woman in a blood red or striped jacked puts out quite and intimidating vibe. So once I would feel comfortable enough, I'd simply take it off to reveal a simple casual yet flattering dress. I would only do it if I found the guy interesting/attractive and it would instantly make me more chill and fun.  Always worked like a charm.  If you like the guy, it gives him a sense of relief as soon as you take the blazer off and relax. And if you don't like him.. well.. just don't take it off. Never been bothered after keeping it on.
text:That's so funny!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:I buy mainly mid-range designer/independent designers secondhand- so I have a bunch of Isabel Marant that would retail 300+ but I get for less than 100 euros typically. My most expensive item that I paid retail for was my Isabel Marant Dicker boots as a gift to myself for passing a high level language competency exam for French. So 345 euros.  However, the most valuable items if they were new is my Chanel pencil skirt and my Ferragamo Vara Pumps that I got really good prices for secondhand, particularly the Chanel.   Like anything, shopping for high quality clothes takes practice. Once you know what to look for quality wise, it's very easy to scan in person to see what is worth the money on the racks.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 22, 2020	labels:For a long time, I dressed horribly. I had two modes: work clothes and sweat pants. It was really hard going to social events, and finally I stumbled on this subreddit. I really liked the basic bastard clothing suggestions:   - Maroon, Navy, and light Grey sweaters -Blue and Indigo Jeans -Khaki and Olive Trousers -White sneakers  They look great together, I was really surprised by the sweaters, I didn't know how much I'd like wearing it. Has anyone found a good way to expand on these outfits.. What are the next steps to add more clothes and look less basic? Is there any types that look as good of the sweater?

text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:I live in the upper Midwest. It's cold, like sometimes cold enough that it hurts to breathe. I make it work with layers. I might start with a knit summer dress, but then add wool tights or leggings or fleece lined leggings underneath. Knee-high boots. Maybe a long sleeved tee under the dress, definitely a cardigan on top. And then one of those coats that looks like a sleeping bag and goes down to your ankles or calves or at least knees.  With layers, I can also adjust myself to be in the office at work vs being outside in the cold. Maybe take off a layer of leggings when getting to work, or taking off the cardigan if I get too warm. I don't think the material of the dress matters that much, since it's the top layer over all the stuff that's closer to your skin. The layers close to your skin keep you warm and dry.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I catalogued all my clothes in an app and track what I wear. If I want to wear something different\~\~\~ then I look at the category of "unworn" clothing and pick something to make an outfit with. It's really helped me make sure I wear as much of my clothes as possible (obviously the black cocktail dress is going to see less use than the everyday pink sweater but it helps with more unique items like my t shirt with applique parrots lol). If you don't want to catalogue your clothes and put this much effort into it (lol) you could just move your clothes to another part of your closet after you wear them or reverse the orientation of the hangers after wearing. Try to move as much of your clothes to the "worn" side of your closet as possible. And when you pick a lesser worn item don't give up and just make an outfit of it! Who cares if it doesn't match perfectly, you'll do it better next time!	episode_done:True
text:Mario Valentino is not Valentino Garavani	labels:Anyone else know any designer "dupes" that play off confused people? I know Beverly Hills Polo Club is a good one.

I have to stop myself from falling for it every three years or so.

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:I try to follow laundry labels as much as possible, especially with more expensive pieces.  That means going to the dry cleaner a lot for my work clothes. For bras, jeans and dresses that can be machine washed, I always hang dry. I avoid drying anything I am especially attached to on high heat.   As for purses, I always keep them in dustbags on a shelf, with paper stuffing to maintain their shape. Hanging them on a hook tends to weaken the straps.

text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:Haven't tried on the $xxxx designer clothing, but the difference between $20 shoes and quality leather shoes is so huge. I wore cheap plastic ballet flats all the time as a teenager, and one day my grandmother just took me to a store to get shoes. The shoes were all $200-$300 range, which was astronomical to me then (still kinda is), but they were so plush to the touch and made of real leather. This was ~7 years ago and the sandals I got then have still held up well.
text:Real leather is honestly worth the quality, and is probably better for the environment because you don't have to keep buying new shoes.   All of my leather footwear has held up amazing well. Some I need to get resoled and replace the laces, but the rest of the shoe/boot is perfect.  My dad is currently wearing a pair of black leather boots he inherited from my grandfather several years ago, who wore them for 20 years before that..... and they're still holding up!	labels:This was one of my random fashion thoughts a few months ago. I wish my mom knew enough to have taught me to buy full leather (upper and liner) shoes.

Aka "I don't like this thing so no one should wear it ever."  Everything from pearls to no-show socks, henleys, denim jackets, etc. are all controversial but man capes. *Capes*.

We're roughly the same size, EU39-41 depending on the style of shoe, and my CP lows in 40 already feel narrow if I've been wearing them all day.   I'm definitely going to try for a pair of Carmina loafers next year--yours looks splendid--but likely in suede.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 07, 2020	labels:I need to update shirts and knitwear in my wardrobe, as I haven't bought much in 2 years. Any brand recommendations for flannels, oxfords, and knitwear? I prefer quality over quantity, and I'm down to spend $100-150 on good shirts, and $100-200 on good knitwear.  I have really broad shoulders and chest compared to my waist (swimmers shoulders and abs), so it's always hard for me to find something that fits well off the rack. For something that doesn't stretch, like an oxford, I pretty much need a medium for my shoulders and chest to fit, but even a slim small is pretty baggy in the waist, and small sleeves are the correct length for me.  I've gotten most shirts made to measure from proper cloth in the past for sizing reasons, but while I like them, I know I can get better quality for the price. I want to try and find quality brands that offer truly slim fit options. I'm curious to try Kamakura, but I'm not sure how easy it is to make returns if it doesn't fit right.  Fitting knitwear is easy, since even smalls can stretch to fit my shoulders, but I just need some good brand recs.

text:Yes, fleece lined tights!! I buy mine often at Winners/TJ Maxx. I really hate wearing pants, so these tights get me through my Canadian winters. On extra cold wind chill days I'll layer them with more than one pair. My winter jacket goes down to mid-thigh and my Sorel boots go up to my knee, so even in like "feels like -25C/-13F" days, I tend to be okay.

Undershirt, long sleeved t-shirt, hoodie, then a long goose down coat the preferably goes to your knees. Waterproof lined mitts, a mec toque and a heavy scarf to keep that horrible wind from ripping the skin on your face off, and getting frostbite.

text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I don't know if this is an actual "rule" or not, but most of my friends growing up were super thin with little curves. I was always much curvier and was always jealous of how they could seemingly pull off anything and still look classy/fashionable. I always felt like if I wore similar clothes (like some examples listed here - turtlenecks/high neck shirts and also crop tops, deep v necks, bralettes in summer, etc) there was an instant , almost negative, sex appeal added and I was always pretty insecure.  Well probably around the time I graduated college, I just stopped caring. So what if a turtleneck accentuates my boobs? Who cares if I wear a crop top in summer when it's 100 degrees? I find that I'm still dressing pretty "young" in my late 20's because I was too insecure to feel comfortable in the styles when I was younger. But I'm having a great time!
text:I've always hated the feeling of fabric against my chest and I have pretty big boobs so wearing lower cut things makes me look slutty but I've always done it anyway.

I steer clear of any of the really cheap fast fashion brands like H&M, SHEIN, Forever 21, etc. because it's just so poorly made.   COS is a favourite of mine because they use a lot of cotton, which I love and the quality is pretty decent if you can buy it for much cheaper than the retail price.  Uniqlo is OK too, as is Muji.  I occasionally buy Zara, it's poor quality but they have some nicely designed clothing.	episode_done:True

text:No Cop January - End of the Month Check In	labels:I'll start and confess that the main reason I decided to post these threads was to force me to follow through.  I set "one in one out" as my goal with "no cop" as a stretch goal. Ended up selling a blazer earlier this month and held off on making a purchase until yesterday so just barely failed at "no cop" but did stick to "one in one out".  The "no cop" definitely helped me avoid a few impulse buys during the Mr. Porter sale as a few times I found myself eyeing something and thinking "Is this really what I want to break my 'no cop' with?" The answer was always No since it was only something I was kind of excited about.   Planning to take that mindset into future months and see how many months this year I can go "one in one out" or "no cop", forcing each purchase to break that "Is this cool enough / am I excited enough about this item to break my 'no cop' with?" threshold.
text:January is probably the best time to implement a "no cop" policy, with all the sales and potential impulse buys that entails. Sounds like you did pretty well and I like the idea of using a public forum to give yourself some accountability.	labels:Yeah and I've never been one for New Year's resolutions but I think wanting to make my first purchase of the year special helped as well in resisting all of the temptations you mentioned.	episode_done:True

text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:I'm almost 60 and if there's anything the years have taught me it's this: wear what you like and fuck fashion. I love clothes and I do not give a single shit about being on trend, ever. I buy what I like/what I think looks good on me/what makes me feel happy to wear and I don't consider what's in fashion or what others might think of how I'm dressed at all. Mostly I buy secondhand because I find good quality fabrics and construction, but that often means the garment has been given away because it's not in fashion any more. Thing is, I care about style and about quality, not about the trend of the moment, and about expressing myself, not about falling into lockstep with what a bunch of mall brands tell me I should wear.  Be confident; love what you love and enjoy what you enjoy and don't let those with less imagination or less boldness keep you down.

Lots of dudes (myself included) conflate their wardrobe or their fits with their worth, believing that looking good is all they have to offer the world. But let me tell you, you have value. Not by your fits, not by your hobbies or skills or jobs or what you do for others, but *just by being you*.  I know lots of guys who wear butt-ugly shoes, suits that don't fit right, mismatched patterns and textures, etc. A few of those guys are my best friends because they are good people regardless of how they dress.  So for whoever needs to hear it, you have value and you are valued. You are good. And I'm here for you.

text:Does anyone take their “power color” really seriously? Basing a whole wardrobe around one color - not just choosing an accent color for a neutral capsule?	labels:I love this idea! It'd be so easy to curate because you'd have a pretty narrow selection of clothes to choose from. My power color is red, and I love wearing all red, but I do mix my reds with black, gray, or white most of the time.   Hot pink could be really cool, especially as we move into winter. It's an unusual fall/winter color so you'd really stand out! And I am personally -never- annoyed by seeing cool ass outfits on the street. I honestly really appreciate it.
text:And, especially in winter, hot pink head to toe can be tempered with the third and fourth elements.

Things like baggier jeans, the high waisted trend (my early 20s was defined by low waisted pants), oversized clothing (think Billie Eilish), etc.  I see some of these styles and think "this should have stayed in the 90s".  The example I think about is Mom jeans.  Many millennials still remember the SNL skit where they made fun of them and how unflattering they are.  They made them look matronly and dowdy.  I can't bring myself to even go near them in the store without that SNL skit playing in my head.

I am ok dishing $5k on a tux if it's worth it and I guess that's a personal choice, but I have come here for some advice.  I am here for your tuxedo knowledge all mighty redditors!
text:As you probably know, tuxedos are not nearly as versatile as a normal suit- you can't really wear them to work or to a lot of semi-formal occasions that would call for a suit but not a full on-tux. Most people won't wear a tux more than once a year, likely even less often than that. I only say that so that to make sure you know what you're buying, as I would personally spend a little less on a tux and buy a nice suit with the leftover money.   So with that said, at your pricepoint you should go to a tailor that will make the suit bespoke for you. It will look incredible and will fit perfectly.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:I don't really do this but I'm aware that sometimes it might look like it because I have like 10 black t-shirts that look almost exactly the same. There are weeks when the "core" of my outfit (not sure how to call it) is the same every day --black jeans and black tee, for example-- but I change the third piece and accessories and it looks like a different outfit. Pretty sure that if I was doing this with the exact same top and bottom people would not notice.
text:I was literally going to say exactly this.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your tips for being stylish when your weight fluctuates like crazy?	labels:My no.1 tip is to put elastic in the waistband of your jeans/trousers/skirts that are too big. It helps them fit you nicely, but they will stretch/you can remove elastic if you need to. I found a tutorial on youtube that is super easy and doesn't require a sewing machine.	episode_done:True
text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:I found a black wool trench coat from Saks Fifth Avenue for $2 at the Goodwin bins. It's fits me and it's super warm plus it was in great condition	episode_done:True

text:Do you have a childhood fashion icon? If so, does their influence show up in your wardrobe today?	labels:Clarissa Darling and, later, Alex Mack. Hats and layers and baggy overalls. I grew up to be fairly minimalist, but I still love layers and flannel and tomboy style.

text:3 hours is brutal, who does that.	labels:The longest continuous interview round I've ever done was five hours. For one job, I did more than twelve hours if interviews over several weeks, mostly in the evenings because of timezone issues.   I didn't get either job.
text:Oof. In my field it's usual that you do a few things in an interview round (something to the tune of 2+ presentations and a traditional interview of about half an hour). But these are stretched over multiple days.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process? What would you prioritize?	labels:I'm already planning this but over time. Going capsule wardrobe so its easier to piece things together. Neutral is black. Id do a good mix of professional and causal. Id invest in quality pieces and have them tailored.	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: You Are What You Wear	labels:I wear J. Crew because I believe the right office outfit will be the thing that gets me that next promotion, instead of just sleeping with my boss like a normal person. Once I achieve that I plan on transitioning to Theory to become a manager, since the only thing better than fast fashion quality at designer prices is having underlings who can't even afford those prices. After that, it's onto M.M.Lafleur for the corner office, since by then I will be working too much to have time for a personality anyway.	episode_done:True
text:How would you style or rebuild your wardrobe around your holy grail fashion piece?	labels:My mother is a seamstress. In high school she made me a matching green vest and wider-leg pair of pants with a white cotton peasant blouse, I think with some type of white-work embroidery or texture. I'm waiting until after the pandemic to go out and find similar fabric to re-create that outfit. That is my holy grail.   I'm slowly rebuilding my wardrobe to be 'hobbit-core' a la Rachel Maksy. I'm not big on skirts, so wide leg pants, peasant blouses, with wide belts or breeches with riding boots. Vests for when I need to look professional. Earth tone colors and natural fibers.
text:Rachel Maksy is a treasure of our age. TEAM VEST!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:i try not to buy anything with a built-in belt. Usually dresses or skirts, they come with little belt loops and a skinny belt. It looks great in the store but always looks incredibly dumb as soon as you lose the belt. Same with built in sashes, etc. You are not going to find a match to replace it when you lose the belt, just be honest!
text:This! I think dresses with built in belts look dated.  Looking at you, Duchess of Cambridge.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What’s a piece you bought before the pandemic, but haven’t worn a single time since because the occasion has been cancelled/we have literally nowhere to go?	labels:I bought two dressed for my two cousin's weddings that were both cancelled ): hoping I fit the dresses when they finally reschedule!	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:Boots. I just wear boots with everything, unless it's summer and in wearing sandals.  Ok, I also have loafers and sneakers, but I have found in pretty much any outfit I can replace the heels with some badass boots and it still works.	episode_done:True
text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:I spent like two months investing in a bunch of nice wool sweaters that I could wear through the winter, put them in a separate laundry bin after wearing so I could launder them myself, but my ex washed and dried them on high heat and they all shrunk so badly that I couldn't even fit them on my dog. About $1500 gone.
text:This is why I don't really let my husband run the laundry too often. He's an amazing human, I love him, and there is so much he is good at; but laundry ain't it. He puts everything all in the same load, all on Hot water, and all in the dryer for an hour. If I left him to do it with no supervision, everything would be ruined.	labels:I do my laundry, husband does his laundry. Either of us do sheets/towels/etc as needed, though probably more me than him.   It works very well.	episode_done:True

text:The best relaxed trousers — 13 bought and tested	labels:Hopefully not too late, but I'd really like some comfy trousers.

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:I don't have a problem buying it second hand because I'm not giving the company any more money.

Uniqlo is out of stock in my size otherwise I would have just given up and settled at that already lol.   I usually wear a medium in Uniqlo stuff but for this sweatshirt I'd like to be a little looser fitting.  My budget is up to $100 (used prices are ok too).
text:For a basic crewneck I'd just get a uniqlo merino sweater which is so soft that you can wear it as a bottom layer.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Light Down Jacket Inspiration Album	labels:For me personally, I really like light down jackets.  I know a lot of guides have solidified around the usual classics: harrington, denim, biker, and bomber jackets  but I find myself wearing my light down jacket more often.  They are super light. they fit well and have that same short cut like the others that looks cool. I don't have to worry about piling or shaping as much. they can be very warm too.    and more importantly I find them easier to layer under another coat, while the others fit a bit weirdly.  So light down jackets in fall and spring. then in winter, put them under a wind/water proof coat.  also pairs well with a sweater or fleece vest.	episode_done:True

text:What niche do you feel is missing from the fashion blogging/YouTube world?	labels:Midsized women who want to be fashionable, but not in a professional/streetwear sense. I've found some size twelve ladies who dress neat and tidy and ready for law practice, and I follow some size 12 ladies who wear streetwear, but nobody wears anything of actual interest in that size between either spectrum. Anybody I do see not in those two categories seem to be more in a "Macy's catalogue, 2013" aesthetic.  I need someone with stomach pudge and jiggly thighs to show me what cool structural and interesting pieces I can pull off without me spending 10 days and 10k dollars at the store to find it.

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:Try maternity tights.  I find they are waaaaay more comfortable.  I have black tights, dark grey tights, and light grey tights for different shades -- all H&M maternity.    For OTK socks... try compression socks.  I don't need compression socks for any health reason, but a friend suggested it -- they are warm and stay up, although all my pairs are just below the knee.
text:What makes maternity tights more comfy?	labels:Maternity tights have zero waist/stomach compression - they are extra stretchy and/or have extra material in that area.	episode_done:True

text:Formula for a put together outfit that works for most aesthetics	labels:To be honest, this sounds like a lot of work. I know when I like my outfit or when it needs something else, or has too much. I don't assign elements numbers, though.
text:It sort of takes the some of the joy and creativity out of getting dressed and turns it into a mathematical formula that requires more work than just...putting stuff together. In hilarious contrast with the ostensibly 'effortless' (I swear this effortless thing is going to be the death of me) style they wanted to achieve.	labels:I see what you mean but for me I've been using it as more of a finisher step than a "how do I put together an outfit". Like I look at the mirror before I go and I feel I have a stopping point of "okay, that's enough" or "I need two more pieces of jewelry for this to look intentional".
text:That's a good way to use it!  I think for people who don't have as much of an instinctual fashion sense or who struggle putting outfits together it can be a way to train themselves. In the beginning it's very mathematical but the more you do it the easier it becomes and it just ends up being a habit. (Kind of like in therapy where at first you take the time to analyze emotions / break them down before that process becomes second nature).	labels:	episode_done:True

For fashion jewelry I try to get silver when I can.	episode_done:True
text:What are you hate wearing?	labels:Anything that is even slightly restricting on my neck (turtlenecks, mocknecks, even some crew necks).

text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:I think vintage designer items used to be a lot more luxurious. A lot of it is made with synthetics and I don't even want to try them on. I saw a St. John skirt set marked down to $900 made of polyester tweed material and it looked cheap. Ann Taylor looked more expensive than that suit. I pay attention to material quality and craftsmanship more than label. I seek this in all brands, new and vintage.

text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:This pandemic is forcing me to learn how to return and drop off packages, and overcome all of my anxiety doing it. I basically only shop thrift in person now, to support local stores, and I do online for everything else. Some of my online has been surprising (like ordering two sandals 9.5 and finding them to be too big) and others were amazing (a Banana Republic Factory fit and flare dress fitting me perfectly?? How) But I basically decided that I think I need to spend more time studying and gathering wardrobe inspiration, and taking care of basics. I also went to my local Fleet Feet and got fitted for proper walking shoes and a sports bra, so I can start exercising for my health. All in all, it's been a mix.	episode_done:True
text:People who work in the fashion industry - what do you wear?	labels:Congratulations! I work in Melbourne, Australia as an inventory manager / distribution manager / seller. So generally I'm working in the warehouse or the office. I also pop by the stores sometimes or meet with clients once or twice a week.  I wear whatever I like, but just ensure I'm always put together or smart-casual. A bit more dressed up than what I'd be on weekends. Most days I'm in a patterned midi dress or midi skirt with sneakers. Easy to move around in and comfortable, but still looks nice. If I do wear jeans I'll add a nicer blouse and boots instead of sneakers.  Edit: If I know I'm going to be doing more warehouse-stuff on a particular day, I'll tend to wear culottes or jeans that day, with sturdy leather shoes. Skirts can get caught on things like shelves and ladders.

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash.

Everything was machine washable, air dry. Accessories like scarves and statement jewelry made things more interesting.

I hate jegging material so it cuts my time in the jean isle down by half. I like sweaters and cardigans but I know what type of fabric or knit I like and dislike and what looks cheap and what doesn't. I personally only shop one size up or down just so I don't disappoint myself by finding something cute thats way to big or small (others im sure will be quick to disagree here).

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 23	labels:Hi,   I'm looking for a warm winter boot recommendation as I live in Minnesota. I want a pair of boots that comes in black and around the $200.00 mark. Last year i used 6-inch Timbs and Nike AF1 boots for the winter. The timbs were great on ice but not very warm. The AF1 books weren't very good on the ice.  I'm looking for something semi-fashionable. What I mean by that is not a muck workboot or something. I won't be out in the snow working or anything, just need something warm enough and good enough w/ sidewalk snow/ice when I have to walk a few blocks.  I like the Sorel MENS CHEYANNE II LACE DUCK BOOT , but I'm reading that the quality is crap now. That the toe area is cracking for a lot of people.  LL Bean has the warmer duck boots, but they don't come in black.  Any recommendations?
text:I used to live in Chicago. You could make a multi-quadrant meme on what you want out of them and having to only select 2 out of the 4 options. Trying to go fashionable can kick out the warm part.   What I did was wear Oboz out and kept my nicer Tafts in the car. If I can walk across a parking lot to my work site without a lot of elements in the way, I'd switch.   That said, if you really want fashionable and warm, think as much about the socks as the shoe/boots. Darn Tough socks can solve for a lot.	labels:	episode_done:True

I go out in the afternoon and it is pretty warm outside, so I wear a OCBD with chinos, and keep the Harrington jacket in my bag. I try to wear the Harrington jacket at night as the temperature starts to drop, but I find that my shirt is much longer than the jacket, and it looks like a miniskirt. So I try to tuck in my shirt, but it just looks way too dressy, and I feel that I'm overdressed.

text:Can we talk sleepwear?	labels:When I prepared to give birth to my first child, I splurged on beautiful long sleeping gown / bathrobe set in white cotton.   It was comfy / flexible enough to accommodate my post-pregnancy recovery. But it was also luxurious and pretty - something that new mothers don't feel. (Also, my FIL was visiting & would often wander around with his camcorder! So I couldn't just walk around in my maternity undies).  I wore that set for more than 5 years.  I also have PJs that are button-down tops with matching little shorts. What makes the difference is high-quality cotton, good tailoring and detailing .  One set is black with white piping. Another is lavender. The guy I've been talking to (mostly via video) loves the black set, even though it's not overtly sexual like lingerie.  I don't wear anything silky to bed because it bunches up & also feels OTT.   Confession: I also "steal" hotel slippers because they are so comfy.
text:Please share where you bought that cotton nightgown. Im currently pregnant and looking for any cozy sleepwear that will also make me feel luxurious and cozy.    Also, if you have any other favorite clothing or product recommendations for a new mom, please share.

I tend to have basically the same pant (black+fitted) in different textures which I love, no harm in it. I would also look at whether any printed pants would suit your needs - if you have a lot of solid tops this could be a fun change.	episode_done:True

text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:Try mens jeans? I randomly have 1 pair of grey mens jeans and my only issues are that its a long pair so its just a tad too long (helpful for long legs tho) and the waist could be a little smaller but I attribute that to me losing weight recently. It sculpts surprisingly well to my body and is hella comfy, two things I've never seen in womens jeans simultaneously. Also the right underwear makes a HUGE difference.A good bra that fits is hella important and I've heard thongs do wonders for tighter fitting jeans or bottoms. (The ones with the wider lace panels, not the stringier types that put you at risk of having a "whale tail" lol)	episode_done:True
text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:Wings + Horns slub tee/henley. I've worn a few almost everyday for 5-6 years now and there are no signs of it ever deteriorating. Truly a r/buyitforlife they are quite pricey but they're fucking amazing quality.    Wings + Horns or Reigning Champ tiger fleece hoodie. Indestructible material, texture looks great. Nothing fancy, but looks great on it's own with just jeans.   Uniqlo jeans. Amazing quality for its price. I've now own two of the same black jeans and I wear them almost everyday   Uniqlo basic tees. After W+H these are what I wear. Super simple but lasts long for its price and fits great. Soft material.   Engineered Garments wool cinch vest. Very flexible. Can be worn over a long sleeve tee, sweater or even a hoodie. Great for layering   Wings + Horns flannel. Bought a zip flannel from them back in 2010? I'm only getting rid of it now because the sleeves have finally ripped.
text:I prefer a good amount of stretch in my denim. Do uniqlo jeans have that?	labels:Lee Extreme Motion jeans are the most flexible jeans I know of. I'm quite flexible and always hated how jeans limited my range of motion and risked tearing. These flex and stretch great, have a good fit, and offer several different cuts.  They really are my top Jean right now because they're a 4 way flex, with different cut in the crotch for better fit. It's nice to wear them and be able to randomly drop into a split at any moment and not worry about destroying my pants.	episode_done:True

Jeans, t-shirts, and hoodies. I do sometimes blazer and loafer it up just because I feel like it though, and I enjoy it.  I also have some looks that are really specific to hobbies though.

text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:In art school, we learned about finding out own aesthetic. Finding it involved copying others' work for a while (never for profit, btw). We learned how to develop our own hand in this process, what worked for us and what didn't. In turn, our aesthetics became really a combination of several other artists.   I think fashion and style is the same. There's influences of who we follow, but the more we try and experiment, determining what works for us and what doesn't, is when our unique style will emerge - and it'll still even then be a combination of several other styles. Experiment, figure out what's important to you in your own style. It takes time and intention.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 27	labels:I recently found an unwashed and unworn pair of sanforized raw denim (it's still stiff to the touch!) that I bought a while ago while digging through my closet. Unfortunately, it seems to be half a size too small now. The waist and zip are fine, but it feels quite tight at the fork and is a bit uncomfortable trying to climb stairs with it. Can I trust it to stretch a bit still after some wear, or are there otherwise any good ways to get it more comfortable?
text:I guess half a size is within realms of expectations when it comes to stretch.	labels:To be fair I say half but I'm not too sure if it's actually just a half - it's just because the fork is the only bit that genuinely feels tight.
text:What is the fork? crotch?	labels:I say fork (where the two inseams meet at the crotch) since that's the specific seam that feels really stretched, but yes that's the general area.	episode_done:True

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:For young women entering the workforce, my key piece of advice is to also invest the time and effort in doing laundry properly. Buy critically and care for appropriately. No more shoving everything into 1 washer and 1 dryer.   I have some pieces from fast fashion brands that have held up really well for several years that I love wearing and feel good wearing. Buy drying racks and mesh garment bags. Air dry as much as you can. The clothes are less likely to fade or misshapen - which is one of the quickest way for a piece of clothing to come off as cheap.  It's not feasible for everyone to have those Pinterest picture-perfect capsule wardrobes - sometimes, you want a varied wardrobe and can really only shop at mall brands. The important thing is you're not accumulating for accumulation sake and that you are purchasing mindfully and purposefully, even if it's not those "investment" pieces.	episode_done:True
text:What are the most recommended items of this subreddit?	labels:Essentials are different for everyone. Depends on age, sense of style, occupation, climate, and so forth. If you want to look decent almost anywhere you go, white leather sneakers plus dark denim jeans plus a blue and/or white OCBD is going to work for most people in most occupations and most climates.

A pair of black skinny jeans has been a staple in my wardrobe for almost a decade now, so those are probably an essential for me also- although I've been getting more into straight and wide leg denim now.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 31, 2020	labels: TL; DR: Question: what are some chukka boots with soft back or some cushioning?   Hi wise members of MFA, maybe you can help me out!  I like chukka boots as a concept and I believe they are very versatile. I love how CDB look but I need something with a softer back or cushioning that would help with some heel borsitis I have (I had CBD for years but even when they broke in they were really stiff in the back).  Among sneakers it's easy to find something soft like that but I am wondering if there are some chukka boots that provide some comfort, so that I don't have to wear sneakers all the time..  I don't need it for a specific context (at work is fairly relaxed) it's just that I normally wear tucked classic button-down shirts, chinos and a in-between shoe is what I am looking for.  Thanks and Happy New Year to you all! :-)

Heel or no heel?
text:Pardon me if im misunderstanding, but a loafer with no heel is likely a driver or a slipper, both pretty casual but doable with ocbd and chinos.

Add to that the great stuff happening on Postmark, Depop, Etsy, and TheRealReal, and it's awesome to be a thrifter right now. I'm glad its all expanding.

I also really dislike sneakers with suits, which I know some people find very cool.	labels:I've found that in order for sneakers to work with suits, the sneakers need to be very minimal and clean and the suit needs to be very casual. In that context I think the look can work, especially in a Spring/Summer outfit.
text:It's an extremely fine line between acceptable and looking like a kid going to prom that didn't bother getting shoes..  Idk if the suit itself necessarily needs to be super causal, but you need some other casual anchor like shirt or belt or whatever to balance it. To me it just feels like an LA look for better or worse.	labels:> but you need some other casual anchor like shirt or belt or whatever to balance it  I agree with you. I also personally don't mind an LA look, I think it's the way tailoring is rapidly trending (for better or worse) and I rather like the feel of the more relaxed/expressive elements. I've read a lot of thought pieces about the so-called "death of the suit," and if that means an evolution from tailoring as dull requirement and blunt uniform, into tailoring as a means of artistic self-expression, then I'm all for that. I think that's why avant garde suits interest me so much, I want to see what new and interesting things people can do with the platform of a suit! Rosen is one such fashion-forward designer that's doing a lot of cool stuff with tailoring.
text:The death of the traditional worsted business suit may be closer than before, but imo it only makes way for the rise of odd jacket/trouser combinations for business and more casual suits in cotton, corduroy, and linen for non-business.

(You might need to email their customer service team to get the current mailing address and price list.)       It's typical, at least in my experience, for boots that are worn frequently to require reheeling/resoling somewhat frequently. I bring my most-worn leather boots to the cobbler for new heels twice each winter season, because I'm very hard on my shoes. So that's not a defect with the Bean boots, it's normal for boots to require maintenance in the long term.

text:What pieces would you love "backups" of?	labels:A pair of wide wale corduroy (90s skater corduroy) leggings. I've been able to find replacement pairs in a pin wale, which are fine, but just not the same.  I scored a pair of amazing bamboo tights over a decade ago for $5 and have never been able to find them in a sized pair since. Anytime I find any they tend to be One Size Fits All and pure disappointment.	episode_done:True
text:Stockings vs Tights vs Leggings	labels:I'm in Minnesota and I have found that fleece-lined tights and leggings are absolutely the best way to stay warm in winter. I usually do fleece-lined leggings under maxi skirts/dresses and fleece-lined tights under shorter skirts. You can layer sheer black tights and even over-the-knee socks over them. I sometimes wear tights under jeans and pants too.	episode_done:True
text:Why even the pandemic couldn’t kill fast fashion	labels:Why would the pandemic kill fashion? The title already makes no sense
text:People generally buy fast fashion because they want to always be seen in new, fashionable outfits.  There was speculation early in the pandemic that if people weren't leaving their homes as often and cutting down on social gatherings, then they wouldn't have as many occasions to buy new clothes.  This article is suggesting that some of that not needing to buy as much clothes is cancelled out by the need for retail therapy.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Big A$$ Clothes--An Oversize Inspo Album	labels:Some of these looks take me back to my teens in the 80s when we all raided our fathers' closets for sweaters, button-ups, blazers, and etc. But of course, back then we kept it slim on the bottom with stirrup pants.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else wear one brand only?	labels:I realized recently when I put all my clothes in an app (called StyleBook) and looked at statistics that a disproportionate amount of my things are J. Crew. I didn't try, it just... happened. There's basically a J. Crew item in every outfit I wear. But my style is preppy and classic, lots of interchangeable basics too, and J. Crew fits that idea perfectly so it isn't too surprising!
text:How do you like that app?  I was considering it, but it seemed like a pretty sizable time commitment up front. Does it help you with new ideas?	labels:I really like it! 100 percent recommend.  You are correct in that it does take a lot of time. It took me a couple of days to take pictures (or find them online) and upload everything I owned. However I tracked everything including my belts, scarves etc so if you just want to do major pieces (dresses, pants, shirts, shoes) it will probably take less time. I also make sure I catalog new things as soon as I get them so I don't fall behind.  It has been very worth it! It even has a really cool feature that mixes up random outfits from your stuff and I have found a few combos I would never have thought of from that. It is definitely worth at least trying!
text:Thanks so much for getting back to me!  Might be a fun COVID winter project.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:Black jeans make stuff more dressy. Grey jeans match well with pastel colours or with black tops. I would start with those since you are a jeans lover!  Real pants can be more difficult to find a nice cut and length, but if you find a check or pattern you like then those are always the pants I reach for first- it is nice if you have a check with a tiny bit of colour in it cause then it pairs well with plain tops in that colour.

text:Stop Dressing For Your Height [Tim Dessaint]	labels:I've never understood the fascination with absolute height as something that would qualify or disqualify someone from wearing a particular style or trying something. E.g. "Don't cuff your pants if you're short."  Like long coats aren't any different whether you're 5' or taller than Lebron James. What *is* different are your relative proportions and that *can* affect whether certain things look good on you or not.   Things like arm or leg length vs torso height but that's a ratio and has nothing to do with your absolute height.  Maybe I've spent too much time on the internet where everyone is the same height in pictures but I've *never* seen a good example where someone was too short or too tall for a styling.
text:I think the Youtuber's point is that short people are cautioned AGAINST playing with proportions in certain ways because the effect is multiplied if you're short. Like, if you wear oversized clothes as a short person, that makes you look even shorter/smaller. As a guy, if you're tall and broad in the 'right' ways, society gives you a pass to play with style more.	labels:People are cautioned against this by others that don't know what they're talking about who are either repeating prescriptive urban legend grocery store checkout magazine bullshit or projecting their insecurities onto others with false authority, thereby giving vulnerable people just starting to learn about fashion false and damaging body image ideas.  We can stop repeating shit like this now.  TLDR: delete this, nephew
text:I don't think the solution to this problem is to just pretend it's not happening. This isn't just men's healthagazine bullshit, it's the entire system shaming men for being short, especially if they try to be okay with it.

text:Bolero album because it's here whether you like it or not	labels:Most of the people in this album are tiiiiiny.

text:It wont. Instead of making more of what people like, they'll collab with Volkwagon and Exxon Mobile to make tshirts that no one will buy.	labels:It's the same hype model that sneaker and streetwear brands use... every article posted on this sub about the collection is about how quickly past years' sold out, how it was so popular that they reissued some of the pieces years later, how there is still a thriving resale market.  If Uniqlo produced more of these pieces then it'd be harder to convince people to run out and buy it the second it drops.

Yes.   I've browsed JCrew's sales a lot in the past years, so I'm never too precious about the things I get from there now. Especially since scoring a good basic on sale feels like a win, and getting a tshirt that develops armpit holes on the first or second wash is just a, ok, not buying those again moment. So, let's see.   Seconding all the people who've mentioned the men's store quality (which I can't speak to). Would love to find that somewhere, inc at JCrew.

Am I allowed to think Rick Owens is unaesthetic in this sub, or are opinions just downvoted?  Also, what am I ignorant about? The guy is clearly successful, I think people should look to him for that. I've never been impressed by his work. I would honestly hate it if more people tried to look like this guy lmao. His silhouette is like Ed Edd n Eddy characters  edit:the answer is no, you have to suck off rick owens here. saved you the blocktext
text:Oh it is subjective but your first comment was  that he can only sell things implying his designs are bad and saying something is bad is not a critique that's just being a dick/asshole.   Also if your criticism is it looks shit or it looks like a cartoon character/ridiculous that's not constructive criticism that's you associating his look with something you don't want to associate with or saying that's it's not normal which are both yet again not actual criticisms just how you feel. Your saying the abstract artist is bad, because he's not painting to your tastes essentially. Which you can say but don't be upset when people who like his design call you an idiot.  Edit : and your most likely ignorant about why he does these designs they are supposed to not look normal and look weird rick owens talks about this in his interviews he's designing clothes for a world of his own imagination.	labels:Yeah I completely understand his goal and his motivations, you basically got it right. Yeah I don't want to look like a weird ugly guy, sorry man. plenty of 'weird' people who know how to dress well, guess I'm just alone in this.

text:Ever been censored at work because of what you wear?	labels:Im a former teacher and as an older lady I still wanted to wear what I felt was appropriate. So I wore a skirt to school that was high but not unprecedented among the teachers. I get a call from the assistant principal calling me in during my lunch break and she said my skirt was "inappropriate". I was in my 60s when this happened. I explained that among teachers in the school my skirt height was within code but she wasn't having it. So I changed into a lower skirt. Meanwhile students and staff who were actually breaking the dress code didn't get any punishment. In other instances they censored one form of political speech for another form when the rules clearly stated that "all political clothing is prohibited". Its very frustrating.
text:That's upsetting to hear, especially since the assistant principal was a woman herself!  Love the username btw :)	labels:Yeah I would've thought she would understand but nope. Most administrators Ive worked for haven't got a clue about their dress code enforcement.   Thanks I love the username as well. It represents yeah Im old I get it.

text:Agree with you on ruffled mini skirts and track suits. They do not need to come back.   However, I am actually hoping low rise jeans come back. I have a really long torso so my hips are a bit higher than normal, so high rise and even sometimes mid rise jeans are incredibly uncomfortable as they cause some horrendous camel toe.	labels:Ouch!  That's definitely fair. I am remembering a specific pair I had that literally ended just above my pubic bone and can't imagine what I was thinking.

I am from a place where it drops to -25 C in winters so I layer my tops  in a way that I can take off any number of layers when I go indoors (and  still look presentable). For example, if the heat is really high indoors, I  will dress down to my last layer which is usually a decent t-shirt.  But how do I layer pants? I mean I cant wear a pant beneath a pant, right?. The  only thing I can do is wear long johns beneath the pant, which doesnt  work for me coz I cant take my pants off and walk around in long johns.
text:In desperate times ive worn thinner track pants like adidas underneath regular fit pants but that all depends on what you're rocking on top.

text:Do you have any pieces that "should not" work with your body that just seems to work?	labels:Treat these "rules" as guidelines or suggestions. It all depends on what features \*you\* want to bring out. If pencil skirts are working for you then go ahead and wear pencil skirts.  For me the a-line/skater and pinafore dress and skirt shapes work best - or \*I\* that that particular shap for me and that's what I generally try to stick to.  Bodycon and figure hugging dresses don't. I've never really classified myself according to a body shape so I just go with what I think is good.

Flip-flops, pumps, ballet flats, clogs, all out.   Ruffles. I have enough trouble looking like an adult.   Anything that has to be dry-cleaned. Hand-wash things are hard enough.

text:Women who have moved for extended periods of time on 1 or 2 suitcases only, how did you do it? Here's the beginning of my process	labels:Vacuum bags and packing cubes, and find square trunks or even boxes that are the maximum size that the airline will allow. Also, if you have a relative/friend that might come visit you leave a bag with them and pay the luggage fee.   For a less minimalist feel, look into some workhorse peices- I usually go for solid dresses or solid blouses + skirts. Then accessorize your little maximalist heart out. It's amazing how many scarves you can cram into a small packing cube. Maybe add a few chains of different lengths and pendants that can switch between them, &t. Just think small things that make the outfit different.   Finally, don't underestimate how different you can look and feel changing your perfume and lipstick- both of which are easy to pack.  ps: artsy facemasks are also a thing for a bit longer.
text:yes! yes! Makeup is a MUST to feeling different!  I find it so easy to be minimalist in the winter because of scarves, stockings, and winter accessories.

text:Help needed for buying jeans online! All advice is welcome!	labels:1. check the material content. If you're looking for the thicker, heavy duty jean with no stretch look, always look at "materials and care" to check fabric content. You want it to be 100% cotton. Cheap options: Zara, H&M, Banana Republic (on sale) and more pricey: Levi's & everlane 2. For skinny jeans you probably want some with some stretch I think 90-95% cotton? (same retailers as above) 3. ALWAYS check to see what shipping/return policy is by digging around the website. Most retailers will offer free shipping over $50 which you can easily hit when buying jeans. ALWAYS!!! check what the return options are. Some will say "free returns" but the fine print will read "but return shipping will be deducted from your refund" If you don't hit the free shipping requirement just buy something you know you're going to return.  4. don't be afraid to buy sizes below and above your normal size! The more you buy the more you'll become familiar with different brands, their fit, and sizing!	episode_done:True

text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:It is not who is doing the shopping, bc for the last few generations, women have done most of the clothing shopping for the whole family.  So I would hazard a guess that it is the thought process during shopping.  When you shop for yourself, you can try it on.  You see how it looks in it's brand new condition, under store lights.  When you buy for your husband/Dad/son/boyfriend, you might pay more attention to material quality and features he has said he prefers, like pocket size, etc.  Higher quality for same price point also means it will last longer, and less likely to have him tell you he doesn't like it - to try again.   Basically, we are more susceptible to all the marketing tricks when we shop for ourselves in the store, but are more discerning when we shop for others and know durability is a key feature, not immediate aesthetic.	episode_done:True

I'm a big fan of the overall look of a blazer, especially the structured shoulders. It's just too fancy for high school. I'm leaning towards a casual sport coat right now.

I would grab the leather jacket I bought in Florence, and probably all of the dresses on the left side of the closet. All the underwear and bras I own. I own nothing "vintage" or anything even remotely expensive aside from my wedding dress and that leather jacket. I live mostly in dresses/skirts (or at least I did before the pandemic happened and I've lived in sweatpants and tshirts since), and I would make sure that those (they're all from Amazon/eshakti/Target/Lulus) would come with me, because I have few enough that they will all fit in one suitcase. I may grab a few sentimental shirts, and probably my favorite pair or two of jeans, but I'd prioritize the jacket and the wedding dress before anything else.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 07, 2020	labels:I live in northern virginia. The last time I bought a suit was in college freshman year. I'm now a 44S in jackets and wear a 30/32 in the waist(depending on the brand), about 5'5 roughly 180 with relatively large thighs and calves.   My current suit is tight (I think 38S/32 pants) is tight to the point where I can't raise my arms because of my biceps and my thighs take up so much room in the pants to the point where I can't place my phone or wallet in the pockets and sit down without feeling like I'll rip them.   My woes were heard by my fam and they bought me a suit which is a 44R in the jacket and 38 pants. I have an idea of what alterations I need to make to the jacket since it'll look long but could the pants be altered to a 32 in the waist without making them look weird? Would I be better off just getting suit separates?
text:With your build you probably need either separates or custom, unfortunately. You can't tailor 6 inches off trousers and have it look not-weird.	labels:A custom suit seems expensive(though I'll start looking into it), wih separates would there still be enough room in the thighs or would I still need to get a size up and have the pants altered at the waist?

NOT. MATTER. And if people make comments to you about it, you can create boundaries so that they aren't a part of your life any longer. Of all the things in life to worry yourself about, the way you look and especially OTHER PEOPLE'S OPINIONS ON THE WAY YOU LOOK are so trivial in the grand scheme of things.

text:To add on to the others, Harris Tweed sport coats have been in-style since the 50s, and the tweed typically suits a more classic, relaxed cut, meaning that the cuts of modern Harris Tweed offerings are pretty similar to the cuts of vintage Harris Tweed offerings.

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I have similar connotations as you about them being kind of cheap or tacky looking, but would add one other angle to it. While I'm 100% against the use of real fur/exotic hides, I think part of the cheapness animal prints comes from taking something that in its natural state exists on fur and copy-pasting it onto all different kinds of fabrics. Real cheetahs look beautiful and elegant. A poorly rendered cheetah print on thin polyester leggings just looks like a terrible imitation. There isn't this mental comparison going on with other patterns, like stripes or polka dots, because there's no "real" standard to compare to. They're just decorative patterns.  Even if you attempt to create a faux fur that more closely imitates a real animal hide, it's going to look cheap and fake (to me) unless it is really well done.

Like others said, there's a point where it's too cold to care about how you look.	episode_done:True
text:How Much Clothing Should I Own?	labels:I don't think anyone is going to be able to tell you this as it's subjective and dependent on your job and lifestyle. It's going to come down to keeping stuff you actually wear on a weekly basis and throwing away stuff you don't wear. This will let you know where you stand with your wardrobe right now and you can build from there.     Personally, I just went though this and cleaned out my closet from all the all the old high school, college, and worn clothes I still had hanging around and my mind set was that ***it's better for me to throw away a little too much than too little***. Only do this if your in the financial situation where you know you can replace an article of clothing pretty easily though.
text:I very much appreciate the reply and completely understand the point about jobs and lifestyle being the determining factor for what I need (which is why I tried to add some details regarding both of those things down at the bottom - but, even with that, I know the needs are subjective).  I've definitely tried the closet clean-out before, mostly as a result of owning too many low-quality items that I purchased on a whim and subsequently disliked, but I found myself in the situation of getting rid of something and then needing a similar garment in the near future, buying another low-quality item in a hurry and being back in the same place that I started - so I wanted to try something a little different (more proactive than reactive).  I could probably just start setting a limit to how long I'll go without wearing something before I get rid of it and letting my wardrobe start curating itself in that way. It's a slower process but likely more accurate than any recommendation.	labels:Where I live we have warm summers and relatively cold winters so twice a year I will swap out my seasonal clothing and what i'm not wearing gets packed away in a tote bin. I have found this is a good time to get rid of stuff I haven't worn in the previous season. For example, this spring I will donate or throw away any of my sweaters that were never worn or worn very little this winter.	episode_done:True

Do you ever dip into the men's section?	labels:I'm super tall -- so shop in the mens section for hoodies and sweatpants to be able to find clothes that fit my long legs/torso.  It amazes me how much cheaper it is for something like a basic hoodie in the mens versus womens section. My favorite mens departments are the REI garage for patagonia pullovers & hoodies & Target for sweatpants & long sleeve shirts & winter socks :)	episode_done:True
text:What are you hate wearing?	labels:Honestly I just donate them all away... Better for someone to use it rather than for me to keep it dormant   Also I love the Uniqlo Sherpa zip :( I was thinking of getting a black one in a larger size and wear it with probably a lightweight dress underneath. On the other hand I can see that it could look mom-y if you throw in a shirt and jeans and styling it with a size that fits you instead of a larger size	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 25, 2020	labels:I have a pair of beater Florsheims I bought on sale which I wear every other day to help my better pair of shoes rest while I save up for another good pair. Naturally I expect their quality to be pretty poor but they've held up surprisingly well despite walking in them a lot this past year. I'm now able to afford said better pair, but I don't want to buy them until I actually need more shoes. What are the signs that I should retire the Florsheims? They really don't seem to be getting any visible wear and tear yet other than the usual creasing.

text:General Discussion - December 26, 2020	labels:I just realized I am having a shoe identity crisis. Not all outfits work with boots, but my trousers selection has shifted a lot and no longer works with sneakers (or maybe I just don't like sneakers anymore). At least most of the time I end up changing my pants because I don't know what shoes to wear. And it's holding me back. I've never been a huge fan of derbies, especially black derbies because I associate them with school uniform shoes, and I'm forbidden to wear sandals. So now I don't know what to do. More types of boots? Buy nice derbies and see if I like them? Accept that all outfits go with boots? shrug
text:> no longer works with sneakers   No such thing as pants that don't work with sneakers. I wear (orphaned) suit (uniform actually, still a suit) pants with sneakers ON THE REG. Another option for you would be Parrie Boots or Klem Mens.	labels:The trousers that I've decided that deserve more than sneakers are mostly my various printed Dries pants	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: Advice on Learning How to Hate Fashion	labels:One easy way to hate fashion is to blindfold yourself and trying to get dressed. If even a single piece of clothing is inside out the wrong side, take everything off and do it again until you get it  right. Oh yea, you have to do that too with the lights off. At that point might as well wear nothing(this is a joke too lol).	episode_done:True
text:How would you style or rebuild your wardrobe around your holy grail fashion piece?	labels:Comfy, smart black ankle boots that fit me perfectly and which do not kill my feet after couple hours of walking. How would I style them? With everything that I currently own in my basic wardrobe set and its winter add-ons!  Edit: Wow, this blew up and I completely didn't see that coming! Thank you all for great recommendations!  Funnily enough earlier that day I ordered a pair of really lovely Clarks ankle boots,so we will see if they fit and do the job! But I am totally jotting down your recommendations for the future search! Big thanks!
text:Thursday Boots cost a pretty penny but are gorgeous, high quality, and extremely comfortable!	labels:Second this! I've been eyeing them for a while but finally went ahead and bought them. They're great.	episode_done:True
text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I'd get a really nice piece of outerwear, either a coat in a quality material like wool or a leather or shearling jacket. If you live somewhere with colder weather during part of the year, outerwear is something you'll be wearing all the time so it's worth investing in a piece that's great quality, keeps you warm and makes a statement. I think an amazing jacket or coat will elevate even the most basic outfit, whether it's a more classic piece, something utilitarian like a puffer jacket or something more extravagant. Personally I think Acne, Chloe and Tibi are brands that make great high-end outerwear in a variety of styles.

However, I love the streetwear designs and fits at ASOS. I mostly just don't like how the clothes aren't great after a few washes and the quality isn't great.  Can anyone recommend similar sites?

text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:Midwest (southeast Ohio) summer (tends to be mid 80s- low 90s with hella humidity) I pretty much live in maxi and knee length dresses with anti chaff shorts underneath- plus sized girl here (18W). I found brands for both the dresses and shorts on amazon- all dresses have pockets because the one thing I dislike about summer is no jacket pockets! Winters have been fairly mild the last few years but pretty much live in booties/boots, wool socks, leggings and tunics or the knee length summer dresses with a chunky sweater over them. If I go for jeans I usually wear a tshirt with chunky sweater or hoodie and I have a pair of bzees boots that look kind of space whey with a wedge heel that are Uber comfy. I have super broad shoulders which are hard to fit for coats without feeling super constricted so I found a north face wind resistant fleece a few years ago I wear under a full zip asymmetrical hoodie with scarf, hat and gloves. Keeps me pretty toasty with the double layering and wind resistance of the fleece.	episode_done:True
text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:Nike for sneakers: ubiquitous, largely overrated, expensive and I dislike their designs. I genuinely don't understand why they are the #1 brand... For cheap clothes: Zara. I never find anything there that is not entirely made of plastic sh*t and I often find their designs weird. I aldo don't understand why and how they can be the  world's #1clothes company...

text:Are you on the shorter side? This has been an issue for me for the past five years and was making me crazy. Tiny holes! Only my t-shirts! Nobody else in my family has this issue! I don't often tuck in my shirts and rarely wear pants with a button! And then it finally hit me that five years ago we moved into this place with no dishwasher, so I am constantly washing dishes. And since I'm just over 5 feet tall, I have to lean into the counter and, oh, that's where the holes are coming from. Heavier materials hold up, but my t-shirts all end the same way.

text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:So I've never had a high-end faux leather bag, so maybe there's a dramatic difference in the quality and durability of the materials?  But every single faux leather bag I have had has cracked. Faux leather handles and straps have been particularly terrible.   I might consider faux leather for a statement piece that I use really infrequently, but for an everyday bag I'd go with either leather or a durable fabric. Faux leather would be the last thing I would choose.   There are a variety of faux leather options that are not PU or PVC but made from agricultural waste, but I've never seen them in real life, so I don't know what the tactile experience or durability is actually like.
text:Yes, mine also always cracked! And then instantly it just looks bad. I have a natural leather black bag, 4 years old. Its bottom corners got a bit "used" with the time, but not cracked. I just polish it from time to time with black leather cream.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: Body Types (no fruit answers allowed)	labels:Stalk of celery	episode_done:True
text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:No. I wear what I want and all together what happens is what happens. An outfit can be in a specific style but I think very few people actually stick to one aesthetic in everything they wear. Sometimes different vibes suit different days, and it's nice to have a dress for a goth day and another for a soft pastel floral day. Just do what makes you happy.	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:Assuming that price and time doesn't matter makes any discussion about knitting moot IMO. If you can only afford acrylic yarn, you're probably better off buying a wool sweater on the secondhand market.  I bought a Sezane mohair lace-weight sweater for $120USD. To knit that same sweater with the same quality yarn would have taken me probably $200 and two months of evenings. It's just not going to be worth it for >99% of knitters.  There's also an issue of finding patterns that mimic current trends. A lot of popular patterns are boxy and use heavy yarn and if that's your jam, go for it. They can be as long-lasting and high quality as anything you can buy. But sweaters with patterns, cables, multiple colors, brioche, etc. require additional skills.  And sweaters with lighter weight yarn can take seriously forever.
text:Sewing also, though perhaps not to the same degree - the kinds of seams, finishes, and ability to adjust the fit that would make the difference are expensive because of the amount of time they take. If you like making clothes, it's worth it to spend that time; if you don't, expect to pay a tonnn of money for it, or assume the workers who made it for you weren't paid fairly (or sometimes both :/ ). Decent material is often more expensive, though the difference may not be as profound as the difference between nice local wool and acrylic yarn from JoAnn Fabrics. That's also why even higher-end and ethical clothing brands often sell boxy shirts without darts, tops with dropped shoulders, and use elastic to fit things to the waist.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Inspo Album: Pulling the Past Forward, Asian-style	labels:I came here from the other Asian designers thread you just posted! I hadn't seen this post but THANK YOU for this.  I'm an East Asian immigrant who came to North America about a decade ago. One of the first few things I did was to promptly lose my native accent and do everything I could I assimilate asap. That meant everything from making caucasian friends to dressing on a certain way. I hid my culture and never really enjoyed telling people where I was "really" from.  Fast forward to now and I finally feel secure enough to wear whatever and speak however I like. I *LOVE* having Asian motifs on my clothes - my closet is full of crane and koi fish details. I'm also lucky enough to be working in a sector that fully embraces diversity on a deep level. Can't wait to try some of these brands out!

text:Let's talk about sneakers	labels:Echoing the observed popularity of AF1s, Air Jordan 1s, and Adidas Gazelles or Stan Smiths. I've also seen a lot of those gray and white Pumas, not sure what the style is called.   I wear sneakers to work (Dr's office) and found the Reebok Man's World sneakers to have a similar look to AF1s but with a more unique vibe! I also love Saucony Shadow originals, but that's less of a trend and more of a personal favorite because they're the most confortable shoe I've ever owned. I get a new pair whenever I like a new colorway.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 08	labels:I'm looking to get a trench coat/overcoat before winter enters full swing, but I have a problem... I'm a tad skinny, 5'10" 130lbs. I'm not quite  wiry, but I'm getting there and this makes finding anything like what  I'm looking for a bit difficult.  While in highschool (I was even smaller back then) I wore a coat by London Fog and was able to make it work and probably could again but, it would be nice to be able to wear something a little less baggy as I won't *always* be layered up.

text:“I'm all locked down with nowhere to go – but that hasn't killed my lust for fashion”	labels:So, I've discovered that I like the Italian chic vibe, kinda like Sophia Loren and 90s Monica Belluci. So as it gets warmer, I think I'm going to channel that look and vibe more. Funny enough, I finally got the hang of winter fashion this year (grew up in a warmer climate), so I've pretty much overhauled my winter wardrobe these past few months.   I've been doing the same thing with my daughter. I've been ordering these gorgeous dresses and separates, shoes and accessories for her, in a size or so bigger than what she currently wears. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that she'll be able to be in person when she starts Kindergarten this Fall.
text:Okay but now I have to see an album of Italian chic, because that is absolutely mood and aesthetic I need more of in my life.	labels:...I will see what I can do.

text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:I have to strongly disagree and a big point is my experience with glasses. What's good to wear has changed Dramatically over the last ten years. At the start of 2010 it was all tiny little glasses. I had this pair of tiny rectangle ones that are sooooo small in comparison to anything you can get now.   My glasses are as big as my mom's were that me and my siblings used to make fun of my mom for wearing in the photos of her from the 80s.

I've noticed more wide legged jeans or trousers online and I must say they can look good but on me they look like trash because I'm short with wide hips, I hope skinny jeans will never go out of fashion.
text:im short with wide hips as well! i hate the way i look in skinny jeans though. if you want to experiment with different fitting jeans, straight leg pants are my best friend! im also starting to get into baggier jeans which has been really fun! you should check out the collusion "dad" jeans on ASOS!	labels:Straight jeans look kinda good on me only with heeled boots, I don't really like them with sneakers. How to you style baggier jeans? I'm intrigued by them but I'm afraid they would look too big on me.
text:i wear white AF1's with my baggier jeans and long sleeve cropped tops right now, but once it gets warmer i'll switch to short sleeve or no sleeve crop tops! Also with my straight leg jeans i wear boots with a little bit of a platform so they don't touch the ground LOL	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:I have a fair collection of high end/luxury items; some I have purchased new, some second hand, and a couple were gifts. The thing all of my most expensive items have in common is that they are timeless, high quality pieces that I will feel good about the investment forever and will never be truly "out of style." I also try to make sure that I'm investing in pieces that I will get a lot of wear out of such a jeans, loafers, wallets, a practical purse for everyday, good winter coats, high quality sweaters, etc. I also make sure to take good care of my investment pieces so that they last me well into the future. Lots of wear = low cost per wear = no guilt. Most importantly, wear what makes you happy and and if that means $1500 for a pair of shoes or $3000 for a purse and you can afford it, you do you.	episode_done:True

My fiance is Indian so can definitely see where you are coming from as I myself have experienced the stares and the comments and dressing to avoid them.  I'm from Russia where the rush hour foot traffic in city streets is a form of runway so I always get blown away when people look down on dressing up and find it an offensive question.  You're right though, it can definitely go both ways, but either way the point I was trying to make is that we should be true to ourselves and that's the most important thing about your image.	episode_done:True

I also had a ripped and deconstructed jean mini skirt that I would wear with Demonia platform boots. I would also flat iron my hair stick straight every day. I remember wearing little plastic hair clips that looked like tanks. I thought I was being so ironic wearing kids accessories. I also had my eyebrow pierced, then the center of my lip.

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:Basic classic pieces never go out of style: i.e., black cocktail dress, blazer, good denim shorts/jeans/jacket, pencil skirt, black pumps, you get the drill. Those pieces are always worth spending extra on. The mix and match pieces can be more of the economical, trendy purchases.  Budget is important. Don't buy what you don't need unless it's screaming at you. Actually, never buy any piece of clothing unless it screams at you. Lol that's my rule of thumb.  A great wardrobe has stuff from department stores/fancy pieces, forever 21/zara (or the like) and thrifted pieces. Buy cotton when you can - it breathes better and lasts longer than most synthetic fabrics.  Also! you probably have a lot more good outfits than you think you do. Sometimes you just need to boost your creativity, mix old pieces with new pieces, get a little adventures and above all else, be confident! confidence is more important than what you're wearing - it's the sparkle factor.	episode_done:True

Everyone is busy looking at, thinking about, critiquing themselves.  So wear what makes you happy! Try new things!   Edited for concision.

My friends and family comment on attire all the time, and it's not always pleasant. If it's something classic, comfortable, "boring" (not like Amish clothes, but average?) I hear nothing. If it's a bright color, or any pattern, or even blue jeans (don't wear them often), I get all kinds of comments ranging from surprise to passive agressive insult to over-exhuberant compliment. Don't even get me started on accessories or hairstyle.  It makes me so self-conscious.   Just once, it would be nice to hear, "I like your outfit," and that be the end of it.  No, they're not overly religious or conservative or anything like that. They all wear a wide range of colors, styles, and accessories, and talk about it comfortably. I guess they're just not used to me looking like I give a damn.	labels:I like your outfit!

text:Formula for a put together outfit that works for most aesthetics	labels:To be honest, this sounds like a lot of work. I know when I like my outfit or when it needs something else, or has too much. I don't assign elements numbers, though.
text:I was thinking the same. I just like to have a centerpiece in my outfit, and will style the rest of my clothes and accessories around it. That way it's never too much, and if your centerpiece is nice and the rest of my clothes are well fit, you will also not look sloppy. Balance is the key.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:Minnesota winter weather checking in! A hat helps keep body temp up and ears warm. The best hats I've found have a lining like a headband around the ears and the bottom of the hat. Some knits are too loose for warmth and this extra lining helps. Not sure what they call it but it works	episode_done:True

Almost none of my favorite brands (e.g., Zara, Uniqlo) carry the 30" inseam pants I need, and I am not even *that* short.  Before COVID and back in my hometown, I would order stuff to my house and then take pants to be tailored, or just got stuff in person at Uniqlo who tailor for you in the store. Since I moved to California, I didn't even had a chance to find a reasonably priced alterations tailor within a reasonable distance before COVID hit. The few pants I did buy from online sales ended up at Goodwill, knowing that I will never go to to get them tailored.  Shorter people of MFA - how do we buy trousers online?

I obviously try to get the best quality as possible while trying not to break my wallet.   Unfortunately, I've gained a bit of weight since the pandemic (more or less stop being active since January) and gotten a bit of a *belly*. My clothes, which are usually M, no longer fit me and I've been shopping for **L** as of recent. Yesterday, I got rid of about half of my closet to donate.  Which brings me to today (black Friday and all that) where I'm trying to restock on clothes. **Does anyone know any decent quality buttoned shirts that won't cost me my kidney that you could recommend based on personal experience?** I'm trying to get a *white* one to use for various occasions, and a *darker* (navy-ish) fancy one I might wear for New Years.  Thank you in advance!
text:Tbh it will work out much cheaper to lose weight than having to buy an entirely new wardrobe. However, to answer your question, at $20, you won't get too much choice. Look for deals that are highly discounted (at $20 most hirts hat were riginally $50+ but is discounted will be better than a $20 shirt)	labels:	episode_done:True

I was soo nervous I had never made a purchase that big for myself, but I was like... what if I never come back? So I bought this beautiful clutch in Gucci pink that literally is my pride and joy.

I've moved to a place with an ungodly cold winter (even though from what people are telling me this winter has been quite mild) from a place with only hot-or-warm-entire-years and the only thing I've been able to think about the past week is: how the hell do people keep their legs warm without looking dumb? Any sort of fashion or even barely nice looking thing I wear seems to let breeze in like a fucking skirt while I'm outside. Are long johns a thing people actually wear and not just a thing in old assed shows that have a winter fishing scene? If you're hooking up with someone and have to take off your long johns, that won't be something that gets you laughed at by society as a whole (or spread a rumour that you're a mormon)?

And the coats they DID have weren't temperature rated so I had no idea if they were sufficient. So I bought nothing...  Signed,  Girl from FL/SC	labels:Macy's is trash for proper cold weather clothing. Outdoor sporting stores are where it's at (REI is my go-to). Look for brands like North Face, Columbia, and Patagonia that are known for making durable items for people who like to hike on glaciers.   Also, INVEST. Look for deals on other items, but if you don't have a proper winter coat I promise you can't afford to wait through the polar vortex to buy on off-season sales. Be ready to spend $150-$250. It's a good chunk of change, but it'll last you years and it's worth the investment.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 18, 2020	labels:I recently bought several items for my bf from American Giant. I have to say, I am very disappointed. Not only were all the sweatpants out of stock in sizes under XL, their customer service is awful. I expected delays because of COVID and the holiday season, but I placed my order on Dec 7 and it still hadn't even been processed (packed up), yet alone sent. I have sent 3 emails, none of which have gotten a response. They also took their phone number off their website (but I found it on google). Additionally, they automatically imposed a 40USD customs fee on my order (I live outside the US), even though the order was under the customs limit (150USD).   I am so annoyed with the lack of communication and the huge delays even though their website promised delivery by Christmas. I almost feel like cancelling my order.

I'm getting married and honeymooning st Disney world next year2021. And I know we will be taking a lot of photos. And I want to gift my sweetheart a cool outfit to wear for pics.  He's late 20s-early 30s and normally he has a signature look of mixing hip-hop influence with comic/gaming stuff  I know disney characters he likes but I'm legit clueless for what men actually like to wear.(not what girls like on men)  So I guess my question is: What would you wear to a park, knowing you're going to take pics?

I only wore black and grey or obsessively used an app for color matching because I was so scared of looking like a fool. That was about 5 years ago. I don't use the app anymore, I put things together based on how they look to me. Shapes and textures really, I said screw trying to color match because it's just never going to work for me haha.

I am from a place where it drops to -25 C in winters so I layer my tops  in a way that I can take off any number of layers when I go indoors (and  still look presentable). For example, if the heat is really high indoors, I  will dress down to my last layer which is usually a decent t-shirt.  But how do I layer pants? I mean I cant wear a pant beneath a pant, right?. The  only thing I can do is wear long johns beneath the pant, which doesnt  work for me coz I cant take my pants off and walk around in long johns.
text:\-25C is survival temperatures. I am not sure there is an answer besides wearing long-johns or performance leggings.

Like if my jeans are feeling less snug because I've worn them 3 or 4 times, I wash them to get them back to the right fit that feels comfortable for me. It's the same with jumpers and tops.

Medium was out for months, I'd actually never seen it in stock even on other retailers (still don't) - so I think it goes without saying I grabbed one.

text:I thrift and left fast fashion behind. The hunt is more rewarding anyway. OP- I think it honestly sounds ignorant to want "feminist" clothing. Are you trying to just slap a label on yourself or what?	labels:can you tell us more what sounds "ignorant" about OP wanting "feminist" clothing?

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:The number one reason I thrift is it keeps me from having to do a mountain of research every time I go shopping. There are honestly too many transgressions to count, and it's incredibly difficult to tell if a company is actually making meaningful changes to its practices. I'm very happy to send my money somewhere else.	episode_done:True

text:Kibbe System and Body Inclusivity	labels:I have negative associations with it because 99% of the time "red pill women" (or other women with deep issues) are the ones saying good things about it.  When I hear "Kibbe" I immediately think "red pill".
text:I had no idea it was a red pill thing, that's so off-putting. I wonder what attracts them to it specifically?	labels:As someone who was raised in a conservative religious household and who fully bought into the red pill women BS in my much younger years, u/PartyPorpoise hit the nail on the head. And to add to that, fashion for the red pill women isn't about personality, individuality or art or anything avant-garde, it's about looking "hot" as defined by society at large (aka men). The Kibbe system gives a sense of right/good/attractive vs wrong/bad/ugly in fashion. It's about being told how to dress (something I got a lot of from church) rather than discovering one's style for oneself.	episode_done:True
text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Many years ago I moved from Hawaii to college in the Northeast. I would recommend 1) Buying it all there, because they'll have what's good for their climate and 2) starting out with cheaper options (thrifted, Old Navy, Target range) even if it's not quite your style. Don't spend much time, effort, and money until you see how you really feel after at least a year of seasons. Maybe you want warmer stuff than you thought you would, or realize you should invest in nicer socks, or discover you don't actually like turtlenecks, or shift to a different style when you're surrounded by a new area's vibe. Let yourself experience it for a bit without pressuring yourself to do it all right.
text:This.   Our gear is made for the cold.  We have lots of items at resale shops because coats are fashion.         My personal favorite is silk long underwear.  It is lightweight and easy to wear under clothes.    Expect to wear a hoody indoors.  Heck, I like to port around my scarf indoors too.     Respect the cold and dont do dumb stuff.  When you go somewhere in a car dress like you will have an accident and need to walk a mile.  Do not jump into your car with shorts and boots just because you look cute.	labels:I like to carry a packable coat with me in the car because I get way too hot on long drives in my very warm winter coat, but yes,  you should be prepared for car trouble, or coming out to your car after work and having to defrost it and brush it off by wearing reasonably warm clothes.	episode_done:True

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:What has really helped me with "growing up" my wardrobe is trying to wear my existing clothes in different ways, and documenting my outfits.  I have also been trying to adjust current go-to looks with different accessories to see if that gives the results I want.   The documenting part has really helped me hone in on what items I want to invest in (what suits me, what fits well, what shapes I like etc).  At the same time, the trying new combos/classing it up with jewellery has helped me feel like I have tons of new outfits to try even though I'm only adding a piece every month or so.	episode_done:True

text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels: A lot of women (myself included) opt out of fashions that are not flattering.  However, choosing to wear something that is fashionable, even though it doesn't look good on me seems an odd choice, unless one is *really* into fashion for fashion's sake.
text:I think things can look good and not be flattering.  Lots of really beautiful/interesting/striking outfits are not flattering to many people and make no attempt to be and that's fine.

I like socks purely for the comfort, I would end up with calluses or blisters, or leaving my shoes dark inside without them.

I don't think I want to get rid of things anymore but rather just wear them and love them lol If I wear something that seems out of date I pair it with something else so the entire look isn't outdated.

text:Permanent Style - The Cold-Colour Capsule	labels:The way he handles the idea of cool/warm colors is strange. Like, he writes blue is a warm color. What? There aren't really, in itself, cool and warm colors, like, you can't say green as a whole is warm or cool. It's about undertones. You can easily find warm green and cool green, so is blue, so is every color.
text:Welllll... he answered me on instagram, and it seems like he *was* talking about "cool" in this sense, but he didn't really explain that, and also meant to imply unsaturated / whatever, and that part was more important... And he didn't really express that part... So... Yeah, he wrote this one in a strange way, but color theory is weird to begin with.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I've had issues with itchy fabrics for a looooong time but recently discovered the joy of wearing not tight pants. They don't necessarily bother me as much as I love how comfy they are. Unfortunately, with my work it's kind of hard to find appropriate pants that aren't jeans but I'm on the lookout for work appropriate wide leg pants. So if you have any recommendations, I'd love to know them!	labels:I hate HATE tight pants,, so the whole skinny jean thing is so not for me. I'm loving my torrid wide leg pants and the lane Bryant Allie line in boot cuts. Dressier fabrics but really comfortable. also old navy khaki pants are amazing. The boot cut fits more like a wide leg or a flare; lots of room for not feeling tight.	episode_done:True
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:I have one (1) pair of orange suede leggings. Sure, if you squint, they could be brown, but they are not. They are orange. I tend to pair them with navy because I am a diehard New York Islanders fan. Fortunately I own a top that has navy Breton stripes and an orange and blue flower detail -- perfect!	episode_done:True

A pair of simple stone earrings that resemble diamonds, or other sparkly thing, but small and nondescript.  If in doubt, I'd stick to silver or rose gold.  I'd invest just a little more into these two items if they should serve me longer, and I try to avoid those plastic jewellery stalls.   A plain black belt with a silver colour buckle, make that genuine leather to last longer.  A scarf that a bit long, for the windy days. A warm neck makes a lot of difference!	episode_done:True

text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:Don't forget that the clothes you see on TV or in films are costumes, even if it's not a "costume drama". They fit well on screen because the whole look has been designed - everyone's outfits, the setting and so on. So unless it's a deliberate choice everything is going to look cohesive. By deliberate choice I mean things like a character wearing obviously different clothes to most of the rest of the cast to show they're old fashioned, or quirky and so on.  I'm certainly not saying don't look to film and TV for inspo, but either try to modify what you see to more match where you are, or accept the fact you might look more dressed up than the majority and go with it anyway.	episode_done:True

text:Gorpcore: How Arc’teryx Parkas and Salomon Hiking Boots Became High Fashion	labels:In the context of living in the rainiest city in Europe, where practically everyone goes hiking or on walks in wet places, the article was kind of weird to read.   This is more or less how your 60+ in-laws dress and they even make fun of themselves for having looking like crap when they go out like that. The combination of Norwegian salaries, the rain, and an utter disregard for how they look when they're out on morning walks makes for a lot of expensive technical wear and Salomon shoes.   Had no idea that it was called gorpcore and that it was fashion. I just texted my father in law telling him that our little town of 280k must be the fashion capital of the world.
text:Bergen? Norwegian West coast is really about practical clothing. It's a big difference with Oslo, for example. But spending a month (even in the summer) in cities like Bergen, Trondheim or Stavanger will teach you that hip and fit clothing is simply not enough some days, you have to face the wind and rain.	labels:Yeah, Bergen.

There must be quite a few new businesses started up during lockdown. The difficulty is finding them because your usual search engine just ain't going to find them for you.	episode_done:True

text:Are jean shorts on men really that bad?	labels:I don't think they look bad, I just find the concept weird.  It's summer, it's hot so you're wearing shorts, but the shorts are made from denim which is a hot and sweaty material. It's an oxymoron to me, like have you got your legs out to stay cool or have you got the denim on to stay warm? What's going on here?
text:Also, for travel, denim sucks. I have been to 40ish countries, so I am somewhat open minded about different cultures, but one area I have unguarded, unabashed chauvinism is in the supremacy of American dryers. Dealing with crappy unvented combo washer+dryer units, or waiting 2 days for jeans to air dry in a hostel is no fun.	labels:The clear problem is that you've chosen to wash your denim rather than live in the muck	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone take their “power color” really seriously? Basing a whole wardrobe around one color - not just choosing an accent color for a neutral capsule?	labels:I love this idea! It'd be so easy to curate because you'd have a pretty narrow selection of clothes to choose from. My power color is red, and I love wearing all red, but I do mix my reds with black, gray, or white most of the time.   Hot pink could be really cool, especially as we move into winter. It's an unusual fall/winter color so you'd really stand out! And I am personally -never- annoyed by seeing cool ass outfits on the street. I honestly really appreciate it.
text:And, especially in winter, hot pink head to toe can be tempered with the third and fourth elements. So a mint green and black plaid blanket scarf and giant mint green duffle bag will keep the head to toe pink look from being so bitchy.	labels:uh, was bitchy the right word choice? idk how a color could make someone automatically look "bitchy".
text:"On Wednesdays we wear pink" maybe?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I know my clothes weren't made with slave labour?	labels:As others have mentioned--you don't. The best way to avoid it is by thrifting since you're not adding to the demand for clothing production. A thrifted item could have been produced by slaves originally, sure, but your purchase of it doesn't contribute to that.  Also, contrary to what you might assume, in many cases companies that have gotten into trouble for abusing slave labor in the past are actually safer now. They overcorrect and invest in auditing to avoid the issue happening again. This only applies to companies who care about their brand in this way though, like Target.	episode_done:True
text:Formula for a put together outfit that works for most aesthetics	labels:I kind of like this system actually because I am Very Bad at fashion and end up looking sloppy more often than not. Sanity checking what I would wear to work in non covid times:  - solid color (usually jewel tone or black) shirt or blouse in a standard shell or button down shape: 1pt - black pants: 1pt - black flats (summer) or ankle booties (winter): 1pt - boring leather tote or structured handbag: 1pt - hair in bun, French twist, or low pony: 1pt - little to no makeup: 0pt  Did I do this right? I should probably add 1-2 more points of visual interest to be more put together then!
text:Probably a bold lipstick, piece of jewelry or fashionable belt would complete the look in my mind. That being said I don't think I usually follow this kind of point system, I find wearing any kind of dress/skirt has people thinking I'm made up.	labels:It's weird to me how simply putting on a dress tricks people into thinking you're super dressed up. My summer dresses feel like pajamas and take little thought since it's just 1 article of clothing. Throw on some flip flops and earrings and my husband thinks we're going to a really fancy restaurant. He usually thinks he needs to change since I'm so dressed up.	episode_done:True
text:Tailoring as a lifestyle choice - Suiting in The Crown	labels:In the age of WFH, what if men just started really living in their tailoring? Hands thrust in pockets, lounging on a picnic blanket, feet up binging Netflix?  An interesting thought exists that as mens casual wear became more acceptable that suiting became more structured and stiff. Thoughts?
text:I think it ultimately depends on your lifestyle. I've worked in diplomacy and executive-level corporate world and both of those fields had me in a suit all day, everyday. I've worn suits in the jungle, the desert, and even conflict zones.  Your level of comfort comes from the fit of the suit. I started with off the rack suits and moved onto full tailoring and now I find the suits more comfortable than jeans and hoodies. I actually don't own any "leisure wear" other than some W+H and RC hoodies from a decade ago.	labels:I'd be interested to see how common your current wardrobe is among men, to have a closet full of tailoring and so little sports/leisure/casual wear.  My wardrobe is 95% casual wear, some tailoring separates and a few suits that 100% do not fit (and frankly are a bit of their 2010ish moment when it comes to cut and styling).
text:It's probably not common at all since I've got a fairly unique lifestyle. I go to work (at least before covid) not knowing if I'll be going abroad for any number of reasons.  I actually do have a shit ton of SuFu approved clothing from the late 00s onward but since getting into a career in the 10s, there's absolutely zero chances for me to wear any of it.

Plus my boots - purple, cow, silver I'm looking forward to wearing. Also some velvet sweatpants and flares, my scarf collection, my chunky handknit socks, oooh I love autumn/winter clothes. Its always been my fave season for dressing.
text:While sunflowers are thought to have originated in Mexico and Peru, they are one of the first plants to ever be cultivated in the United States. They have been used for more than 5,000 years by the Native Americans, who not only used the seeds as a food and an oil source, but also used the flowers, roots and stems for varied purposes including as a dye pigment. The Spanish explorers brought sunflowers back to Europe, and after being first grown in Spain, they were subsequently introduced to other neighboring countries. Currently, sunflower oil is one of the most popular oils in the world. Today, the leading commercial producers of sunflower seeds include the Russian Federation, Peru, Argentina, Spain, France and China.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Beat me to it!   I actually used to be in charge of changing all the signage when things went "on sale", which was literally almost every day. Never ever ever pay full price for anything at Kohl's. There is like, a 95% chance that said thing will go on sale... and if it doesn't, it's probably going to clearance out. Having also been (at a different time) responsible for a lot of that, I can attest to that.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:The Business of Markups on Logo T-Shirts. Why You Shouldn't Drop $600 on a Gucci Tee	labels:I love designer clothing but one thing I will never spend my money on is a designer T-Shirt
text:I got an Alexander McQueen t-shirt recently and to be completely honest, I'm scared to wear it because I don't want to mess it up. I can't even enjoy the damn thing.	labels:This is one off the reasons why I mostly buy my clothes from thrift stores.  I once had a suede jacket from Reiss that I splurged on, but I would rarely wear it because I never wanted to ruin it (i.e. wouldn't wear it if there was a chance of rain, or if I was gonna go out to a restaurant or bar).  In addition, I purchased it when I was at a particularly low weight due to some personal issues.  By the time I got back to around my normal weight, what used to be a slim fitting jacket tight to the point I couldn't move my arms around. I paid well above what I normally paid for that, thought way to much about trying to keep it mint and never got to enjoy it before I had to give it away.  I feel a lot less stress about the clothes that I've thrifted, so I get to wear and enjoy them a whole lot more.  I personally wouldn't entertain dropping so much dosh on a designer t-shirt knowing my psychology when it comes to expensive clothes.	episode_done:True

I really like the idea of it because I tend to be plain or just too much, but I think I'd need to tweak it so that only my statement jewellery counts or something.  It's a neat idea I just looked down and counted just my jewellery points and found it funny enough to share - tone is hard to get across online!	episode_done:True

text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:It's a bit disheartening that the majority of responses talk about a decrease in quality. Of all my purchases in the last year or so, I think Patagonia is the only brand that is making clothes that wash well and seem to be standing the test of time. Since sturdiness is their bread and butter, I'd hope so! Needless to say, I'm searching for a new go-to brand for day-to-day wear - just haven't found it yet.
text:I had a black Pategonia ski jacket and had it for ever, it was still quite warm, and look great for the quality, it was expensive when I bought it but paid off.  I switched to a Canadian brand Arcteryx but recently I was not pleased with a jacket and returned it, I would consider replacing the Pategonia. I am going for a fall jacket so will check out their line.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:I have similar experiences too, my mother rarely taught me how to style my clothes, put make up on, or how to match colors. I don't blame her though, she was a working mom who had to support her 2 children. There were different priorities in her mind back then. Style wasnt an important factor when it comes to clothes, affordability was.   But my mom did taught me to look clean, though the colors may not match as long as they were a perfect fit and you groomed yourself properly it would be presentable (unless it was a bright green neon shirt paired with saturated red pants, I still cringe remembering that day xD in a good way) Right now I'm doing what I can to learn about fashion so maybe in the future I wont be so clueless	episode_done:True

text:I (M/39) just bought some bright yellow, women's, terry loungepants from August November. What wonderful "non-female" fashion items have you purchased recently? Do you ever dip into the men's section?	labels:My husband has two cardigans that are absolutely not his cardigans anymore. I have stolen them. They are mine now.  Also, men's outdoor gear is often better than women's and the pink tax on sporting goods is so real. I sometimes shop in the boy's section for hiking boots and outerwear since men's sizing often doesn't go small enough, so there's extra savings to be had there!	episode_done:True

If you're looking for the fun, character side, I would suggest Hot Topic, Think Geek, and maybe Svaha.  If you're more for the trendy/business casual aspect, perhaps Banana Republic, J. Crew, ModCloth, ASOS, and Antonio Milani.	labels:And honestly even old navy on a good day	episode_done:True
text:What are you hate wearing?	labels:Jeans. I cannot stand pre-distressed, stretchy, or tight jeans, so I usually buy jeans that are 1. Men's, because most women's Jean's are basically shapewear with busted-out knees, OR 2. A size or two bigger. So when I wear my jeans (which everyone thinks look super alternative/daring), I have to cuff them, wear a belt, and deal with puckering fabric around the crotch, which I offset with tight, long-sleeve shirts. But yeah. Does anyone remember the hey-days of Delia's? I remember the excitement of getting a new pair of raw denim that would become distressed to fit my body over time. These pre-distressed "jeggings" look horrible on everyone because the distress marks do not correspond with people's figures. I also cannot cannot cannot warrant buying clothes that are already tattered/ripped. Jeans are a love/hate for me.	episode_done:True

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:So, two pieces of information:  1) My stepmom works at Marshalls and she says it's totally random what they get in and when, but she does work front end, not receiving, so it's possible that there are patterns that she just doesn't pick up on.  2) I read an article once that said that Marshalls, TJ Maxx, etc. purposefully seed a few insanely good deals (designer stuff for a few $, etc.) throughout the store because it's a good way to make customers look at every single thing on the racks to make sure that they don't miss out on another deal like that. And that makes them buy more overall. Obviously I can't prove whether this is true or not, but it does sound plausible...
text:They are the casinos of clothing! Next they'll cover the windows so you don't know how long you've been in there hunting for a deal.	labels:Huh. This is why stores don't have windows.
text:It's certainly why casinos don't have windows. I personally prefer to have windows and have sunlight to view items in. Colors can be significantly different in sunlight vs lightbulbs. I've never enjoyed shopping at department stores, and the lighting is part of it.	labels:	episode_done:True

Everything just looks super bulky on me, like my current jacket. Do you have any tried and tested winter wear you can recommend to a thinner guy? You can recommend a particular piece, a brand or even a type of jackets - everything will be useful.  I would wear it in temperatures between -10 and 0 degrees Celsius (14 - 32F). If it matters, I'm not the tallest guy either (173 cm / 5'8'').
text:A single breasted overcoat can work pretty well for a slimmer look. Alternatively, you could wear slightly looser bottoms to balance out a bulkier top.	labels:Given that I've got my first wider pants after last winter, maybe this could be solved by itself. I'll give another chance to my current jacket and see how it works in a wide fit. Thanks!	episode_done:True

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I'm a too femme to function lesbian and stereotypical queer fashion always leaves me feeling left out in the cold. I don't like how I look in flannel and doc martens. I really do like how I look in an embroidered satin maxi skirt.  Going back in time, I used to feel like I had only two options : butch or look straight. It was not a fun choice. Neither was right for me. I spent a lot of high school looking way more masculine than I really felt comfortable with. It was partway through college that I realized that I had a third choice. Perform the hell out of stereotypical feminity. Embrace the chiffon and satin but do it on my own terms.  I don't look exactly like your average straight woman these day. It's subtle but there's a difference. Well there's also the fact that I dress like I'm an escapee from a Victorian brothel. I play with feminity. I wear petticoats beneath skirts and dye my hair blue. It's not the same kind of feminitity as a the average straight lady. It's a conscious performance of femme and not an uncritical acceptance of gender norms. It works for me.	episode_done:True
text:What are some unexpected surprises you've found with certain clothing brands that are known for other things?	labels:Not exactly fashion, but more sport-specific: Puma, usually known for casual sneakers or soccer cleats, makes excellent basketball shoes. Clyde All-Pro or the cheaper Clyde Hardwood are both excellent performers compared to signature shoes from Nike or Addidas.
text:On a similar wavelength - UnderArmour is primarily known for their compression clothing (leggings, shirts, etc.) and clothes in general, but their Curry line of basketball shoes is highly regarded as comparable to some of the best, top-tier tech basketball shoes by Nike and Adidas.	labels:	episode_done:True

Removing those updates from brands and sales and such was helpful, especially since we're so inundated with online marketing nowadays.

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:Hope I'm not too late the party. I'm very much a jeans a tee kind of girl. Always have been, always will be. All of my tees are fitted though and I have a variety of necklines. I also LOVE to make jewelry so that's usually how I dress up my jeans and tees and I'll also wear my leather boots instead of my trail shoes sometimes.   When I started thrifting I noticed that there are a lot of shirts out there that look "nicer" but feel like a tee. I have a cold shoulder shirt and a couple of soft, fitted cowl neck shirts that are super comfy and casual feeling but they look more like "going out" shirts. Another great thing about them is that you can dress them up even more with accessories and nice slacks or some fun colored pants but you can still keep it casual with jeans without feeling too dressed down. For me these were a simple way to get more variety into my wardrobe without going too crazy. (Because you can pry my fitted tees from my cold, dead hands. Hahaha)	episode_done:True

Just wish I had the guts (and budget) to start wearing them. It's one of these things that I like seeing others wear but I feel that wouldn't be able to pull of.  I might start to wear bracelets again and go from there.
text:Honestly the pandemic is a pretty cool opportunity to switch up your style/wear things you usually wouldn't in the comfort of your home (assuming you're not leaving the house much) by the time you start leaving your house more hypothetically you'll feel much more comfortable wearing things like jewelery because you've actually been wearing it for weeks	labels:Good idea. I'll honestly think about this. I'll slowly start browsing for rings and see if I finally pull the trigger

text:My feet started to ache a lot from standing all the time barefoot.  Before the pandemic, my shoes were off at the door and my house was quite shoe-free.  Since the pandemic, I wear shoes for like 4-5 hours a week instead of 50 hours a week and my feet need more support.  I designated a pair of my "regular" shoes to be house-shoes for the foreseeable future because I need support and structure for my feet.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:[Inspiration] Sculptural Jewelry	labels:Looks ungainly and uncomfortable to wear.  Low profile rings made of unconventional materials work better imo.   A simple obsidian band with some engravings would look way better
text:There's not a lot in the album most people would consider practical. You sacrifice comfort and a bit of function to wear a ring like 5 or 6. I'm fine doing that, but I know most people aren't. As for those vs an obsidian band, it depends on the occasion. Assuming a typical office job (obv these won't fly in trades), at work an obsidian band would look much better because that's not the environment to wear something as bold as the things in this album. But if I'm wearing jewelry for a special occasion I personally want it to be more daring than a basic band.	labels:Yea i get that.  I work as an electrician. The majority of fits on this board I simply cant wrap my head around, and seem ridiculous/limiting movement.

text:I dyed my leather boots and here is how it went.	labels:I had a pair of brown mocassins that had a small hicth, a patch with a different color, and that I couldn't return, so I decided to dye them black. It was really easy and I love how they turned out. They look like a pair of Gucci loafers now.  I used pure acetone to deglaze them and didn't use resolene, but I polish them with a black polish. It's such an easy process I decided to dye a handbag too.  My 2 tips are:  1. Protect everything! The dye will go everywhere and it stains. 2. If using acetone to deglaze, make sure it des not come into contact anything it's not supposed to, like a shiny plastic surface, because it could ruin it.	episode_done:True

text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I had to start from scratch three times this year because I lost 91 pounds!   My strategy has been to pick a style (classic) and four neutral colors (black, gray, camel, white) to build a wardrobe base with.   I picked basics I knew I needed, made a list, and shopped for them on sale.   Now I am working on adding some color, mostly in accessories, although I bought a smashing red dress yesterday!   The important thing for me, given my wardrobe is small, is that everything goes with everything else.

text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:Thank you so much for posting this. I feel like I also see an overwhelming about of posts ragging on getting dressed. I have been consulting from home since August 2017, and I have not stopped getting "dressed" everyday in a nice outfit that I would be seen wearing outside.   I have a routine that includes exercise and a shower in the morning, and then I am dressed by 8:00am.    Of course I absolutely have refined my uniform to no longer include pants that strangle my waist (and shift dresses are a thing of the past) but I absolutely get dressed every day, even if I just wear a nice blouse and a knit pencil skirt or slacks.   I no longer wear makeup since COVID-19 hit, so that has been the only adaptation I have made in that regard, and I think its because I so rarely see other people wear makeup when I am out and about these days.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 10, 2021	labels: Okay so some background: I'm 15 and usually my fits are pretty trash. I usually wake up, put on a sweatshirt, some sweatpants or jeans and that's it for the day at school. Most the time that happens cause it's so early when I wake up. Basically I'm dreadful at style and look stupid most the time. I kinda wanna branch out and look better and my goal by June is to kinda be an improved better version of myself etc. I just don't want anything to fancy or crazy cause I live in a kinda conservative area and some fits would be seen as "weird" or "gay" (which is fuckin stupid). So yeah that's basically it it's really hard to have any sort of style but I hope it's something I get better at. Anyone got recommendations?
text:your first step is probably figuring out what your definition of a better self looks like. are there certain styles/silhouettes/color palettes/specific articles of clothing that you like?  for generic advice, don't wear sweatpants to school. jeans + a sweatshirt is by no means a bad look at 15. if you want more time to pick clothes but refuse to wake up earlier you can put out the clothes the night before then just slide into them when you crawl out of bed (that's what i did for work before covid)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:Your style is what you want it to be. I mean, I'm pretty sure you're not going out screaming from the rooftops to anyone who will listen that your style is alternative/grunge. If you like alternative/grunge, if it's what you're drawn to, if you like how it looks on you, that's your style. It's for you.   There are a number of situations in life where someone won't get to wear clothing that's their style or where it may not be practical. Uniforms, workplace/school dress codes, special events where certain attire is expected, running errands, working out, etc. In many situations, clothing is just not the most important thing at that time/place, and that's okay. It doesn't change what your style is.	episode_done:True

text:What was the last addition to your wardrobe in 2020 and what was / is going to be the first addition to your wardrobe in 2021?	labels:I genuinely can't remember the last item of clothing I bought for myself this year haha, the most recent one I can remember was leggings and a sweater in February. But the last addition to my wardrobe was an XL men's Columbia fleece sweater that belonged to my boyfriend's mom, but she loaned then gifted it to me when we moved in with her (thx Covid) and she realised my wardrobe was NOT suitable to life in the climate she lives in.  First item of clothing in 2021 - work is supposedly sending me to China in the Spring (though given Covid cases in my country currently, I'll believe it when I have the visa in hand lol). So if the trip does go ahead, I will need to buy a few things so I'm presentable!	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 22, 2020	labels:So I've been lurking / participating here for about a month and I think I have a good feel for the types of posts that generally end up on this sub, common opinions etc.  I see this same pattern - posts that align pretty well with what's discussed in WAYWT/Discussion threads, like the Rick Owens post from today or the coats post from last week, getting thousands of votes and comments from people posting things like "he looks like he's shit his pants", and "nobody would wear this".  Why do people who spend their time lurking this sub, silently absorbing whatever opinions and discussion, decide to come out of the woodwork to post _this_ hot take? Really - you had to put some thought and energy into typing that out. If that's what you think, why are you here?  I just don't understand. At least the post-meta-discussion here is good for a few laughs.

I know it's not the freshest look, but it makes me happy so I do it. I do try to keep in mind how much goes into one outfit (a shirt with puppies on it *and* a bright skirt *and* colored rights *and* a headband is too much, but a shirt with puppies on it, layered under a blazer and with black pants is doable). And its kind of consistently my style, rather than something I randomly cling to every once in awhile, if that makes sense?

I have no idea what the difference between, say, a "medium tall" and a "large slim" is supposed to be. Which one is longer? Which one is tighter? Haha I have no idea what to make of this.

text:> suits will never go away but there had better be some seriously comfortable offerings from now own.  I feel like there always has been? A suit that fits you well can be very comfortable. Think of a gray flannel suit in Winter, or a cotton-linen suit in Summer. As far as styling goes, casualness has been on the rise for a bit (even when it comes to tailoring, see the excess of unstructured Italian-inspired options nowadays) and there's many writers who think that the pandemic is only accelerating that trend. Even industries like banking and finance no longer require full suits for work attire.  I'm actually struggling now to think of somewhere I would go in my life that would absolutely require a suit, and all I'm coming up with is most funerals and some weddings. In my personal observation athleisure is rapidly becoming the default for most people in my world.

It also has cut outs on the sides so when I wear a cute bra and it shows off my rib tattoo I feel like a boss.	episode_done:True
text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:My closet is mostly neutrals to begin with, so I can pair almost anything with almost any hair color. My struggle was with makeup - I switched from red hair to teal, to my natural brown, to emerald green, then purple, and now I'm finally blonde. It's not that I have difficulty matching or coordinating my hair to my make-up per se, it just got annoying have to switch from cool to warm palettes and vice versa. A lot of my lipsticks were out of commission, too, depending on the hair color.  The blonde has been INCREDIBLY fun because I can just make my way through the rainbow without anything clashing. Also a perk to not getting dye on my fingers when I inevitably twirl my hair.
text:I'm glad I'm not alone with the transferring issue! I looked like a damn smurf when my hair was freshly dyed.	labels:I keep reading that it means I'm not rinsing properly, but the water RUNS CLEAR. I just don't think dye manufacturers anticipate the nervous-nelly hair twirlers!

I don't know what the deal is, but I started seeing their cool, *Hackers-*inspired ads suddenly around 2 months ago, and they obviously worked because I eventually ordered a ring and pair of earrings that I really like and seem to be good quality (I got the gridlock ring and chain earrings, both in gasoline finish.)   I did a bunch of research before ordering to see if they were just a drop shipper and thus if I could find dupes on alixpress or something, and I was never able to find any real dupes, especially for their more bold designs. Seems that they are just a designer of cool unisex jewelry! But owie my wallet.

text:The French love them.  Wrinkling-creasing - you really have no idea what you are going to get. If the last fits you very well, probably less creasing. If you happen to get good hides, probably less creasing.  I have an old pair of Alfred Sargent made for Brooks Brothers Chelseas - these fuckers DO NOT CREASE. Do I think that necessarily makes AS a must buy brand? Nah. Do I think that AS made shoes for BB to an impossibly high standard - not likely (I believe the rumor is that before Gaziano and Girling had their own factory, AS made for them). Basically, I think it is just blind luck that these shoes don't really store creases.   Stylistically, I go back and forth with them, but I do worry about how they look worn in.

text:Inspo Album - Statement Sweaters	labels:Is there another name for the type sweater in the 5th image? "Rollneck" just shows a lot of what I would call "turtlenecks".
text:You might try mockneck.  But that style of neck being called roll neck seems specific to that style of Irish sweater.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:For footwear especially, there is a lot of high quality vintage out there for great prices. Lightly used Allen Edmonds, vintage Florshiem, and old defunct shoemakers can be found for sub-$100. A comparable new shoe can't really be found for under $200 at the bare minimum.
text:I totally agree to that, but do you guys have any recommendations for people in EU ? (Both on which brands to look for and where to find them) Because as a guy from France, I've never heard about Allen Edmonds before coming to this sub, and idk if I've ever seen this brand in any store.	labels:> Because as a guy from France,   You've got *way* superior options right there in France. EU more generally also has a huge number of excellent shoemakers at various price points. JM Weston, Corthay, etc.
text:Lots of quality brands doesn't mean the market for secondhand shoes is well developed sadly	labels:That's fair, though I was thinking just searching for those brands but on eBay and other secondary sites like Grailed, etc.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:Well, a lot of the online articles you see about 'classics' are doing that with the goal of 1. selling you stuff 2. telling people who want to look professional/conventionally put together how to do so.  Neither of those seem to fit your needs!  That's fine.  We get a lot of messages in our society about how to fit in and how we have to consume to fit in.  Part of becoming an adult, I think, is being able to tune out the noise of the 'shoulds' and do what pleases you and meets your needs.  In the past I found the idea of a 'classic' wardrobe helpful in the same way I found capsule wardrobes helpful, because I did a ton of thrifting and ended up with a lot of cool things that I liked but no outfits that made me feel really cute or professional enough for my office job.  Having a list of basics was a helpful place to start, but over time I've developed the list of MY basics that work for me!	episode_done:True
text:“I'm all locked down with nowhere to go – but that hasn't killed my lust for fashion”	labels:I have the exact same feelings. I LOVE fashion.

text:Folded and in boxes.  Some say make sure they're sealed, others say using plastic tubs is fine, I don't really think it matters all that much but ended up with some Ikea fabric/nylon stackable containers.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Honestly I totally agree,, its crazy. Even for a meet up I'm always thinking of what yo wear and how to make it unique. But I feel I buy the same things over again and again. Its definitely annoying , especially when hubby wears a t shirt and jeans for 99 percent of social functions and looks amazing!

text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I mainly thrift, but I'm a stickler for trying things on in store and since I don't feel comfortable shopping in person anyways, I've finally sucked it up and tried out Depop.  It's been about 5 years since I last did any online clothing shopping, but I've had pretty good luck with it so far, but I've got a good eye for what shapes are gonna work for me, and I always message the seller about something before I buy.  I probably would have picked up a couple of things for Asos, but they don't do video anymore, so I'll probably try and tackle Poshmark next for some of the more fun pieces on my list.	episode_done:True

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:I moved from Seattle to the Midwest about a year ago and everything on my Christmas list was warm clothes because I kept being told how cold it gets. Thusfar they've had some of the mildest winters in years and NOW I am moving again to England where I have been told the weather is basically the same as Seattle. I definitely second what others have said about waiting until you need something to purchase. I am also glad I kept the clothes that I could wear freely in Seattle but get weird looks for in Nebraska for traversing the UK and Europe (post covid)	episode_done:True

text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:I live in the north of NZ and it is humid! In summer I wear sundresses with chafe preventing shorts underneath, sandals, lots of sunblock and deodorant. The sun is harsh here. I grew up in a dry part of Australia so the humidity is a new thing to me. In winter it's not that cold. I have a raincoat and wear dresses or skirts over tights with a jumper or cardigan. Ankle boots or gum boots, depending on the rain.	episode_done:True
text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:I have a well made, over-sized denim jacket that I can pretty much wear with absolutely everything. I also have an excessive amount of pins that I can use to give it some extra pizazz when I feel like it lol. I'm also the person who gets cold pretty much everywhere, so it's definitely a staple!	episode_done:True
text:Help with 2020 post-COVID scrubs style	labels:I work in memory care, but I love the carhart brand scrubs. They have a lot of nice colors and matching sets, as well as some cute professional printed tops. They have tons of pockets, in the tops and the bottoms. I dont tuck mine so im not sure how that would look, but they are form fitting and not boxy. I size up for the bottoms because I do a lot of bending, but they still look good. They're soft and they last a while, the pockets have reinforced stitching.   When my hair was long I'd wear in a low messy bun (low pony at the back of your neck, hairtie once and a half around, fold the hair up and tie again) but now that my hair is short I do half up in a top-knot	episode_done:True
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ?

text:By tacky so you mean reflective/make the material look similar to latex?  Do you mean they were tight or "painted on"?  You've gotta use descriptors that aren't subjective about the style, things that tell us what you're actually referring to.  You can try to find Ann Demeulemeester, Rick Owens, Saint Laurent, Blackmeans pants on Ebay or Grailed or something.  You might get something between $500-1k.	labels:	episode_done:True

I have been pretty glad that I sorted out my slipper situation already, however.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 26, 2020	labels:I have a thick, fat neck and I am looking for new T shirts to wear mostly as loungewear at home. XL fits me but usually chokes me. XXL gives my neck ample room to breathe and results in a baggy fit.      Given that these t shirts will mostly be loungewear, should I get an XL and alter the neck collar or just get the XXL and alter the length and fit if I desire so at a later date?

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 10, 2020	labels:**Lucky Brand Jeans**  I really like the past few pair of Lucky Brand jeans I have. Fortunately I've lost a good bit of weight in the past 3 years... I'm 5'10, 170lbs... pretty fit. I went from 36x30 to 31/30x30 sizes.  I just bought 2 pair of Lucky jeans different cuts, but same size- 30x30. They fit great in the waist, but are really tight in my calves and quads. I remember this sorta being an issue w/ the last pair I bought a year ago... now that I've lost more weight (but my legs are pretty muscular), I don't think Lucky jeans work for me.  Any recommendations for jeans in the $100 - $150 price? I'm in my mid 40s.
text:are you buying tapered cuts? that might be the problem. Try a slim-straight cut of Luckys or Levi 513 as an alternative. Up the food chain is Unbranded skinny fit which isnt skinny at all or Naked and Famous skinny guy which also  isn't actually a skinny jean but slim-straight.	labels:Yes- I'm buying slim/tailored... the boot cut and "athletic" cut look really baggy.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:I'm 5'11" and also pear shaped with a smaller bust. Definitely try a site like Eshakti where they make garments to your exact measurements! I'm slowly building my wardrobe up with clothes from there (it's not extremely expensive, but not dirt cheap either).   If Old Navy is available to you, they make most of their women's clothes in a tall version with longer inseams, hemlines, and sleeves.   I'm sending you all the good vibes to find clothes that make you feel good. I know how frustrating it is when all your clothes just don't fit right.	episode_done:True
text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:Shoes with a wide toe box and skinny heel that aren't super ugly and aren't hiking/running shoes.  They don't exist.  Every single pair of shoes gives me a ton of blisters except for my Altras but they ugly as fuck.
text:Omg same! Every wide width shoe I look for looks like orthopedic shoes :| I'm considering looking at Torrid because I know they're shoes run a bit wider	labels:Wide width shoes don't work for me either, I just get blisters on my heels instead of on my toes.  They have to be wide in the front and narrow in the back.  I have duck feet...

It could also be just a fun activity to do during lockdown. A fun photo session.	episode_done:True
text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I don't have a capsule wardrobe but perhaps you could get statement pieces in the other colors for things you often accent with. Like accessories (bags, belts, jewellery etc.) Or coats and other outerwear. And leave your more basic items (tees, basic tops, pants etc.) as your most used/appreciated colors?
text:That's a great idea! I tend to wear a lot of more muted colors right now but I miss having bright colors or accessories that I can pair with them. I love a good bright lip too, but with masks right now, it's a no-can-do.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: Why/ when/ how do you cuff jeans?	labels:What does a hard stack and/or pooling mean? I have short legs so I almost always cuff my pants out of necessity
text:Stacking and pooling are what happens when pants are longer than your "proper" inseam length. What ends up happening depends on the width of the pants, as well as the material. Pooling is what you think of when people talk about '90s jeans; wide, long, and "puddling" all over the shoes. Stacking, in contrast, is what happens when the pants are skinny and long, forming folds or "stacks" at the ankle area. Material plays a factor since cotton tends to rumple/wrinkle which favours stacking, whereas stuff like wool drapes, which favours pooling. Think of it as a continuum between narrow stacking and wide pooling.  Also important to note that either can be purposeful decisions to convey a particular vibe, but pooling ends to happen more with people who don't put as much thought into their clothes (i.e. "they'll grow into it" sizing, etc.)	labels:Ahhhhh.. thank you for that	episode_done:True

text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:A well fitted black wool coat in a cut that flatters you. It goes with any outfit. You can dress it up or down, and on early mornings taking the kids to school or late night runs to the store you look like you have your shit together even if your sans bra and wearing 3 day old leggings.

text:What are your go-to basic fall tops? I’m talking long sleeve tees, sweatshirts, turtlenecks etc!	labels:I love Kotn long sleeve tops ($33) and turtlenecks ($34). They're both super comfortable and soft. Great amount of colors.  I also really like the organic cotton long sleeve from Organic Basics ($45). SUPER soft. Like crazy soft. (If you do order one of their long sleeve tops, size up...My first order I got my usual size and wow that was a mistake! Lol) they don't have a great amount of colors unfortunately...  NAADAM is also a great place to get cashmere. They're ethical/sustainable and pretty reasonably priced for cashmere items. I have about 5 of their $75 cashmere sweaters and one that is $125. Totally cute, warm, and comfortable! Lots of colors to choose from as well!  I also have quite a few long sleeve tops from Target...I am trying not to buy A New Day long sleeve fitted tops ($10)..but they're pretty decent for the price. Fun colors also.	episode_done:True

text:What pieces would you love "backups" of?	labels:I have a pair of cognac-colored leather Sperry Topsider boat shoes that I've kept around for YEARS -- they've carried me through an unexpected "hike" in Torrey Pines State Park in sand to literally being on a boat in Florida. The soles are starting to go, so I've looked for a replacement pair but they don't make mine anymore -- the leather on my older pair was richer in color & more substantial, and the style/design of it was more classic. I'd kill to stumble upon a "new" pair somewhere but c'est la vie...
text:Oh man - you have got to share pics!  I had a pair of Sperry's I \*loved\* for a long time. They were so much more comfortable than pointy ballet flats that apply so much pressure on your heel. Can we bring them back please?	labels:I had a pair that I left out on the deck through a Chicago winter and after a quick wipe down and some oil looked as good as new. Loved those shoes.	episode_done:True

Enough of that this time around and the trend will cycle to something else.  signed,  someone who dealt with many, many ripped jean legs.

text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I've worn glasses since I was 18 mos old. So its not so much of a style thing as an adaptive device type thing. But I do have the luxury (low prescription) of whatever type of frames I want to have, so that's nice. I dont think about how they work with my clothing at all, more so how they work with my facial structure.  I also will not personally order any glasses online. My two eyes have significantly different prescriptions and I have a slight lazy eye, so I dont trust them to get the pupillary distance correct. I've had bad experiences before with online services so I stick to my optometrist.  Also, I only ever have one pair of glasses because I get headaches when I switch them. So def not fashiony lol
text:Are you me? I've worn glasses since I was 3 years old, only because they caught my lazy eye late. I have severe astigmatism in my lazy eye, which has a farsighted (positive) prescription and my other eye has a slight nearsighted (negative) prescription. Both powers are relatively low but because of how complicated my prescription is, I always go to the optometrist. Because of that, my glasses are pretty expensive, so I end up getting "neutrals" that go with everything- right now I have big black wire frames with a slight cat eye, and am thinking of getting a pair of circular wire frames when I visit the optometrist next week.	labels:My situation is pretty similar to yours. I have severe astigmatism on my lazy eye and also have mild nearsightness on both eyes. Glasses are expensive af for me so I usually wear boring ones due to school rules and that they match with everything.	episode_done:True
text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:I take one day (like Halloween or some other day where costumes are acceptable) to try out some ridiculously out-there style and see what people thought... and get used to drawing stares. I found out that I really like certain influences in my outfits, and that others are just entirely too bold for me.	episode_done:True
text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:If your mom gave you tons of style advice, you would be sitting here making a post about your mom ruining your creativity and giving you self-esteem issues.   Teach fashion to your kids if you feel like it, but don't be surprised if your daughter tells you to fuck off with your eyebrow plucking nonsense or spends her teenage years giggling about your style with her friends or doing the exact opposite of whatever hair advice you give her. Kids are ruthless.	episode_done:True
text:Street style	labels:I have sort of a range depending on what I am doing, but generally I do a lot of really easy dresses, easy skirts, tank tops, etc. By this I mean cotton stuff you can find on Asos. I don't really like jeans so for me a lot of upleveled leggings so not the traditional cotton but other fabrics, slim jogger style pants, etc.	episode_done:True

text:What am I supposed to do with my head post-chemo?	labels:I have straight hair. It sucks ahahah. I have tried to give it a proper form for years until one day I got exasperated and shaved it. I'm not going back. I feel much better about my appearance now. People are usually afraid they'll look like nazis with very short hair but I haven't seen anyone being intimidated by my haircut yet ahahah	episode_done:True
text:Men’s clothing	labels:In general, men's clothing is cut pretty boxy, as opposed to more form fitting cuts in women's suits, dress shirts, etc. If you have really any kind of curves, size based on hips, and for pants, make sure the leg holes are wide enough (I often find men's jeans that are perfect in the waist and I get stuck in the legs). As for suits, you can most likely measure yourself and go off of that and get it tailored, but you'll probably have the best luck looking at suits for boys/young teens, unless you have rather broad shoulders. For things that are less tailored, I usually go down one letter size. I usually wear a large in women's shirts, so usually for t shirts and sometimes for pants (measurements will be your best friend!!) I go for a medium.	episode_done:True
text:Dress Sneakers Are Alarmingly Popular	labels:Dress sneakers are great and I'm not sure i understand the hate. Sure don't wear the with a full suit, but, pairing them with the right thing makes a casual-formal look feel purposeful. Wearing dress shoes for a semi casual look almost takes always takes away the casual aspect. For mens fashion advice this seems to be more of a hit on an item of clothing, instead of how to make that item work.	episode_done:True

Age: 36  Nationality: United States  Shoes/boots: 15  Tops: 53  Dresses/skirts: 13  Pants: 10  Outerwear: 9  Sweaters/sweatshirts: 15  Belts: 4  Purses: 7  total: 126  Doesn't include pjs (I have bought fancy pjs in quarantine), a capsule of workwear that includes branded shirts and hiking boots, underpinnings, and 5 day's worth of workout gear.	episode_done:True
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:I would buy factory defect denim pants, sew giant inserts into them to make them super wide legged, and add a ton of pockets. Then I'd spray paint designs on them and pair them with a boys graphic tee (functionally a tight crop top with ninja turtles or spongebob or something on it) and layer 2-3 hoodies over it. But I was a weird teenager.	episode_done:True

They're not designed but more mall brands like Jcrew, AllSaints, Diesel and Frank and Oak.   &#x200B;  I don't expect much maybe like 10-20 per piece. Is it worth the effort? i have them listed on facebook marketplace
text:I've been using Vinted to sell items. I'm not sure if it's only a European thing to use Vinted but you could check it out. Everything that I've been listing has been sold and the procedure is really simple. I highly recommend it if it's common in your country.	labels:	episode_done:True

I got into bandanas to keep my medium-long hair (20M) somewhat out of my eyes. Up until now I only got the standard bandanas with the standard pattern, do you have any recommendations on good brand that are based in Europe so I don't have to ship them from America (even tho some bexar goods bandanas are so fricckin cool)? Also, I have brown hair and brown/green-ish eyes, any suggestion on what color fits best?
text:A Piece of Chic   Maharishi   Cinabre (expensive)   Thrift stores/ebay/etsy/etc	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:No uncomfortable clothing or shoes such as tightness especially on the shoulders, waist, hips, knees and feet, or scratchy, unbreathable fabric. Definitely no shoes that don't feel secure or with very low heels.  No unforgiving materials on a bloaty body or that amplifies a bad posture like thin, clingy stretchy cotton or wool. Draping is really important for an outfit to work and I only recently got to know about it.  No turtlenecks and constricted collars, my upper body is not long and lean enough for them.  No too delicate clothing that needs to be dry cleaned ie. fur, leather, sequins. Low quality fabric goes straight to ignore, and durable clothing gets higher points even if not as stylish.	episode_done:True

text:Have your clothing purchases dramatically dropped now that we can't go anywhere?	labels:I live in Canada, so not the worst, but in the second worst hit province, so our restrictions just got tightened significantly.  I definitely bought less during my covid unemployment for obvious reasons (ie no money).   I wouldnt say I buy less now that I've gotten a new job but im buying differently. Different athletic gear as I've started running since I cant play volleyball for fitness. I finally fucking found jeans that fit as close to perfectly as I'm gonna get and now I want to buy every colour to replace my badly fitting jean wardrobe. I'm not buying any biz caz stuff as it's indefinite work from home at the moment.	episode_done:True

text:What are some unexpected surprises you've found with certain clothing brands that are known for other things?	labels:J.Crew Wallace and Barnes line. Originally thinking J.Crew was more for preppy and business causal lines, but their Wallace and Barnes line is excellent quality for the workwear/Americana style.
text:I'll check it out. Love J. Crew	labels:	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:I think the advice for "what to wear for job interviews" has changed a *lot* since the sub started. Increasingly suits aren't even a good idea in a lot of industries and you'll be over dressed.  Further, the advice from before was often to get "one good suit" and to spend a lot of money at Suit Supply or similar.   I think for a lot of people, suits will be so infrequently needed that spending $400 on a suit is most likely over kill. Especially if you're a student and on a budget.  Read the guides on how a suit should fit, a lot of that hasn't changed too much. Then go somewhere where you can try the garments on in person (writing this for if/when COVID ends) and go from there. I find it weird to recommend to beginners to try and order a suit online without seeing how the garment fits on you first or spending more than around $200 if it's something you'll need maybe twice a year for the career fairs.  Get something in a basic navy or charcoal, brown dress shoes, a white dress shirt, and a basic grenadine tie to go with it. Easy.
text:Anecdote: I've gone to all of my job interviews wearing a t-shirt, jeans, and if it's "winter", a hoodie (and for most of them, flip-flops), and always gotten an offer. This is a) for software jobs in small companies in California and b) not what I recommend, really, but there are two points to it. The first is that you need to pay attention to your industry *and* locale *and* specific company. The second is that in general, I think it's better for someone to wear the clothes they are comfortable in as long as it's within an order or two of what's expected, rather than something that's "right" but further stresses them out in an already stressful situation; when you're relaxed you perform much better.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 03, 2021	labels:Not a question, just a rant.  I do not enjoy watching "real men real style" because honestly, he's just not entertaining, nor is he good looking.  But guess what?  We need someone like that, because that's the average guy.  Not very entertaining, not particularly attractive.  That is what makes people average.  He's not in great shape, so his clothing/dressing advice might be helpful.  Compared to Jose Zuniga and Alex Costa who are way more entertaining... but honestly perfect looking.  Alex and Jose giving date advice kind of fall on dear ears, cause look at them!  But Antonio from Real Men Real Style?  If he can get a date, he must know something!
text:i saw his videos before, he seems to go over alot of topics but doesnt seem to be too in depth with them. For example for colognes you're better off with someone who are making colognes videos and same with fashion. I enjoy one dapper street alot for fashion and gents scents for perfumes	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your go-to basic fall tops? I’m talking long sleeve tees, sweatshirts, turtlenecks etc!	labels:Honestly Target men's sweaters are where it's at for me. They're light and comfy, have a slight v-neck so I don't feel like I'm suffocating, and they come in nice colors and patterns for like $20.
text:I feel like women's sweaters and long sleeves are always either a tight crew neck or a super low plunge v neck.  I need to check these out at target.	labels:Those tight crew necks kill me, I tug at them all day because I hate things touching my neck. Merona from way back when is pretty prominent at thrift stores around me, I got a whole pile of them a few years ago for $1-2 a piece.
text:Oh same!  Turtlenecks are basically torture devices.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I know “fashion” but people of minorities are always forced to try better. Some Insights	labels:So true. I went to a networking event with my partner last year and there were a lot of young professionals there. I was talking to this younger Asian guy when an older Asian guy joined us. No issue at first but before he left he told the younger Asian guy to get a shorter haircut and change his glasses so he looks less FOB. To me, the younger Asian guy looked and dressed more professional than the older guy and did not act any different than anyone else. The younger Asian guy and I chatted about it after and he said it is sometimes the stereotype of his own people that keep them back.	episode_done:True
text:What socks do you guys wear? and some advice on socks please?	labels:I only wear Bombas socks (calf, ankle, and no show).	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:I'm a full fledged Maxxnista but I haven't had much luck with clothing there.  It's been very hit or miss lately (and 2020 styles are NOT flattering on me AT ALL).    Their beauty section is another story...  That's a major weakness of mine and I just recently stocked up on some shampoo and conditioner in anticipation of another lockdown.
text:Yass I get such nice skincare from there. Their beauty section is great	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are the Recurring Motifs, Symbols, or Images in your Style?	labels:Florals and horizontal stripes, and I'm a big animation nerd so I'm one of those people with a lot of licensed t-shirts (and other clothing) with cartoon characters on them. I especially love when I find stuff that's more subtle references--Steven's shirt from Steven Universe (red shirt with a yellow star), a floral print with a Disney character sprinkled into the mix, a quote or song lyric, etc. Sometimes I branch out to other silly prints or quirky shirts, too--my favorite shirt has a picture of Galileo on it and underneath it in a fancy font is the text "Thunderbolts and lightning, very very frightening me - Galileo"	episode_done:True

text:I think you should add more 'basic' colors before adding on the more bold colors.  Things like black, beige, cream. Then you can mix and match these basics and add a bold color touch to it as needed	labels:I'll keep it in mind, thanks	episode_done:True
text:Formula for a put together outfit that works for most aesthetics	labels:I'm definitely usually in the less than 6 zone, because I consider myself a safe dresser that loves their solid colors... I know I like the effortless, simple look but I always feel like I'm not quite there, this is probably why. Maybe I will start trying to hit the 6!	episode_done:True
text:What's on your 2021 fashion wishlist?	labels:Literally any maternity clothes that don't look extremely fugly and sad.

text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:I used to go to 30s themed murder mystery weekends, so would buy anything that fit with that so I had good kit for the weekend, and end up wearing it in my day to day life.  I have more tweed calf length skirts than most women could wish for.  Having said that, I always lean more towards medieval and have things I would love to wear but really can't without looking like a bit of a lunatic.  Floorlength linen layers for the absolute win.	episode_done:True

text:How to find non-custom tailored clothing for short men (under 5')	labels:The 5'2 stuff should work, might need some hemming. Shouldn't be super hard though.  Alot of department stores have free or cheap basic alterations on full price stuff(uniqlo also springs to mind)   When you get a bit more of a budget you can also opt for some made to measure stuff. Less can often be more in a wardrobe just get a shirt or pants here and there and rotate out

text:What are your go-to, everyday shoes?	labels:Sanuk flip flops or Teva combat boots	episode_done:True
text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:I wouldn't, but only because I think that when you're describing your style, you're aiming to give other people an idea of what you actually wear, day to day, as concisely as possible.  If even your basic looks have alternative elements, it might make sense, otherwise there's nothing wrong with "basic, occasionally grunge-y."  That said, you don't only have to stick to one style, and it's not as though it's not part of you because you're not wearing it all the time.	episode_done:True
text:I love all the new leather clothes this fall, what have you bought?	labels:I bought a large boys leather jacket at the thrift store for $9. It is very much a men's jacket and is not necessarily "flattering," I don't think it really goes with anything I have too much, and I'm probably not butch enough to "pull it off" but by golly I love it, someone else can have that jacket only when I pass out of this world!  I also bought some super cute pleather leggings, I think from Kohl's! I'm trying to figure out the best way to style them, but I haven't been in too much of a rush to figure that out since I'm not exactly going anywhere

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I was 24, my then fiance (now husband) bought me a Chanel bag to congratulate me on achieving a major life milestone. It's a beige calfskin, classic double flap with the interlocking C's and gold hardware. I use it on every suitable special occasion. It's been more than a decade and is still in damn good condition, I'll probably hand it down to one of my daughters.  Then when I got married, my parents very generously surprised me with a Chanel bag as well. It's the same handbag style, just a size larger and black with silver hardware. Still in great shape, and will probably also be handed down to my girls.   Honestly I don't feel the urge to acquire more / other high end bags, though I certaintly wouldn't object if they were gifted to me!	episode_done:True
text:Using Pinterest to Help Find Your Style (or: how to tell Pinterest it is no longer 2012)	labels:These are really good points, I think I was doing some of them because I found out that Pinterest was helping me learn more about some designers and have them "saved" in my boards.  What I do is I have styling boards for seasons right now they are "autumn-winter" and "spring-summer" but I'm going to separate them because where I live summer is its own season with very extreme temperatures. I have a subcategory in the boards for colour, so I can pin outfits and inspiration which have the colours I'm looking for even if it isn't necessarily the shape or garment I like.  I also have another more inspirational but I don't use it that often, maybe for "saving" haute couture or really fancy designs.  What I've been doing recently is editing my boards because I found a lot of pins I don't like anymore. I'm trying to improve my wardrobe and tune my style and I revisit them often, so editing makes a lot of sense for me.	episode_done:True

text:I tried wearing only 10 clothes for 10 days! Here are all my outfits	labels:Having to wear medical scrubs daily will allow all of those extra pounds to go unnoticed! Regular jeans are not forgiving at all and will let you know quickly what the real deal is.	episode_done:True
text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I was at a thrift store the other day and I found a pair of jeans that actually fit me. They were $30 used because there were from a nicer brand but gosh-darn-it, I bought them anyway because they just fit so nice!
text:Yup!  A couple of weeks ago I got a great pair of jeans (ok they are a tiny bit big) in a charity shop.  Nothing fancy, just M&S, but PLAIN (not ripped/sequined/ragged/holey/whiskered - you get the idea!), dark jeans with decent pockets!  Didn't NEED them, I have two other jeans and three green (not kelly/neon, just sage?olive?) trousers in current rotation, but hey that's a find!  I guess we normal-jean-ladies just normally wear our jeans to death!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:Corsets and stays. I want some so badly.  Wear with first a slip, then the corset over it, and then a blouse and midi skirt or dress pants
text:This comment has been overwritten	labels:Omg my dreams have come true.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:I follow color, texture, pattern! Too much of either one feels wrong, except for color. I think generally people are too fearful of color.	episode_done:True
text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "A Primer on Materials"	labels:I think it'd be worth mentioning the difference between the material and the construction/weave because it's easy to mix things up.   Like when people say something is smooth because it's silk, but really, it's smooth because it's satin. Just like how raw silk noil isn't smooth even though it's silk.
text:I think some information on the different weaves and varieties of fabric and what materials they can be made out of would be super useful. I agree that most people tend to equate silk with materials like satin or charmeuse when silks like noil or dupioni aren't as smooth or shiny. Also, I think a discussion on fabric grain and concepts like twill and other weaves would be helpful for people hoping to avoid clothing with mismatched grain that doesn't sit or wash right. Grain is super important to how the material behaves and it's something a lot of clothing manufacturers are sloppy about.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:I had bright blue Coraline hair for around 4 years (with a few months of pink or lavender intervals in that time) and it did actually change how I dressed.   I mostly wear black, with some grey and camel, but until I had blue hair I hadn't realized how many of my office tops were blue or blue patterns. I didn't like mixing the blue tones, so I ended up passing over all my blue clothes until I had pink or lavender hair again.  In my anecdotal experience, I felt like light pink went with nearly everything, but blue wasn't hard to fit into my (pretty neutral) style.

text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process? What would you prioritize?	labels:High end winter coat and jackets  Good quality jeans that will last more than a year (maybe raw denim?)  High quality sweaters, some super soft and cashmere, some irish wool. (I have an irish wool thrift store sweater that's better than a coat sometimes).	episode_done:True
text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:I don't think you should actively search for an aesthetic. Buy what you like, if you notice you gravitate twards certain styles go with it but don't force it upon yourself.	episode_done:True
text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:That's amazing! Im soo similar and my 2021 resolution is to do this too, I buy wayy to much to make me feel better and I love buying clothes but I honestly know I dont need them. So roll on 2021 to finally create a style	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else hate literally everything they put on?	labels:It's not you, women's clothes are the worst. Unless you shell out $$$$ for quality pieces you're gonna have a bad time. My problem was not trying on an outfit all together at the store. "This skirt fits" and then later "This shirt matches cute and fits" but I'd never try them at the same time, and then I put it on at home and my waist line is all squirly or cuts off my body, or shirt too square for the skirt..:etc. Also, Tailors are cheaper than you think if you buy something $$$$. Lastly, maternity jeans (not prego) have the most fab waistline for a smooth top. No zippers, bulging buttons, just totally smooth. My 2 cents. Ok one more, you like your body, high wasted belts over shirts or dresses are your friiiiiieeeeeeeend.
text:omg omg yes!!!! I need to buy full outfits not just one piece. The shirt won't tuck in right or the pants gape a bit. I've gotten a few things tailored and I'm happy to shell out for it tbh, but my issue is mostly tops and t-shirts, and I feel like I can't get those tailors. I'm going to go to the outlet mall soon and just invest tbh. I got a new job so I can afford it, and I'm sick of feeling like shit.   Women's clothes really are the worst tho omg!!!! It's like they just cut out a square	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How Carhartt A Billion-Dollar Brand	labels:I'm never not going to think of a farmer first. The farmer clique at my high school was literally known as the Carhartt Mafia. Every single one of them had the ubiquitous light brown duck canvas jacket.
text:I feel that, that's what all the redneck boys in high school wore	labels:I wore one in high school that had huge "WR"s written all over it in sharpie. My dad was in work release in the county jail and they scribbled that on all of the carhartts to dissuade people from stealing them. It was a good ass jacket, warm enough for Michigan winter, and I just made up some dumb shit whenever someone asked about the sharpie.  Oddly enough I just got the carhartt Michigan chore coat today.	episode_done:True
text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:Admittedly I don't know if this thing was ever actually back in fashion, but durning the summer months, I tend to wear a Fanny pack around as my purse. I came to realize 2 years ago now, that at least in the summer, I like being able to be hands free as much as possible, having a bag I can just clip around my waist is where it's at. The one I have is galaxy pattern and I love it. I also plan on getting a solid colour one of some sort. Probably gonna get a floral one too, or some other patterns. I just make it a part of the overall look and it works. Winter I use a real purse, but summer it's all about the fanny pack.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 04, 2021	labels:Haven't been doing anything with clothing recently, mainly been focused on cooking and getting my head straight. How have y'all been?
text:What have you been cooking?	labels:Pretty much exclusively Italian food, I've made a bunch of soup, pasta, and risotto. Probably my favorite was Pasta e Fagioli, although the beans took so so long to cook (I soaked them but they still had to cook for close to 3 hours). I've got attempt #2 of semolina pasta about to go in the pasta machine in about an hour.
text:Salt in the cooking water can dramatically increase the time it takes dried beans to cook. Maybe that contributed?	labels:Almost definitely. The recipe I was using said that an overnight soak and 40 minutes of cooking them in the broth would make them soft enough, but it ended up being way off.

A friend of mine has on several occasions mentioned an interest in buying a pair of suspenders so I thought about getting a pair as a Christmas gift. I've done some research and found a local company that makes them in wool. All I really am stuck on is in which colour I should get them in.   He usually wears a navy suit with a white shirt and brown shoes, I've just assumed the suspenders should be navy as well then but maybe I am wrong - what is the etiquette when it comes to suspenders?
text:Suspenders are underwear. Under no circumstances should they be seen. Mine are black, but literally all colors are the same.  Wool suspenders sound weird. Better for them to have elastic.	labels:Thank you, that does make sense!

text:Model poses while online shopping	labels:They do that when the fit if the garment is inferior. It is intentional.  Beware items that have this kind of photography, because most of the time it means the garment has bad construction, weird seam placement, or unfortunate details.  Well constructed items are not shot in this manner. Brands want to show off their excellent construction. It is known.  Hope that helps!
text:Yup. There are so many things I've seen on the Zara website that are photographed in that highly editorial style that have intrigued me enough to seek them out in-store, only to realize upon trying them on how badly made and ill-fitting they are in reality.   Well-made, cool clothes look great without crazy poses. There's a reason why runway models (for the most part) just walk and do a rather neutral pose at the end- because the clothes and construction are what's being highlighted.	labels:	episode_done:True

It was a simple white ballgown, but the skirt had swarovski crystals on it, with the fabric swirled around each one. I do not know \*why\* I have such a vivid memory of this one in particular, but it is the only piece I remember from the many fashion shows I watched on there back then.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 17, 2021	labels:So in few months I will be finishing bachelor's thesis and possibly attending job interviews. I thought that I could purchase a proper suit jacket/blazer. In my wardrobe I have chinos for summer and moleskin/textured wool for colder months. Should I avoid worsted wools so my navy blazer would look like orphaned suit jacket? Is flannel blazer a safe bet?
text:The standard navy blazer is hopsack.  If you're doing interviews you'll probably want a worsted suit, though.	labels:Hopsack can be worsted. Hopsack is a weave -- a basket weave. It's very open and kind of textured, but not *bad* for a business suit.  "Worsted" means that the threads that make up that weave were treated and twisted up in a way that makes them harder, but stronger and sleeker and less fuzzy than threads of "woolen" wools.  I wear a flap-pocket blazer in a worsted wool with a twill weave. It has suit-like features, but it functions just fine as a blazer -- nobody is that picky about making sure your blazers are casual enough to be blazers.  Depending on OP's industry and priorities, he could go with a hopsack twill, or other weave, should probably go worsted either way, and could go flap or patch pockets.

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I have gone through a hellish 2020 - I moved across the country, separated/am in the middle of a divorce, quit drinking alcohol (I'm sober six months!), didn't get the promotion I wanted (stupidly my fault, was too depressed/distracted to apply), never mind COVID and all that comes with that.  I am trying to be kind to myself despite it all, and I am saving for my first luxury designer bag! I have owned mid-tier level bags like Coach, Dooney and Bourke, etc. but I think my first real luxury bag will be the Louis Vuitton Speedy 30 (classic). I'm still deciding if I will give it to myself as a Christmas present :) I'm in my late twenties and I think it is a classic enough style that I will still like it even as I get older. I also like that it can be dressed up or down - I've seen pictures of people wearing it with dresses and heels, as well as with sweats and a tee-shirt, and it looks good either way. Some people even bring it to work!

text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:The biggest boon for me recently was having someone on my Buy Nothing group post they had a situation where a person was starting from scratch, clothing wise.  (Had just left an unsafe situation with nothing, IIRC.)  Not only did i just donate the entire bag i had already prepared, but i went through my closet again with a much more intense eye.  With a specific recipient already chosen, it was so much easier to look at things i'd bought but never had the courage to wear and just...let it go.  Goodwill i don't really picture it really helping a unique individual, but in this case i could be both more brutal with myself and more generous with my give.

text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:Comfort is my top priority when it comes to fashion. I do have some sensory issues, so I wear dresses or skirts almost all of the time because I find the lack of restriction on my legs much more physically comfortable and living in a hot climate, much cooler.   In the past, I sometimes found it hard to figure out what to wear for casual occasions without appearing overdressed. Now, when I want to go for more casual looks or for loungewear I go for one of my casual sundresses or t-shirt dresses that can be paired with sandals. Or I will pair a band t-shirt with a skirt and sneakers to express more personality.  When wearing a dress/skirt would be impractical I end up reaching for shorts. I opt for something in a relatively soft material and that is not overly tight fitting.	episode_done:True

text:Mayhem at Uniqlo in Japan as customers fight to grab the Jil Sander collection	labels:Can someone explain the hype behind J Sander's collab to me? I was just at a Canadian store with full stock of this stuff and the entire collection just looked like your typical Uniqlo-feeling pieces except oversized.
text:It's the name. A lot of young people only heard whispers of how great the first collaboration was over a decade ago (it really wasn't anything special) And so this, for many, was an opportunity they might not get for who knows how long, if ever again.   Like Black Friday lines, if you stayed up all night or got prepared hours before waiting, you're likely going to commit to buying something, if anything from the collaboration.	labels:The strange thing about it is that Jil Sander's work requires high quality fabric to really shine. Her work is so minimalist it relies completely on cut and fabric. The Uniqlo collaboration can recreate the cut, but not the fabric. I haven't seen the stuff in person, but I'm sure there would be a big difference if you held it next to Jil Sander's mainline work from 16 years ago. This isn't a new criticism; it's probably the issue every article ever written on designer x fast fashion collaborations has in common. But unlike, say Roberto Cavalli x H&M which had some interesting prints, +J is just cut.   But to be fair, that's probably enough to completely set it apart from anything even twice the price. The pattern-making you get from Jil Sander is just too expensive to employ anywhere except luxury labels. Given the requests you see in inspiration albums with slightly loose-fitting or oversized clothes on this sub, people are definitely interested even without the luxe fabric.
text:> The Uniqlo collaboration can recreate the cut, but not the fabric.  This is one of the main issue with Zara usually. They copy/get inspiration from great design, but the final look, even on promo shoot, look cheap because the materials are not great.	labels:as well as the fact that they are fast fashion and all the environmental/ethical problems that might entail

I was heading to town to resupply and I got a hitch from a Gila County cattleman in an old F-150. Handsom young guy, quiet but kind as can be. He was wearing old 501s and a shearling bomber over a tshirt that had once been white. His sandy hair matched the undyed wool and the leather matched his dusty boots. It was the most natural, most fitting, least pretentious use of a shearling jacket outside of being in the ball turret on a Flying Fortress. And *even he* just barely pulled it off. Because shearling is the peacock-feathers of Americana.

Shit if we're gonna give Thom Browne credit for the short suit that's a massive formality clash.  Not saying that there aren't reasons to critiques sneaker/dress shoe hybrids but if you're gonna say that individual shoes are somehow objectively bad and *especially* if you're gonna say that an entire category (subgenre?) of shoes is irredeemable then I expect a better reason than "formality clashes are bad"  Also separate but related hot take:  Caring about the rules of formality is at worst barely-coated elitism and at best it's nerd shit and should be ignored

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:I like to think about sustainability is a few ways:  1. Buy nothing and use what you have, mend it and use it till it can no longer be used, and treat it with care 2. Buy something that is used or second hand 3. Buy something made sustainably 4. Buy any some thing from a less sustainable source  So sure, it is a good idea to source better when you can. But in reality a lot of the sustainability  conversation is still about consuming more. And that in itself isn't really sustainable. We should really be talking more about consumption. And after that no matter what you bring in the door, use it, keep using it, and use it till it can be used no more.  Part of the problem we have now is that people are both getting more stuff, they aren't mending the stuff they have, and when they get rid of stuff it is still perfectly usable. Clothing is super hard to recycle and repurpose (blends in particular).	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I think for people who engage actively in fashion (whether it's participating in a fashion-focused community like MFA or a penchant for (window) shopping - especially in trendy neighborhoods), it is extremely difficult to not buy clothes for a year because the temptation and stimuli are constantly bombarding your willpower. Rather than going cold turkey on the addiction, the goal is to be conscious of each purchase. It really helps to sleep on a potential purchase for a day or two and ask yourself if you'll really love or wear the item enough.  Buying secondhand is a different matter. I think most people hold a stigma against buying secondhand for various reasons: dirty/unknown source, unreliable/inability to return, the allure of new stuff, etc. It really just takes giving it a try and realizing that you can get new or near new stuff for a fraction of the price, while simultaneously helping the world with less manufacturing and sustainability.

text:Inspo Album - Statement Sweaters	labels:Lovely and inspiring album, OP. And I especially appreciate you listing prices. But that's also the problem, at least for me.   The statement all these statement sweaters seem to making is, "I pay more for sweaters than some people pay for cars."   The "goodwill chic" sweater is over a thousand dollars. Goodwill? Srsly?  Do people *really* pay this much for sweaters? How do they also pay their rent? Put kids through college? Save for retirement? I make over $200K a year, and I honestly don't get how you can even consider a purchase like this. Much as I love some of these styles.
text:I buy Inis Meain, 300+ euros a pop, because they are locally made, I'm from the west of Ireland. They are produced off the coast near where I grew up. I treasure them and take a genuine joy any time I wear them. They represent an aesthetic of Ireland that's dying out but is profoundly nostalgic for me.

text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:yes, blacktailor, but in combination with the influencer trap, I saw their cargo pants for a while, and an influencers discount tempted me to go for them. They arent bad perse, but they ain't that good either and now anything that is promoted by an influencer, I take with a grain of salt.  Most of the advertisers are dropshippers, which isnt wrong in itself, but it has meant that vendors A, B, and C are shipping from the same stockists so when ones bad, the whole batch is more or less likely the exact same.  The delivery time is about a month, when lucky, and the quality of materials is average. However, the quality of detail isnt that great, so if it's something with a combination of materials or particular sew and maybe even iconography, I would advise one to consider that those aspects of the garment.  To get details of what type of brand they are, I would also recommend browsing the website for info regarding the company, when they have addresses is based in china, they're quite likely to be dropshippers, if they're based in the US, less so, but still likely	episode_done:True

text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:I wouldn't say I inherently hate the brand but I think Champion is an example of a brand that exploded a few years back/to now basically all because some celebrities or whoever wore it- and everyone who wears it now is most likely a ding dong hypebeast type or the VSCO type girl or whatever. Like I'm old enough to remember it being bottom tier Wal Mart level shit you'd get borderline made fun of for wearing- but now all of the sudden it's enjoying this moment. So it's just that perceived inauthenticity and collective pivot in peoples' minds to a fashion name to people rather than just athletic apparel that irks me somehow.  However though, the Todd Snyder Champion stuff is PHENOMENAL- it's not the mainline stuff. You don't see any of those assholes rocking that.

Definitely wouldn't recommend it as one of your first few, one of the reasons why navy and brown are so recommended as sport jacket colours is because they're not as noticeable when you wear them again.

Right now I'm just wearing black leggings and a white camisole which will go *under" my costume...  So basically I'm wearing ghost underwear for all of eternity. Great.  I probably died braving the Halloween day traffic around Spirit Halloween on the hunt for a cool lace cape.   Definitely haunting my boyfriend because he's been ignoring me all day.	episode_done:True
text:What are your go-to, everyday shoes?	labels:I have mustard yellow Ecco Sneakers that are super comfortable, and also black suede sneakers from Mephisto that I love. I walk a lot and don't have great feet so shoes are super important to me! Can't wait to get my hands on another pair.	episode_done:True

text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:Colorful skirts are good options to try out. I also have a mostly neutral wardrobe, but I discovered that I can pair basic white shirts with a more colorful skirt.  It looks fun, but still "safe" because I don't have to worry about what color suits my skin tone.	episode_done:True

I was able to get a couple pairs of chinos for Black Friday, and they fit me very well. Now I want to buy some more stuff, but their inventory seems to be running low.

text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:If you need to wear dress pants for work in the winter but it gets hella cold, size up your pants and wear warm leggings underneath. Been doing this for a few years and it really helps with that biting cold on my legs.	episode_done:True
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Sometimes I feel like the only woman alive who won't wear jumpsuits/rompers. Every single one I've tried on either gives me massive cameltoe or makes me look like a giant toddler. Something about the way my body is built I guess, I've just given up on them.   Similarly, mules and slides. As someone with super high arches, trying to walk in those things is like giving my heels a constant series of high fives. They're so cute but sadly just not meant for me.

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:I was in middle and high school in South Carolina. We wore flare jeans that drug on the ground and gave us all muffin tops, t shirts from your flavor of mall store (Abercrombie for the preps and Hot topic for the goths) oversized skateshoes, rainbow flip flops or potato shoes(the clog form of birkenstocks) and the same damn hoodie every day. If you were a student you had a jansport book bag and if you were a girl you had a purse, either a Dooney and Bourke(sp?) Coach, Vera Bradley, or a "Louis Vuitton" speedy bought for $20 at a flea market
text:Do you remember those purses that were like...idk...grocery bags but with sequins? Big sequins too, they made a very specific sound when you walked with one.	labels:yes a very soft and gentle jingle kind of noise, swishy. I can hear whispers of it in my memory	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else hate literally everything they put on?	labels:The only time I've ever felt like crap in my clothes was when they didn't fit me.  I've always straddled sizes and gained just enough weight/muscle that nothing on the smaller end fit me...which I didn't even realize until I got fed up and did the wardrobe overhaul thing.  For me, rebuilding my closet was as just as much about learning terminology and curating online as it was physically trying things on a ton of random things, figuring out what I liked on my body, and buying that, instead of actually subscribing to a particular style.  For you, it may not be that you're going to try something on and think it looks great on your body, but that you compare how you look in a couple versions of the same things and stick with what you think your body looks best in.  That said, if you're spending all this time on clothing and not finding any joy in it, it might be time to look into doing something a capsule wardrobe and spending your money on something you actually like.

But I'm not sure which kind of flannel to get or how to wear it.   I feel like some colors won't go with my skin tone (think light brown). So I was hoping the experts here could tell me which kind of flannel would go best.   And it's winter so I'd want a jacket (ish) to be able to wear it during 3/4 seasons. I don't know how to actually wear it. Ig the obvious answer is flannel over a plain color hoodie or shirt with black or navy jeans. Are there any creative and more fashionable ways to construct a fit with a flannel jacket?	episode_done:True

text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:I feel like dressing in the winter is so difficult (although the clothes are so much cuter/look better on me lol) because it'll be like 20F outside and 110F inside, and then a balmy 80F on the metro (crammed with smelly people pre-covid). so I usually wear a pretty thick coat (I got a really nice one on LL Bean last winter) and light layers underneath - J Crew tissue turtlenecks are my staples, Docs, and a scarf.  I try not to leave my apt during the summer haha...still trying to figure out cute clothes that won't make me feel/look miserable
text:I had this problem at my last job when I took public transit to work. I finally just got into the habit of taking off my puffy coat once I got into the subway station and holding it on the train. I'm sure it made me take up like 10% more room, and it was harder to keep my hands free, but it was worth it to not be a puddle of sweat by the time I got to work.	labels:I swear this is why more people pass out on the T in the winter (or so it seems to me). You're wrapped up like a burrito and get on the train and then the heat is blasting and you start sweating. What a mess.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:I think suits are something that have a very low point of return for a lot of guys asking questions and often get misadvised. I often see a guy asking for a first suit to wear to a job interview where it'll be a 1-3x a year garment and people are recommending brooks brothers, suit supply, and condemning anything that has any polyester content or is fused.    If you are wearing a suit 15 times in 10 years like a lot of guys with more casual jobs are a $150 macys or JCF suit with some tailoring in a classic color is a way better buy than a $499 brooks brothers suit.  They are bloth going to be outdated before they wear out, so durability is a nonfactor to most occasional wearers.  If you aren't the type of guy who want's to own suits a polyester lining is going to be indiscernible from a more breathable one.    &#x200B;  The importance of suit quality is vastly overstated as it relates to the average very occasional wearer.
text:Buy nice or buy twice. In high school and college - I purchased a cheap tuxedo for concert performances. I probably used it 10-15 times per school year. It was a wool/polyester mix that felt terrible every time I wore it. A few years ago I upgraded my black tie rig (though I rarely use it) and wish I had never bothered suffering through that original setup. The same thing has happened with a few Jcrew/Macy's tier suits/blazers that are wool/polyester mix, worn a few times, and are now replaced with stuff from Spier/SuitSupply tier or higher.	labels:Yeah wearing something 10-15x a year is way different than the scenario I presented.  Obviously if mobility is really important like it presumably is while playing an instrument and you are wearing it multiple times a month I think people would be correct in recommending you something better quality.  I would however say that "buy it nice or buy it twice" is a rather meaningless cliche.  "buy a more expensive version and be happy with it for longer" doesn't flow off the tongue as well, but no one is buying a suit one time in highschool and never replacing it.  I am only in my mid 20's and almost every guy I still know's bodies look completely different since highschool.  A lot of my friends were still growing in highschool and not to mention styles have changed in the last 12 years and the skinny lapel skinny tie look that we all rocked look very outdated now.  I am not saying buying good quality suits is a bad idea for anyone, I am saying buy the most expensive you can afford isn't a good idea for everyone as blanket advice.	episode_done:True

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:I bought a pair of $300+ Christian Dior DIORSTELLAIRE1 sunglasses. I bought them in June and wear them pretty much every time I go outside. They have a slim frame so they don't really stand out too much and overtake my outfit. The lense are polarised too which is perfect for the upcoming Australian summer. A good pair of sunnies is so important in my opinion	episode_done:True

I straightened the hell outta my hair in high school, dyed it, and pretty much destroyed my hair by 23. Finally got a chick friend who introduced me to the LOC method and discovered that my hair type should not WASH my hair everyday. I stopped trying to brush my hair smooth. I did the Big Chop two years ago and my curls are popping now at 30. I'm rocking an undercut to minimize the insane volume and still straighten it in the winter (my hair takes about 5-6 hours to dry, brr!).   Conditioner is my friend.

text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I got a tshirt from Parks Project. They have kind of vintage-poster looking graphic tshirts that celebrate America's national parks. I was happy with the price and the quality. The biggest downside is maybe that it isn't totally clear that its a for-profit company not actually run by the Parks Department? At least some of their ads were a little misleading, but they do donate some proceeds to various national park/nature groups...but overall, I've managed to steer clear of buying from most Instagram ads! I don't know what my algorithm suggests, but almost all of my ads are things that fit my aesthetic but in no way my budget. Like, I'm not dropping $350 on a dress from a random ad!
text:Parks Project is a legit brand, even REI sells them!	labels:That's good to know! I had only ever seen them through Instagram and figured it was tied to the fact that in early 2020, I'd been doing lots of national park research because the plan had been to take a trip...I think I'm fairly lucky in that most of the Instagram ads I see seem to be legit companies, because I'll see them tagged in celebrity feeds (which may be why they are advertising on my feed?) When I went on Facebook, that's where I saw a lot of the sketchier stuff...

Doesn't seem like you should wear these out to the store. Why not wear socks when you are home?
text:I personally hate wearing socks. They pull on the hairs on top of my feet, leading to a low level of irritation throughout the day. So, slippers allow me to avoid wearing them.  I have a pair with a rubber sole, and I will wear them to take the dog out for his evening pee, or to take the garbage to the end of the driveway, but I realize that many people consider that gross.	labels:I've got a pair of outside slippers and a pair of inside slippers for this purpose

text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:I love their (Amy, Dione, and the Tibi brand) style but sometimes their pretentiousness irks me. They go like oh you can wear whatever you like but then they come up with 1000 rules about what should not be worn together. Anyway, if you like that style and also like to DIY things you can totally adjust regular items to look like Tibi ones. For instance, the asymmetrical shirt that closes a bit on the diagonal, the buttons that are used to pull up the sleeves, the ankle bands on some of their pants, etc. can all be recreated relatively easily and you don't need to spend 100s of $ on their "affordable" items (Amy's words, I always crack up when she boasts about how affordable Tibi clothes are).
text:I have to say I don't see them as hard rules, but more like principles of how to understand what looks good and what looks tired/tried-too-hard. For example, the rule of having only one white thing or not wearing necklaces and earrings or similar. I think it is a way of simplifying a formula of how to dress well, rules are easy to remember. At least it is my perception of what they are saying.  Yeah, concerning affordable items... It is above my reasonable clothes budget. I don't have to look expensive for my job and I would rather splurge for a good trip, books or a course. This is pragamtism for me.	labels:I know they say they that they are not hard rules and that nobody needs to follow them, but sometimes they sound condescending when talking about things that don't work for them and that's what I don't like.	episode_done:True

text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:I wash socks, underwear and workout clothes after each wear. T shirts and bras get 2-3 wears depending on how sweaty i get. Jeans and sweaters more like 4-5. Other stuff as needed. I also only use a washcloth once, and bath towels twice, hand towel 2 per week.   We do 3-4 loads in a normal week between 2 people. 1 load for towels (bath towels, hair turbie towels, wash cloths and kitchen towels all fall under here) then we separate the clothing into lights, darks and colors. I use a lingerie bag for bras and delicates but most of my stuff is pretty sturdy.   I also use reusable pads for my period, so I tend to use a different detergent for those that prevents detergent buildup and I will throw my workout clothes in there with the pads on that week so they can get refreshed.	episode_done:True

I'm considering Zara, but imo Zara is pretty overpriced so I'm here to see if anyone has any other suggestions! :)

text:As I wait to hear if I have to evacuate due to CA wildfires, here’s a hypothetical I had to do: you have time to prepare before your evacuation and pack up your car. What clothes do you bring and why?	labels:I've packed up to evacuate a few times, and honestly the stuff I pack up is the stuff that I know I will need for daily wear and will be comfortable and adaptable for a variety of situations in case I end up having to go to a shelter or head to a friend's house for an indeterminate period of time. I tend to focus on jeans and leggings comfortable tee-shirts and tank tops, pajamas, and a sweatshirt or two, and as many pairs of socks, bras, and underwear as I can get my hands on.   The only other stuff I grab (after my documents, my laptop, and my cat) are the things that are absolutely irreplaceable and have very high sentimental value. For me that is all the jewelry I got from my parents and grandmother.	episode_done:True
text:Store closings at malls	labels:The biggest loss IMO was the Aerie at my local mall, during the first lockdown back in March/April. I know #aeriereal is just marketing, but it really did made me feel comfortable going in there and buying and trying on nice sweaters and cardigans.   We're under strict lockdown again in my area, so I'm sure there will be even more stores gone once malls open again. I really do miss physical stores - my sizing is weird, so it really helped to be able to try things on without going through a cumbersome returns process.	episode_done:True

Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels:Who knows, I've gotten different results on the Myers test and my latest one doesn't ring much with me.   I got INFP many years ago and according to the net they're supposed to dress according to their own rules, which I guess would be true I like wearing whatever and have fun with clothes.  But on later years I've consistently gotten ISFJ which are supposed to be the polar opposite and be stylish and classic, which... not true at all.
text:With mbti, you can test as opposite of what you are if you're not in a good place. Also, infp can test as allot of different things sometimes.	labels:I'm an infp, ive tested as an infj and an enfp. Its a real thing for us.	episode_done:True

text:> dressing up is coming back  We're in the throes of a global pandemic, and a global Depression is right around the corner, yet I keep seeing things like this.  People are struggling to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table.  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.	labels:It's because there are two economic changes happening right now. If you were working in the retail/food/blue collar job you are SOL and the government is too incompetent to help any more. But if you are a medium to high income white collar you are getting tax breaks from the government, are able to take advantage of low interest rates, and generally have more spending money now that vacationing and other expenses have gone out the window. That's why we are seeing ridiculous shit like cashmere sweat pants and luxury pajamas having a moment. This is a K shaped recovery where the lower and lower middle class get absolutely obliterated while those of us (myself included) who have been privileged enough to keep our jobs are doing a lot better.

Confidence plays a part in the clothes you wear.	episode_done:True
text:Runways have been sending out 2000s vibes. Anyone onboard?	labels:I hate it. I feel like these looks are the epitome of, "Is that even a cool outfit, or is she just really skinny?"   The 2000s were such an era of idolizing the Paris Hilton body as the only acceptable physique. Remember how Nicole Richie was "the fat friend"? I'm so over it. I've been over it since I was 12 in 2004 and realized I would never, ever, look like that no matter how little I ate. I feel like we have moved forward as far as body positivity and inclusivity since then, and these stupid throwback trends are dragging us back.

text:Does anyone take their “power color” really seriously?

Hot pink satin joggers, fuchsia tee shirt dress, and a great hot pink peplum. I am not very good at monochrome, but I like color blocking and I do not mind mixing bold colors. It sounds fine to me. I have even added some pink purses, and I have blush pink sneakers.  If I ever find the right separates, I will go for a multi tone pink outfit, with neutral shoes.	episode_done:True

text:Sometimes picking something extreme is the key. Standard oversize might feel awkward, but have you tried super-oversize?

I suggest you sell your unused business clothes, on Poshmark or whatever's in your area. Start with your least favourite pieces and go from there. No rush, but start cycling the out.  Don't be like me: I kept them all just in case and they are all now dated and dusty. They take up room in my second closet and have been for years

I appreciate seeing pieces I recognize (Ann boots!) in a totally different arrangement than the usual (head to toe Antwerp). I haven't seen the show but I find this style aspirational - millennial, ADHD, switching moods at the drop of a hat, playing with gender, the textures, the silhouettes - in a way that I usually don't.

I feel like silver is more neutral and would look better with more watch bands and outfits, but I feel like most Apple Watch bands for men are designed for black Apple watches. Also, I'm worried that my watch will inevitably look too feminine too work with my outfits.

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.
text:I'm pretty sure this is actually my fashion goal. But maybe both black and brown shoes.	labels:It's honestly so easy and looks like a lot of effort. I don't understand why people think dresses are too fancy to wear every day. It's secret pajamas all day, every day! This summer I bought underwear that are like  bike shorts and I don't have to worry about thigh chaffing or showing too much skin if I sit unladylike.
text:I ended up wearing dresses and skirts a lot in lockdown - used to hate them now I love them. I didnt think I could lull them off before but they're lovely and fun and so dalm easy.

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:Echoing people here, anything nice in polyester/synthetics I wash in cold water but hang to dry. Wools and silks I hand wash using soak detergent.   Rayon I'll give the old college try and hand wash but with limited water contact - 99/100 times it's fine. I think newer rayon tends to shrink less than old rayon. There's only been handful of pieces over the years that have been ruined by this method, and usually because I left in water too long so set a loud timer. Big wool coats or fancy dresses I'll dry clean though because its a hassle to hand wash.	episode_done:True

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:My standard is the classic "The Rock" outfit: black turtleneck tucked into high-waisted straight leg jeans, a heeled boot. I'll swap the turtleneck out for a tee in the summer. It's an outfit that goes anywhere and never looks out of place.   HOWEVER, as a foil to a lot of the other repsonses here, I will say I sometimes like to wear something really flashy! I'm a pretty flamboyant dresser in my everyday life, and I don't want to be with someone who would be turned off or embarrassed by that. On one of my favorite first dates I wore shiny disco pants, a white cropped sweater, a pink blazer, and a big fur coat over top.

I started with a Pinterest board of inspiration, and then I replaced each inspo image with a link to an actual product/piece and bought them over time. And threw out my old wardrobe lol

text:For those of us with only a passing interest, in what way are they gatekeeping?	labels:The gist of it is, though with a bit of hyperbole...  "You can only wear these clothes if you grew up a trust fund baby, went to prep school in Connecticut, summered on Nantucket, love sailing, went to an Ivy League school, are a doctor/attorney/work in finance, etc."  EDIT: oh, and in many cases, you have to be white.	episode_done:True
text:As I wait to hear if I have to evacuate due to CA wildfires, here’s a hypothetical I had to do: you have time to prepare before your evacuation and pack up your car.

Then my two pull over head hoodies as they are not generic.   Then all bras. Then all my stock of knickers and socks, I mean all new in package.  Then all shoes in use.  Then sandals not yet in use.  Then boots/shoes not yet in use.  Then shorts.  Coats would be the easiest replaced, so they would be last, along with knickers and socks in use.  I realise this is not specific, it is a list of priorities!  If space started to get tight partway through, I would have to start over to be sure of having some of each kind of clothes.  Footwear and trousers would be number-one priority because they are the most fit-critical.	episode_done:True

I would style this with an all black wardrobe for the following reasons:  1. I miss not thinking about coordinating my wardrobe  2. I would like to do one wash instead of waiting for enough whites to do a wash 3.

A friend went with me to Barney's to pick it out. I literally had a panic attack about 10 min after we left the store. Luckily my friend was there to help me calm down. I still love that bag 10 years later and it makes me smile when I look at it. I've since bought plenty of expensive bags with no problems at all.

text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:I have always preferred dresses and skirts to wearing pants; however, I find that they can make a person look "overdressed" in a more casual setting. If I wear a loose-fitting or oversized dress then I look like I put some effort into my appearance without being too dressed up. I also love oversized/loose-fitting pieces with weird structural details or unique drapes. Sometimes these pieces are not necessarily "flattering" per se but I enjoy them because they are comfortable enough to get shit done in while still looking somewhat interesting. I agree with other commenters, sometimes you want to draw attention to your clothes rather than your body parts.	episode_done:True

We're finally moving out of our mediocre apartment into a house further in Atlanta (renting). We've got all the paperwork and shit locked down, I'm more looking for advice on the moving process. I used to move around all the time with just a suitcase and my car but we've been in the apartment for a few years so I think it's gonna be a lot more of a process.

text:Shopping for clothing items you already own: confessions of an outfit repeater	labels:Little black dresses for me. Sometimes I look at my closet and think, "I should really get more color in there," but the fact is, I feel happiest and most myself in neutrals. Past couple years I've been trying more colorful clothes. They do get compliments and objectively I like them, but what are my workhorses? The neutrals. Mainly knee-length black dresses. And a single red bodycon dress that's made its way into the regular rotation.  So now I'm trying to look for clothing with interesting texture, silhouettes, and architectural details, but color is no longer a requirement. I make up for it by having a colorful home.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - October 27	labels:I ordered some fatigues from an online milsurp store and they ended up being fucking Stan Rays. I decided to just get custom fatigues from Proper Cloth. I think my pants are gonna have to be all custom from now on. I can get away with some normal shirts, but some of my favorite brands (Corridor, Freenote, RRL) don't fit me. At least I fit into most outerwear?
text:>I think my pants are gonna have to be all custom from now on.  I hate that this is where I'm at too. I can either find the fabric I want but the fit doesn't work, or the fit is perfect and the fabric is uninteresting. Spier & Mackay RTW is *so* close, but the contemporary fit is too tight and I don't want the pleats that come with their high rise.	labels:Yeah honestly the only stuff I can find is at big and tall stores, and all of their stuff is like the most blah business casual clothing that exists.	episode_done:True
text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:I find labels helpful to get an overall vibe so i can shop for the style myself and modify when i need. So far I've realized i enjoy cottagecore or whimsical/ natural and also dark academia during the cold months. I like to play around with masculine and feminine shapes as well as darker and lighter colors so now i want to see how much i can mix those 2 established aesthetics and add my own flair to make my unique style

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:This is more of a sewing reference, but I think it's a good resource for trends--a website/YouTube channel called "the Fold Line" has monthly videos for sewing pattern releases (these tend to mirror trend) and a seasonal video on upcoming trends based on one of the business owners going into London shops and comparing offerings.  I think it might work for you because it's geared towards people making those things, so they're not pressuring you to buy those things. In fact, it's inspiration for people to make those things.	episode_done:True

Sure, its cute with an oversized sweater that covers your booty and some nice boots or if you wanna workout or lounge around at home. But I always thought it was weird when adults where leggings like they're pants. I know they're comfortable but I don't think they should be considered "fashionable" imo.   Leggings look cute on toddlers tho.

Prayer beads amd ropes found in so many cultures and religions is really interesting- learning about malas, i found out the first beads found are 42,000 year old seashells that were shaped and strung up.   In other news, i'm making a website you can go to for printed fabrics, patches, customised clothing or a form to contact me and commission repairs- i love fixing clothing with stitches, it feels really invigorating to see how more people are trying repair as a practical thing and an art form.

text:What’s your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:As a baby of the 80s/90s, I'm here for it! This is my first cycle of fashion "coming back," and it's pretty fun to see a new generation reinterpret the style I saved my allowance to buy from Limited Too. That being said, as a 30-something, I'm not diving in too deep, as this aesthetic feels a bit young and maximalist for my style.  The trend seems to be permeating home decor too... I'm mentoring a high schooler through a women in STEM program, and we had a Zoom date the other night. Her bedroom looked like the set of Clarissa Explains It All and it was strangely comforting.
text:I'm also in my 30s. I don't think styling 90s fashion is off the table for me entirely but it has to be done VERY well in order for me to not look like I just literally haven't updated my wardrobe since 1999. Juicy tracksuits are coming back (I realize that's more early 00s).

I have similar issues with standard sizing not fitting me well (long torso and short legs), so I buy pants that fit okay but are solidly constructed and then get them tailored the rest of the way.
text:I'd also like to add that it's not nearly as expensive as I thought it'd be. I think a lot of people (including myself in the past) hear the word "tailor" and think it's only something the upper-upper class do. I have a friend who didn't even consider getting his wedding day outfit tailored because he thought it'd cost more--I think he was imagining on the order of $50 or so. He just needed his pants hemmed and it cost like $8.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:Is anyone else kind of tired of posts and comments that variously try to "justify" the price of obvious luxury goods, designerwear, etc.?  Good thread on the SLP teddy, but just about nothing in there is surprising. Is it well-constructed? Duh, it's SLP. Does it have little refinements all over, compared to everyday varsity jackets? Yeah, that's kind of the point. Is it "worth" $2,000? No, obviously not.   Like...at some point we need to acknowledge that these efforts are misguided, even if well-intentioned. You're buying SLP because it's SLP (or Ackermann, or Dick Ovens, or whatever your thing is). *That* is the justification. And that's a fine justification in and of itself! An analysis of the materials and construction is unlikely to throw up surprises that'll make people go "damn, that really makes it worth the obnoxious price tag!"   (This observation does not apply to bespoke clothing, where the justification genuinely is that you get something more or less customized for you, and you alone.)  What do people think?
text:I feel one of the issues is that in this subreddit we have:  1.  A group of people who genuinely want to know why people make large purchases (people just getting into fashion, hearing about spending more to get better quality leather/materials). I was in this group for a while.  2. A group of people who are looking for the absolute cheapest way to get into fashion, they often take pride in getting things for cheap and some even get a sense of superiority for getting the same look without spending as much as "suckers" who buy designer fashion.  3. Hobbyists who have the money to spend on exact items they want.   I genuinely think that one of the issues that causes people to butt heads in this subreddit is when the hobbyists feel they need to justify their purchases when confronted with the question "why?"  Getting the exact item they have searched for is a valid enough reason, and trying to invent other reason to "justify" a purchase often causes confusion for people who are trying to get involved in fashion and are genuinely asking "why is this item worth it?" When I first was looking for new footwear, the number of times I was told that $500 boots were worth it because how long they would last was absurd.	labels:>when the hobbyists feel they need to justify their purchases when confronted with the question "why".  Agreed. It's this justification that I think is ultimately pointless, even after explaining all the little details that make it special.	episode_done:True

My mom's attitude was that clothes should be cheap, functional, and age appropriate. But I had to teach myself about fashion, fit, and what value means to me. I guess she taught me never to buy something at retail price because everything goes on sale eventually?  I don't think I will have children, but if I do, I think being body positive and giving them agency in their choices would be key. And I guess I would pay attention to if my kid was excited about trends that the other kids at school were excited about so that they wouldn't get made fun of for having the wrong clothes. idk	episode_done:True

text:As Chanel Raises Prices For A Second Time this Year, What Do Luxury Brands’ Inflating Prices Mean for Them & for the Industry at Large?	labels:Luxury brands inflating prices means creating another pricepoint at higher categories. When fashion tees at $300 a pop becomes the norm, why wouldn't the luxury brands jack up the price on other products to increase their margins?  The only way this can be curbed is through the consumers. When we stop falling into the hype cycle and scramble to buy up everything just for the gram and social media likes, these products will sit and go into the 50-60% off discount during the sale seasons. All these brands have data; when they see that stuff is sitting and mostly selling at lower price points, they'll need to curb their expectations and set price points accordingly.   It doesn't help right now during COVID that I see people whose jobs/income did not get affected by COVID, and therefore has additional disposable income because they aren't eating out, partying etc. They justify spending more on items at MSRP instead of waiting for a sale.

text:Keep in mind that fashion is influenced by art. Monotone clothing with simple details is inspired by minimalism. A few years ago we had shirts with large, busy designs that were inspired by maximalism. Fashion is basically wearing art to send a message about who we are and how we want to be perceived.   Generally our clothes are mostly functional with a layer of art on top. Outfits like the OP posted focus on the art, instead.	labels:	episode_done:True

However, we are ver sensitive to the ways this topic can overlap with general body dissatisfaction. We request that the comments in this thread center on the discussion of making items fit your body rather than becoming a platform for people to criticize their body or express body dissatisfaction. While every body is unique, we're not actually *that* unique and many of the things you might criticize about your own body are also aspects of others' bodies.   We would appreciate an effort to express your individual struggles with fit without making subjective judgements about the quality of your body.

text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:My situation is probably a bit different than most because I'm dressing for a minimally temperature controlled home office (trying to save money and not run the a/c or heater during the day).  So I was too hot most of the time, and now I'm cold all the time.  Majority of my clothes were for a temperate office, so they weren't worn much.  I miss wearing all my cute clothes, but it's a vague ache.  Dressing purposefully for the day -- even if it's not the clothes I'd normally wear -- staves off the depression more-or-less.  I Kon Marie'd my shirt drawer, and I've been making it a point to work through my columns of shirts.  So everything is getting worn, which adds a bit of variety to the days.

That being said as a bigger guy myself I find wearing button downs/flannels and straight fit pants work well the structure of a buttoned shirt helps hide my stomach and straight fit pants balance out my top.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:Ooh, I LOVE this question. I'm a big fan of perfumes and scents in general! I think scent really influences my experience of people/places/products/etc. I definitely prefer my perfumes to sit fairly close to the skin. I've been trying to transition from "grad student gremlin who has an f'ed sleep schedule" to "actual person with an advanced degree and consistent bedtime." Either consciously or unconsciously, this has led to a preference for $$$$ perfumes... so right now, my faves for cold weather are Jo Malone Velvet Rose and Oud and Tom Ford Cafe Rose. My favorite for warmer weather is Jo Malone Peony and Blush Suede. To me, those say feminine, refined, cozy, inviting.
text:Yes!!!! Velevet Rose and Oud is amazing for this weather. Sometimes I like to layer it with Myrrh and Tonka.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Tailoring for the People	labels:Favorite ways to incorporate tailored clothing casually (easiest to hardest, IMO):  All of the tailored items should be on the casual side (OCBDs, patterned shirts, non-worsted jacket/trousers, textured and/or patterned fabrics, etc)   1. Swap in button up shirts for tees and/or layer under sweaters/sweatshirts, non tailored jacket, overshirt, etc.  2. Swap in trousers for chinos or denim. Knit, sweatshirt, tee, polo, hoody, etc for the top. 3. Button up shirt and trouser. Layer with knit, sweatshirt, non tailored jacket, overshirt, even a hoody. 4. Jacket with denim. Non button up shirt top (knit, sweatshirt, polo, clean solid tee) 5. 4 but with a button up shirt 6. Jacket and odd trouser (odd meaning it's not a suit). Non button up shirt top. 7. Jacket, button up shirt, odd trouser. 8. Suit and non button up shirt top. Could be tied with 7 if the suit is casual enough.	episode_done:True
text:No (New) Jawnz January: 2021 Edition	labels:Shit, I copped a shetland wool jumper from eBay on the 1st. The deal was just too good and it's a big upgrade from my previous slightly holey (but admittedly great for the price) $4 goodwill wool/acrylic sweater.   So, staaaaarting NOW.	episode_done:True
text:Bolero album because it's here whether you like it or not	labels:I... actually kind of like these.  Not at all what I was expecting when you said bolero (I think I've seen one being sold as a sleeved scarf at one point???) but it seems like it'd be a practical way of adding warmth to dresses without loosing the silhouette.	episode_done:True
text:How does one incorporate haute couture into everyday work outfits?	labels:real haute couture should be treated as an art piece, first of all if you can afford to buy a piece of haute couture chances are that you not only need the money to afford it but also the power and most pieces are only made for events such as the oscars. if even that you still have the money and the influence in the fashion industry to be able to have haute couture in your closet, I wouldn't wear it for work tbh appreciate it	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 08, 2021	labels:How do yall feel about sneaker fakes? With how exclusive and hard to get nike drops have been lately, I find myself browsing /r/sneakerreps. Especially with how common my foot size is, I dont know if I will ever get a pair of jordans in a desirable colorway without spending $400+.  Not sure if I can personally justify a purchase of something that expensive just because its "hyped"
text:Imo fakes are perfectly fine. The market is fucked and fakes are an alternative to resellers and their bots (and Nike's business practices tbh). Jordans and Dunks generally have bad QC and their MSRP worth is already debatable. Can't really justify paying 2 or 3 times more to someone who bots/backdoors.  I would have  bought a couple of sneakers if they were easily accessible, but it's just not worth the trouble to me. I could see myself buying fakes in the future.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:[Inspo Album] Inspired by a recent Red and Pink Comment: An Inspo album of unexpected, but totally wearable, color combos	labels:Lol, I used that "rules and don'ts" thread as outfit inspo last night, breaking the "no black with navy," "no multiple neutrals," and "no sparkles unless it's a special occasion" rules. It was fun and the outfit felt so cool and badass. Can't wait to break some color rules too!	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:Definitely not, an LBD is really just something that will work when you dont know where the dress code is between business casual and cocktail, basically. It can be any colour, shape, it can be pants, a blouse, a dress, a skirt, whatever.  Although I do have an actual LBD that I've owned since 2010, it's magic. But like, black suits me, and its basically just an a-line dress is a semi-suiting fabric.	episode_done:True

text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:For me it's a pair of leggings that have a faux leather panel down the side of the legs like a wider tuxedo stripe. I managed to get a pair a few years ago but the faux leathers starting to tear and I need to replace them. It seems like it's out of style because all I can find now are full vinyl leggings.  Also anything with pockets that can actually hold a modern smartphone without it falling out every step.

text:General Discussion - January 14, 2021	labels:k guys how many socks do you have? I only ask because I realize that my gf has so many socks she only needs to do 1-2 large washes of them per year and she's good, it just takes like half a day to sort and match them.
text:I have maybe 7 pairs of gym socks, 8 pairs of all-season socks, and 4 pairs of "oh fuck it's cold" socks.   Honestly I wish I had as many socks as your gf. Does she organize them in any particular way or does she just toss them all in a bin?	labels:Just one big drawer of her dresser. But also we have a decently large container of non-matched socks that we go through once a year to see if any of the new lost ones have matches.	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:My handknit sweaters look great and have lasted much longer than my store bought sweaters. They are typically made from better materials ( i.e. natural vs. acrylic yarn) and I do tend to baby them because they took me so long to produce, which may be a big part of it.	episode_done:True
text:What was your first 'expensive' fashion purchase?	labels:I feel super poor after reading this haha! This year I turned thirty (COVID birthday whoo) and bought my first ever designer purse, a small tote from Kate Spade. I absolutely love it and look forward to using it every day.
text:Love Kate Spade! I actually just bought a frances valentine purse, the line she started before she passed away	labels:She passed away, when?!
text:She took her own life a couple years ago...was quite sad to hear of it. She seemed lovely	labels:Oh that's horrible	episode_done:True
text:Brands that are actually great that you discovered on Instagram?	labels:Lo & Sons bags: I have a backpack(Hanover 2), weekender tote (Catalina Deluxe Tote), purse (the Pearl in saffino leather), and wallet. Love them all. Good construction, attractive design, and functional interiors. They have good sales pretty often too.   I wanted another Pearl in the softer leather (safino is built to water and stain resistant), but I literally only wear one bag full time for years until it gives out. I have several other purses in a box under my bed but they get used once a year, if that.
text:YES! I bought their Brookline bag, and it is absolutely perfect for work and travel (not that I'm doing much of that these days). It's spacious enough that it fits everything you need but it isn't bulky. I also love that it can slip over the handle of a roller suitcase.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:A discussion of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's infamous fashion statements	labels:I'm not American so don't know much about her. I had no idea her collars had meaning; that's really cool.   The part about the robes being designed for men is something I noticed about academic gowns when I was graduating (the hood is meant to be attached behind your tie knot; I had to pin mine to my bra).
text:I pinned mine with a button I got out of a quarter machine at a bar once. It said something like "F\*\*\* with b\*\*\*\*\*, wake up with stitches" in subtle looping cursive. Nobody saw it or said anything, except the woman walking behind me who said "damn, I wish I thought of that." I was hoping someone WOULD say something because I was in the mood to get snarky.	labels:We were given pins and told Very Sternly not to damage the rented gowns.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - October 22	labels:Seeing how crazy people are going for Aime Leon Dore is astounding. For the prices they are charging, people are snatching it up like it's a Supreme drop. At $500 a sweater or $2K for a coat, there's other brands out there (AMI or Acne Studios comes to find) that would be very similar styling or quality.   And it's selling out not even general release but the early access stuff.
text:I like the brand but the styling takes them a helluva long way, see the clothes by themselves and mostly they're pretty basic and actually a little disappointing.  Not just the styling of their clothes though but the curation of the brand, the store, their references, music, cars, nostalgia and so on, its all on point. I think the hype has come from some kind of 'return to streetwear' thing they've got going on, like it all went stupid high fashion stuff for a while, everyone seems well tired of Supreme, Off White. Theres a whole group of streetwear/sneakerheads in the middle of that which Aime Leon Dore hits quite nicely as their new 'in the know' brand.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else have “irony pieces”?	labels:Teddy bear/sherpa style sweaters and jackets. Initially a friend and I bought them as a joke because we loved that they reminded us of the famous Justin Bieber Ikea monkeys' jacket. And all of a sudden years later here I am, in my cozy cocoon of 5-6 sweaters, 3 jackets, some lounge pants and shorts, headbands, socks, and earmuffs/mittens... all different colors. I'll admit it's taken over. I love them.	episode_done:True
text:What clothing items have you reverted back to since WFH/quarantine?	labels:I have a confession. I have Christmas slippers that I bought in the after Christmas sale at Land End. They have a Christmas Cow that goes from the right foot to the left foot.  &#x200B;  I've never put them away and wore them as needed since March.

text:Pantone Color(s) of the year for 2021: Illuminating and Ultimate Gray	labels:I love yellow & I love gray, in most shades, but these in particular just feel so... textbook Crayola starter pack to me? Like, in a vacuum they could be the platonic ideal of yellow and gray, so I can kind of appreciate how they are both true mid-tones, but I don't like them together (for some reason it's giving me flashbacks to the chevrons and turquoise of 2010 decor) and I don't find them particularly inspiring right off the bat.  Or it could be that as a warm-toned olive I know they will both look terrible on me, lol.
text:I have an old chevron bedspread (well, maybe 5-6 years "old") that is basically these colors + white. These COTY shades don't really say "current trend" to me.	labels:The gray-yellow combo was hot a few years ago and I didn't like it then.

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:You could check in on your favorite go-to clothing sites from time to time and pick up fashion magazines for inspo.

text:What is one item that you own too much of?	labels:Cardigans.  10 is too many

text:same, i only like the shawl collars. i've tried a bunch (and own one that i wear often), personally can't do wool, way too scratchy	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:Not much has changed for me, but I spend 4-5 times more on an item than I used to. There was a turning point for me a few years ago when I was disgusted with the amount of crap I had in my closet and decided to really care about the ethics and materials of my clothing. For a while, I made a pact with myself to get rid of a few items of clothing before buying a new one. That has slowed down, but mostly because I rent pieces. If I find something perfect, and I know my money is going to the business directly, I get it.	episode_done:True
text:What pieces would you love "backups" of?	labels:Ok so, every three months I make a capsule wardrobe. This past one I set out to find the perfect black v neck tee shirt. I found it, and bought 14 of them. I now pretty much only wear that one tee shirt.   I really should buy two pairs of jeans at a time because I always bust out the inner thighs.
text:Does this mean you buy 14 shirts every three months?	labels:Ha ha no way, I just choose something to add if I make the capsule wardrobe and I want something else. None of my shirts fit right and I wanted to not think about making an outfit every day, so I got 14 of the exact same shirt that I wear every day.	episode_done:True

text:What's the greatest length you've gone to obtain a much coveted fashion item?	labels:I watched too much bestdressed and wanted a gingham summer dress.   I found an extremely large (2XL?) gingham shirt at a charity shop.   I brought it w me when I flew home for the xmas break, intending to use my mum's sewing machine, then I realised that I can't sew. While I was there there was a minor outbreak so my friends and I decided not to go ahead w our original meetup plans (mostly going out to cafes and shopping and such)   So I invited my friends that have some level of dressmaking (SCA at uni) or skirtmaking experience over to make the dress. Took us, in total, probably 18 hours of stuffing around over 3 days? But I now have a gingham dress.	episode_done:True

text:Can you please enlighten me as to how some rather standard menswear tailoring pieces, with a few simple deviations in design (like a flat hemmed vest), made exclusively in either an orange and/or a neutral color is in **any** way similar Derelict?	labels:In my opinion, these clothes look poorly fitted and oversized, like a child wearing their father's suits and coats. Since they are adults, it has the appearance of thrift store clothing purchased without regard to proper fit. That, as a whole, is what Derlelict was lampooning, and since that's still a trend, the reference remains relevant.
text:>That, as a whole, is what Derlelict was lampooning  Derelicte was a direct reference to Dior Spring 2000, which was explicitly inspired by homeless people (the IRL collection was in even worse taste than the movie). It has nothing to do with "fit".   Also Derek was wearing a skintight jumpsuit in that scene, have you even seen the movie?	labels:	episode_done:True

text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:Black jeans. All my outfits revolve around black jeans. I have 5 pairs that I cycle through. I wear different pants only when I'm exercising or wearing a suit. Funny enough, I also have one pair of dark blue jeans that I wear to nice restaurants that pair with a black blazer (black blazer + black jeans may be too much).  Also trucker jackets. I have three suede trucker jackets and two denim jackets. I get complimented pretty often (pre-COVID) when I wear these jackets. They're incredibly comfortable, durable, and stylish.

text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:I wore socks with heels irl in high school and guess who was labelled a weirdo? And wearing a blazer was "trying to dress rich".(I loved gossip girl then but I'm sure most girls did then.) I grew up in a small white American town where fashion was and still is not a thing. It really pushed me to mostly dress plain af. Once I do step out in slightly more dressed up/stylish clothes, suddenly strangers assume I'm a fob or Korean. Like, no. 99% of my clothes are western brands. Once I dress up it's suddenly "asian/korean" fashion, but the H&M model I copied the outfit from isn't considered asian fashion on her.  Anyways, I'd really like to dress like a Clueless,  Gossip Girl, Mean Girls, or Skins character more irl.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 17, 2020	labels:Any recommendations for a jacket/parka to handle wet fall/winters? I have a heavy parka for those single digit days but it's super overkill for the 20-40 (F) range. Turns out where I now live gets a lot of the cold rainy 30-40F type weather, so need some insulation and waterproofness but would also like to not be sweating walking around. Budget around $200 or so.  Carhartt WIP Clash Parka caught my eye but looks a bit too rugged/streetwear for how I generally dress, or I need to move to Berlin.

I've died wearing the too-large, white-but-actually-gray-at-this-point, ratty bathrobe given to me by my ex over a decade ago. I haven't had a haircut in almost 2 years and I'm not even wearing socks.   The worst part is that I spilled coffee on myself, so now I have a coffee stain on my chest for all of eternity.  I think it's safe to assume that I died from falling down the stairs or some shit after spilling coffee all over myself. I'm going to haunt the path outside my house because when the wind blows really hard, it actually howls down the path and it's spooky AF. I think I need all the help I can get, give the whole bathrobe situation. Though my coffee stain MIGHT pass for blood, so that's cool.  People aren't creative at all, so I'm probably going to get called something stupid like Bathrobe Witch. Or like, The Ghost of... Well I'm not actually going to put the name of the path because I don't want someone to find out where I live and make me actually dead.

text:Rise is like, relative mannnnnnn. High rise in 1950 is different than high rise five years ago  is different than high rise now. Agree that a lot of what we've been calling high rise is closer to a "timeless" medium though	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Brands that are actually great that you discovered on Instagram?	labels:Vitaly- really cool streetwear-style jewelry brand (mostly stainless steel stuff.) I don't know what the deal is, but I started seeing their cool, *Hackers-*inspired ads suddenly around 2 months ago, and they obviously worked because I eventually ordered a ring and pair of earrings that I really like and seem to be good quality (I got the gridlock ring and chain earrings, both in gasoline finish.)   I did a bunch of research before ordering to see if they were just a drop shipper and thus if I could find dupes on alixpress or something, and I was never able to find any real dupes, especially for their more bold designs. Seems that they are just a designer of cool unisex jewelry! But owie my wallet.
text:I remember seeing them on Dragon's Den a few years back!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Ghost Outfit	labels:I'm wearing nothing but a red leotard.  And it's very comfy.  I guess I would probably die from choking on water or something stupid like that.  I randomly show up in ballets, where the dancers can't react because the show has to go on and I fit in enough that the audience doesn't realize I'm a ghost.  My favorite thing to do is to come out during the applauses at the end and then just disappear.	episode_done:True
text:What’s a piece you bought before the pandemic, but haven’t worn a single time since because the occasion has been cancelled/we have literally nowhere to go?	labels:Gold Sketchers platform sandals.  They're tacky, but I love them.  Bought them the first weekend in March 2020.	episode_done:True
text:What are your favourite places to find loungewear ?	labels:Have to say I love everything I've bought from the Zella line (Nordstrom's in-house athletic and lounging label) and they're always included in Nordstrom's big annual sales! The leggings are lot more...structured feeling? They also have slouchier styles. And I love their jersey material shirts.	episode_done:True
text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:Honestly, the thing my mom taught me about fashion was to 1) not judge people on what they wear, 2) demand the same treatment from stores as a person holding a Birkin, and 3) the value of quality.   That empowered new to go to places with personal stylists and get help developing my style.  She was never really one to teach me about style or makeup herself, but she taught me how to navigate and use places like makeup counters and know what I want to ask store employees, all while wearing whatever she felt most comfortable in.	episode_done:True
text:What’s on everyone’s Black Friday wishlists?	labels:I've been buying only pink clothes and I've worn pink every day for the last week or so. I didn't have anything in mind but I got a pair of pink sequin joggers and pink high-waist corduroy from Loft. I have a pair of pink velvet joggers in my cart at Gap right now, but they're pleated front so I'm not sure how I feel about them.  I almost talked myself out of the sequin joggers but they are MACHINE WASHABLE, so it was the only responsible thing to do. Right?	episode_done:True
text:Model poses while online shopping	labels:Yep, I understand your point completely. Think a lot of regular brands are trying to come across as high fashion and original but need to know their audience and consumers, especially Zara.	episode_done:True

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Go skiing/snowboarding almost every year.  Best gear combination is to use layers.  Personally I wear a thermal, fleece, and then a hard outer shell (plus other accessories like gloves, etc).  Three items I regularly use during the year when used together are way better than just a single winter coat IMO (used a Canada Goose to go skiing once ... personally found it really uncomfortable and harder to move in).  Have fun!	episode_done:True
text:The Business of Markups on Logo T-Shirts. Why You Shouldn't Drop $600 on a Gucci Tee	labels:I feel like the venn diagram of people who want to own a Gucci tee and people who care about the business of markups on Gucci tees does not overlap very much.	episode_done:True
text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:I would say I grew up fairly wealthy but I only learned of it as an adult because my parents hid it well. Yes we went on vacations BUT we also had to earn the things we wanted. Chores or whatever. And for clothing we had limits when it came to new clothes and their cost, even though they could easily afford it. So as an adult I would say I am fairly conservative in my spending but have small splurges.   I guess it helps that my style is very jeans/tshirt and sweatshirts lately. Lol.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 22, 2020	labels:I've ordered the EG Bedford in Khaki cord. I've wanted one for about 3 years and it can only mean the downfall of mankind that they are still in stock come sale time. I want to get matching fatigues or the Andover in the same material. Questions are:  1) Is wandering around in an EG cord suit ridiculous and to be avoided.   2) If the answer to 1 is no , then fatigues or andover? I'm looking for a touch of slouch but not parachute pants.

text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:I'm fairly tall and for about a year now I've been looking for high waisted, wide leg, black pants made of really flowy material.

text:Thanks so much! I definitely feel that the label is not nearly as popular as Saint Laurent Paris was under Hedi here, but I know it took a bit for that to catch on too, even with FW13 now being the most coveted collection.

text:General Discussion - November 25, 2020	labels:Recent post has me realizing, i love my Lady White co white tee, but it is the WORST to keep white. Maybe im just paranoid because its so much more expensive, but i swear there have been way more issues than any other white tee ive had. First there were these weird discolored spots that showed up in direct sunlight, like some spots were just a bit whiter than others (i believe this had to do with how i put detergent into the washing machine) Consistently it picks up marks on the drying rack.  Now there are weird bloodspot looking stains which I assume are from iron in the wash water. I dont even wear them that frequently. I swear this fabric is way less resilient than cheaper shirts. I love the fit and feel though   I think im going to just dye it, this is too much heart ache

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:The stores do have different tiers. If there are not enough items on markdown to fill all "doors" then they send them to the biggest ones first and try to sprinkle the remains to some of the smaller stores. It would definitely be worth traveling to go to a bigger one to increase your luck if there is one nearby. It will have more stuff to sort through there too, though, which may not be helpful.	episode_done:True

I am lucky in that I have lost my pregnancy weight and then some with pretty much no effort. I had gained about 25 lbs. during my pregnancy. Other than my bust being a bit larger than it was before and some stretch marks near my belly button, my body is pretty much the same as it was prepregnancy. Because of this, I'm really glad that I didn't do anything drastic like get rid of my prepregnancy clothes that I had initially assumed I would never fit into again, or buy a bunch of clothes in a size up. I was advised to do so by many well-meaning people.	episode_done:True

text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:As a Canadian: nothing is worse than having cold, wet feet. Invest in a nice pair of WATERPROOF boots, preferably with a deep tread so you don't slip on ice! I have a pair of Blundstones that I wear with thick socks on cool days, and a pair of heavy duty Sorels for really, really nasty days. If you can afford it, invest in some nice wool socks, too! Natural fibres are much better for trapping heat without making your feet sweat than synthetics, (same goes for scarves, hats, mittens, and thermal underwear, too).
text:Also, I would recommend just keeping some extra pairs of socks around the office etc. We've all done the thing where we think we can just run across the road to get some coffee without putting our big boots back on and then we end up with damp socks and snow in our indoor boots.	labels:Ooh, yes! Run across the road for Tim's, regret it for the rest of the day. We've all been there.	episode_done:True
text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:Honestly, what is the inherent value of being 'stylish'? Does it really matter? How much of your life do you want to spend purchasing and perfecting your wardrobe?
text:It has value because some of us like it? It's a hobby. We ENJOY clothes and putting a wardrobe together and wearing it. I don't understand how that's a foreign concept on a FASHION sub. Like, what does this comment seek to achieve?	labels:What does it matter if other people don't have, or aren't interested in being 'stylish'? Yes, this is a fashion sub for people who are interested in fashion advice, NOT for wondering why other people don't have style. I take issue with the poster wondering WHY people of a supposed socioeconomic status don't aspire to have style, like it matters on the scale of anything on this planet, or that it adds any value to a discussion about FASHION. Because this is a sub to discuss FASHION ADVICE. We are here because we enjoy fashion, but it doesn't mean everyone else has to aspire to being fashionable. There is nothing wrong with not caring about fashion. Musing on the fact that you were once average middle-class american but now have style doesn't add anything interesting or meaningful to the discussion. Like, that's what this comment seeks to achieve.
text:Oh, oh, oh, okay, I get u. it came across as the very knee-jerk FFA "who cares about fashion, fashion is stupid and I don't care because I'm not like other girls!" comment, but I understand what you mean, in the context of the OP.   I agree with your sentiment, but at the same time, who says they don't care? Like, who is OP to decide that because these people weren't dressing up to her standards or from the stores she dressed that it meant they didn't give a crap about it, you know?   That reeks of classism, even though it's ostensibly a "reflective". "Poor, ergo doesn't care about the way they look" isn't a good thought process.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:LL Bean cashmere sweaters are amazing and last a lifetime

I stopped buying LL Bean cashmere due to significant early pilling, and donated those but still wear my older cashmere some 20 years now.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Anyone like wearing traditional clothing from you culture?	labels:Dirndl for the win. These garments make all women look so much better. That extra ten (or 20) pounds actually looks bomb in a Dirndl. I'd love to wear Dirndl-like dresses every day (but alas, the real world...).

text:I (M/39) just bought some bright yellow, women's, terry loungepants from August November. What wonderful "non-female" fashion items have you purchased recently? Do you ever dip into the men's section?	labels:I wish it fit me better, because I'm tall and would love some longer sleeves, but men's clothing generally doesn't fit over my hips and boobs. I'm pretty hourglassy. The only "menswear" I've had any success with is accessories like hats and scarves.

text:I don't really understand this, and we only play PS casually so it's not like I'm going to bat for Sony. But it's not a stuffed toy?

text:What Are Your Regional Fashion Stereotypes?	labels:Recently moved from the West Coast to a college town in Virginia. Because of COVID I haven't interacted much with the locals or paid attention to their fashion, but the college kids seem to be big fans of sweatpants and crocs. In my classes alone, I've noticed at least 4 pairs of Crocs at any one time, and many of the students have several pairs on different colors.  I definitely stand out in my suits or slacks+waistcoat teaching attire.
text:A bit late to reply here, but I also live in a VA college town (southwest VA). Sweats and Crocs are definitely a thing with the college-age set here, but I think that may have more to do with Covid and people not bothering as much. Jeans and tees/button-downs are the go-to for most folks (myself included); standard suburb styles with a few OCBDs for office workers and the occasional wacky teen fashion.	labels:	episode_done:True

Luckily boots, sneakers and cute jackets are my weakness!
text:I had Eddie Bauer waterproof knee high flat rubber soled boots for walking from train to office, and a knee length waterproof insulated parka with (faux) fur trimmed hood from Northface.

I've always parted on the one way, see myself in the mirror and thought "alright, good"  then I see an actual picture of myself several times and it's like "... yeah I don't like that at all"
text:Going OT, but the reason you dislike your "un-mirrored" self is because you're simply not used to see it. Have you ever seen someone you know very well in a mirror? They look weird if you see them in a mirror. It's because your brain is used to see yourself in a mirror and has adjusted and neutralized all the assymmetries in your face, and the same goes for people you know. When you look in a mirror, you see a 3D picture of yourself whereas a picture is a 2D version of you. You're also most likely looking at yourself in specific angles that you like when looking into a mirror, something you don't do when someone takes a picture of you.	labels:	episode_done:True

Museums are starting to open up again, so I have gone 2X so far.   I am still pretty cautious, some of my friends are super cautious, the homebodies are staying home and isolated. My sister is immuno-compromised so I am taking her lead on what she things is safe. But we are planning to go visit our parents for Thanksgiving (they live a few counties away) so I am staying cautious for the next few weeks in anticipation - they are in their seventies.

TBH the only clothes I've purchased since Covid were PJ pants (because my old ones split in the ass).  They were from Walmart (so I could go even during a lockdown).   Oh and I bought a sweater dress at Primark.  Now, most of the clothes I buy run SML as opposed to numbered sizes.  Even dresses.  I generally just hold them up to my body and pray that they work (and return if they do not).    I tend not to buy clothes online because the quality is so inconsistent from store to store (and even within a store).  I need to actually feel the quality.	episode_done:True

text:Permanent Style - Tucked in T-Shirt	labels:It's funny how most of people think of tucked t-shirts as something for "an older man", because I see it as something so fresh to a overlook and makes your trousers pop so well (specially if you're wearing a cool/elegant belt). When I try to pull it off to go to work, I usually get the feedback that I look "modern" from my co-workers.  Anyway, it depends from people to people, body type to body type, that's just my point of view.
text:People saying it makes you look like an old man are thinking about their run of the mill slim fit tees from Uniqlo tucked into their slim fit chinos or denim with killshots.   In that case it absolutely does make you look like a weird old man. Even just the tiniest bit of imagination can change that outfit like a wider uniqlo U tee with Levi's straight fit 501s and a braided leather belt and that outfit can be 1000x better.	labels:Yeah, I think it is because a slim tee tucked in suddenly looks a lot more like an undershirt. I also think it's a look you can't afford to have a beer belly, otherwise it'll look even more old-mannish (and worse for other reasons, unfortunately).	episode_done:True
text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:My coworkers and I go out to dinner once a month, so I've been dressing up super extra to compensate for the daily lack-of. And by super extra, I mean Villanelle-style. lol	episode_done:True
text:Best of Techwearclothing 2020	labels:Damn, you know a lot of these pieces look great. I really dig the new-age utilitarian look that a lot of these items have. Sadly I can't really see myself wearing any of them, but I still dig the idea.
text:Yeah, love the concept. Just doesn't fit what I do, and I'm much too big to fit any of it. My shoulders are so wide, they couldn't get me into an MRI machine. Definitely won't fit these smaller cuts, regardless of how much weight I lost.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The colors? One way or the other, I try to buy most of my clothes on like thredup or Etsy or whatever. But the softness??? The.Softness. I want to get rid of everything in my wardrobe that does not feel soft on my skin, and ideally loose. Life is too short and I never wanna wear jeans again.

text:Post-Baby Problems I Wish Someone Had Warned Me About	labels:I feel this so hard. Almost 9 months pp and holy moly it's been a fashion rollercoaster, pandemic lifestyle changes aside. I'm 5lbs above my pre-pregnancy weight but all of it is in my midsection. Technically I fit into my old clothes but they are not flattering. My boobs have been 5 different sizes in the last 365 days. I stopped breastfeeding a month ago and my already small boobs are now...soft little flappy things. That chicken cutlet tip is perfect - I tried on a push-up today and nothing looked up. Sigh. Nice to know I'm not alone	episode_done:True

text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:I'm a huge thrifter and estate sale lover. I haven't found anything super high end but some of my favorite items recently are a vintage white Ferragamo bow bag, a beautiful quilted Bally leather bag and a gorgeous camel color wool coat. I also scored an amazing Ralph Lauren alligator belt for $1 as well as a Ferragamo bow belt. I find the clothing at estate sales is often overlooked :)	episode_done:True
text:Do you name your favorite outfits?	labels:This is a brilliant idea and I desperately want to see your Coolest Kid at the BBQ. Some of mine that I can imagine...  1. Summer Jewel Tone Witch - A blue-green sleeveless midi-dress, mustard lace kimono, black birkenstocks, dangly crescent moon earrings with smoky quartz drops, and ideally many rings. 2. Granola Goth - High necked black crop top, high waisted black jeans, oversized black plaid flannel, and again, the trusty birkenstocks. As much jewelry as my level of effort that day calls for.
text:Summer jewel tone Witch is actually one of my favorite looks. I call it art nouveau socialite but it's basically the exact same vibe.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Model poses while online shopping	labels:there are certain poses which I look for that I KNOW means the garment is shit or has a lousy fit. An extreme lean back, tugging on the clothing, hands aggressively shoved into pockets, any sort of jump that means you don't know how long the top is.. probably more I'm missing.
text:The one I particularly hate is when the model is billowing out the skirt, or grabbing the hem of a swingy jacket and holding it out or way up.  I wear a lot of goth stuff, and there's a lot of bell-sleeve and flowy cape anime running and I am over it.  Put it down, sit still. I just wanna see the fit.   I will literally never flip this dress over my head and run through a parking lot.	labels:I mean... never say NEVER...

text:Bigger, Longer Coats	labels:They are fine-looking but not practical to me. I don't go places that require that kind of coat, plus I like freedom of movement and long coats tend to be heavier and constrain that. If I were to just go to dinner parties or nights on the town, these would be awesome, however my manual labor job and the fact that the fanciest place I go is BW3 really make a longer coat a luxury I don't need.	episode_done:True

text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I forgot to add this to my original comment but I saw something on LinkedIn that is food for thought. I can't find the post but it's basically along the lines of "male dominated" implies that men have more control and influence over the industry (probably true), but switching to the phrase male clustered (meaning many of the same) changes the language and inherent thoughts associated with men being better to men being equal.	episode_done:True

text:Dressing for “housework” vs “working from my house”	labels:Same wardrobe, except that if I'm doing something like cleaning the bathroom or kitchen floors or using bleach, I'll wear a ratty t-shirt and old yoga pants instead of nicer loungewear, just because I don't want to get stained. I don't wear shoes at home unless I'm on the bike (converted for use indoors).	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:When I had to buy business/work clothes, I invested in a really nice, fitted black suit, a couple of collared shirts, and a pair of flats. Those were my basic essentials that I knew I could mix and match with a lot of stuff. Everything else I picked up at Goodwill.   My coworkers commented on my cute clothes so I think it was a great strategy. I collected a pretty huge work closet for practically pennies.  After that, I've never had a clothing budget. My closet is a pretty good deterrent of overspending because I hate clutter and I hate having a crammed closet so if I think I dont have room and an item I'm looking at isn't worth creating room in my closet, I dont buy it.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:Honestly, I don't.  The 2013 factory explosion taught me that it wasn't just the Forever 21s of the world, but higher-end brands were made in the same conditions.  And ethical fashion is generally not anything that I would wear.  The styles tend to be very boxy and earth tones, neither of which flatter me.  I'm not going to go out of my way to wear expensive ugly clothes.
text:There's a lot more selection than you think! Though it is hard to track down, but there is more to fair trade clothing than just the Reformation minimalist look. A good example is Lucy and Yak, very bright clothes, and a reasonable price (or at least, what used to be considered a reasonable price before fast fashion redefined that). Pact has a lot of basics for good prices, kinda meh on the fabrics but they're kind of like old navy quality. There's a lot of sites now, the issue is just finding em all cause I mean they're usually smaller businesses obv.  Spending more definitely does not mean ethical though, that's a point that so many people miss. Basically, unless a clothing brand explicitly advertises their labour practices... It's probably made for pennies. Because really, that's such a good advertisement, why wouldn't they broadcast that? (But even then it's still not necessarily ethical, but at least it's more likely to be.)	labels:And even broadcasting fair labor practices doesn't mean the dye was ethically sourced. Many colors only come in specific ways which are highly toxic. Hence the stereotype of ethical clothing being well, not appealing in colors.	episode_done:True

text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:Can we talk about shoes too? I am a shoe enthusiast and I want to hear other people's perspectives on designer shoes. I can definitely see that very expensive brands are made better. I was thrifting in Austin and I found the most beautiful bright yellow boots (the brand escapes me now), but they were originally $1000 and the thrift store owner was selling them for $600. They were... exquisite. I mean I've never seen anything like them. And the leather was just buttery. I honestly was hypnotized. Unfortunately I can't afford $600 shoes. But I've bought designer shoes before and I'm usually disappointed by how long they last! Does anyone see a difference between brands that are made well and brands that last and do you find that the two don't necessarily last?
text:Assuming that the shoe is made well, I think whether a shoe lasts, is comfortable, is worth it, etc, is highly dependent on your feet and how you walk. I always scuff my toes because of how I walk but I don't get holes in my shoes, whereas this may be totally different for someone else.  I personally find Jimmy Choos extremely comfortable and would happily spend extra money for a pair of heels I'll be using a lot.   My Common Projects are the most uncomfortable sneakers I've ever worn and I would not buy another pair, even though they show little wear and tear after much use.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I rarely dry clean, even things that aren't washable.  Combination of hand-wash, steaming, and dryel sheets.  I usually only dry clean if something gets a stain I can't get out, or if I want a suit pressed and I'm too lazy to do it myself.  Things like blazers I'll dry clean maybe 1-2 times per year.
text:Steaming!  Getting a steamer is such a life hack	labels:how does that work? that just gets wrinkles out, not actually clean them, right?

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:I was taught a lot about matching colors, matching style, feminine outfits.     I wish I was rather taught to use clothes as an extension of my self, apply creativity and not strive to look appealing to others but rather have fun with clothes myself. Having said that I also understand that my parents had to plan only several outfits with those few things they possessed back then. I just wish I was taught it is OK to try styles out which suit my personality more, rather than "to look good".	episode_done:True
text:The best sweatpants — 11 pairs tested (full post in comments)	labels:$150 for what I am essentially going to wear to bed seems a little expensive, when historically most of my pajamas have been homemade.  Are people actually wearing sweatpants outside the house? To me that's sort of a sign of giving up on life.
text:You got pics of these homemade pyjamas??  I'd wear sweatpants if I was running around the corner or to pick up a package or something. Other than that I basically go between bed, the sofa and my desk (which is also in my apartment...), thus the motivation to find some quality sweatpants lol	labels:>You got pics of these homemade pyjamas??  Lol, no.  My mom and mother in law are both avid sewers, and my Mom in  particular is getting up in years. She's made all my pajamas ever since I was a baby. She still does.  This year for Christmas, I asked for homemade napkins, quilts, tablecloths, placemats, pajamas, curtains, and several other homemade things. One day, she is going to no longer be alive and I want to have things around me that she made so I can remember her until the end of my days comes.  Even for work from home, I wear pants, a buttonup shirt, and a sweater. I was WFH before Covid, and dressed that way then too. I get a little judgy of people who walk around wearing sweatpants. These days when I work out I just take off my shirt and change my shoes.
text:Holy shit you mother in law sounds like a textile machine!   Sometimes I wear decent clothes for wfh, but there's not always time for that when I roll out of bed a 9.15 and the team's standup is at 9.30	labels:Yeah, they do good stuff.  I also have several scrap rugs that my sister in law makes.  Recently, my Mom repaired my Dad's baby quilt. That doesn't sound huge, except I'm 37, my father was 50 when I was born, and that quilt was made before he was born by his mother and grandmother. It was originally sewn in the late 1920's. It's very close to a century old.  My house looks a bit like a Grandmother's house, I guess (except for all the video games and geeky tech stuff) but I wouldn't have it any other way. Fun work from home fact: hanging a quilt on your wall works almost as well as some of the sound damping panels you can buy, and if you already have the quilt, you just pay for the hangers. Of course, it does give your house more of that Grandma aesthetic.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 01, 2020	labels:I'm planning on gaining muscle mass , I'm currently 186cm and 67kg(lean) and aim on getting around the 75- 77kg mark. I've been wanting to buy a leather jacket and have now found the perfect one. Most size small jackets fit me perfectly but , considering I'll be piling on some size, I don't want to outgrow something I love. Should I buy small, as it's consistently advised to size down on leather jackets, or go for a medium. Keeping in mind that I'll keep this bulk as lean as possible. Thank you.
text:Over the summer I started to bulk up also, and what I was noticing was that, although my chest size remained relatively the same (maybe marginally tighter), I felt that the shoulders in my coats and shirts  got *really* tight.  Honestly, I would either (1) wait until after you bulk up and try the jacket on afterwards, or (2) buy one size up now to get ahead of the bulk (but you would run the risk of oversizing or undersizing). Hope this helps!	labels:Thanks!	episode_done:True

text:Hiking Aesthetic - Functionality vs. Fashion	labels:One brand I really like which I haven't seen suggested here yet is Duluth Trading. Prices aren't bad and they frequently have sales. I've had trouble finding hiking pants that don't look frumpy or fit poorly, since I usually need a curvy fit/high rise which is never available for hiking/work pants. Duluth Trading has options with high rise that fit curvier figures, while still managing to look modern. They also have a bunch of 100% cotton clothing at a decent price.  For shoes...functionality is always going to trump fashion. However, I do like the look of my Merrells. I have a pair of hiking boots and a pair of trail runners, purchased both on Amazon for less than $40 and they've lasted a really long time.	episode_done:True

I wear a lot of high waist loose/straight leg pants now. Most of my pants aren't jeans either. I've really gotten into other fabrics.	episode_done:True

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:Get xl size lingerie bags (I got mine on amazon), wash everything delicate in them with cold water and hang/lay flat to dry. I wash silk, cashmere, and wool like this regularly and never dry clean anything. My washer doesn't even have a delicate setting and this works great.   Don't buy rayon, it shrinks in water. Spot cleaning and hanging in an airy place to air items out, especially outerwear/wool, helps go longer between cleanings. If you have to wear full suits everyday this is probably not as applicable though, so ymmv!
text:I second this.  All my silk shirts go into a delicate bag and get washed in cold or warm then hung dry on hangars.  No wrinkles and no dry clean bill.  Wools get worn over other things multiple times and then hand wash or delicate washed in cold w wool light	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Shopping for clothing items you already own: confessions of an outfit repeater	labels:I walk a LOT - like 10km a day or more - and with my awkwardly shaped feet it's hard to find shoes that stand up to this and also feel comfortable all day.  Once I find something that works I buy multiples for fear they'll be discontinued. So I have a couple of pairs of unworn (now no longer made) Merrell trail runners in addition to the two pairs I currently rotate, and I scan Ebay regularly for more. Plus several Hogan Interactives and Golden Goose Superstars, which I'm trying to wean myself off as the price has rocketed recently.  I tend to do this less with clothes, as fashions change, and I don't want to be stuck with a wardrobe full of unworn dupes of yesterday's it-pieces. But I will never say no to a piece of Uniqlo Heattech on deep discount, so as it never wears out I now have enough to kit out an Arctic expedition.

text:How has lockdown affected new purchases?	labels:In the first few months, with nothing to do, I definitely dropped a bit on purchases to take advantage of shoulder season sales and just being bored. But then being home forced me to start actually wearing my entire closet, which was nice. Discovered some things I didn't forget I had, but forgot how nice they were. And now I've really reached that feeling where my wardrobe is pretty full.  Since then, with the gyms back open, and having started a running program, all I buy now is active wear. Especially since with my office partially open (mostly no in-person client meetings so it's just me and my partners here) I continue to just dress in active wear for the most part. Now that's all I want to buy. I still browse the new drops but nothing really is appealing to me right now except active wear.	episode_done:True

Everyone dressed the way you would for temple but in black or other dark colors. Modest, nothing flashy, nice enough. Most men wore suit separates. I think I wore a plain black quarter-sleeve dress. I would skip heels if you are going to the cemetery after (grass).   My husband's grandmother's funeral in rural New Mexico was a lot weirder. People didn't necessarily wear black. Some people were in suits and the way I would dress for a funeral. Other people wore jeans and bolo ties. It was at a funeral home and not a place of worship, though the service was very Christian (at least to me, who has only been to Jewish funerals).	episode_done:True

text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:A denim miniskirt with buttons all the way up the middle in the front that is actually fitted on me. Most of them kind of flare out below the butt and the waist is too large (not a humble brag, a genuine problem). I usually wear a 24 waist in jeans.	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:I LOVE Aerie leggings!

text:I bought a Kenzo tee last year at approx. 100 USD. Such a waste of my money.	labels:The reason why I don't buy any those type of shirts is because 99% people think it's fake. It's not that it would mather what they think, but it's still a kick in the butt anyway. I am talking about those t-shirts with all the big logos on it, not those subtle ones. I have a Gucci shirt that is really simple, has that signature stripe around the neck (small one at that point).	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 13, 2020	labels:Hello I dress like shit and have been on a YouTube street wear binge. My question is where are good some good brands in my price range. Budget is around $250 per piece. I want to move away from stuff like Patagonia
text:This is not at all descriptive enough. What are you looking for?	labels:Brands whose items range $100 - $300. So essential brands and stores a tier above Zara?
text:Zara would cost... Billions? Of dollars. You won't be able to buy a brand for $300.  Are you looking for pants? A jacket? A streetwear statement piece of indeterminate nature?	labels:Tops and bottoms. I do not mind spending a larger sum on a coat and footwear.
text:Alright, well take a look at 18 East. Most pieces are at the low end of your price range and like four or five notches above Zara. (Zara is bottom-of-the-barrel quality).	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What was your first 'expensive' fashion purchase?	labels:Mine was the pink Travelling Cupcake Dress from Modcloth. It as sixty dollars, which to teenage me was a lot of money. I mean, it's still a decent amount of money now, but it felt like even more back then. I probably wore it to school at least a couple times a month, with a white cardigan so that I wouldn't get sent home for showing my shoulders and, I don't know, sending all the guys into swooning fits or something? Now I don't have to follow school dress codes so I wear it in the summer with no cardigan and show off those pasty delts to the world.	episode_done:True

I finished and arrived around 8:20 just to get a message from the team leader that they had a massive error in production and had to call it off.

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash.

(Though to be fair I have seen some holes lol).	episode_done:True
text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:Most perfumes and fragrances give me bad headaches, with some exceptions that I can't really identify, but it's usually very soft natural smells that blend together. My guess is that there's a particular ingredient or two that's common (but not ubiquitous) in fragrances that sets me off. When I can smell somebody's perfume or body products, it's mostly a negative from me, unless it's one of the "lucky few". Deodorant is the worst, though, it goes straight into the sinuses and stays there. Unscented anti-perspirant all the way, if anything. I wish people would just be comfortable being clean with very little else going on.  That said, I don't have issues with essential oils, so when I want to be fancy, I use a concoction I mixed up in beeswax that's a mix of wild thyme, fir tree and a tiny hint of lavender. It's a kind of solid perfume that reminds me of hiking through the mountains in the summer and puts me at ease
text:Your homemade perfume sounds amazing! Did you melt the beeswax to mix in the oils?	labels:Yes, I melt the wax first and I also added some olive oil to be a bit more spreadable - I know it has a faint smell of it's own, but I felt it would all sort of go together. I don't smell it at all, though. I was just loosely following some online tutorial, TBH  Edit: Some essential oils can be phototoxic or irritating to the skin, though	episode_done:True
text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:I'm a bit (read: a LOT) of a clothes hoarder. It's my number one online shopping weakness, I love hand-me-downs and hand-me-ups, etc etc.  I recently had to move and re-evaluate my wardrobe. Previously, I was holding on to anything and everything I liked, even if it didn't fit me or didn't work on my body type or was 15 years old, or was irreparably damaged (a wax spill and numerous seam rips come to mind). For the first time, I got rid of things I objectively like because realistically I hadn't and wouldn't use them or wear them for many years. There is NO reason to hang on to my younger sister's 6 year old Forever 21 dress just because I like the color....	episode_done:True
text:Bolero album because it's here whether you like it or not	labels:Wow I totally forgot about these things. You picked out some cute looks though.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:I think just occasionally you find something that fits perfectly and you just know! Sometimes it depends on the garment as some have more leeway than others. Giveaways for a bad fit are as already mentioned with shoulder seams etc. Buttons pulling, waistbands not being flat to the waist at the back etc	episode_done:True

text:How do we feel about see-through totes?	labels:I don't love them, but there are enough places in my life (pre covid) that require clear bags that I'm glad I have options! The first time I needed one, I found out last minute and the only one at Walmart (the only place open) was too large, so I literally used a Ziplock bag, lol...having different styles and shapes is definitely nice. But I don't use mine daily, just when I need to. I can't imagine if it were an everday purse?  Based on some responses, it doesn't seem like clear bag policies are universal? I'm American and have been dealing with them in one way or another for 10+ years, so I guess I just assumed everyone had a clear bag tucked away?
text:Aussie here. Our arenas are "no bag", rather than clear bag. The only place I've ever encountered that insisted on clear carrying-objects was high school state exams, for pencil cases. A lot of kids went for ziplock baggies, and I just shrugged and tied my most used stationeries together with a rubber band.	labels:	episode_done:True

Dressing up to look good = easy mode. Being comfy in your own home = easy mode. Comfy and looking good in front of cute girl = time to ask the experts.

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:When I was 14 and had just started working I saved up some money for a few months and bought a Michael Kors purse and matching wallet. My mom had gotten her first MK bag about a year before that so there was no way my parents were going to buy me one. Of course, being a 14 year old, I just wanted what the other girls at school had. So I got a blush pink crossbody with the matching wallet and I still use it to this day. I am very impressed with the quality 5-6 years later with somewhat consistent use.	episode_done:True

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.
text:This is the method I use as well. I have an Arcteryx non-insulated hard shell in black that I purchased 15 years ago (still going strong cause it's bulletproof). It is the only jacket I wear for skiing. If its -20C with windchill I just keep increasing layers. Dri-fit base, Merino wool (tight), Half zip merino wool (loose), heavy full zip fleece jacket, Arcteryx hardshell over top (adjusting the number of layers for conditions). For spring sking - the Arcteryx hardshell with Dri-fit base only. One Jacket to rule them all.	labels:You wear 2 base layers? That's nuts. I like it.  Right now I wear a merino base, a patagonia nano puff insulation layer, and a Helly Hansen Alpha jacket that is rated 3/6 on their site for warmth. I'm still too cold, and I don't see how in Canada anyone could get away with a lighter hard shell jacket.  In your case, with 5 layers, anything is possible.
text:In BC, for mountain hiking, I get by with three layers:  -	Uniqlo HeatTech base -	random merino sweater -	Arcteryx Atom LT  This has been fine for summits down to -5C, as moving definitely helps. Theowing on a Patagonia Better Sweater and a Beta LT helps for higher hikes and windier/colder days.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Style Lessons from Male-Presenting People: An Inspo Album	labels:These are all beautiful!

text:It sounds rank but I ruined a couple of pairs of cheap summer shoes wearing them every day with no socks. It builds up and they really do become gross. At the end of the summer I discovered no-show socks and it was a huge _"OH"_ moment.	labels:Honestly you can always clean them if you want to, though.
text:in my experience, once they get the smell, there's no washing it out. even after washing, baking soda, the freezer, you wear them once after cleaning and the heat and sweat brings it out immediately again.	labels:Hydrogen peroxide? Bleach? Nothing works?   damn.
text:This is gonna be gross but put them in the freezer for a day or 2. The cold will kill the bacteria	labels:Cold does not, as a rule, kill bacteria.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 02, 2020	labels:How does one use an Iron without water in it?  Do I just use a spray water bottle on the side and spray my clothes?  Do I need to use the steam function if water is externally added to it?    Or do I press the steam function even when there's water I spray on the clothes to mimic the effects.  I'm very new to ironing.
text:Use a spray bottle. The steam button will do nothing if there's no water in the chamber.	labels:I see, so I can't get the benefits of the steam function unless I pour water into the iron?     The spray bottle will just act as a better technique than Dry Ironing.. but not as efficient as steaming, correct?
text:I don't think the steam function gives you much of a benefit over just spraying with water and ironing. Whenever I iron, I just get the clothes wet with a spray bottle and press (although I don't iron that often, see flair).	labels:Ok that makes sense.  I just saw a popular comments from a couple years ago stating they only buy cheap irons and don't put water in it so there's no chance of it eventually leaking.. which is apparently a huge problem with irons.    Wanted to see if people on here do the same thing.    Thanks man

text:I say don't worry about your scars. I have scars on my ankle from surgeries due to a broken ankle, and if I hid them I'd be wearing mid calf socks all year long. I know midriff scars are on a more noticeable part of your body, but I think you should work on being less self consious of them so you can wear the styles you want. If the scars bother someone, its on them not on you!	labels:I don't know if I'm self conscious or I just don't want anyone pointing at it and asking and having to tell the whole story! I wrestle with the idea of showing them or not
text:I have very obvious sh scars on my forearms and thighs that I never hid. Most people don't ask. In like 6 years I've only gotten questioned three times and 2 of those were just high schoolers being stupid.   Point being, do what makes you feel comfortable but 99% of people have enough of a brain to not mention stuff like that and if they do they're just random dicks. Wearing whatever you like is really freeing.	labels:	episode_done:True

Its usually big and bulky and filled with junk, haha  But if I'm going somewhere "special" (date, art gallery opening, wedding, etc) I'll be a bit more intentional with how the purse matches the outfit. I still don't do matchy-matchy, but I make sure it all looks a piece of the same puzzle...	episode_done:True

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:As an 'old' (read: early 30s) this sounds like a young people's problem. (Please hear me out)  Fashion trends cycle a lot more frequently in the 18-25 demographic, and honestly, once I was in the working world, absolutely nobody seemed to care about my work clothes other than they were professional/appropriate. And in the 30s, people start to look 'old' because they end up sticking to the trends that were popular when they were younger and somehow nobody tells them anything. But that's okay if it's what they really like.   I have coworkers that wear beautiful trendy outfits, some that wear hoodies, and others that have a uniform that is easy to choose. If you're tired from decision fatigue, it's something that you can choose to opt out of with few repercussions. Fashion should be fun and not a burden.	episode_done:True
text:Have your clothing purchases dramatically dropped now that we can't go anywhere?	labels:I've been buying more than ever before.

The top I think would look really fun layered over a form fitting tube dress and then paired with some flat trainers.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 15, 2021	labels:How to stop nylon pants from being so noisy?  So I bought these nylon cargo pants which I like the look of, but the one thing is that they are SUPER loud and it's very annoying. Does anybody have any experience with loud pants and know a way to reduce the noise or should I just return them since I haven't taken the tag off?  I saw one person online say that washing them a few times makes the fabric softer and makes it quieter, can anyone confirm? I don't wanna take the tags off to try that unless I know it works for sure. Thanks!
