text:Well, but bespoke tailors can do anything. They all have a house style, and maybe the Haute Couture brands do something a given house won't replicate, but unless theres' something really unique happening, you'll probably be able to find *some* house that can make you at least as happy. Probably.  The real issue with Bespoke is just the amount of time it takes.	labels:I think I see what you mean. Bespoke tailors are great pattern-makers so they can theoretically copy anything. So if you show them a YSL/SLP or Dior coat, they should be able to make it for you. Some won't do that on principle. Some won't even copy a garment you own that's damaged or too small. It's also impossible for it to look the same because it'll be a different pattern. If what you want is an exact copy of something, you're better off buying the thing and tailoring it	episode_done:True
text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:Split the difference. Some top houses have a very discreet bespoke line that blends bespoke fit with the adventure of couture, only for those in the know. Hermes *sur mesure* and Berluti in particular. There are also particularly progressive bespoke tailors that push the envelope in design, materials and construction at the top end: Davide Taub at Gieves and Hawkes; Michael Browne; Cifonelli.	episode_done:True
text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:He could by a ready made coat and take it to a tailor and have it altered to  fit him better.    I don't see why a good tailor can't make something that looks as good as a Dior or YSL RTW coat.  Would you say a Savile Row coat would look like something from J Crew?	episode_done:True
text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:Here's a different point of view... I'd take a serious look at two categories beyond the bespoke / haute couture options.  First, my preference is for the Italian tailoring houses. Kiton, Zegna, Loro Piana, and Etro Milano etc.  First, they are more male / menswear oriented. And their materials and tailoring are exceptional and can be altered or mtm if needed. I have a Loro Piana Icer in cashmere that's beyond mere mortals. Of course, $4,000 won't get you very far - - but the quality is a level beyond the French design houses.   Second, depending on his design taste (and if I was younger) I'd consider the younger brands like CP Co, Rick Owens, Acne Studios, etc to see if they are more in tune with my desired look.	episode_done:True

text:Good luck puma!  I'm at the same point with my wardrobe. I have all the basics covered and want to buy more cool shit, but cool shit is expensive. So I settle for shit that isn't as cool but still serves it's purpose, i.e. I have clark's wallabees instead of paraboots, uniqlo raws, and a lands end barn coat instead of a barbour. Of course I could just save up money to get the nicer shit that I really want, but that would mean copping less shit altogether which I was unwilling to do.

text:I started doing around the beginning of the pandemic. There are several vintage/thrift shops near me, and for like two years they were my go-to for outerwear and the occasional shirts and pants. But it's so easy to start picking things up just because they're cheaper, and not be happy with them just a couple months down the line...  I've got maybe three or four real gems that I still wear from vintage hunting, but everything else has been donated or sold. I'm much happier with my wardrobe now, especially since I started to invest in nicer stuff. I'm wishing you all the best through that transition!	labels:I have gotten a ton of cool shit from thrifting but it really is so easy to grab something for grabbing something’s sake. Especially going to the cheaper places in NYC like L train. Soon you’re taking back like 2 or 3 pieces a visit, that shit adds up quick.    Thank you!!!
text:Definitely. For me, I went to some of the shops enough that I'd chat with the owners when I stopped in. For sure I value the idea of supporting local businesses + building relationships with people who are hustling hard, but it also made it much harder to leave without picking something up haha	labels:Oh that’s what I do 100%.

text:[Inspiration] Jewelry	labels:Cool stuff. Looking at this got me wondering.  Every outfit there is definitely on the casual side. I’m always curious to see how it would look with business casual and business formal wear, without being over the top.  Working on Wall Street, the only jewelry I’ve seen are cuff links, watches, rings, and occasionally wrist beads or bracelets. There was one stylish black man who would wear diamond studs with suits but that’s about it.  Curious if anyone has examples of subtle jewelry with suits and business casual outfits.
text:During the height of #menswear people were copying many of the Italians and wearing multiple beaded and/or leather bracelets which are a bit more lowkey since they don’t shine like metal. A single signet ring on the pinky probably wouldn’t draw that much attention given the old-school tradition of it. And if you’ll allow me to plug myself a little bit, some of my waywt posts have me wearing some rings and bracelets even with my tailoring, though it may not be super visible. Metal jewellery primarily has the intent of being seen though, so you will be making a statement by combining it with tailoring.	labels:	episode_done:True

Imo full Yohji fits are some of the coolest and most comfortable looking out there; plus there’s Y-3 for athleisure.    Marni is a little bit of a left field choice but I really enjoy their use of colour and prints. It would make the wardrobe much more fun.	episode_done:True

text:No (New) Jawnz January: 2021 Edition	labels:When I'm really hyped up over a new garment I just found online, I ask myself this armor-piercing question: *Do I already own this?*  It forces me to shift gears out of hype mode and take a mental stock of my wardrobe. While I may not own an exact copy of the garment I'm considering buying, I probably own a piece that fulfills the same purpose already (with regards to utility or aesthetics), and if the comparison is too close with the new item then I know I should wait a week and see if I still feel the same attraction to it. In most cases this allows the glamour of novelty to fade, and I've saved myself money and a potential redundancy in my closet. It's helped me a lot over the years.	episode_done:True

I’m 15, slightly overweight and have a 2-3 inch belly that I hate. 6’0 is my height. Atm I’m trying to lose weight, but I don’t have enough self confidence to wear anything but a baggy sweatshirt and jeans to anywhere.  I’m looking for some ‘transition’ clothes, so I can start trying to find my style without ‘showing off’ my fat, if that makes sense. I’m not really sure how to explain this lol.  Are there any brands that are good w/ baggy clothes, if not what are some inspo sources that have sweatshirts, baggy clothes, etc.  I’m in the US, and have a budget of around $100, maybe $150. I’d have what you call a ‘Baby Face’, very uncooperative hair (which is always in a side part, just naturally), and zero self confidence lol.   TL;DR - overweight, hate it, have no self confidence and want to start finding my style without showing off fat. Need suggestions on styles w/ baggy sweatshirts, t shirts, or styles that are okay at hiding fat while I lose weight.  Mods, if this isn’t allowed here please let me know where to post it!

text:General Discussion - January 02, 2021	labels:I'm proud to say that I was successful completing my new year's resolution from 2020 of not purchasing any new clothing. I had made the exception of new socks and underwear, but I purchased a bunch at the end of 2019 and they managed to last me for the year.   I chose the goal initially to try and cut down on my waste. I'm a very impulsive person who makes very impulsive purchases and a lot of what I was buying was going practically untouched. I had also seen the patriot act episode regarding fast fashion and that was the final nail in the coffin. The beginning was the hardest—especially once the spring/summer sales started. I found that after a couple of days I'd forget about the sale and eventually I stopped even looking at clothes online and hunting for sales.  The effects from the resolution carried over to other aspects of my life. I found I was more conscientious of other products I was buying. I spent time researching environmental effects and labour practices of all sorts of different companies. I have been a lot more mindful of where my money is being spent. I cancelled my amazon prime subscription and have opted to shop locally as much as possible, but if not, spending my money at small independent online retailers.   At Christmas I did purchased my dad a new Reigning Champ sweater from NRML, an independent store in Ottawa. I made this exception  because it sets up my 2021 resolution—the only new clothes I can buy are slow made, or made in Canada/USA. I think this embodies the spirit of my 2020 resolution but doesn't restrict me from supporting smaller designers.

text:MFA's Own: 2020 Favorites	labels:Hi all,   With the wrap up of 2020, I decided to ask members of MFA to submit their favorite fits of which they’ve posted throughout the year. The range of styles and silhouettes presented here serves as a great reminder of the truly amazing variety we see in this community.   So c’mon, have a scroll through the album! Maybe not all the fits are your cup of tea, but they don’t have to be! Before you type out “why would someone even wear that,” just think maybe they like the way they look. Seeing as this is a collection of the users’ favorite fits from the year, I’d wager they really like the way they look. And, at the end of the day, if you feel good, you look good.   See y’all in 2021.

text:I've noticed a drop in new users over the pandemic. Nobody really needs advice right now on what to wear to a wedding, or for date night, or job interviews, or their first office job. Another drop the last week due to the holidays but overall the core community is still pretty active across GD, WAYWT, and some recent discussion posts.  As for old threads on the front page, I'm guessing that's because a lot of the discussion has been pushed to recurring mega threads like Simple Questions. There was an experiment earlier this year with allowing simple questions to be posted as self posts and it led to stuff only staying on the front page a few hours but overall quality of discussions and recommendations was a lot lower.	labels:GD, expectedly, has risen significantly in average activity I think (though not that many total unique users).	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 30, 2020	labels:I’m invited to a New Years indoor house party. This might seem simple and stupid for most, but I’m at a loss as to what I should wear.    I usually dress business casual, and I stand a lot. The pants I have aren’t very comfortable for rolling around in, or sitting casually (raw denim, tucked in shirt, etc) - to which at this party there will be food and drink, and lots of floor space to sit or lay (they have no furniture, and people usually just sit on the floor). Pretty casual, however I don’t want to look like a slob or over dress.   I know this is probably obvious as to why anyone would care if the environment is this chilled, but there’s a standard im trying to keep myself to.   Any suggestions - thanks.
text:I would think that the business casual you describe is very appropriate for a NYE party under normal circumstances. That being said, unless you live in New Zealand I can't help but think you'd be better off in sweats on your own couch this year.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Good quality men's jeans?	labels:Just wanted to reply that I'm a raw denim guy, but a lot of people are going to throw out raw denim recommendations to you.  One thing to be wary of.  Raw denim is unforgiving, so in the slimmer cuts I have found them **MORE** likely to have crotch blowouts than other jeans.    I've never had issues with crotch blowouts in your standard levis/gap/j. crew brands.  My first 2 pairs of raw denim had crotch blowouts, because I wore slim fits, and the point of tension is in the crotch.  My 21.5 oz and 16 oz raws had holes forming within 6 months.  I've since bought a pair of Samurai's in a straight cut and they seem as if they will last forever, but they are NOT slim.

text:Good quality men's jeans?	labels:> * The crotch tearing (this one's a reoccurring theme) * The dye running onto white shoes (probably the cheapest pair I've had has done this) * The jeans losing their shape/fit and turning loose  1. This happens when your thighs rub together and there's not enough fabric slack there. You may want to try sizing up at the thigh. Also, get a few pairs and rotate so that each pair only sees a third or a quarter of the wears instead of one pair getting it all.  2. This is called crocking, where indigo flakes off/falls off when abraded against something else. That's part of indigo, whether you're talking about jeans, jean jackets, etc. You can help remove excess dye with a wash and try a magic eraser on your shoes.  3. That's normal. The warp/weft weave will stretch out like a sweater after each wear, becoming noticeable in time. Wash them when they get too out of shape.
text:Your #1 tip is helpful, but my concern with sizing up is that I don't have a particularly large waist. My butt/thigh to waist ratio is a bit off in that I have naturally big thighs/a big butt compared to my waist. So if I simply sized up I would be quite loose at the waist. My jeans have already been a bit loose as is :(   As another redditor commented, I may have to look into the cut itself as to simply sizing up.   As for #2 and #3, thank you for clarifying. I've learned a lot in this post!	labels:Maybe experiment with types of fits, not just size. For example, Levi’s has the 541 athletic fit, Naked & Famous has the “Weird Guy”.

text:Good quality men's jeans?	labels:I've had one pair of jeans tear in the crotch in my entire adult life (it was a silly pair of Burberrys I had been gifted). I always wonder what people do that they get crotch tears so often. Rarely washing jeans also seems kind of meme-ified? They're just clothing; wash when necessary!   As someone who also favors slim-skinny jeans, chinos, etc., Rag & Bone is my absolute favorite "everyday" denim. The denim comes, or at least used to come, in different weights with a nice amount of stretch. Good range of colors as well. Fit 1 verges on being too skinny, but Fit 2 is perfect. R&B is always a bit overpriced at retail, but pretty easy to find on sale.   Saint Laurent during Slimane's tenure put out the sleekest, cleanest jeans and I love the pairs I have from that time, but I have no idea what the current offerings are like. I try to wear them a bit less frequently.	episode_done:True

text:Reigning Champ Hoodie: 2 months later	labels:OP, I think your experience is an outlier and not representative of the brand. I've owned 10+ items from RC over the past few years.  I only ever had one incident with a pair of sweatpants that developed a rip in the pocket in the first few weeks of wear. I sent RC an email explaining the situation, and they happily sent me a replacement pair and a prepaid label to have the defective pair shipped back. It's entirely possible the rip was my fault and I didn't notice (could've easily snagged it on something), but they took care of me.  I would try contacting them and see if they can do anything for you. At 2 months, it may be pushing it, but if you make an effort to articulate your situation, you might get a replacement. Mention that you took the advice of online fashion forums when you made your purchase and that you were surprised by the poor durability and that you think you may have gotten a defective item. It's always worth a shot!	episode_done:True

text:Reigning Champ Hoodie: 2 months later	labels:I have 3 hoodies/crewnecks from them + 4 tees and they've last 2 winters already. The tees get most wears and has some pills (mostly because I put them in dryer) but the collar is still in perfect shape.  I'd say you most likely beat it too hard or snag it somewhere. I've never got a hole in any hoodie (cheap or expensive) in my life.	episode_done:True
text:Reigning Champ Hoodie: 2 months later	labels:Often times, cheaper, more utilitarian fabrics are more durable. While I can't speak to RC's quality as I have never owned any of their stuff, terry-cloth is generally a softer material and can be more likely to abrade. So if you are like me and place a lot of weight on your elbows while seated at a chair with armrests (esp if you have pointy elbows), then you might find that you develop holes there and so you either change up how you sit or you realize that you need something that will work with your use-case (denser weave material or maybe reinforced elbows/elbow patches). Not dissimilar to how some people put holes in socks more easily than others. Shape of your body and how you do normal, everyday things can impact how things wear on you.    More expensive does not mean more durable. These are not the same thing and it's something that people really need to stop using as a reason to spend more on something. Durability \*can\* be a high-quality product's claim to fame, but is certainly not generalized to everything.    Durability is also not a measure of quality. It can be part of why you consider something to be "quality", but that's up to you what you want from your garments. Unfortunately, you don't know what you don't know, and going by what people recommend means that you're basing your purchasing decisions on other people's preferences. Fashion can be an expensive hobby and there is a lot of trial and error as you learn about yourself and about the various things that go into making a garment.	episode_done:True

text:How to Talk About Collared Shirts	labels:Brilliant guide, must have taken a lot of work to put it together so thanks for all the effort you've gone to.  Would it be worth a mention on sloped shoulders?  I went through loads of brands and fits (even custom) because every shirt I wore would fit well in most areas, but I would always be left with big diagonal creases from my collarbone.  It was only the last custom company I found, asked me if I had sloped shoulders.  Turns out they are quite severely sloped which was the cause of all my issues.  Nice to see wool mentioned as a material, its not very common but is brilliant for shirts.  My mum found a Ralph lauren Polo shirt on sale in a department store about 7 years ago, it was reduced to £15 so she just bought it.  It was originally for my dad but was too small so I got it instead.  It's pure wool, heavy, but feels like silk and breathes brilliantly.  The fit is perfect and it never needs ironing.  Only problem I have now is that I've worn it so much that the button holes aren't as secure.  I've added a bit of weight too so they are prone to popping open when I sit/stand!	episode_done:True

text:Athleisure button down shirts	labels:I've had good experience with Twillory shirts.  Good stretch and it travels really well.  I find that it may wrinkle a little but if you spray with a water bottle and let dry it'll come out.  My biggest complaint is that I'm normally a 14.5 / 32 with a 38 chest and 31 waist, and i think i'm in between sizes so mine are a little oversized at 15 and 32/33 (since they don't make a one number sleeve length) rather than my buttons popping off.    I haven't brought myself to buy any of the others since they are 40% more at best and if you buy 2 or more you can get the same as the others but a 2 for 1.  I've tried on mizzen and main but they are just way too big for me even at their small / trim size.  You could find those on nordstrom earlier this year for less than $100.	episode_done:True

Problem is, the algorithms picked u on it and I keep seeing ads for exactly the clothes I want, but they all reveal themselves to be clones of the same outlets as the same items and site issues appear.

text:the capes thread really triggered the entirety of Reddit it seems.   I’m not sure why people get so worked up by inspo albums and runway articles. There is tons of content on MFA that is mainstream. The entire daily question thread is full of basic advice for newcomers. The sidebar is like terabytes of slim fits and OCBDs. Articles from non avant-garde blogs like Die Workwear and Put This On are linked to every week.   I am one of the most conservative guys here ( fashion wise, not political before anyone freaks) and there is tons of content I enjoy.    I mean just Ignore  what you don’t like and create  and consume what you do.   Also sometimes not being in an echo chamber is a good thing. A really good thing.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 24, 2020	labels:Hey hey—I bought two pairs of Uniqlo slim fit jeans, waist 35"—and they've both failed by fabric separation in the crotch. They were on sale, they used Kaihara denim, and were made in Bangladesh. My first thought is that fit is the probable culprit, because two pairs in a row is a lot. I've bulked up in the past few years and decided to fit waist to hips rather than actual waist, which probably explains the failure right there—although 35" jeans in other brands didn't have the same failure point, and took much longer to fail. (When I was thinner, I got a lot longer than 10 weeks out of a pair of Uniqlo jeans.)  (Disclosure: My hips are 34"; my waist is currently a mighty 42", 39" at full intake. I'm open to sizing there if anyone thinks it's possible for a denim waist not to migrate downward.)  What's my best option? Should I:  a.) size up 2-3 inches (to hips) to get a more accommodating fit, but still get slim-fit jeans  b.) size up 2-3 inches and abandon slim-fit jeans  c.) size up 2-3 inches and switch to jeans made in Japan, whether slim-fit or not, or  d.) size up to my full waist size and wear my jeans higher?  Losing weight isn't a bad option, either…but I'm not going to lose it overnight, and I'm fresh out of jeans without holes! (I'm going to have to re-stitch an old pair for now. 😅)	episode_done:True

text:How to combine colors	labels:Not another skin color post	episode_done:True
text:How to combine colors	labels:To be honest, a lot of these resources read like the kind of infographics MFA used to upvote; there's the trifecta of pseudo-objective diagrams (e.g. color wheels), dubious pop-psychology (e.g. colors' subconscious associations), and simple but misleading theory (e.g. "seasonal" color schemes) for lurkers looking for 'rules' to bind them.  And like those infographics, I feel that most of these are, at best, an attempt to transform the act of "looking at things and using your brain" into tractable but useless theory (compare: any time someone tries to create a head-shape matrix for glasses), and at worst pretty much junk (particularly the psychology bits). They're also usually based on the fucky assumption that a conventional white American beauty standard is objectively "correct."  Prevailing trends and cultural/subcultural context are way more meaningful determinants of how to use color than a set of temporally/culturally specific rules, and frankly I think the only way to understand those is experience: looking, doing, and thinking. "Caucasians shouldn't wear all black because it offsets their undertone and makes their skin look less vibrant," for instance, sounds reasonable up till you look at actual people who look perfectly fine in it.	episode_done:True

Also, if your primary goal is to see which colors match, don't limit yourself to looking at male clothes, women's section are often bigger if not more extensive than the men's selection; thus they're bound to have larger varieties of color coordinations.

text:How to combine colors	labels:Having read a dozen of these articles, I'm not about to read a dozen more, watch multiple videos, et cetera.  The most obvious flaw in most articles I've seen on this topic is a broad lack of photos. In some others, the flaw is that the photos in no way illustrate the point.  I skipped through one of those videos. It briefly showed the woman being made over in black, and then, at the end of the video, in green. Most of the video seemed to involve large amounts of makeup, which I don't entirely understand -- won't heavy makeup change her skin tone, thus fighting the practice of trying to match clothing to her skin tone? Strategically manipulating one of these things in light of the other two is one impossibility -- strategically manipulating all three variables at the same time serves no experimental purpose, and, in the end, still doesn't really seem to make her look much better. She just goes from being a slight goth to an ordinary woman. Perhaps there would be a point if I bothered to watch the video, but I doubt it.  Is there an article you have that illustrates its point visually? Not just writing out a point and putting irrelevant pictures next to it, but actually having relevant pictures that make the point clear. Don't give me another list, because I would just pick one at random again -- please, just give me one good one.

text:How to combine colors	labels:OP this isn't directed towards you specifically, but the biggest issue with color theory stuff I have is the lack of why. Nobody can tell me why these colors don't work with this undertone besides saying that color isn't suited for that undertone and then when you push further what they mean is that color generally makes people of that undertone look more yellow which we associate with being sick to which I have to ask why that matters if you can tell the person isn't sick (edit: I also don't agree with this statement that yellowing in a person's skin makes them look sickly people don't change skin color because of illness unless you have gout or something).   I guess what I'm getting at is the premeditated goal when talking about color theory almost always seems to be less about how/why colors work and more here's how to look most conventionally attractive and that's an issue because then these guides can become prescriptive real fast and new users then cling to these rules and it stunts creativity.

text:Lurker concept of dressing better is dressing “good” in a mainstream sense. Something that is restrained without being flashy. Something that other guys will say “cool jacket!” But won’t be scary to wear.   It’s how the basic Bastard came around. Inoffensive but still good.   It’s hard to talk to my friend who clearly wants to dress better and cooler but just can’t. He loves all the stuff I wear cause it’s cool and preppy (he’s also New England born and bred) but he’s in the more jock/frat category than I am (engineering nerd/artsy) and I think the idea of stepping too far out of line will be met with ridicule. I don’t really notice that stuff cause I’ve been doing it for so long, but for him even a new jacket or sneakers is really stretching it and he’s hesitant to step away from normal guy stuff.	labels:Yeah, I think I fall into the trap of dressing like this for so long that it’s sorta second nature at this point.

I can don the wolf shirts all I want, but it doesn’t change the fact that because it isn’t who I was born, it’s something I’ll never be. The same goes for most of the people on this subreddit who, by most accounts, even detest and reject the trappings of class that can not be divorced from euphoria. It is a style of, by, and for the American lower basement class and below, and nothing you say will change that.   It’s literally a costume for most of the people on this sub, and frankly, it’s subversive and I despise it.
text:What have I done?	labels:Here's the thing. You said a "trilby is a fedora."  Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a haberdasher who studies classy hats, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls trilbies fedoras. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying "fedora family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of fedorae, which includes things from porkpies to safari hats to cool indiana jones hats.  So your reasoning for calling a trilby a fedora is because random people "call the classy hats fedoras?" Let's get pith hats and tricorns in there, then, too.  Also, calling something a duster or trench coat? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A trilby is a trilby and a member of the fedora family. But that's not what you said. You said a trilby is a fedora, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the fedora family fedoras, which means you'd call porkpies, Safari hats, and other hats fedoras, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 22, 2020	labels:Why are hooded garments almost never modeled with the hood up?   I  keep my head shaved (bald) and prefer hoods to hats. Part of my problem  is a lot of hoods don't land far enough forward on my head so I want to  see them modeled with the hood up. Most of my problem is that when I'm  shopping online about 90% of hooded garments are not modeled with the  hood up. It seems intentional, anyone know why?  Admittedly I want my hood to fall farther forward than most might, like to my  eyebrows, but most of what I order and see online, when they are  modeled, land with the edge behind the top of the forehead. I get that  this is consistent with the hat trend of wearing the edge behind the  hairline, for whatever reason, but I'm looking for function over style.	episode_done:True

I can’t quite describe why I think they’re dorky but I will say that most people I see wearing transitions just aren’t very fashionable people. To stereotype a bit, these people mostly fall under the dorky/nerdy types and tend to be older people as well.  Of course, it could simply be that people who like transition glasses tend to be less concerned about appearances and value functionality more. If you’re confident about your overall look, I don’t think transition glasses would look bad at all.   Now if you’re a so-so or horrible dresser, transition glasses become more of an eye sore.	episode_done:True

text:Weird, well I don't give a shit about people's opinion, I'll slap em if they think I'm a dork lol  But yeah, weird how people perceive things  I know 1 thing though, I don't understand people wanting tablets when you have a laptop and a phone, why have this middle something that's neither of those and can't do the job of either  I'm thinking transition falls there, if you r going out knowing it's sunny, just put prescription sunglasses and if you go indoor, well who cares...but this in between thing, idk how deal breaking it is...it's like having your phone change brightness automatically depending on brightness outside, which is turned off for me haha	labels:Tablets are invaluable for my work/school (coding). Serves as a secondary screen when I’m traveling, makes reading pdfs/books easier and also allows me to manually trace/write code when I want to, something I wouldn’t be able to do with a phone or a laptop. :)	episode_done:True
text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:Like others have mentioned, it’s entirely how you feel about your look and ultimately your decision when it comes down to it. However my advice would be against it, I find that while they try to be the best of both worlds with glasses and sunglasses they just end up being a worse version of either. Either they’re bad sunglasses because the glasses part is small, or they’re weird looking glasses because it’s a big sunglasses frame. As well I personally find the awkward grey tinge they have in the “mid” light conditions to be very tacky/dorky looking. Like many others have said, with the price of cheap frames now a days you can just get a cheaper pair of both. Prescription sunglasses or contacts for days you need sunglasses is likely the better option for you.
text:Yeah after all the advice I got here and your to top it off, I think you are on point  This is why, my store has two sizes 51 and 53, 53 looks big on me, I need 51 as I wear 52 usually anyways  but if I go with transition, the guy told me I should get 53, as the transition on 51 would make it look smaller  &#x200B;  so yeah, you are on point here, it will look either bad as sunglasses cuz it's small or bad as eyeglasses cuz it's big  &#x200B;  I ended up choosing 51 eyeglasses, and then I will just get prescription sunglasses on the side by changing one of the old lenses on my frame - I think that's the best way to go on about this, transitional glasses are like tablets - neither a phone nor a laptop  &#x200B;  Thanks for the advice, I might make a new post later black plastic frames what sunglass lens colour to get	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:I thought transitional lenses were cool in middle school. This kid Dane had blue ones. Nowadays I think they look tacky, I’d rather get prescription aviators or wayfarers, personally. They’re timeless in style.
text:>tacky  There is a model for this one with a metal piece running above the nose - sorta more aviator like, but yeah aviator looks really good on me, but I would want prescription sunglasses for aviators - they need that dark tint I think, but you are right wayfarers and aviators are timeless and that's what I am going for really - no extra stuff  &#x200B;  I think these frames are pretty classic and timeless, but it's not because of the looks I am choosing it - it's the most lightweight glasses in the market right or one of them	labels:Yeah, aviator styles prescription glasses are basically grandpa glasses.  I’d be careful choosing lightweight frames, especially if they cost a lot because it’s easier to damage. All it takes is one drunk night to wake up with an arm bending at 90 degrees.
text:Yup - grandpa style, think the same haha  So do you think on these frames the gray colour would look dorky/nerdy? or idk enhance the look? that's the 2 sides of argument I am getting  &#x200B;  I am pretty good with my frames, but yeah they are super light weight and well titanium, so technically they can be fixed again idk how much it would cost, but I am pretty good with that (and would probably carry a hard case in a bagpack when doing some adventures)	labels:I guess depending on your face shape these glasses will look good. Rounder frames typically call for more angular/defined faces, otherwise they will accentuate the curve of your face.  As far as transitional go I would skip it on these frames. They got like a Morpheus kinda matrix vibe
text:Haha yes thank you that's what they remind me off too Morpheus, and again I don't want to go into that realm of weird fashion, disco/idk what to even call it...these on me look so good, that I personally think adding anything to them like slight tint might take away it's character - or who knows maybe enhance it as other claim  Face is oval mostly with faded beard sharpening the jaw a bit. I don't do full rounds, I do these oval shapes mostly, works nice, aviator looks nice too...full round is not for me, looks harry potter like	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:Glasses are cheap enough now (via something like warby Parker) where you can experiment with this style and see if you make it work or not.   As a fellow glasses user - I treat my glasses as an accessory. I have 10 pairs I alternate between (though truly 2-3 in heavy rotation). Warby Parker changed the game and made this possible.   So you do you man - see if you can make it work and if not then well you have a pair you can use at home :)  Me personally? I have prescription sunglasses and glasses for separate occasions haha if these are more than warby prices I personally would not opt for transitions  Hope this helps!
text:>Warby Parker  I thought I had enough frames haha  I have a similar plastic ones like the Warby Parker already - will be making them sunglasses as the prescription on them is old  &#x200B;  but for these frames, they are expensive yes, but for a good reason really (and I don't mind paying cuz I wear glasses 14-17 hours and won't be doing eye surgery anytime soon)  ...I think like you, in terms of having sunglasses on the side - and prescription seperate  What concerns me the most is the looks - if it will be ruined, having silver frames and some transitions on an expensive frame, most of my family tells me don't do those gimmicks, but 1 is like it might be cool and enhance the look of the shiny silver frame? idk	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:Friends of ours were married in a beautiful 200 year old timber church on a gorgeously sunny day in the middle of a perfect winter.  The bride wore glasses, they were transitions, and the light streaming through the stained glass caused them to change colour. Every shot of her during the ceremony looked as though she was wearing sunglasses. I don't like transitions.
text:That's really funny, I was thinking about photos outdoor too, and decided that even if it might be cool sometimes with slight tint, I think it's better to put some aviator sunglasses and rock that on a photo instead if you r going for that look in a photo  Idk I think they are a good tech/idea, but not quite there yet	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:I’ve had them on and off since the 90s...

As others have mentioned glasses are pretty cheap nowadays so getting spare shades is the way to go. At the moment my back up pair is transition. Oh and no one will ever notice or care that your glasses are transition, and people don’t actually have an opinion on them. Also— when you’re inside they’re completely clear like regular glasses.
text:No for sure, you are right it definetly is wroth it I think  It's just for me, it came down to look, if I get transition I had to go 1 size up, so I could have sunglass look, but when it turns white it would look kinda big on me indoors and I didn't want that as I am more indoor than outdoor  If I got my size, then transitions as sunglasses would look small on me outdoor, and would give me this Matrix Morpheus look, plus taking photos - not always do I want shades, I want my eyes to speak  &#x200B;  but yeah if you have big frames already, and mostly plastic, transition would work, but I decided I will either make my old glasses as tinted sunglasses or buy new aviator sunglasses from cheaper online place (just gotta figure out which one is good, I did buy from Firmoo before) - idk what else is good  &#x200B;  but for you - I suggest lookign up at different transition models - there is one xtractive or something that gives more tint when behind the wheel - they got many models for different needs, times and so on	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:I wear transition RX raybans and have no issue whatsoever because they really just look like normal sunglasses when dark and look like hipstery thick framed glasses when clear.	episode_done:True
text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:Perhaps transition lenses have improved and it's a case of only noticing the bad ones, but I definitely see them tinted indoors occasionally and they look dopey. Like wearing sunglasses indoors in general.  I'd be uncomfortable buying them as a primary pair of glasses without trying out the transition for the day and seeing them actually transition quickly in my normal haunts.
text:They do transition quicker now with gen 8 version, but still not that quick  Takea about 3-4mins depending on where you live, colder climates are slower and tint gets darker, warmer is faster, but gets less tinted, in a car it doesn't work for those who drive that might be a big consideration  I was just thinking from style perspective and not looking like a nerd or ruining the look. The guy above is right, he said the same thing as my glass store if you get one you gotta go 1 size bigger, cuz they usually seem to make your glasses look smaller  But if you r indoor, your glasses look big, so you sacrifice on looks basically  I think they would look good if your frames are big and plastic made, I'm taking big big frames or if your pair is sold as sunglasses too, but I think having separate sunglasses is more practical, a hustle to carry, but does a better job if you got the space for it	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:I use them out of convenience mostly. After spending 15 years carrying both prescription glasses and prescription sunglasses, it's pretty neat to only have one thing to carry.
text:The functionality aspect I get it  I just don't know style wise if those frames as classic and elegant as they look would be ruined by the slight tint or enhance it  My store told me to go 1 size bigger if I get transitions as it makes the glasses feel smaller usually	labels:I don't really care much for it to be honest, it's mostly the frame that matters. That said having tinted glasses on a cloudy winter morning is a bit annoying but these things are sensitive. Anyway I don't wear my glasses constantly as I've got 9/10 eyes. If I had to, I'd probably opt for something different, like these sun lenses you can clip on your regular glasses.
text:Yeah, I was thinking that too, there is a sunglasses clip for this one actually, although carrying that around - might as well have a sunglasses, putting 2 glasses on each other is like looking from telescope with glasses haha  &#x200B;  That's my feeling, but it looks alright	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are your predictions for 2021 suit style?	labels:Working within a multi brand store, a lot of what the buying team is seeing is relaxed fits, patch pockets and a pretty standard over arching lapel size (let’s say 2in), but it still keeping towards formal regimented shoulders (with very subtle roping) and small amounts of taper to the trouser and waist. Almost half of the suits  reviewed having pleats, but less function and more to bring an elongated look when sans jackets. Lots of hopsack open weaves giving a more draped look. I’m saying all this at least in our market, when people are looking for suits it’s become clear people want far less patterns, and moving towards subtle pinheads and puppy’s tooth, or even tone on tone 5mm window pane. In darker colours even coming into summer. COVID has pushed suits in our market back towards the cleaner look, with textured shirts and a little more fun with ties. Saying all this though it’s super dependent on where you are in the world and where you associate yourself in the corresponding circles.  So tldr: shrug*

text:What are your predictions for 2021 suit style?	labels:I would say that suits in general have been on the downtrend among white-collar types; a lot of jobs just don’t demand it anymore. I think the pandemic and bankruptcies you mentioned may push that trend further, but it was already on its way.  As far a changes in the style of common suits: I think super wide/skinny lapels are definitely on their way out (if they’re not already there), looser fits may make a comeback, and I feel that somewhat bolder colors might be a bit more popular.   As for the more fashion-forward: I feel like I’ve been seeing more belted suits, skirt suits/skirts + blazers (on men; @ Harry Styles), and asymmetric details. Obviously that’s getting into the world of fashion show stuff, so it doesn’t influence most of us that much, but it’s worth talking about.
text:> I think the pandemic and bankruptcies you mentioned may push that trend further, but it was already on its way.  I actually wonder if the opposite will happen. After a year of sitting at home wearing sweatpants every day of the week people might be in the mood to dress up again and suiting could see a revival... maybe with more casual details to ease the transition? Unlined jackets, drawstring pants, patch pockets, stretch blend fabrics.	labels:That’s a possibility for sure, but I think only for a small group who really enjoys tailored clothing; I feel like the vast majority of guys really just see that sort of clothing as a burden. That said, I myself have been fleshing out my formalwear closet a lot since the pandemic started, so I hope to put it to use once I can :)	episode_done:True

Highly recommended from me. I have ~9 pairs of DT, and they're my only brand of socks.

text:Hooded Sweatshirt Roundup	labels:Once you get over a certain level of $ point, it's really hard to rank basic hoodies over one another, it mostly comes down to the fit that you want.  I've tried a lot of hoodies from cheap to expensive and most of them are as comfortable as each other. The article mentions JEs villain hoodies which are probably out of fashion these days but JE still produces other cuts of hoodies such as the beach hoodie, raglan hoodie and oversized cropped hoodie which all have different fits and are all as well made as each other. People who rave about a particular brand of hoodie are highly likely to be just really happy with the fit, the quality and comfort isn't gonna really differ between RC, Norse Projects, Champion and such. Even coveted things like loopwheeler also doesn't provide anything unique either when it comes to comfort.  I've rambled but if I had an advice to give to hoodie buyers who are mostly focused on fit and comfort, it would be to identify a fit that you want and just start from the midrange brand that you can find of that fit.
text:I bought a JE zip up hoodie. I also have Stone Island and Burberry hoodies, as well as American Apparel and other cheaper ones. I won't say spending $300+ (cad) on hoodies is smart, but the main difference I note is the cut. Comfort, like you said, isn't too different unless you get into cashmere, but the difference in cut and overall shape and sizing is much better. I definitely wanna get my hands on a Todd Snyder Champion hoodie though, that's right up my alley.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 18, 2020	labels:Hey everyone,  &#x200B;  I'm 31 and have always been a jeans, band tee, and hoodie type person, but I recently started redoing my closet over the past few months.  I'm looking for some euro inspired trends.  I feel like I have a good base going.  I bought a couple of pairs of athletic slim black jeans - Lucky 410's, a pair of Adidas shell tops and stan smiths, a pink/lavender semi-casual button-down and a gray peacoat.  I like matching some of my darker sweaters with my black jeans and a pea coat.  I like that monochrome look with white, black and gray but I'm looking to branch out more.    This is the first time I'm really paying attention to my fashion and my wardrobe and I'm looking for some suggestions.  Right now, I like leaning towards more of a conservative or clean look, but I'm open to suggestions if this helps.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 18, 2020	labels:I recently bought several items for my bf from American Giant. I have to say, I am very disappointed. Not only were all the sweatpants out of stock in sizes under XL, their customer service is awful. I expected delays because of COVID and the holiday season, but I placed my order on Dec 7 and it still hadn't even been processed (packed up), yet alone sent. I have sent 3 emails, none of which have gotten a response. They also took their phone number off their website (but I found it on google). Additionally, they automatically imposed a 40USD customs fee on my order (I live outside the US), even though the order was under the customs limit (150USD).   I am so annoyed with the lack of communication and the huge delays even though their website promised delivery by Christmas. I almost feel like cancelling my order.

text:First you gotta ask yourself what do you mean looking better? Like what are your goals? Expressing yourself, having fun, looking more conventionally attractive etc...

text:Dude the models pants in the pic with the jacket are like a slim straight. You could definitely rock that coat with slim pants it would be a cool loose top tight bottoms thing imo	labels:no these are not the credit cards you’re looking for 👋	episode_done:True

text:A complete capsule wardrobe - casual version	labels:For the shirt part, I'd like to add something called "custom shirt". It's interesting and really worth giving a shot.   My whole family have bought some from Hyerfavor to wear as uniforms, each has our own name or nickname on it. We even had one designed for our doggo with his small pic on the shirt.	episode_done:True

text:A complete capsule wardrobe - casual version	labels:Nice wardrobe but if having 5 pairs of shoes, 5 pairs of pants, a dozen shirts, four jackets and 3 beanies is *capsule* then I’m an ascetic monk. My understanding of capsule is something you could fit in a luggage case comfortably.
text:I thought the same, and asked myself if the post was tongue in cheek or something.  Ah yes, a capsule wardrobe with not one but two Noragis.  Interesting post/wardrobe but it's no capsule.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I avoid jeans in the house just because it’s terrible on surfaces. Couches especially but even wood if for example you have a wooden dining room chair. Denim is really abrasive.  Durable but hell on anything it touches.  So to keep my stuff nice I opt for softer things day to day. Keeps stuff looking better longer.	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True

text:[WWD] Pal Zileri scaling down major manufacturing plant. Hope this isn't a trend for Italian RTW Tailoring mainstays, especially one as craft-driven as this.	labels:Pal Zileri is one of the big mass manufacturing heavyweights of high quality Italian RTW amongst Canali, Corneliani and Caruso.   They have historically done a lot of contract work for more fashion forward houses like Trussardi.      While " the death of the suit" may rightfully be cheered on, Zileri and some of these other brands offer  tailoring that very much defies the norm of stiff fused navy blue uniforms, instead offering  beautiful patterns, textures, fabrics and detailing along with very craft oriented construction.   I hope these brands and the craftsmen behind them will endure.	episode_done:True
