text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I think hair accessories in the workplace are fine as long as they're deployed thoughtfully. Nice scrunchies and those slightly high profile headbands can work pretty well when combined with a polished outfit and subtle jewelry (or more creative outfits and jewelry if your office is more casual). I work for a nonprofit that straddles a few different different fields (economic and business dev, higher ed, entrepreneurship, etc) so I interact with a wide range of dress codes and dress code interpretations.   I'd love to wear more headbands but I'm a whiner with a huge head and they pinch too badly to get through a work day; I love the look of the almost turban-styled headbands though and don't think they're automatically off limits for a biz caz office. But then I've worn a black scarf scrunchie to work on a sleek ponytail with a sleek turtleneck and skirt outfit, and I semi-regularly deploy interesting clips (geometric, tortoiseshell, or single jewel bobby pins).	episode_done:True

I don't know if you intend to wear THAT much black, but her sense of style is out of this world for business and casual.

text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I‚Äôve had decent luck with my targeted ads. I almost use it to my advantage now. If I‚Äôm looking for something, I‚Äôll spend 5-10 minutes searching Google and browsing sites - then wait a few days. My Instagram will pop up with lots of places that I wouldn‚Äôt have necessarily found off Google but I am their target market.   Then I stalk. Check out the product reviews on their website, do a product review. com check, go into the tagged photos on Instagram to see people who are wearing the product and their feedback. Search comments! Companies not worth shopping with will have complaints under Insta photos or fake responses to their customers. Worse is no response to questions.   You can also find discount codes from their influencers on the tagged photos page that they wouldn‚Äôt necessarily share on their main page.   I‚Äôm a very cautious buyer. I need to have a good return policy if I‚Äôm shopping online from a company. So yes, I have a good experience but I put in a lot of prep into preparing my parachute before I jump.	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Drake's | January 16, 2021	labels:I have a handful ties from Drake's: one is Easyday, one is MTM, and the others are mainline.  I don't deny that other makers are better made, especially since Drake's ties are getting much more expensive than when I first saw the brand in 2014.  However, I think that mainly applies if you're buying solids or repps. I like buying their more abstract designs or "soft squares", as most other geometric ties out there simply don't have the same vibe (unless you're buying vintage).  The same could be said about their tapestry motif scarves, of which I also one own.  There's also their sleeveless cardigans which I really like. The wide rib on the "V", chunky buttons, and shorter length appeal to me, because again, not many other knitwear companies do it that way. Maybe if rubato made sweater vests.   I also own one Drake's shirt, which is a bold awning-esque multistripe. It seems okay, as like with the ties, I bought it for the pattern rather than the quality. It was acquired during a sale, so it was only $120~ compared to the 200+ it retailed for. In fact, all my Drake's items were bought on sale!	episode_done:True

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items have all been high quality copies of items I have in low quality but wore out the wazoo.  For example, I knew I was ready to invest in some high end Chelsea boots when I found myself going through a cheap pair every year. Or to invest in a nice leather-looking jacket when I found myself grabbing mine 70% of the time I went out.  The expensive items were hard to wear at first, maybe on date nights or to a nicer event, but as I got more used to wearing them I wore them more often. I think it took me a hot year before I wore my Red Wings more than like once a month.   My recommendation is keep the items in your comfort zone (so no wild dresses or Colors at first) and to force yourself to wear it at a regular interval. These days, just wearing nice jeans while I go shopping seems to be my ‚Äúdate night‚Äù when I dress up!

text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it‚Äôs typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it‚Äôs a bottom, they no longer ‚Äústay up‚Äù. This usually happens with leggings or panties after about 5 or more years of regular wear with caring for the items properly.  I also had a faux leather jacket wear out after 6 years of regular wear. The faux leather ended up ‚Äúpeeling off‚Äù or something like that.
text:Yeah, it's the elastic that gives out, and returns to it's original petroleum state.   I don't buy artificial fibres, because of environmental reasons, but almost all cotton clothing will include 2-5% spandex, and that's the first thing that goes.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:How are you determining quality? I'd wager a lot of less experienced people (particularly those who haven't actually spent money on higher end things) don't always have a good frame of reference on quality. It's easy to parrot what you hear on reddit or in a youtube video, but do you (general you) know what you're looking at when you're making that assessment of quality?    For example, a canvassed suit simply has a feature (non-glued material floating within the body) that you like and attribute a stamp of quality to, but that doesn't mean it was done well or that it's a quality garment. It may be \*more likely\* that is it, but does not necessitate it. It's easy to assume something is overpriced, especially when you're a neophyte. Additionally, there's a lot of the blind leading the blind going on here and in other fashion communities (and other hobbies/etc).     "Value" is a nebulous term, and people seem to be desperate for a way to mathematically determine if they're making the best/most optimal choice. It's a fool's errand. You're better off pursuing pieces that actually make you happy. You will wear them more and enjoy them more, thereby generating the only "value" that matters.
text:>How are you determining quality?  I'm not, really. I'm kidn of just extrapolating data I have from others, and patterns I see -- oh, bemberg lining tends to come in on the higher-end half-canvassed suits. Oh, they named their wool mill, that's good.  Value and quality are nebulous terms. You wanna know a secret? So is everything else in every language normal people use to communicate. We still use them, form coherent thoughs based on them, and live our lives.  I'm not trying to pretend I have an equation that tells me whether a purchase is good or bad.

text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ?

I don‚Äôt own any bold colour shoes, but if I did and were to say wear a red shoe, I might try to wear something else red in my outfit to tie it in, like a shirt or a bag. But I think a bold shoe would also look great with an all black outfit, or tied in with something simple like a belt.	episode_done:True
text:Andrew Marc New York Leather Jackets -- exploring the different "grades" of this brand	labels:What is Andrew Marc quality comparable to?
text:From my own experience, I'd say the best made "vintage" Andrew Marc leather jackets are better than a lot of "mall" brand leather jackets I've owned or tried like Kenneth Cole, Tommy Hilfiger, Reilly Olmes, Ralph Lauren Chaps. I have a Ralph Lauren POLO leather jacket (original MSRP $695) from 1999 made of a heavy leather that has held up wonderfully over the years and I'd say is better than the best Andrew Marc I've tried (but my experience is limited--there may be "gems" out there, like limited editions).	labels:90s Polo is kind of golden era polo, somewhat different to what we have 20 odd years later.      RL Polo iteration one happens in 67' , RRL comes in 93', and then Purple label is in 94', but over the years I think the gap in quality has really widened sadly.
text:Agreed. RRL has changed and isn't what it used to be. I've at least seen that with their jeans. I'd much rather pay less and pick up a lightly used pair from a decade ago rather than something new. I'm not familiar with their recent leather products, though.	labels:Interesting, I always hear RRL as the grail brand

text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:I went through this too, and while going through it, did an entire wardrobe overhaul. Instead of lamenting the weight gain, I chose to have a ton of fun buying new clothes for my bigger pandemic size. I‚Äôve had a great time eating really enjoyable food during quarantine, I don‚Äôt care that I‚Äôm fat now. Also, I had been ready to re-do my style for a while, and this seemed like the perfect time.   However, now knowing how easy it is to fluctuate in size, I used weight fluctuation as a deciding factor in what I chose to buy: I only purchased items that will fit with a fluctuation anywhere from 5-15lbs (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2). Seems crazy, but it actually is possible. I stuck to either loose silhouettes, or tight yet forgiving stretchy styles.   What worked for me in choosing what I invested in was just ensuring I put enough time and effort into the process. I downloaded Pinterest and spent an inordinate amount of time looking at street clothes, I set a budget, thought about what items I needed, and did a ton of online window shopping. Once I had a better idea of what I wanted my new style to be, I did a lot of online shopping. I did return a lot of things, but also kept a lot, too.   Think about items of clothing that you gravitate towards, that make you feel really good. Use that to form the basis of your wardrobe. The process does take time and effort, but doing enough prep before buying will really make the process way easier.
text:Yes! I also did this! Wrap skirts, jersey tee shirt dresses, pocket leggings, over sized sweaters, all things that work for ups and downs.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:Hmm I don't set money aside for clothes specifically. I have a general budget divided into monthly bills, savings, food, and other expenses. Clothes usually fall under "other expenses", unless it would be a huge purchase that I'd have to save up for specifically - but that rarely happens).  I only buy clothes like 3-4 times a year, usually to replace old stuff, or if my wardrobe needs some extra something, or if I find a really nice item that I'll definitely wear a lot. I know what sort of styles, colors, fabrics etc I tend to go for. I avoid impulse purchases, I already have enough stuff sitting around because I have nothing to match it with or nowhere to wear it lmao	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I mainly thrift, but I'm a stickler for trying things on in store and since I don't feel comfortable shopping in person anyways, I've finally sucked it up and tried out Depop.  It's been about 5 years since I last did any online clothing shopping, but I've had pretty good luck with it so far, but I've got a good eye for what shapes are gonna work for me, and I always message the seller about something before I buy.  I probably would have picked up a couple of things for Asos, but they don't do video anymore, so I'll probably try and tackle Poshmark next for some of the more fun pieces on my list.	episode_done:True

text:How do you care for your expensive/fragile pieces?	labels:Mesh wash bags and I turn my clothing inside out before washing on cold water. It helps with keeping its shape and color too.  Understand the care labels. Some articles of clothing can‚Äôt be put in a dryer and have to lay flat to dry.
text:one tip! You can always seem to get super clearance-d mesh bags from TJ MAxx/Ross/etc. They always seem to have ones that likely got separated from a multipack or something for like $1-3.  I have got some great ones scanning the clearance.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your 2021 Fashion / Style Goals?	labels:I‚Äôm generally happy with my wardrobe but I simply have too much - too much clothing, too many shoes, too many bags, etc. It‚Äôs getting to be overwhelming. I would like to try to do a low/no buy year to keep me from accumulating more, while simultaneously trying to declutter what I already have. If I do make purchases I want to think about them long and hard, and really justify why I need them. I also want the item to be perfect if I‚Äôm going to buy it - I have a bad habit of buying things that are ¬´¬†good enough¬†¬ª in the pursuit of what I really want and that‚Äôs definitely contributed to my overflowing wardrobe. No more settling for ¬´¬†good enough¬†¬ª, it‚Äôs a waste of money & close space!	episode_done:True

text:Would you mind expanding a bit on the wardrobe tracking idea? Sounds really interesting!	labels:I personally started using an app (closet for android) where you put in every item of clothing you own, and log each day what you wear, so you KNOW how many wears your getting out of each item. Logging every item was weirdly fun, and really made me asses why I kept what I kept. But the app was a bit clumsy, so I made a secret instagram account to just take an Ootd (outfit of the day) picture as I headed out the door (or when covid hit, on my way to the couch, ha ha)   If you have apple I have heard great things about their apps, some people on here use airtable (if you search the group there are loads of better informed wardrobe tracking, and mgetsdressed blog has many many posts about it)   I personally found looking at what I'm ACTUALLY wearing, not what I aspire to wear, helps me be realistic about what to add to my wardrobe, and being more aware of everything I own now I've done several purges makes me pull out lesser worn items to I have an excuse to keep them	episode_done:True

If they're allowed to post photos, you get a better idea of what the item really looks like.

Or maybe we don't want to wear that exact item, but some part of it excites us. It's okay to translate what you loved in a picture into something you feel fits into your everyday life. What gives with your "friend"?  Now, if you find yourself unable to do that -- you're STILL okay. And if you need help, obviously that's why Daily Questions etc exist. Because we weren't any of us born knowing how to style.
text:I love dusty pinks and mauves.  I cannot express how badly those colors look with my skin. I've had *strangers* ask me if I was ok because they assumed someone who resembled a corpse that much must be actually nearing death.   I love heels and very sleek business casual as well as what I can only call ho-fits. I have bad ankles fr from working on concrete floors too many hours, and take public transportation. It's too much of a risk I could sprain my ankle from how much I walk, and I can't afford another sprain. My office is not business casual or sleek, but a no fuss "just don't wear t-shirts with slogans or anything" type of place. I am decidedly over my ho phase, despite my continued love of the clothes.   My fantasy of wearing heeled booties with a structured fashion blazer over a mauve dress is not any less real just because I have the common sense to not go through with it.  Fashion fantasy is still a valid form of participation!	labels:>I love dusty pinks and mauves.  >I cannot express how badly those colors look with my skin. I've had strangers ask me if I was ok because they assumed someone who resembled a corpse that much must be actually nearing death.  My way around this is that over the past 12-8 months Athleta and Lululemon have had a lot of merchandise in these colors so now I have a bunch of athleisure leggings, joggers, and culottes in shades that would make me look dead if they were anywhere near my face but are okay below the waist.

text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:<rant>  If I said "Wear cropped jackets so you look taller" I'd be laughed out of the room but somehow "Short people shouldn't wear long coats" is a valid thing?   Also what's defined as short? If someone is 5'7" do they get to wear long coats? What if they're 5'7.5"??  It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering". If you care so much about these gender norms, masculinity and being ~ flattering ~ then sack up and wear the clothes you like.   That whole thread is just people saying that someone else told them they couldn't *wear a coat* so what should they do? Oh idk. How about tell them to fuck off and wear the damn coat.  </rant>

text:How has lockdown affected new purchases?	labels:Still working from home and will be until at least end of b2c peak next year, so my "need" for new stuff hasn't really been that great. It has meant I've worn a lot of stuff I haven't really had the chance to recently; even getting some pieces out of long-term storage that I was holding onto to gain value ripe to exploit some archivists.  I've sold a bunch of stuff as well, but most of that money has been spent on things other than clothes; fly fishing/tying, a 3090 or replacing tired stuff in the house.  Ultimately, my annual clothing spend for this year is going to be massively down. Sorry Ssense and Yoox.	episode_done:True

text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:I haven't yet shopped FashionNova/Shein. But have spent plenty of time shopping cheaper brands like Target, Old Navy, NY and Co, Kohls, H&M, Forever21. And honestly I have plenty of things from these places that have held up fine. Especially when you follow wash instructions and avoid the dryer as much as possible.   Even cheaper stores have some gems among the low quality items.  The biggest issue I found is that certain things needed to be replaced like annually or sometimes 2x a year. But on the other hand some stuff will just last forever. I had (have) some decade+ stuff from all of those places that still get worn.  Some were super frequent, some weren't.  Now that I am a bit older - I realize there are a few things I always wear - vetted by years of experience - that is makes sense to spend more on. I'll always use a black cardigan, grey cardigan, and black knit pencil skirt (ponte or similar) year over year - so those can be upgrade picks. But as for dresses? My vibe changes often so I am ok at saving on those and trading them out as I see fit. There are some that live in my closet forever, but really as long as I have a couple of black/white print dress options I am happy!	episode_done:True

I'd also like to point out the person in your example picture is wearing 2 dresses, one sheer one on top of a floral one.  I don't think I would describe that outfit as "restrained" as much as "unique pieces but overall subscribes to the formula of a very normal outfit" in the sense that a dress with socks, a bag, and loafers isn't weird.

Otherwise he said they stay in that moist, malleable state and get out of shape more quickly.  Anecdotally I‚Äôve seen a major difference in the lifespan of my shoes.

Their look is very body conscious, very revealing, very showing off curves (in the right places since they are very thin.. Always explicitly sexy. It is indeed, maybe stereotypical very russian, or eastern european in general.  Some  observations about those looks and if you want to :  - keep shoes all pristine. High heels or sneakers or combat boots, but keep them as  pristine as possible.  - when in doubt, downsize clothes (this is against my regular advice, but this is a specific look).  - usually always showing one of legs/cleavage/midriff.  - very brand aware but you will find similar pieces everywhere starting from primark up...	episode_done:True

text:Model poses while online shopping	labels:They do that when the fit if the garment is inferior. It is intentional.  Beware items that have this kind of photography, because most of the time it means the garment has bad construction, weird seam placement, or unfortunate details.  Well constructed items are not shot in this manner. Brands want to show off their excellent construction. It is known.  Hope that helps!
text:Yup. There are so many things I've seen on the Zara website that are photographed in that highly editorial style that have intrigued me enough to seek them out in-store, only to realize upon trying them on how badly made and ill-fitting they are in reality.   Well-made, cool clothes look great without crazy poses. There's a reason why runway models (for the most part) just walk and do a rather neutral pose at the end- because the clothes and construction are what's being highlighted.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Tips for easily looking more modern/in style?	labels:Depends on what you have, what you like. Assuming you have basics you like, the easiest and quickest way to "modernize" is to get one top or bottom in the shape or color of the season, and a pair of shoes.  Right now loafers are having a moment, extra modern is ones with chunkier soles. Chunky knit tops are having a moment, particularly cardigans. So you can get a chunky knit cardigan, chunky loafers, and pair with jeans and you are more "current."   Or you can swap your normal jeans with a straight legged faux leather trouser and those same loafers.   I like to follow sites like Coveteur, Who What Wear, or the Zoe Report and read their trend roundups and adopt accordingly (for me that means after I have vetted it is the sort of trend I would like.)	episode_done:True

text:How do deal with being pressure to find ‚Äúclassics‚Äù and ‚Äútimeless pieces‚Äù when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:I buy/wear items that I like, whether they are in style or not, whether they are considered classic or not. For example, I love high waist pants and maxi skirts - both were "trendy" a couple years ago and I'm so glad they were produced more as a result. I will keep wearing them even though they're no longer trendy, because I love how they look and feel, even if no one else is wearing them.   Another example for me: neutral colors are considered classic, as well as patterns like plaid and houndstooth. But I love fun colors and funky patterns, so those are what I wear most, no matter if others are wearing different styles.  Just because something is labeled classic or trendy by social media, fashion brands, retailers, etc. doesn't mean that we have to adhere to them. You can wear whatever style you like, whenever you like, regardless if others woild label those items trendy or classic.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 26	labels:Hello, wondered what the community thinks about 3-piece suits for younger guys.  I am 20y and in need for a new suit, that I would wear semi regularly throughout the year. Need it for oral exams in uni, for a possible internship (law) and more formal events that would come up throughout the year.   Always loved the looks of a 3 piece suit and tend towards more formal clothing in general but really unsure if it is (age) appropriate.   Wouldn't normally care that much about other people's opinion. However I would wear it in occasions where (1st) Impressions do matter. Also considering that I rather spend a bit more on quality, I of course don't want to spend the money and then don't look good.  Worried that it would come of as a bit jarring, or just too much.   Any feedback would be much appreciated.
text:I can't necessarily speak to where you live, but in my 28 years of American life I've been to plenty of formal events and I've seen a 3-piece suit worn less than 5 times. It's definitely a more formal choice than a 2-piece suit and the general shift towards casual clothing means even the occasions for a 2-piece are getting rarer. So I would say that it will likely stand out and catch attention as an intentionally formal and possibly somewhat anachronistic choice.  That being said, I don't think it's inherently a *wrong* or *bad* choice - if you work in an area that requires very formal clothing, it could be useful to have the variety, or if you're aiming for that dandy-ish side of menswear that embraces the affectations, it could definitely have its place.	labels:I live in Austria, where things are bit more formal, at least compared to the US (from what I have seen). So more formal suit varations are not as rare but its still definitely the exception to the rule.   I would definitely expect it to stand out, at least somewhat. My main worry was, that it stand out for the wrong reasons.  I do have a shop near me that has a good selection of 3 piece suits. Just haven't been able to make an appointment due to covid. So actually seeing the suit on my body will hopefully help, in terms of getting a better picture.  Thank you very much, for your advice	episode_done:True
text:What is something you've heard as fashion advice that isn't worth following?	labels:Probably the advice that anything I wear as a fat person has to be slimming or flattering. Yes I wear a lot of black, but just because it's easy not because it makes me look thinner. My size isn't a big secret or anything.   Also this is taking a really broad view but the fashion culture of planned obsolescence, declaring certain things "out" and other things "in," is super classist and unsustainable, so even though I enjoy reading about new trends I don't really care to follow them.

text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:So, look, I don't want to tell you _not_ to do this, but if I've understood correctly you're looking at creating a bloodborne-inspired victorian/traditional wardrobe. There are elements of that style that have mainstream appeal today, high-waisted wool trousers being one example. However, when you take them in context with the more "interesting" elements you picked out it gives off serious cosplay vibes. Perhaps you should take the fact that the only places offering this sort of clothing are Etsy/cosplay stores as a hint that you should reconsider this idea.  You might be thinking, _what about the cyber goth vampire Rick Owens fits I see on this sub?_ It's a valid question. The key difference is that the style you're going for here has _such_ a strong association with cosplay and videogames and so little mainstream appeal that the number one association people are going to make is that you are cosplaying. Doubly-so if you're wearing cosplay-quality clothes from cosplay vendors. While the Rick Owens aesthetic may not have mainstream appeal it _is_ very accepted within fashion circles and _doesn't_ have that strong cosplay association.  So with that said my advice is to take what you've got and tone it down. Treat it like a high-fashion runway show and take inspiration from it instead of trying to recreate it 1:1. High-waisted trousers, great. Gaiters? Maybe just get some actual boots. Bloodborne-style woolen collars/scarves/hooded shawls? Wear a regular scarf that has an interesting shape or texture, or a shirt with a more exaggerated collar. Maybe the fact that you can't find retailers selling this kind of stuff is the limitation you need to make it work in the real world.  Or maybe I'm just talking complete shite and someone smarter than me can help you more. I hope that I've at least broken the ice and said what needed to be said so that people can try to constructively help you.
text:I agree with you 100%. The sleeve thing, gaiters, and video game style collar things are a recipe for disaster. Maybe the aesthetic is possible to pull off, but it would require very high quality pieces and someone who is really good at this kind of thing. It's one of those, if you need to ask for advice, there is no way you could pull it off scenarios. As terrible as it is, I'd probably chuckle if I saw someone wearing any of those accessories at a bar or something. I'm just picturing someone alone at a dive drinking some shitty (or very oddly expensive for the bar) single malt whisky alone approaching random people and trying to talk about outdated philosophers. Even just the high rise pants look seems very intimidating to me. I'm always very impressed by the people on MFA who pull it off. It seems like one of those things where if you pull it off you look incredibly fashionable, but if you fuck it up just a little you end up looking  wholly ridiculous.	labels:What the hell is "Outdated philosopher" supposed to mean lol
text:My bad, I meant discredited. Like, someone talking about philosophy despite having a surface level understanding and discussing concepts of which our understanding has been refined greatly. TBF, I'm a dumb ass and know nothing about philosophy, so I guess I was mostly picturing some guy constantly mis-using 4-5 syllable words he found in a thesaurus.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Closet Organization By Color	labels:My system includes by color, but it's a little complicated:  Left door: Dress/formal clothes   Right door: Casual clothes    I then categorize clothes by warmth, which is usually just sleeve length. No sleeves are in the center of the closet, then short sleeves, then long sleeves. Coats and jackets are at the edges.    Then each warmth section is organized by color: Black, grey, white, black/grey/white mix, cream/tan, brown, yellow, orange, red, pink, purple, blue, green.    It helps me readily identify where I have gaps in my wardrobe, whether I am ready for the upcoming seasons, and makes picking clothes super easy for the day's weather.	episode_done:True

text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I used to wear small diamond earrings every day, and would put them in my wallet when I went to the gym after work. I got to work the next day and realized I forgot to put them back in after the gym, so I opened up my wallet and they were gone. I had made my usual morning stop for breakfast on the way to work, so I rushed to the food cart and looked all over the sidewalk but I couldn‚Äôt find them.  At least 1-2 weeks later I went to the same food cart for breakfast, looked down, and saw one diamond earring in the crack in the sidewalk. I looked more closely and there was the other one! The metal was chewed up (they were bezel set) so I had to get them repaired, but it was a lot cheaper than a new pair!   Definitely my #1 fashion (jewelry?) miracle.
text:That's incredible! I'm a notorious earring-loser, so I never wear nice ones. This gave me so much satisfaction ‚ù§	labels:It was insane that I found them! I still went to the same food cart pretty much every day after losing them, and I would half-heartedly look down, but I never thought I‚Äôd actually find them!

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I require a relatively formal work wardrobe that includes suiting and tailored dresses.  After years of wasting time and money at the dry cleaners, I decided to rationalise my work wardrobe in a similar way to you some time ago.   Some brands, including Emporio Armani, Joseph, Me&Em and Norma Kamali, make very high quality machine washable polyester suiting and dresses that don't look remotely cheap or plastic-y. You can get suiting in machine washable wool from budget-friendly brands including Marks & Spencer and Next, but surprisingly designer brands don't seem to have taken up the opportunity. Wool or cashmere knitwear (any brand) can be machine washed if you invest in a modern machine with a wool setting and a specialist detergent. While deeper coloured cottons will eventually fade, it is otherwise resilient to machine washing and probably the best choice for shirts.  I would avoid silk. Even if it's washable, the colours will eventually fade, and it's hard to remove stains without damaging the fabric.	episode_done:True

text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I have three or four distinct styles. Most of the time I like wearing dark, edgy punk-inspired clothes.

Take out my piercings, and I‚Äôll have anyone fooled that that‚Äôs the realest me. In the summer and family gatherings I often wear more earthy boho and beachy surfer looks. Fashion is a great tool for self-expression, matching the mood, and setting the mood.
text:I'm convinced that there's something deeper than just boho styled, edgy, punk, professional styled etc. that we find ourselves liking, that creates our style.   Like music. There's something deeper than simply genre that makes me like a song. It's not genres that define my music taste.

text:FAQ: What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I try my best to only buy during sales and when I buy it's under two circumstances. The first if I need something that I don't have that are absolute necessaties such as work pants, or to update a particular item if a similar item is found that offers the same benefits if not more e.g. old, thinning bomber jacket vs insulated bomber jacket.  I haven't bought any new casual button downs or dress shirts in a year since I'm satisfied with my current collection and most likely it'll be the same for the upcoming year.  For shoes,  I live in an area that's notorious for its weather so I take extra precaution on wearing the proper footwear to and from work or the gym inorder to extend the life of the shoes. Annual cleaning and maintenance is necessary.  Note: It helps to wear items for their intended purposes. I  wear jeans at times but I don't go camping or hiking in them, nor do I wear them when it's exceptionally hot or humid. I have an interest in raw denim and have heard stories of people wearing their raws for everything in order to get fades. I don't do that. Same thing applies to welted boots.	episode_done:True

text:'Silk and Steel' NPR Article Discussion	labels:Interesting article. US urbanite perspective here, as I feel that‚Äôs important to state.   ‚ÄúClothing is the barometer of change‚Äù   It‚Äôs interesting to think about the roots of what we now consider ‚Äúclassic pieces‚Äù, only coming from the last century. It makes me think about what changes we will see moving forward, and how classics may shift with shifting norms.   When I think about French fashion as a whole, as diverse as it it, the dominant idea is that of the Parisian bobo woman, a bit undone but thoroughly classic. Neutral colors (described as dye shortage, and also mourning),pops of color (described as identifying with a political allegiance) trench coats (wartime utilitarian piece) a nice wrist watch (wartime utilitarian piece). Clear connections. The roots are there. It makes sense. And practical! Don‚Äôt pull out your phone on the metro if you don‚Äôt have to, check your watch instead. Protect yourself from the urban grime and constant wet with blacks and greys and throw on a trench.   Import that idea and it‚Äôs further diluted. Current urban dressing has been reduced and simplified and given a new context. Along with increased production and lower quality, it feels so disconnected to me. Think about a flimsy fashion trench coat, or a thin pair of combat boots. Hollow, right? Think about a robust trench coat or thick, protective combat boots. A little excessive for hopping on a train or an uber to dinner, no?   I‚Äôm longing for clothing that aligns with my utilitarian needs again. I‚Äôll reluctantly say, for now, long live loungewear!	episode_done:True
text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:Konmari only worked a little for me, as I find joy having clothes to meet any occasion including weight going up or down. Also clothes are more like a hobby and also sentimental so doing them first never made sense to me.   What's worked best over the years is more of a "container" strategy. Let's take your socks for an example. I allot only so much room for socks in one section of a drawer. Those socks with holes are going right out, I don't have room for them and I'm not making room for holey socks. I would take the cue that these socks were so well loved they got holes, so I am fine with finding a similar replacement, then tossing the holey socks to make room for a similar pair I know I'm going to love and wear a lot.   Work stuff and COVID is so much more difficult. Pre-COVID I traveled a lot for work so needed to pretty much maintain a 4-season all weather occasion work wardrobe for all cultural possibilities and their nuances. That's long been 80% of my wardrobe.   But now here we are. And everything's been turned on its head, and that 80% wardrobe is just gathering dust, while the 20% is getting worn 80% of the time. Who am I kidding... more like 100% of the time!  But I'm not ready to declutter my work wear because when we have a vaccine and we're back to normal work schedules, it would be too costly to replace all of it. Especially if somewhere along the line I was laid off.  So for now I've basically SCRUNCHED all my work wardrobe into the smallest possible footprint to make more room for the stuff I'm actually wearing. And re-shuffled so the stuff I'm actually wearing is front and center and the other items are harder to access.   The cool thing is WFH means you can do laundry more often, so no, you do not need a month's worth of loungewear, tees, leggings. You just don't.	episode_done:True

I also do more eye liner dramatic looks at times as well! Usually if I‚Äôm wearing something a bit more cutesy I‚Äôll do my makeup to reflect the look. If Im wearing my black velvet blazer set I‚Äôll do th√© likes of and orange and gold Smokey eye to make it more bold and less professional looking! I have a very dressy style with masculine, Victorian, and highly detailed elements so bold colorful makeup makes some of my more stuffy looks less boring. I‚Äôve lately been after doing my foundation putting a bit of blush from the bottom front of my eye bags to the top of my brow bone. I love how it makes makeup a little more unique and makes me look a little less baby faced.  I used to wear very skater boyish/ art kid outfits and hair ( I still respect the style still though ) but wore heavy Instagram glam style makeup. I still do glam makeup but it looked quite odd at times! I didn‚Äôt really think much about makeup in relation to clothing then, not that it‚Äôs really necessary! I feel I‚Äôve come far with my style!

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 01, 2021	labels:How are bomber jackets technically suppose to fit?  A little oversized?  I posted here a couple of days ago regarding one I got in a small and medium; I was told that the medium looked better.  I'm just paranoid that it's "too big" on me.  IMO the small fit better, but I was struggling to get it on (i.e., I had to twist my arm to get it on).

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.
text:I love this answer, and I think that‚Äôs also why certain looks on certain people end up looking so costume-y. If a look is not authentic to your life and to who you are, it‚Äôs not going to have the effect you‚Äôre hoping to achieve.  The notion of appreciating fashion without feeling compelled to wear it yourself also ties into the conversations around cultural appropriation. As beautiful as I find traditional attire from other countries and cultures, or as cool as the fashion is in many countercultures, I don‚Äôt NEED to wear those outfits on my own body to appreciate and enjoy them.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 17, 2020	labels:I bought an Amazon basics men‚Äôs puffer jacket in a large this week and loved it when it first arrived. I really like the style of a black puffer jacket. The major issue is the cut of the jacket. At first glance it appears to fit well, but if I lean or stretch at all it cuts into my armpits. Even just putting my hands on the wheel when driving causes it to cut into my armpits. I want to find an alternative to the Amazon basics that is the same style but perhaps higher quality or a better fit. I have been looking at the Uniqlo men‚Äôs ultralight down puffer jacket. Does anyone have any experience with it or other similar jackets and know if it fits well under the armpits?  TLDR Amazon basics puffer jacket too tight under armpits.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 20, 2021	labels:Are websites like framesdirect legit and advisable for buying brand name sunglasses for cheap?  I‚Äôm curious what sunglasses aficionados think of websites like framesdirect to buy sunglasses from brand names that may be out of season but get discounted.   Anything bad I should be aware of? Or are there better options?   I love aviators but I just hate buying cheap sunglasses that break easily. I‚Äôm looking to spend like 200 bucks and under. I also wouldn‚Äôt mind spending 50 bucks on multiple sunglasses.  I know luxotica controls a lot of the eyewear brands - is there any value in eyewear brands then?

Ideally I‚Äôd love to support an independent brand that makes their products in the US but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that doesn‚Äôt exist.	episode_done:True
text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I think the size of your wardrobe is going to depend on your climate, job, hobbies, and general lifestyle. I have a lot more clothing than that. I also live in a place with four seasons. I have outdoorsy hobbies that require some tougher clothes. I can‚Äòt wear my casual clothing to work (and I‚Äôm also holding onto some more professional clothing from a past job in case I return to that field). I don‚Äôt have a lot of disposable income either, so I always keep things like dress pants even though I never wear them in my everyday, because I can‚Äôt afford to go shopping when interviews and funerals come up.  For instance, I probably have at least 15 dresses alone, once you count all the strappy sundresses, nice work dresses, wool sweater dresses, the cocktail dresses, and the evening gown that‚Äôs in the back of my closet - and everything in between.  I swap out my clothing with the seasons and have one closet that I share with my husband, so I try to be judicious about what I keep, while giving myself grace that I don‚Äôt need to get rid of something just because I don‚Äôt wear it regularly.
text:Hobbies are a big one. I ride horses, work out, sometimes hike, and have a professional job.

text:Is anyone into MBTI? Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels:At one point on the INTP subreddit everyone was talking about how they wish they could wear a cape without it being seen as weird. I would interpret the INTP relationship to fashion as a little bit more nuanced than "drab and careless". I think the common theme is that INTPs don't generally care what others think - and so that can manifest on a spectrum from "wears whatever because does not care about their appearance at all" to "wears completely outlandish things because they care about their appearance but do not care at all what others think of it".      As an INTP myself I fall somewhere between the two. Like... I *want* fashion to be a higher priority for me, but when it comes down to it my attitude is more often just "whatever" because social pressure to look good  doesn't register to me nearly as much as it could.

text:Fashion "fantasies" coming true years later?	labels:Male here (kind of important for this story).  Growing up I was always really jealous of female fashion, makeup and the ability to express yourself in your clothing (and it not coming down purely to details or fabric). I dabbled in the japanese rock scene back in HS, partly because I really liked the music, partly because it opened up a lot of opportunities for exploration. I didn't have the guts to go all the way though, but did some light makeup and had sort-of feminine haircuts.  Anyway, past HS this was all behind me, except in my art where I kept my aesthetic alive, though never consciously setting out to do so. I've since moved the canvas onto myself, so haven't picked up the pen much at all lately.   Fast forward 10 years or so, and I'm standing at a graduation ceremony. I work as a teacher, and I'm saying goodbye to my students, since summer break is about to come up. All teachers are lined up, and I look at my female colleagues and feel a real sting of jealousy. I'm standing there dressed in a shirt and pants while they're wearing lovely dresses, with earrings, makeup and bags.  I decided enough was enough, and went and bought nail polish the same day, and booked a time to pierce both my ears the day after. This all coincided with a long solo trip to Japan, where I bought a ton of makeup and really started to let lose. I also started (slowly) incorporating female cuts and items into my wardrobe, but every step needed quite a bit of courage, heck they still do. My comfort zone has blown wide open but anything beyond what I wear regularly gives some slight anxiety.  Then in 2020 I started posting here, getting feedback and help, and through constant cheering from colleagues, friends and students I finally feel like anxiety isn't keeping me away from expressing myself the way I want.  &#x200B;  So yeah, kind of a tangent, but that's my fashion fantasy coming true.

text:General Discussion - December 13, 2020	labels:The long comment thread below got me thinking.   I feel like we live in a time where dozens of fashion subcultures are able to exist at once. I've never seen so many designers and brands across several "genres" all thriving so well.  Saying something isn't "in fashion" just seems wild to me right now. Because honestly I think what's "fashionable" is exploring your own personal style and aesthetic. Being yourself is what's currently cool, and I think that's dope.
text:Sometimes I wonder how of this is bias towards the present.   There definitely have been large scale trends lately: notably luxury streetwear, which is starting to ebb (Virgil Abloh, Kim Jones, and Jerry Lorenzo have all been trying to pivot to tailoring lately).  Sure, not everybody has been on the streetwear train, but not everybody in the past marched in trendy lockstep either. We think of the eighties as pretty homogenous, but football shoulder *Wall Street* tailoring, prep, punk, and new wave were all happening at the same time, Issey Miyake was in the middle of his career and Comme and Yohji were getting their starts. If you were living in the middle of that and you cared about fashion, you probably wouldn't think there was just one trendy thing at a time either.   Maybe in 2060 we'll all be looking back on the 10s as The Streetwear Era and think that trends are just at that moment starting to die.	labels:I was gonna say something similar but you put it much better than I would have hahaha.

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:eBay:  - Filter by fabric content. Try searching for wool, silk, cashmere, and other nice fabrics.  - There‚Äôs a filter for vintage that‚Äôs useful for finding unique items. Also make sure to look at sizes that you may think would be too big. Vintage clothing tends to run much smaller.  - Avoid stuff labeled as ‚Äúunbranded‚Äù its mostly just cheap junk mass produced in China that is heavily advertised on eBay  for some reason - Make use of the extensive filters eBay has, you can use them to find very specific items.    Poshmark:  - Sort by recently price dropped. This means the seller is really trying to get rid of the item and you can get a better price.  - Don‚Äôt be afraid to make an offer. I‚Äôve made offers I thought the seller would never accept, but they did and I got some great items for insane deals.  - Search by key words, the filters are not as good as eBay  - You can filter by your specific sizes, but I don‚Äôt recommend this on Poshmark. The system does not work well. For example, I put my dress sizes as 4 and 6, and they only show me dresses labeled those sizes while leaving out dresses labeled small or medium.   In general for online thrifting: - Ask the seller for measurements if they aren‚Äôt posted already, and compare to clothes you have that fit well.  - Filter by size, color, or brand to find more specific items.  - Create saved searches if there‚Äôs a specific thing you want that you can‚Äôt find
text:For Poshmark sizing, you can also select sizes small and medium. So I usually check the pant size (26/28) ‚Äúdress size‚Äù (2/4) and the regular size (s/m) to get all of the items in my size!	labels:	episode_done:True

As for those vs an obsidian band, it depends on the occasion. Assuming a typical office job (obv these won't fly in trades), at work an obsidian band would look much better because that's not the environment to wear something as bold as the things in this album.

text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:While we can't say for certain: is it possible that the second experience is the correct one? A lot of men believe that they need a fully custom suit to fit well, but in actuality for most body types the patterns are rather close. If an OTR size with alterations would look great, paying for MTM is a waste of money. I've done MTM suits and bought OTR suits and have generally found that getting OTR with alterations is a faster way to a well fitting suit than the low to mid level MTM stuff we're talking about here. I've done Indochino MTM which was generally a mess and a tuxedo from Black Lapel which eventually worked out well, following one full remake and $100 of local alterations (that they paid for). My OTR blue line suits from SS fit great after alterations.
text:Yes, I even considered this. It is possible that all the fuss associate with a MTM may just create work and not contribute much to the overall fit. I'm kind of build weird though...rather "wide" with a 36 inch waist, but not pudgy at all. My legs and arms are really thin, so I look like I am completely swimming in most OTR jacket sleeves and trousers. My SS OTR trousers I have do fit well, but not as well as the perfectly tapered MTM ones.  I failed to mention that I own an OTR SS Sienna as well, which I bought online and had altered. The MTM one fits much better, but it's mostly sleeves, shoulders and trousers....so basically all of it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else wear one brand only?	labels:I realized recently when I put all my clothes in an app (called StyleBook) and looked at statistics that a disproportionate amount of my things are J. Crew. I didn't try, it just... happened. There's basically a J. Crew item in every outfit I wear. But my style is preppy and classic, lots of interchangeable basics too, and J. Crew fits that idea perfectly so it isn't too surprising!
text:How do you like that app?  I was considering it, but it seemed like a pretty sizable time commitment up front. Does it help you with new ideas?	labels:I really like it! 100 percent recommend.  You are correct in that it does take a lot of time. It took me a couple of days to take pictures (or find them online) and upload everything I owned. However I tracked everything including my belts, scarves etc so if you just want to do major pieces (dresses, pants, shirts, shoes) it will probably take less time. I also make sure I catalog new things as soon as I get them so I don't fall behind.  It has been very worth it! It even has a really cool feature that mixes up random outfits from your stuff and I have found a few combos I would never have thought of from that. It is definitely worth at least trying!

text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:As a recent college grad I had 3 prs of shoes and I thought a polo-style shirt and khakis were all I needed for work. Shopping wasn‚Äôt a big thing.  I was just trying to live independently and pay my bills.  Making outfits was challenging because I didn‚Äôt have the items to make a cohesive wardrobe that could last a work week without re-washing something. I did have a few items for going out that I swapped with friends. Who know where those things ended up.  Mid-career (and middle-aged), I think more about my personal style than trends. I enjoy creating styles that don‚Äôt appear over planned, yet are well put together. I‚Äôve built what I consider a personal fashion archive over the years that I can pull from.  The stores I buy from have changed...or least the % of my wardrobe from certain stores has changed.  I‚Äôm more aware of quality and fabrication, though I sometimes compromise fabric preference for style. Conversely, I will drop some coin on high-quality items made from natural fibers, good shoes, coats,and an occasional luxury handbag (or two).	episode_done:True

text:What‚Äôs some of the best general advice you‚Äôd give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Lots of good advice here already. One thing maybe worth adding: be aware that a lot of women's retailers use soft-feeling but lower quality fabric. At places like Zara and H&M, the men's clothes will be made of nice cotton or wool blends, and then nearly identical garments in the women's section will be flimsy rayon blends (knitwear, especially). It's easy to get duped by something that feels nice in the shop, until you get home and realise it's made of nasty sweaty acrylic. The stitching and construction can also be shoddier, so you'll end up with garments that look warped and awkward after one wash. (My husband is often shocked by the difference in quality when we shop together.) Maybe you've already noticed this, but I wish someone had told me these things when I started shopping for myself :)  Another thing to know is a lot of women's clothes are labeled "dry clean only" or "hand wash only." You'll want to carefully read the labels so you don't ruin anything! The tumble dryer is not your friend, except for socks/undies/workout clothes. That said, most "dry clean only" items that aren't heavily embellished can be gently hand washed and air dried, but if you don't want the hassle, check the label before you buy.	episode_done:True

There are a couple guides if you search them, but if it were me starting over here is what I would do.  **Bottoms:**  Light wash jeans, Navy Chinos, Sand Chinos, Khaki chino shorts **OPTIONAL:** Dark or black wash jeans  **Tops:**   **T-Shirts**(no logo no graphics)**:** 2x white, 1x Navy, 1x Light Grey **Optional:** Offwhite, Charcoal, various pastels, short/longsleeved henleys in any neutral colors.   **Button Downs:** light blue oxford, light pink oxford, **Optional**: gingham button down (light blue or navy), flannel shirt (black and watch or buffalo plaid), White oxford, university stripe oxford.  **Outerwear:** Light Grey crewneck sweatshirt olive anorak (for rain), tan/brown/navy quilted jacket for winter   **Shoes:** White leather gym shoes, brown leather boots or chukkas (pants only) **Optional:**Tan/light brown loafers, brown camp mocs, snow/rain boots (bean boots or hunter mocs)  &#x200B;  Obviously feel free to make it your own, but I would start trying to build solid basics like that that are 100% interchangeable.
text:I've got to admit I'm more than impressed at those recommandations, they're so detailed I can even picture some in my head somehow!  Thanks a lot for this, I'll try to check what I already have and then get some that I'm missing	labels:Glad I could help! Let me know if you have any questions about any specific pieces!   Also word of caution, don‚Äôt but everything st the same time. Get a pair of pants, wear them a couple times, make sure you like the fit and everything then start adding more. I have gotten overzealous so many times and doubled down on something that I later decided I wished fit different.  Good luck!
text:Love your comment mate, some really good basic foundations to build on.  Totally agree with the chinos, although I don‚Äôt always like the modern fashion of halfway up your ankle. I have a few pairs of this style for summer. But generally I prefer longer trousers.  T-shirt‚Äôs kept plain, keep the logo style ones for at home.   I would add a suggestion for a nice peacoat for winter, it‚Äôs a classic item that goes well with casual and smarter outfits (not a suit though, go for an overcoat for a suit).  I love a good pair of double monkstraps as a winter shoe, the right colour can make a casual outfit and it fits with smarter looks.   Great advice though!	labels:	episode_done:True

In fact, giving up square-toed black shoes in favor  of more anatomically correct brown ones became something of a rite of  passage for well-dressed men.   This is quite a reach. But then again it does feel quite reminiscent of nearly MFA where brown red wings were the best choice a man could make.

I received a white Carly bag with a gold chain this past Thursday and I was insanely impressed with the quality of the leather and craftsmanship.

text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:Yes free the titties! If that‚Äôs what you want to do. I hate this idea that the ideal boob shape is something that just isn‚Äôt natural for most women. Or that there is some supposed ‚Äúideal shape‚Äù. I‚Äôm currently a 38DD. Who has boobs that size that naturally look like the shape formed by an underwire bra? Literally basically no one. I‚Äôm a human person. I have boobs. They don‚Äôt have to defy gravity. And I don‚Äôt have to wear some uncomfortable CONTRAPTION to fool the world into thinking they do. I fully support women who feel their best in an underwire bra. I just don‚Äôt think we have some societal obligation to optimize our boob shapes.

text:Shopping for clothing items you already own: confessions of an outfit repeater	labels:I‚Äôve recently stopped doing this, actually! I was a sweater collector for years. Boxy crewnecks in super thick woven materials and weird patterns. I had like 50 for awhile, it was straight up out of hand. I‚Äôve finally stopped buying them and managed to part with most and actually wear through a few (and unfortunately stained several and never wore again, which happens to anything light colored that I own). Now I‚Äôve got a handful of good sweaters with enough room for another if I find one I *really* need.              All that said though, I‚Äôve gotten into my mid twenties and my body has changed so now I can barely even wear sweaters at all anymore because I‚Äôm too damn hot all the time. Has anybody else had this change too? I used to be cold all the time and now I‚Äôm roasting in a t shirt at 70 degrees.	episode_done:True

I put them on at my house, wishing I was in the mountains so I could look cool wearing this particular fit, and then I take it off and put them back in my closet.
text:I love heavy knits, I have way too many. I hear you, even though I'm in Southern Ontario.

text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:IT depends on you.  What is your lifestyle (be realistic)?  When determining this, keep your area's climate in mind as well as your workplace (or school) dress code.  Also know your hobbies because a hiker is going to need vastly different attire than someone who likes clubbing.  IF your work environment is casual, then you don't need a closet full of business formal clothing.  If your workplace requires a uniform, then you don't need a wardrobe full of work clothes (unless the uniform is a dress code like black pants/white shirt).    If you're living in Miami, then you likely don't need a down parka.    That said, no matter your lifestyle, I'd have one outfit in your closet (could be the same thing or separates) to wear to a job interview, wedding (guest, not wedding party), and funeral.  Be prepared ahead of time should those occasions arise.    My other recommendation to learn color theory and the color seasons.   If you are unsure, try and find a celebrity that has similar coloring to you and study their wardrobe and what colors they wear on red carpets.  Know what colors look good on you and which ones do not.   I'm a clear winter, so my colors are jewel tones, icy pastels, and crisp colors.  Muted tones like olive, khaki, mustard, off white, etc look terrible on me.	episode_done:True

text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:First and foremost, this album is AMAZING!!! I fucking love the pieces, and you definitely channeled the essence Cassie so well with every outfit.   Truthfully I think there doesn't have to be a line between cute and sensible. I just make sure that I cater "cute" to my setting- like what's "cute" at the club, isn't going to be "cute" at work and vice versa. In terms of sensibility, fuck it. As long as your outfit is appropriate for your setting, and the heels aren't hurting your feet too much,  don‚Äôt worry about sensibility.   I typically like to interpret edginess into softer looks with significant color contrast, thoughtful accessories, and statement pieces. Like for instance, a soft colored dress with dark colored, edgy shoes and a bag to match the shoes. But statement pieces and accessories are the easiest way to give a cutesy, girly soft look some edge.	episode_done:True

I like their sustainability focus and their aesthetic fits my style. The only problem is that my name is Noah. Basically, I can't decide if it's cool to wear a hoodie with my name printed on it, or if it's narcissistic/just kinda cringey. I think I would definitely wear the brand if that wasn't my name, but I also feel like because it is, that might be the only thing people notice when they see me wear it. Thoughts?

text:I have this problem all the time. Recently I've had the bad habit of buying the same piece of clothing in every color/pattern available if the fit is great.

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:The clothes on the runway are designed to represent, as closely as possible, the idea and sentiment that the designer is using to inspire the new line.  It's analogous to the Platonic ideal. Because the ideas can be so abstract, so too must the clothes. In fact, you can think of it as a series of progressive dilutions, from the designer's mind, to the runway, and then to the clothes that you wear in your day-to-day.

Also what's defined as short? If someone is 5'7" do they get to wear long coats? What if they're 5'7.5"??  It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering". If you care so much about these gender norms, masculinity and being ~ flattering ~ then sack up and wear the clothes you like.   That whole thread is just people saying that someone else told them they couldn't *wear a coat* so what should they do? Oh idk. How about tell them to fuck off and wear the damn coat.  </rant>

Hopeful-me will think about buying a teal floral wrap dress because it‚Äôs gorgeous. Realistic-me knows it will sit in my closet untouched for 3 years because I don‚Äôt wear teal!   I‚Äôve learned to differentiate between the two while I shop, at least. If I was a celebrity suddenly, maybe I would lean towards hopeful-me‚Äôs style, but for now I am normal and realistic!

I love shopping for my aspirational life where I host elegant but casual outdoor dinner parties, wear tasteful, high end fashion, risk getting snapped by the paparazzi when I leave a store, and don't profusely sweat when it's over 75 degrees. But in reality, I am a lawyer who spends the time I'm not wearing suits, wearing mostly athleisure since my real life activities are working out, taking our dog to the park, hiking, and sometimes working on cars.   For me, it's been helpful as I've developed my style to create go-to outfits that make me feel put together based on various occasions that I actually would need to wear (at least, pre-CoViD): work dinners, running errands when it's hot out, brunch with friends, etc. I also have found my style has changed over time as I go through various seasons of life.	labels:	episode_done:True

I agree with most things on this list except for vintage knitwear; maybe I just haven't seen a good example, but old sweaters are scratchy + don't really look good beat up + hold smells deeper than things made of cotton. Especially with the premium on nice vintage these days, I'd rather get something new.  Vintage OG fatigues and vintage chamois shirts are incredible though. Both fabrics are so much more comfy when worn-in, and you get to continue telling a story by wearing them doing work / making art / going on hikes / etc.	episode_done:True

text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Many years ago I moved from Hawaii to college in the Northeast. I would recommend 1) Buying it all there, because they'll have what's good for their climate and 2) starting out with cheaper options (thrifted, Old Navy, Target range) even if it's not quite your style. Don't spend much time, effort, and money until you see how you really feel after at least a year of seasons. Maybe you want warmer stuff than you thought you would, or realize you should invest in nicer socks, or discover you don't actually like turtlenecks, or shift to a different style when you're surrounded by a new area's vibe. Let yourself experience it for a bit without pressuring yourself to do it all right.

text:I'm Not a Watch Guy I Swear - Street x Sprezza	labels:I am a watch guy, but very much a relatively broke one.  Had I known how much trouble it would be to break into watches, I might have said never mind and wisely walked away. I didn‚Äôt, though.   Some pointers for those interested:  1.	The cost of the watch is only the upfront cost. Like a car, a mechanical watch needs regular maintenance. Generally speaking, this will be anywhere from $300 to $1,000+...every 5-7 years.  2.	Because of point #1, entry level (~ $500) mechanical watches are not pieces you will pass down to your kids. In fact, it is usually cheaper to trash them entirely and buy new than to bother having them serviced.  3.	People will tell you there are deals to be had in the vintage market. That‚Äôs true, but it can also be difficult to find parts or people willing to work on them. 4.	There is relatively little offered between entry level and about $3,000.  5.	There is nothing wrong with wearing a quartz or digital watch.   All that being said, I still love my small collection. Just wish I had known those things from the start.

Treat yourself like a friend. If a friend told you she wanted to change up her style but was nervous about getting comments, would you encourage her or tell her she's being weird? You'd encourage her! So stop discouraging yourself.	episode_done:True

text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:Layers layers layers. I live in Canada and our winters get nasty. Long skirts are a must if you want to wear one. Any exposed skin is dangerous and will immediately make you lose warmth very quickly. Wools are fantastic in the winter. They naturally wick away dampness and hold in heat even if wet. Silks are next because they are similar, but they don't breath as well or hold in warmth as well. Avoid cottons like the plague. If they get wet they will sap heat away from you and this can be fatal. I avoid polyester whenever possible unless maybe as a waterproof outer layer. Leathers are a great outerlayer that is generally water resistant.  If I am going to be outside for a length of time in a skirt I wear merino wool leggings from icebreaker if it's cold enough under the skirt. You can also wear another skirt under the first one, or a third, go nuts. Also add boots that make it to around the end of the skirt, or a pair of socks over the tights to extend the coverage. Don't forget your toes, fingers and head. You can bundle up as much as possible but if you forget those you basically undid everything. Your core is much warmer than your extremities.  Also, don't make the layers too tight. You keep warm so long as the air around your body is warm, so you need loose ish styles to seal in not just you, but warm air.  This being said. I would not recommend any serious bushwhacking in heavy skirts and deep snow.	episode_done:True

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I have a lot of environmental allergens (especially pollen and animals) and pretty much anything that I wear outdoors for even a few minutes has to get washed after every wear to keep my exposure to those allergens as low as possible. I also work (pre-pandemic anyway) in a business formal office.  General, I find that "dry clean only" items are fine if they're washed in the machine on gentle cycle, with a little bit of detergent (think half a cap instead of a full cap) on gentle cycle, in COLD water, then hung to dry. This works well for blazers, dresses, pants, and blouses. I try to pick styles that don't have ironed-in pleats, and I gravitate toward fabrics that don't wrinkle easily (although a hand steamer is far easier than ironing). If a piece has delicate lace or is something that can snag easily, throw it in a mesh bag to protect it. And make sure that more delicate items are washed in small loads that don't have heavier fabrics like denim to reduce the wear and tear on them. I do try to shop clearance racks (and places like TJMaxx are my favorite for blazers), because I do just kind of assume that every now and then I'll purchase a dud item that doesn't take to laundering as well as I'd like.  I tend to stick to fabrics like polyester, cotton, and rayon. I avoid wool, cashmere, and silk.	episode_done:True

text:Excercises for personal style	labels:I recently watched a tedx "Dressing for Confidence and Joy", where the presenter Stasia Savasuk asked people to think about how they wanted to be perceived in the world by thinking about key words, and then to think about articles of clothing or accessories that fit in that keyword category. For example, if  Person A wanted to be perceived as confident, they would ask themselves if the article of clothing or whatever fit inside the "confident" bubble.  I found that idea to be useful. So the first step is choosing your keywords, and then considering them when you shop or dress yourself.

text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:I slipped into the "easy casual lounge wear" early on in the shut down where I live. I almost immediately left crappy and sad. I realized for me, in a world where I have no control over anything, I do have control over what I wear. Even though I have been working from home, and have no where to go, I get dressed...every day.   After a while I realized that, no one sees me except maybe a waist up video call once a day, so why not wear things that I was excited about? Who cares if anyone else likes it. I have always been drawn to vintage pieces and even had a few in my closet. I rarely wore them because they didn't fit the classic business casual that was expected in my office. I wore those pieces almost every day. Then I started a Pinterest board with really specific criteria, earth tones (looks good with my skin tone), vintage cuts, texture, natural fibers. Boom. For the first time in my 30yrs I had a style that I loved!   I kept the few items I already had and loved, and slowly started collecting others that would match or compliment them. I went the thrifting route because 1. its cheaper, and 2. I could find good quality pieces in natural fibers more easily than if I had gone to the mall. I would visit a thrift store once every two weeks and get one or two items, always reminding myself of my criteria (natural fibres, classic/vintage cuts, earth tones). It narrowed down what I looked for and bought which made it easier.  Now, two months later, I have a cute little capsule wardrobe, and I LOVE every piece.  I guess that was a really long winded way to say, wear what you want and what inspires you in the morning. Especially now when no one is around to judge you while you are just "trying things out".	episode_done:True

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:I have always been pretty comfortably middle class, but yes lack of physical access has changed my attitudes to shopping at least.   I grew up on a super remote island, and literally the only place to buy "new" clothes was the thrift store, so everyone was walking around in each other's clothes. I never associated second hand clothing with poverty until I moved to the city, so I still have an attitude of "I don't want this dress anymore, but it would look great on my friend so I'll offer it to her" which some people find very weird.   The lack of access to shops has also affected my attitude to shopping. I can't fathom shopping as a past time or getting much enjoyment out of the act of shopping. Clothes shopping (besides the thrift shop) was something we did on one day a year as part of our annual holiday off the island. Mum would drag us around hundreds of shops, trying on clothes and shoes and it was exhausting and high stress and built so many terrible memories that I now hate clothes shopping with a passion.	episode_done:True

text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I have been rebuilding my wardrobe for the last couple of years because I have the financial means to do so at this point in my life, and I feel like I finally have a good sense of what works/what I like.  This is what I kept in mind when making my purchases:  - What type of fabrics/colors/fit do I find myself reaching for the most often? - What outfits were my favorites in the past? What qualities about them made me feel confident/comfortable/good? Were my favorite outfits also my most worn? Why yes or no? - What occasions/situations do I need the most clothes for?  For me, I realized that I heavily favored natural fabrics that drape while still having some hints of structure. Fabrics like linen, cotton, and wool. I like black, cream, camel, burnt orange, and earthy reds.   When I had a good sense of what I needed and wanted, I did the following:  - Bought basics first. Well-fitting pants, solid tops, good undergarments like slips/bras/underwear. These basics followed my general rules for fit/cut/quality/fabric/color story.  - Only purchase items that fit perfectly. I realized that if something was even slightly too long, too tight, too whatever, I wouldn't end up wearing it.  - After I had the basics, I started purchasing items that I could build on the basics to create awesome outfits. I would only purchase something if I could think of ways to incorporate it into multiple outfits.	episode_done:True

Seems like side-by-side comparison photos for these are pretty hard to find.  I already have Greats Royale which is decidedly chunkier than CP, and I'm hoping to get a pair of white sneakers in slimmer profile similar to CP.  Kind of considering Beckett Simonon but I'd prefer having actual lace guards instead of BS's more minimal "holes on a plain sheet of leather" look. Also would prefer smoother looking leather than BS's leather with visible pores (not sure if they're pores, but similar texture to orange peel).  In the end, Artisan Lab seems the closest barring CP, although AL's heel part doesn't look as good as CP imo. I think that's worth sacrificing for a cheaper price, but if they're visibly chunkier than CPs, then I may as well just pay that CP premium (although I'm never paying full price lol)	episode_done:True

Any recommendations for a good turtleneck, preferably not too thick of a material, something to layer under a jacket.
text:Possibly but there is no way to tell   Some claim they make outlet quality versions of mainline jeans. Not sure I believe that. With Levis ubiquitous sales you could probably get 501s from the Levi website for close to the same price with Black Friday coming up.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn‚Äôt get boring?	labels:I catalogued all my clothes in an app and track what I wear. If I want to wear something different\~\~\~ then I look at the category of "unworn" clothing and pick something to make an outfit with. It's really helped me make sure I wear as much of my clothes as possible (obviously the black cocktail dress is going to see less use than the everyday pink sweater but it helps with more unique items like my t shirt with applique parrots lol). If you don't want to catalogue your clothes and put this much effort into it (lol) you could just move your clothes to another part of your closet after you wear them or reverse the orientation of the hangers after wearing. Try to move as much of your clothes to the "worn" side of your closet as possible. And when you pick a lesser worn item don't give up and just make an outfit of it! Who cares if it doesn't match perfectly, you'll do it better next time!	episode_done:True

text:I actually hate my Ruggable. I love the design, but it is horrible for a house with dogs that shed a lot. The only way I‚Äôve found to get hair out of the rug is to get down and scrape it with my hands. Since using the vacuum with the brush (which would normally loosen hair) separates it from the Velcro and causes it to wrinkle, it‚Äôs impossible. Also, the edges are always rolling up.   Ok, end rant!	labels:I hate mine too. My dog peed on it the day after we got it so I put it to good use right away, but it‚Äôs a pain in the ass to set up and the edge are rolled up	episode_done:True

If everyone started dressing like her, then it will be in fashion.	episode_done:True

Inevitably the comments use the word "hipster" as an insult when it is so clearly a euphemism for "fag".    The whole thing is so gross and tiring. I guess that can be said for lots of stuff in 2020.

text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:One thing we don‚Äôt talk about much is the importance of tailoring and undergarments for those 50s and 60s looks.  There‚Äôs a reason a lot of the actresses on Mad Men had to wear crinolines and girdles and cone bras with their costumes; that‚Äôs what created the silhouette.  Also 50s and 60s inspired clothes that have a lot of stretch in the fabric won‚Äôt hang or move the same. ETA:  oops, I see you said ‚Äòmen‚Äôs fashion‚Äô.  The part of my comment re: tailoring and fabric content still applies!	episode_done:True
text:What fashion trend/s have you been obsessed with lately?	labels:I really love these huge, puffed up sleeved sweaters which cuff at the wrists.

text:When is a garment worth it to you?	labels:It is highly subjective, but the old saying "you get what you pay for" is true. High end materials and fibers will cost more. There is a point, however, where you start paying for the label beyond the quality of the materials. Then, it is just a matter of preference.	episode_done:True

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn‚Äôt get boring?	labels:Shoes and other accessories can be much cheaper to own and can completely change the vibe of an outfit. A different pair of shoes alone can take basically the same outfit from grandpa-core to vintage feminine to streetwear. For example I have pretty basic black cotton blend dress that I can wear with platform sneakers for a streetwear look, with flats or booties with pearl or diamond earrings for a "classy casual extra feminine" daytime look, and thigh high boots and berry lipstick for a "baddie" look on a night out.  Jewelry, makeup, and shoes are just fun easy ways to play with being someone else for a day without own multiple different sets of actual clothing. In my experience costume jewelry and second-hand or outlet retail shoes (like from places like TJ Maxx, Ross, Burlington, etc.) hold up much better for the lower prices than fast fashion fabrics do. So I like to get quality clothing and basic accessories, but then have cheaper more "out there" accessories/stuff for variety and experimental/trendy moments.  That ends up being way cheaper and more sustainable than buying a new top or skirt that will fall apart or be out of style in a year every time I want to feel different for a little bit. A change in hair and makeup is even cheaper and more sustainable because often you can use the same products, but just with different techniques/styles.	episode_done:True
text:US bans all cotton from China's Xinjiang region over forced labor concerns	labels:Just force them making coffee then, or chocolate!!	episode_done:True
text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:I wouldn't say I inherently hate the brand but I think Champion is an example of a brand that exploded a few years back/to now basically all because some celebrities or whoever wore it- and everyone who wears it now is most likely a ding dong hypebeast type or the VSCO type girl or whatever. Like I'm old enough to remember it being bottom tier Wal Mart level shit you'd get borderline made fun of for wearing- but now all of the sudden it's enjoying this moment. So it's just that perceived inauthenticity and collective pivot in peoples' minds to a fashion name to people rather than just athletic apparel that irks me somehow.  However though, the Todd Snyder Champion stuff is PHENOMENAL- it's not the mainline stuff. You don't see any of those assholes rocking that.

text:For those who define their style as "classic-traditional" (tailored, fitted, matching, sleek), what are your typical outfits for work, on the weekends, date-night, running errands or lounging around?	labels:I have to dress biz casual lite (aka, not jeans) for work, so my work/weekend outfits are the same - I like button-downs with midi skirts and ballet flats or feminine mule slides, high-waisted trousers with thin fitted tops, linen shorts and button-downs, and dresses (sometimes with a sweater over the top or a cardigan).   I feel like I‚Äôve slowly narrowed in on my favored style via trial and error and I usually focus on the silhouette - I like things that nip in at the waist and I either have a looser top or bottom, but never both. I stick to a neutral palette (lots of camel, light blue, black, and green) and avoid anything too trendy.   For lounging around, I wear sweatpants haha - but I have cute high-waisted ones in a pretty tan color that are slightly ‚Äúelevated.‚Äù	episode_done:True
text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:I wash underwear, socks, masks, leggings, and tank tops (I wear one under most outfits for smoothness/sweat!) after each wear. Outer layers like sweaters, hoodies, etc after three or four wears. Jeans after four or more wears‚Äî can usually tell by how they feel and fit that they‚Äôre ready for a wash.  Bralettes when they start to smell!
text:How do you separate your laundry? I‚Äôve been separating it by ‚Äútype‚Äù but everyone I know does it by color. Now I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I‚Äôm doing something wrong, but washing black underwear with black jeans just bc theyre the same color sounds so odd to me	labels:I personally wash everything together if I know that the colors won‚Äôt bleed. So if you have not washed something in a darker color before, absolutely wash it by itself before tossing it in with whites! If the underwear is delicate, a delicates or lingerie bag is a good (reasonably inexpensive) investment, though I‚Äôd still be wary of tossing them in with anything denim or generally rough (t-shirts or blouses are fine). When I was living with the rest of my family, we separated out by ‚Äúhot water‚Äù (socks, underwear, etc) and ‚Äúcold water‚Äù (everything else) more than color.	episode_done:True

They vetoed me posting pictures (we have public facing jobs, these pictures are all over social media, too easy to reverse image search etc.), but they wore a Rick Owens dress (that I picked out) while I went full minimalism with a collarless shirt with onyx studs, a sleek blazer and cropped trousers. I put this together from my existing wardrobe, since we didn't want to spend a lot. Covid measures made things a bit weird, but the court officer made a real effort into making it nice, which was great. (edit: just so nobody thinks we are totally irresponsible: it was literally just us at city hall, no guests, no party. We'll catch up with that after vaccination.)  It was fun seeing all y'all Americans count down to my wedding day.

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.
text:I have what I call my "base layer," which is a black shirt (t-shirt or long sleeve, depending on season) and black bottoms (pants or leggings).   Then a colorful sweater or jacket on the top, plus a scarf and gold earrings, and I'm out the door.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - October 23	labels:I gotta say, as an American, it's really surprising that there's class connotations to rugby shirts. On paper, rugby should be an "everyman" sport like soccer, basketball, football, baseball, etc. with the barrier to entry just being a ball and a field. Seems really out of place for it to be paired up with golf, tennis, and horse-related stuff.
text:Rugby Union is a middle and upper class sport associated with fee paying schools in England (and Scotland to some extent).  The working class version is Rugby League. There was a schism in the late 1800s over the payment of wages to players and the dominance of London and the South East of England in the RFU. The working class sport went in an entirely different direction.   Union is the prominent version in culture, and the big money one too and a lot of English support and players still come from the wealthy South East and private fee paying schools.  Slightly different in Wales where we kept playing Union, and it's essentially our national sport and very working class but we're an outlier in the UK on that.  Of course, Ireland (and Ulster) is even more complicated because of, well, the sectarian thing.  But rugby shirts tend to get seen heavily around the big Spring and Autumn tournaments and worn by a very particular kind of English man (and Scotsman, Welshman etc), that is both a class thing and also a kind of macho laddish thing. Here in Wales rugby culture is heavy drinking, men down the club thing and not exactly friendly to women, LGBT etc.  There's also the national thing, Wales' single greatest sporting achievement in my lifetime in popular culture probably isn't winning the Tour de France or making it really far in euro 2016. It's knocking England out of the rugby world cup they were hosting at their home stadium. We all love to hate England rugby fans too. The England rugby team represent a lot of what the Welsh resent about England for lots of reasons.  When we were in Japan for the World Cup last year I thought my wife was going to tear apart the loud England fan who was supporting Fiji over us three seats away.	labels:That makes sense. My father-in-law is really into rugby, in all forms, and has all the obscure sports packages for TV to be able to record basically every single match on earth. He very well might have been on the US national team in his 20s... but tryouts were on his wedding day. Ended up being the club team advisor for about a decade at the university he taught at instead.  He's never brought up this stuff at all.

text:Are LBD‚Äôs really a MUST?	labels:Don't be too worried about looking like everyone else, clothes aren't always about standing out. I think it's good to have a classy black dress just in case you get invited somewhere you have to dress nice. Like maybe you need to do a poster presentation for your thesis, or your org has a formal. They're easy to dress up or down depending on accessories.    Honestly, if you can't think of an occasion where you'd wear one, then you don't need one! I just like the simplicity of a black dress sometimes, esp if you have accessories that you want to emphasize.	episode_done:True
text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:I have an excellent tip for this! Get a large salad spinner and some gentle lingerie soap, put your really delicate stuff in with some warm water and detergent, spin a hand-full of times and let it soak for 5 mins, drain the water out and fill it with cold water, let it soak for 5, then spin, drain, refill, spin drain repeat till it comes out clear. Takes maybe 15 mins total and you don't destroy your clothing. You can even spin it again once the water is out to speed up drying if you let it air dry.

text:Exactly what I was going to say. I got a navy one at TJ Maxx. It was $50. It‚Äôs perfect. Structured so you can stuff it or barely have anything in it and it looks the same. Big purse=big lot of junk.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it‚Äôs typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it‚Äôs a bottom, they no longer ‚Äústay up‚Äù. This usually happens with leggings or panties after about 5 or more years of regular wear with caring for the items properly.  I also had a faux leather jacket wear out after 6 years of regular wear. The faux leather ended up ‚Äúpeeling off‚Äù or something like that.

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:I would find a shape you think works for you and try different textures! A black jean is really different from black leather, which is really different from black velvet. I tend to have basically the same pant (black+fitted) in different textures which I love, no harm in it. I would also look at whether any printed pants would suit your needs - if you have a lot of solid tops this could be a fun change.	episode_done:True

Sequins and velvet and a good set of heels. Those are the only things I would need outside of work haha oh and a new swimsuit. I just read Nicole Byers‚Äô book and now I want to brave a bikini for the first time in nearly a decade.   But mostly in 2021 my goal is to spend more time/energy/money on non clothing fashion, like actually getting my hair cut and colored instead of doing it myself, getting my nails done regularly, maybe getting laser hair removal, and a new tattoo. I want to feel polished all over.	episode_done:True
text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I guess I would say I do, because I don't "use looks/trends" I use shapes and colours that suit me and that fit parts of me i'd like to express.  And that does create a signature "look" without trying too hard because well.. I can't change my shape, and the colours that suit me are very defined within a colour palette.  I'm almost always wearing something stretchy that accommodates my body gently, and I like deep colours, soft colours and neutrals. I can have different elements (such as a romantic element, or a classy element) but the underlying fundamentals of "me" is there.  The problem with having different looks is that less pieces go together and some aesthetics don't really suit people as well as other looks might because the "structure" of the piece clashes with the person. I'm thinking of someone who might like sleek aesthetic inspired by 6 foot tall people, when they are more small and rounded, and it may be better to keep to their lines and add "touches of sleekness". Keep the air of sleekness but twist it in a way that suits them.. in other words, not "copy the aesthetic".	episode_done:True

text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I buy/sell on eBay, Poshmark, depop, and Mercari. There are pros and cons to all of them. For me I‚Äôm not trying to make money or save money necessarily‚ÄîI just want to recycle clothes that didn‚Äôt work for me and from everything I‚Äôve read most donated clothes end up in landfills. I also prefer to buy secondhand for similar reasons.   Poshmark definitely has the best customer service. I‚Äôve dealt with a lot of bad sellers (listing the wrong size, clothes not as described etc) and whenever I‚Äôve reached out to Poshmark they basically refund all my money and let me keep the item. On the flip side, as a seller people have unnecessarily complained (item didn‚Äôt fit) and Poshmark didn‚Äôt allow them to send the item back for a refund‚Äîmaybe Poshmark gave them a refund and let them keep the item but I wasn‚Äôt effected. This is something that REALLY irritates me about eBay‚Äîthey always take the side of the buyer and u end up having wasted time, money etc shipping something even when u aren‚Äôt at fault. I really wish eBay would absorb the costs like Poshmark does, but this is probably why Poshmark has the highest fees.  Ultimately I think the downfall of Poshmark will be the wholesalers and people who are doing it as a side hustle. It‚Äôs becoming harder and harder for sellers with 20-30 listings from their actual personal closet to sell things because there‚Äôs so much garbage for buyers to sift through. It‚Äôs also hard for me as a buyer to find bundles anymore. In the early days sellers closets were made up of actual clothes from their closets so they were all the same size and the style of the person selling. Now if I find something I like it‚Äôs impossible to find another item in someone‚Äôs closet because there are 500 random listings to sift through.

text:Reliable brands to buy in South America - Americans your opinions please!	labels:I am no longer living in Brazil, but here are a few decent options back from when I used to live there: .. Reserva (usereserva.com) - casual wear .. Aramis - for shirts .. Osklen - a little bit pricier than Reserva, a carioca luxury brand of sorts .. Ellus .. Hering - t-shirts (single colour), shorts  I prefer these national brands to some of the options available at Zara, Calvin Klein and Adidas. Better construction than Zara, at least.

text:I have made a realization that, apart from school uniforms, I only ever wear polo shirts	labels:I can never shake the association of polos and retail workers
text:Yeah I already disliked polos but working retail killed them for me, it‚Äôs a work uniform forever for me	labels:I don't get this. Retail workers wear shirts, t shirts, sometimes sweatshirts, jeans, chinos, trainers, etc etc. Polo shirts are no more common than any other type of shirt.

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items have all been high quality copies of items I have in low quality but wore out the wazoo.  For example, I knew I was ready to invest in some high end Chelsea boots when I found myself going through a cheap pair every year. Or to invest in a nice leather-looking jacket when I found myself grabbing mine 70% of the time I went out.  The expensive items were hard to wear at first, maybe on date nights or to a nicer event, but as I got more used to wearing them I wore them more often. I think it took me a hot year before I wore my Red Wings more than like once a month.   My recommendation is keep the items in your comfort zone (so no wild dresses or Colors at first) and to force yourself to wear it at a regular interval. These days, just wearing nice jeans while I go shopping seems to be my ‚Äúdate night‚Äù when I dress up!
text:That‚Äôs a really good idea, buying cheap versions and seeing what you rewear. Can‚Äôt believe I haven‚Äôt thought of that.   The thing that I want to spend money on is leather lined shoes, especially chukka boots. But I also teach elementary school. All day, they step on my feet and it destroys my shoes. So I don‚Äôt want to spend more than $100 if 7 year olds are just gonna wreck them.	labels:My dad always told me to do that with tools, as well. If you use it a lot, then invest in a high quality piece. If you rarely need it, a lower cost tool will be fine! I try to take that advice for all parts of my life!	episode_done:True

text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:I dunno, I have no problem looking ‚Äòoverdressed‚Äô.

text:I am older than most here, I suppose. When I was in high school, dresses and heels were not unusual (in the mid-late 70's). I liked the variety of clothes I was able to wear and enjoyed "dressing up" once a week or more!  In college, daily clothes were jeans, blouses, sweaters. I had one friend who dressed to the nines everyday-makeup, hair, the works.  I admired her and I wish now that I would have followed her example. I was too afraid to stand out and also too lazy! I did only what I needed to do to stay a B student. Staying up late at parties makes it hard to wake up and do your hair. She was also at the top of the class (chemical engineering) and was a talented actress. I don't think she missed out on fun, but probably didn't have as many hangovers as I did.  I never went back to "daily dressy" at work (flats and trousers in the lab), but I didn't wear jeans every day until grad school.  My message- don't be afraid to stand out! Express yourself and you will have plenty of admirers. Encourage others to do the same.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Learning to dress better	labels:Do you have someone you think dresses really cool? Either real life or celebrity? Cop their style some and as you get more comfortable add your own touch.

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:As someone who dresses like an absolute nut job I have learned that generally speaking as long as your outfit is overall appropriate for the situation, you can get away with murder. Like I wouldn't wear a sequined micro mini or ballgown to my office job, but I would absolutely wear a velvet suit and a bunch of brooches. I have also noticed that when I wear pieces that I love, my confidence increases throughout the day. Sometimes I have moments in the day where I look down and think "dang, this outfit is cool and I feel cool!" Those moments just give me a boost of confidence all on their own. The last thing is that people are generally too busy with their own lives to notice what you're wearing. They're doing them, so do you and have fun with it!   edit-words

text:General Discussion - October 27	labels:I think early MFA and the attendant blogosphere it spawned / belonged to / helped popularise is partially to blame for the whole "timeless" nonsense.  We've come a long way from "well dressed men wear suits" to "actually shirts and blazers can be dressed down" to "actually you can wear what you want and look good", and maybe the whole "timeless", "dapper", "classic", "gentleman" thing was a necessary part of the journey, but... would it just fucking die please.
text:Sad part is the nature of the ‚Äútimeless‚Äù trend is gonna cause people to stick to it and swear by it forever.

text:yea, Im pretty sad they are so long. I am not into the crop look for winter but when I was looking at details I just saw regular and assumed they would be around 28 inches( didnt see the 30.5 inch measurment online at the time). As someone that's 5'5 I didnt expect a regular length to be to long. Im not sure if I want to pay the 8 dollar return fee again though to go for the crops since I'm having a hard time getting past other fit issues  I might try the rebel pants instead as its stated they are meant for curvier types. I do not like the fitted look though, I prefer the straight leg, I just think they bunch because they are to long	labels:Eh I think that it‚Äôs great piece for fall/winter bc you can wear big sweaters to hide the other fit issues. By the time summer comes, you definitely won‚Äôt be wearing them. But if it‚Äôs only $8 for something you might like better and actually wear, then I would bite the bullet. Better than these sitting in your closet and never wearing them, or taking a loss and selling them.	episode_done:True

text:Wolf vs Goat Fonzie Goes to India t-shirt Review and Fit	labels:I‚Äôve been looking for the perfect white T-shirt for a while. It‚Äôs almost an obsession at this time.  Right now the only T-shirt that checks all the marks, except for price, is Velva Sheen.  Wolf vs Goat seems too gimmicky to enter the list as of yet I tried these brands:  Velva Sheen ‚Äî perfect but too expensive. Not very soft but I don‚Äôt really mind it since it holds its shape/fit is the perfect thickness.  Everlane heavyweight cotton ‚Äî good but too long.  Naked and famous ‚Äî too long and expensive ($50)  Uniqlo Supima cotton ‚Äî too thin, shows my nipples  Taylor stitch heavy weight ‚Äî too thick for the summer  Taylor stitch hemp cotton blend ‚Äî too thin, shows my nipples. Nice fit though   Random Amazon heavy weight cotton ‚Äî too long and loose  Next one one on my list is Kuwalla because they have the same barrel stitching construction as Velva Sheen but much cheaper at roughly $25/tshirt, and it will likely be the last one before I bite the bullet and go full Velva sheen for my tshirts.  Edit:  Just noticed WvG is based in DC. Going to give them a try.

text:I actually hate my Ruggable. I love the design, but it is horrible for a house with dogs that shed a lot. The only way I‚Äôve found to get hair out of the rug is to get down and scrape it with my hands. Since using the vacuum with the brush (which would normally loosen hair) separates it from the Velcro and causes it to wrinkle, it‚Äôs impossible. Also, the edges are always rolling up.   Ok, end rant!	labels:Is it microfiber? Is that why?  R/cleaning would tell you to use a squeegee. Them peeps obsessed with squeegeeing pet hair off carpets.

text:I'm Not a Watch Guy I Swear - Street x Sprezza	labels:I am a watch guy, but very much a relatively broke one.  Had I known how much trouble it would be to break into watches, I might have said never mind and wisely walked away. I didn‚Äôt, though.   Some pointers for those interested:  1.	The cost of the watch is only the upfront cost. Like a car, a mechanical watch needs regular maintenance. Generally speaking, this will be anywhere from $300 to $1,000+...every 5-7 years.  2.	Because of point #1, entry level (~ $500) mechanical watches are not pieces you will pass down to your kids. In fact, it is usually cheaper to trash them entirely and buy new than to bother having them serviced.  3.	People will tell you there are deals to be had in the vintage market. That‚Äôs true, but it can also be difficult to find parts or people willing to work on them. 4.	There is relatively little offered between entry level and about $3,000.  5.	There is nothing wrong with wearing a quartz or digital watch.   All that being said, I still love my small collection. Just wish I had known those things from the start.
text:hard disagree with point #4. See: Nomos, Sinn, Seiko, Grand Seiko quartz, Damasko, etc.	labels:I'm a former watch guy. I guess the hard part is for most who arent watch geeks, they'd want public recognition after spending $2-3k on wrist candy and the public dont know Nomos, Sinn, Marathon, Baltic, Oris.

text:"Can people just hate fashion again" - Synecdoche When Talking about the "Industry" Discussion	labels:> Should spaces & industries for fashion lovers, clothes lovers, and people that have to wear clothes be completely separate?  I don‚Äôt think that any of these groups should be completely separate however I do find them all being lumped into the same spaces very frustrating as someone who does love fashion as a form of art and creativity.  I like harsh and blunt constructive criticism in pretty much all areas of life and I most certainly want it for my outfits as well. I want to hear what other fashion lovers and artists think of my colour choices, proportions, textures, fit, etc. and be able to refine those things and really flex my creative muscles when creating an outfit. Instead, many fashion spaces are dominated by ‚Äòyou do you hun!‚Äô and ‚Äòso long as you like it, that‚Äôs all that matters!‚Äô which is great for someone *who has to wear clothes* and doesn‚Äôt actually care about fashion but joins fashion spaces because they feel some obligation as a woman to care about it but... those spaces just become unhelpful and bland for those who really love fashion and want to get better at it.  I‚Äôve been an off and on follower of FFA for a few years and I feel like it‚Äôs definitely dominated by the ‚Äúpeople who wear clothes‚Äù group and unfortunately it limits the amount of critique that is acceptable to give.

I have put an effort in buying less but buying a quality piece (for the environment ya know) so all I need is 20 pieces of clothing.  I usually include a couple of trendy pieces. a leather jacket. a fur jacket. a nice tan color wool jacket. another beige wool jacket. 2-3 high-waisted trouser/tailored-pants. 1 denim jean. 1 white blouse. Sometimes I include dresses and skirts depend on the season. I usually don't include skirts and dresses though because they are not as versatile but I tend to keep a beige silk wrap skirt.  Since I own less, I am able to care for each item more. Each piece is very loved.	episode_done:True

What designers were delivering and retailers stocking was out of step with consumers' buying habits.  This was a great way to explain how the precollections help fill in the gaps, but it will be interesting to see brands cutting down on resort or cruise collections. I normally enjoy precollections cause I find that they tend to be more fun and leave room for more creativity by the designers.  > At the high end, fashion is a relationship business. Sales associates at brand flagships and independent boutiques keep up with clients via phone, text, and e-mail. Rather than making orders through a website, you reach out to your SA and ask "do you have x in?" or they contact you as new stock comes in and try and sell you on whatever bizarre runway item people with both money and sense üëèwillüëènotüëèbuyüëè.

Everything else I hang up on a garment rack to air out. I hit it with cheap vodka in a spray bottle to deodorize/sanitize. I learned that trick in costume class in college, much more skin safe than febreze. I use a steamer to get out the wrinkles and reshape. I recycle my old toothbrush brushes/cut up tshirt rags to spot clean with felsnaptha or oxi clean.  If you have good hygiene and aren‚Äôt sweating, there‚Äôs really no need to wash most things, especially with a washing machine. Clothing experiences a lot of friction while being agitated in the machine and that will wear your fibers out. I have shirts I bought at 16 that still look brand new and spot care preserves all my vintage/handmade pieces. The hang/vodka/steam combo is great for bras too, which should only be hand washed if they need to be thoroughly cleaned.	episode_done:True

Of course, there are are ethical retailers out there that have lower prices, but if you are young and/or poor, there is a certain amount of fast fashion that you need to buy because it fits your price/budget. Even though it isn‚Äôt ideal, not all fast fashion is gone in a couple years, if you are buying less trendy pieces you can wear for a while.  Many things I‚Äôve bought from fast fashion retailers I‚Äôve had for years - I haven‚Äôt changed my height or weight much in over 10 years, so I have tops from Old Navy I have had for 10 years and other clothes that have lasted way past 5 years.  Reducing consumption is a key part of ethical fashion and even if you buy it from a retailer that is cheaper because that‚Äôs what you can afford, if you keep it a long time and don‚Äôt buy a bunch of clothes all the time, you are reducing demand and helping the environment.	episode_done:True

text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:Perhaps transition lenses have improved and it's a case of only noticing the bad ones, but I definitely see them tinted indoors occasionally and they look dopey. Like wearing sunglasses indoors in general.  I'd be uncomfortable buying them as a primary pair of glasses without trying out the transition for the day and seeing them actually transition quickly in my normal haunts.
text:They do transition quicker now with gen 8 version, but still not that quick  Takea about 3-4mins depending on where you live, colder climates are slower and tint gets darker, warmer is faster, but gets less tinted, in a car it doesn't work for those who drive that might be a big consideration  I was just thinking from style perspective and not looking like a nerd or ruining the look. The guy above is right, he said the same thing as my glass store if you get one you gotta go 1 size bigger, cuz they usually seem to make your glasses look smaller  But if you r indoor, your glasses look big, so you sacrifice on looks basically  I think they would look good if your frames are big and plastic made, I'm taking big big frames or if your pair is sold as sunglasses too, but I think having separate sunglasses is more practical, a hustle to carry, but does a better job if you got the space for it	labels:	episode_done:True

I hope you enjoy it ‚ù§Ô∏è  P.S. just a note that the size twin app is going to be updated in the next week or so -- it's very out of date. If you follow me on IG that's the easiest way to hear about updates, but I can edit this comment when it's refreshed, too!   **(11/30 update if anybody is still reading -- the app is updated!)**  Edit: since so many of you are finding the tool mostly useless, I just wanted to say that the goal was to create something that would help you find fashion inspo from people who are more similar in size to you than a fashion model in a magazine.  Of course it's impossible to get an exact body double from just 3 measurements, but that's what the standard is, and that's what I could reasonably expect the average person to know about themselves. I have to make sure that the barrier to entry is very low. The more people can join this index, the more useful it is. Please remember that I offer this tool completely for free, that I don't work in the fashion industry, and that I don't have any background in the industry (fashion, data, or web design). I just wanted to do something helpful for the community. I will try my best to make as many improvements as I can over time, but I have very limited resources, and maintaining it is quite a lot of effort as is. Sorry, all!

My essentials  (\* means seasonal)   1) Athletic shoes-- usually a name brand (Nike, New Balance, etc) purchased at TJ Maxx or the like.     2) Slip on sneakers-- surprisingly Walmart has some that fit well and are semi cute   3) Flip flops\*   4) Chelsea Boots-- The ones I have now are Primark brand\*   5) Knock off UGG velvet boots.  So comfy and I can't wait until the weather allows me to wear these again.\*   6) Tall riding boots\*   7) Winter boots that can survive the snow\*   8) Ballet flats   9) High heeled shoe.  &#x200B;  I have other shoes but for the most part I don't deviate too far from the above categories.

I just had to keep receipts, and subtract the cost when we got home. Besides cutting down on ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt really need this‚Äù arguments, I actually ended up learning some useful lessons from the process‚Äîin order to set my budget for the year, it was my job to figure out what I needed and lay out a proposal, which was negotiating practice (my sister and I competed to see who could get a bigger one approved!), and we had to use Excel to log everything.

Cheaper sweaters are noticeably thinner (both the threads and the sweater itself), which don't keep you as warm and don't last as long.   The good news is that there are some great options for getting high quality sweaters at low prices if you're willing to shop secondhand. For $150 you can find a gently used sweaters from Ines Meain and IMO that's a much better purchase than most of the cotton and fine merino wool sweaters listed in this article.

My parents (and all of my relatives) expected me to dress super preppy (like a walking J. Crew catalog-- those were a thing then).  I was secretly alternative and was more about band tees and late 90s era Hot Topic stuff.  But I had very few Hot Topic type things because of my parents.   I remember putting black lipstick on as soon as I got to school and taking it off before I went home.  I hid the lipstick in my locker.    They still give me a hard time about how I dress and I simply reply with "I'm not you.

Eventually, the tops always end up with a hole and stretch out quite a bit.  I've not shopped at GAP in over a decade, but I still own a pair of sweatpants from them that are now 20 years old. Yes, That's how well they have been lasting. I doubt that the current ones would hold up that well.  Anthropologie pants also always end up with holes and stretched out. The tops always feel very cheap to me when I look at them in the store. Even buying on sale is becoming not worth it.  I have tried Sezane recently and am very pleasantly surprised at the quality from the feel of it. It remains to be seen how well the pieces hold up. If they do, I'm ok with spending the extra amount if it's  going to last a decade.	episode_done:True

text:I actually hate my Ruggable. I love the design, but it is horrible for a house with dogs that shed a lot. The only way I‚Äôve found to get hair out of the rug is to get down and scrape it with my hands. Since using the vacuum with the brush (which would normally loosen hair) separates it from the Velcro and causes it to wrinkle, it‚Äôs impossible. Also, the edges are always rolling up.   Ok, end rant!	labels:Is it microfiber? Is that why?  R/cleaning would tell you to use a squeegee. Them peeps obsessed with squeegeeing pet hair off carpets.

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I often buy multiples of items I love. I bought several of the same cardigan after I realized that I wore it more than any other sweater I owned. It's great!  Another thing I do is, when I see an item I like, I mentally run through my closet and see if it will mesh with what I already own. If it works, I get it. If I'd have to buy several new items to make it work, I don't. For this reason, I don't own many t-shirts, but I do own lots of sweaters and dresses.
text:That‚Äôs the biggest life lesson I‚Äôve carried on from one of my high school teachers - if you find you truly love an item of clothing, it‚Äôs worth the time to go back and get it in every color (that‚Äôll fit your wardrobe).   Now if only I were the type to recognize immediately that I love an item instead of waiting until it‚Äôs no longer sold, that‚Äôd be grand.	labels:I also suffer majorly from non-buyer remorse, but just had a major win recently! If I love something but I'm either not able to afford it or just not ready to pull the trigger, I take a photo of myself in the item, a photo of the store tag, and a photo of the tags on the clothing (especially any tag with a style number). I spent 3 years looking for a specific out of my budget Paige denim jacket that I tried on at Nordstrom Rack by scouring ebay, etsy, poshmark, etc.   Last month I finally found the exact jacket (confirmed by the style number and tag information) on Poshmark in excellent shape for a great price. Unfortunately in those 3 years I've gained a bit more weight than I realized and it's a bit tighter than my original try on photos, but still wearable!
text:Oh hell yes. Happy for you!  It‚Äôs a good idea to take pics of tags, I haven‚Äôt thought of that. That would make second-hand searches so much easier.  Y‚Äôall convinced me. I‚Äôll start searching for another one of a dress that a snap is broken on ü§û	labels:	episode_done:True

In my situation  even just learning about color and combinations becomes difficult because I lack the foundation to even see the colors and the nuances described. So far I¬¥m leaning towards a gray/white/black combo style which isnt too hard and look good. But I also really like earth tones/autumn viby colours and comfy clothing so I¬¥m checking that out at the moment. I recently saw Ordinary People (the movie from 1980) and the sweater, shirts and colors were perfect. Anyway, checking this out. Thanks  Edit: for colorblind bros: apparently there are apps (f.ex color grab and kuler) that can tell what color things are. Super helpful if you wanna learn which skin tone you have.

text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:Skiing is a strenuous sport, often done in a dangerous alpine climate. I wear technical gear: bright loose waterproof jacket and pants for visibility and mobility, wicking warm base layers, balaclavas and goggles to protect my eyes and skin, a helmet, and a backpack or fanny pack with an emergency kit.   After skiing, I strip off the outer layers and walk around in uggs, tights, and turtleneck.   You know what? I 100% blend in. I don't look better or worse than the hundreds of other people who have just come down from the mountain. This is why people specifically wear bright colors. Your party will be able to identify you at a distance from the specific colors you're wearing.   I think ski/apres ski style is to skiing what cottage core is to farming/homesteading. It's an aesthetic for people who don't actually do it.   If you like the look and aren't interested in skiing, then look into some New England heritage preppy looks. The bean boots, scandi wool sweaters, thick stretchy stirrup pants, fluffy trimmed accessories, and parkas may appeal to you. Uniqlo has some cute stuff in their recent collab that has that cozy lux vibe. Moncler and Gorsuch are some OG European ski fashion wear companies. You could look into those for inspiration.   But definitely don't try to go skiing without a waterproof pant and jacket combo. You will have a terrible time, given how much you will likely fall. (Assuming that you're a beginner.)
text:I live in a place with no snow so I'll probably never ski unless I go out of my way to go on a vacation somewhere with snow. I just wanted to say I LOVE the Tipsy Elves apparel and never realized I wanted to look like a cute astronaut until now.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Has anyone just said screw it and focused more on fit than color scheme for your outfits?

text:What's the deal with leg openings?	labels:Don't ask a  man who has tree trunks for legs	episode_done:True
text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:Personally I try to avoid faux if possible. Real leather lasts longer, faux leather is just plastic and I find it cracks and/or scuffs usually within a couple years. Granted, I haven't bought any luxury faux leather so maybe that would last longer. Also on the sustainability side I feel like real leather is better (although I'm sure it depends on processing and where it comes from)
text:Leather production is really terrible for the environment too, but since it lasts a looot longer and afaik is waaay more degradable, it's still by far the more environmentally friendly choice unless you purchase a whole lot of it.	labels:Tangentially related, but a lot of leather also comes from cows from the meat industry, so it‚Äôs also good that the entire animal is being used instead of raising a cow just for its hide.

text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:Is anyone else kind of tired of posts and comments that variously try to "justify" the price of obvious luxury goods, designerwear, etc.?  Good thread on the SLP teddy, but just about nothing in there is surprising. Is it well-constructed? Duh, it's SLP. Does it have little refinements all over, compared to everyday varsity jackets? Yeah, that's kind of the point. Is it "worth" $2,000? No, obviously not.   Like...at some point we need to acknowledge that these efforts are misguided, even if well-intentioned. You're buying SLP because it's SLP (or Ackermann, or Dick Ovens, or whatever your thing is). *That* is the justification. And that's a fine justification in and of itself! An analysis of the materials and construction is unlikely to throw up surprises that'll make people go "damn, that really makes it worth the obnoxious price tag!"   (This observation does not apply to bespoke clothing, where the justification genuinely is that you get something more or less customized for you, and you alone.)  What do people think?

text:Cristophe Loiron of Mister Freedom - Inspiration Album	labels:I love Mister Freedom and own a few pieces. I‚Äôm especially fond of his Campus leather jacket and Road Champ boots - which I don‚Äôt have yet.  The shirt I have doesn‚Äôt fit me great. It‚Äôs too trim for me, even in size 42/xl.   The pants, however, fit fantastic and thread the line quite well between straight and wide. They‚Äôre high waisted fatigues with a 9 inch opening in a camo pattern of his own design that‚Äôs reminiscent of frogskin/ duck hunter camo.   Lately, the new workwear repro Labour Union (which isn‚Äôt union made, despite the name) have straight up copied his Ranch Blouse design. Fuck them.  Christophe Loiron has a personal blog where he talks about his products, his design process and his inspiration. It‚Äôs a great read if you like design and workwear.
text:That‚Äôs interesting. I think there is another brand literally called ‚ÄúUnion Made‚Äù or something like that which is, go figure, not a union shop. The owners said they wanted to ‚Äúgive homage to that aesthetic‚Äù or something like that.  They had some cool looking Americana/workwear stuff but I just couldn‚Äôt pull the trigger.

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:It‚Äôs been said already but shoes, outerwear, and knits definitely. In terms of shoes, I don‚Äôt think you really need to spend obscene amounts of money or absolutely must have Goodyear welted construction to get quality or longevity out of your shoes either. In a rotation and with a minimal amount of effort in terms of care, you can get plenty of years out of more mid tier brands. With knits a good work around is just buying cotton instead of wool if you‚Äôre on a budget, most cheap wool is not great and cotton will be a bit tougher. If you‚Äôre worried about warmth just layer with some heat tech or the like.   The good thing about these 3 though are that the high quality stuff lasts forever so long as you don‚Äôt abuse it.	episode_done:True

text:What are your favorite bags at the moment?	labels:I like small, fairly structured bags for everyday wear. Lately I've been into short shoulder bags (so they hang above the elbow) and top handle bags that sit in the crook of the arm, but crossbody bags are classic and very practical. I recently scored a secondhand Little Liffner bag in sky-blue embossed leather; I'm excited to wear it in the spring with tonal browns and creams or with clashing shades of bright blue and purple. I also have a few fun vintage handbags, and I've always coveted smaller bags by Wandler, By Far and Mansur Gavriel‚Äî$$$ though!  If there's a lot of stuff to carry (like a big notebook and a change of shoes or something), I'll carry a separate bigger bag, like a canvas tote or an attache case. It's convenient to carry two bags in these situations; this way essentials like keys or a wallet don't get lost at the bottom of a giant tote.	episode_done:True

text:I'm convinced there isn't a single job that isn't miserable and that won't pound out any joy you could've gotten out of the tasks you're forced to do.

text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:My advice is to notice what people around you are wearing.  Take notes!  Are you in school?  Glance around the classroom to get ideas.  Do you have a job?  Are your coworkers wearing mostly jeans, or something else?  You can balance that with what you see on pinterest.  I was in a similar boat in that my family was super poor growing up, so I just had to wear whatever was given to me.  It took me a while to figure out what to buy, I would end up in situations where everyone else would be dressed one way and I would be dressed another -- like, say, wearing jeans and a sweater while everyone else was in dressier attire.  It also helps to notice what you find yourself wearing a lot.  For example, if you start with two pairs of shoes, heels and sneakers, and you notice you wear your sneakers way more, then you've learned: you should own more sneakers than heels.	episode_done:True

To diversify, i started by trying to buy different colors (I mostly had grey, black and green). At first I found it really hard to wear a different 'bolder' color. Once I felt comfortable with colors, I tried to buy different texture or materials. And now that I have different texture I'm trying different cuts.

text:Sewing your own clothes	labels:Having basic sewing skills to repair or slightly modify existing clothes is a fundamental skill most people should have and is absolutely worth the time. Novice tailoring is a great skill to have too and can save you some money. Beyond that, sewing clothes from scratch is more of a hobby than a necessity for most people, due to the widely available nature of inexpensive and functional clothing. So like most hobbies, whether or not it is "worth the time" (and cost! Sewing is expensive and it's frequently cheaper to just buy an item unless you're looking for a custom fit or something super unique) is more dependent on your enjoyment of the activity than it is on more "functional" motivators like cost-savings.
text:Yes, I think it is a hobby now. I love fashion I have been interested in cothes since I was a kid. For now, I don't have the skills, but it is like mindfulness. Maybe one day I get there :) Thanks a lot!	labels:	episode_done:True

She maintained this for a few years and now that she‚Äôs in her late 60s, she wears what makes her happy- embroidered sweatshirts and appliqu√© jeans.   I don‚Äôt wish she taught me anything but I think if she kept a pulse on trends it would‚Äôve saved me from some teasing in middle school. But, on the flip side, is it fun to fit in?

text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I am a teacher that went back to working in the building at the beginning of September, so to be fair I was only wfh for several months in the spring, but it still drastically changed my style, or my perspective on my style.   Pre-Covid my work style (and general style) had morphed over the years to become very, very minimal and neutral. Lots of Everlane and Eileen Fisher. This was both because I wanted to be taken seriously at my job (I read very young) and because it also seemed like what was in style to me.   Returning to work in the fall, I realized I really f*cking hated all of my sensible, plain, go with everything black and grey clothes.   I still really prefer earth tones and blacks and greys, and I still wear some pretty simple outfits somedays, but I went on a small spree on The RealReal after I had my realization. I bought myself some louder statement pieces that feel more me, including an embroidered Happy Sheep sweater, a knit Missoni sheath dress, a multi-colored leather and fur purse, platform oxfords, and a couple of geometric patterned silk shirts and dresses.   For me life is too short to try so hard to be timeless and professional. I‚Äôm not knocking the look, it just isn‚Äôt ~me~ I want to love the clothes I wear and the clothes I love are fun knits and patterns.

text:definitely worth the cost. I found out about contour bodysuits maybe a month ago and I already own 5. I would say it‚Äôs pretty true to size but I would size up for the crewneck styles only because the armpit isn‚Äôt stretchy which makes it harder to get out of. If you want a skin tight fit, I would go with regular size and just take into account you‚Äôll have to be patient at the end of the day getting it off or have someone help you.

text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:Depends on what the day is like for me.  I have the Madewell Medium Leather Transport Tote currently as my daily go-to and I normally have my phone, keys, wallet, some basic toiletries (chapstick, eye drops, ibuprofen, candies in case blood sugar gets low) in a small zipped bag, and more often than I'd like there are some random receipts and other things that should be cleared out.  When I'm traveling, all the extra space in the bag is used for things like carrying a light cardigan, small water bottle, headphones, small notebook, and other necessities for the day. It's been great for it's versatility.  I've thought about the idea of getting a higher end purse, (I think the Neverfull Tote from LV looks nice) but I honestly can't seem to confidently justify spending 10x more on basically the same thing (large tote bag) I currently have. Would like to hear more on why people buy luxury items and their experiences!
text:I've owned bags in various price ranges. I've found that more expensive ones, up to a point, tend to be more durable. Vachetta leather bags are very forgiving, and mine looks great after years of wearing it daily.

text:What are novelty leather keyrings/keychains for? How do you use them?	labels:I believe that they are used so you can have an easier time finding your keys as well as just a decoration.   I don't personally use them because I like to minimize the amount of space my items take up, but I can imagine it being relatively hard to find keys in a large tote unless you have a lot of little thingos hanging off of them, or you attach them to some kind of long string, hook, etc or keep them on a lanyard like you said.	episode_done:True

text:A work shirt will generally have two chest pockets and be lighter weight in a fabric like chambray, or a lighter flannel/twill.   Overshirts and shirt jackets will tend to have flapped chest pockets and maybe hip pockets and be a little heavier - maybe moleskin or corduroy or heavier flannel.   A chore jacket will be heavier again - wool or heavy twill or canvas maybe, and classically have two patch hip pockets and an external patch chest pocket and an internal chest pocket. Chore jackets will normally be cut much boxier too, and will have plain instead of button cuffs.	labels:	episode_done:True

For some people snow boots and really heavy feather filled winter coats are essential, I got a coat and boots I only wear when travelling in winter to cooler places and they would be inadequate for a lot of places! I love jeans, some women hate the feeling and would rather do without.  I dunno. You got to you do you, think hard of what you find comfortable physically and mentally, what makes you think "pretty" or colors that cheer you up. How much do you walk?

How) But I basically decided that I think I need to spend more time studying and gathering wardrobe inspiration, and taking care of basics. I also went to my local Fleet Feet and got fitted for proper walking shoes and a sports bra, so I can start exercising for my health. All in all, it's been a mix.	episode_done:True
text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:I have moved to different climates many times. My recommendation would to not purge or change anything until your move is complete. The reason is, you definitely get climatized, where what would consider "warm" in the winter to you now will feel chilly enough to wear heavyweight items you hadn't expected would work once you are climatized. A lot of items that you think will/won't work end up being the opposite, etc. You mentioned having less storage, so it sounds like you will need to offload/purge at some point, but I'd wait to do it once you get there and put it off for as long as you can to truly see what items work. I'll never move to a cold climate again but even moving to different warmer climates, I will wait to do any paring down/purging until I can get a little climatized and adapt.
text:Was coming here to say this as well. I recently moved from the Midwest to Florida and my body adjusted pretty quickly to the higher temps here. It‚Äôs my first winter and I find myself still wearing my warmest wool and cashmere sweaters, winter coat, and gloves. It‚Äôs all relative, so a 30F degree drop day to day is going to feel cold regardless of if you started at 90F or 60F. I would also recommend trying to wait a year if you can before purging. I think I could safely purge my snow pants if I wasn‚Äôt planning on using them when I visit my parents. It‚Äôs also hotter longer here though, so I could definitely reduce my sweaters by 20% (the ones I reach for last anyway) to make room for more hot weather clothing. Hope this helps and good luck with your move!	labels:In regards to the snow pants: I personally would definitely find a way to store stuff like that if you like to travel or visit family. I have always lived in southeastern Texas but my husband and I tend to be able to travel when it is winter up north and I *definitely* have super cold weather (for me) items I only break out when I travel. Even though they only get used once a year or less, it is worth it to have for me.	episode_done:True

It can get confusing checking the size guides of each brand when doing online shopping.
text:I‚Äôll settle for consistent sizing between different colors of the same item.

If you can‚Äôt do this then at the very least do not have the camera angled up at your face. -	I have noticed when I have my monitors blue light filter on, because the screen is more yellow toned, it warms up my skin on camera lol	episode_done:True

text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:A well fitted black wool coat in a cut that flatters you. It goes with any outfit.

text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:I feel the same way, I'm bewildered at so many people finding ALL pants uncomfortable.   The only thing I can think of is that they're either wearing the wrong style (I vastly prefer super high rise. midrise and lowrise cut me across the stomach in an uncomfortable way, unless they're a size too big), the wrong size (too small jeans WILL be terrible, especially 100% cotton), or they have sensory or digestive issues/stomach sensitivity.	labels:I find low rise the most comfortable, so the overwhelming prevalence nowadays of mid/high rise rules out most pants for me.	episode_done:True

text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:try to mimic in your clothes what your body does, but more in terms of structure and sharp vs soft lines rather than "broad hips need x". If you have a sharp bone structure, try sharp and crisp styles, if you look fleshy go with soft draping fabrics, if you look short then split the silhouette by colors or a belt. These are just examples but they can be extended to anything. This is basically what the kibbe system does.

text:General Discussion - October 27	labels:I think early MFA and the attendant blogosphere it spawned / belonged to / helped popularise is partially to blame for the whole "timeless" nonsense.  We've come a long way from "well dressed men wear suits" to "actually shirts and blazers can be dressed down" to "actually you can wear what you want and look good", and maybe the whole "timeless", "dapper", "classic", "gentleman" thing was a necessary part of the journey, but... would it just fucking die please.
text:There was a reddit shower thought awhile back about how Dads are like time capsules because they wear whatever was popular / in style when they had kids... as if they just stopped buying clothes and keeping up with trends once they had the first kid.  It seems like mid-20s/early-30s white guys in tech are the same. Based on what they're wearing, you can tell when they first started paying attention to how they dress. And they're all convinced that whatever they wear is timeless or classic, without recognizing that they just bought in to whatever was trending at that time (menswear, minimalism, streetwear, etc.) and that they already are starting to look dated.	labels:I agree. I just think that this partially resulted from how we used to "teach" fashion by some sort of quasi-scientific approach, with all the infographics etc. on how "clothes should look like". Everyone got a dose of post-hoc rationalisations on why the fashion of the day is "right" and it is difficult to move past that. Cf. the whole thing about slim fit being the right fit.
text:Look at every post/Q about spreadsheets or color wheels or apps or whatever... people want to take something that is fundamentally about taste and aesthetic and make it objective and rules-based. Them confronting the fact that this is impossible is very difficult for them.	labels:I've seen that in other advice subreddits as well. Latching on to "rules" makes it easier both for advice receiver (easier to understand) and easier for advice giver as well.  It leads to a reinforcing loop where a newbie shows up to ask a question, is given a rule from an "enlightened newbie", and then turns around and parrots that rule to the next newbie.	episode_done:True

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:Give shoes a day break between wearings.  A shoe repair guy said that even with socks, shoes absorb a lot of moisture from our feet. He suggested going  at least day on day off with shoes to give them time to dry and regain their shape. Otherwise he said they stay in that moist, malleable state and get out of shape more quickly.  Anecdotally I‚Äôve seen a major difference in the lifespan of my shoes.

text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers. Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:I am very sensitive to temperature changes so I suffer when I wear layers. Every time I come indoors, I need to strip off everything except a t shirt but I‚Äôll be shivering my butt off the second I go out. Best solution was to get a thick and heavy parka. I have the Moose Knuckles Beaver jacket (discontinued now). It‚Äôs so warm that I can wear only a bra under it and still leave it half zipped in -25C.   I‚Äôve been wearing it for 5 years now and the only signs of wear are on the slightly yellowed fur that used to be white, and the stretchy cuff where some threads are coming loose. The only reason this even happened is because I wrap my whole hand in it while writing on paper, so there‚Äôs more friction on them than with exclusively winter use. I‚Äôve even gone skiing and snowboarding with it when the slopes were icy and had absolutely no issue. I was learning too, so I spent more time on the ground than upright. It‚Äôs been beaten up quite a bit but i can honestly say that it‚Äôs still in at least 8/10 condition. The fur is also great since it doesn‚Äôt get ruined at all. I‚Äôve been rained on too many times to count in this coat but you just gotta dry it and it‚Äôs good to go.   Compared to my aritzia coat, I‚Äôd say that it‚Äôs not even half as warm as my moose. It also doesn‚Äôt last anywhere as long and I ripped through the shell after a slip on ice. I think it lasted me 3 years, but the fur on it was ugly at the start of the second winter season so it required a lot of upkeep it keep it looking in better shape.	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: You Are What You Wear	labels:I was born and raised in California which means I am effectively a lizard person‚Äîfragile and unable to generate my own warmth. I am forced to rely entirely on cashmere to keep myself from freezing to death.  I am a very luxurious lizard.  But if you look at the brands of all my cashmere sweaters (Grana, Halogen, C by Bloomingdales) I'm wearing the materials of the wealthy, but from pedestrian brands! I AM A POOR PERSON MASQUERADING AS A RICH PERSON!  And honestly, that's pretty much the most disgusting personality flaw one can have.

text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:I think a lot of people here that say their clothing falls apart quickly aren't properly caring for their clothes. Growing up I learned to wash everything together on cold. As an adult I had to read articles and watch YouTube videos on how to care for my clothing. I recommend everyone learn how to properly launder their clothing.
text:I agree, I've never understood what people are doing in the laundry to make their clothes literally fall apart after a few washes. Washing on the hottest setting and drying high heat, maybe?  Ive legitimately never had anything fall apart in the wash ever and I dont take particular care other than cold water and low heat in the dryer (plus not chucking things like sweaters, dress shirts and leggings in the dryer at all). And I used the communal machines in my apartment!	labels:The washing machine at my apartment is very rough on clothing. It's a top loader with an agitator and the machines are 'twin thin' (very small). My clothing goes through the ringer in that machine. I don't know how, but my clothing gets knotted up into a huge wet ball. Sometimes the clothing ball is stuck to the agitator and you just have to blindly yank around until it comes loose. But after I realized the machine sucks... I didn't put anything nice/delicate in it ever again.  So yeah.. If your washing machine sucks, hate to break it to you, but you need to hand wash anything you aren't willing to sacrifice to the laundry gods.

Feed it into my veins and I hope to see the tamed down version of these things on the L train next fall.
text:There is something about Rick which is so alluring in a dystopian sort of way. Its like a Lovecraft horror story. His stuff is both elegant and decrepit. All the dangly stuff, the dragging on the ground, wacky proportions.... The extra neck holes remind me of some infectious sores. But also glamorous (look at those briefs, lmao).   I'm not going to be sporting any of these looks, but its such a strong aesthetic to consider. Good stuff!	labels:Yeah, it's like a fistula.

It's nice to get a new appreciation for an unfamiliar angle of fashion.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 19, 2021	labels:I never thought I'd become this person, but man, shipping costs really can fuck up my desire to buy something. I was just about to commit to buying another pair of sneakers and it's probably the best deal I'm going to find on them, added to cart, shipping info entered, billing info entered... $20 for the cheapest shipping option. No shipping codes available, no threshold I can cross to get free shipping. $20 period, no exceptions.  It's a $300 pair of sneakers discounted to $180, I guess should be able to rationalize that at $200 (including shipping), I'm still getting a better deal than what's available anywhere else online (only a few select retailers got this colorway, and all but one are sold out in my size), but still, $20 shipping feels *wrong*. My brain has been trained from years of online shopping that there should always be some way to get around paying for shipping, or otherwise, shipping should be cheap.
text:My unpopular opinion : most shipping is criminally underpriced and we should pay more for it. Many of the externalities don't seem to be priced in properly and everyone ends up paying for me to have my luxury purchases delivered.	labels:Actually worming in shipping has caused me to drastically reconsider how I view shipping costs online, it‚Äôs not as cheap as people would like it to actually be.

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:Fashion is to style as reading is to wisdom.  If you only read the rainbow press you're not gaining wisdom.  Likewise if all your contact with fashion is the fast fashion catalogs you're not gaining style.  Still reading comes at different levels if you give a book by let's say Boudrillard to somebody who never read you're not doing them a favor.  Same with haute coture.  People need to already have a fashion framework to understand it.  Also if you read something and just vomit it out again verbatim at the next opportunity you definitely don't demonstrate any wisdom.  Same way if you copy a model's clothes you're not getting her style.  The way reading furthers wisdom is because you would try to integrate ideas of what you have read into your existing cognitive framework, and the effort you spend on your framework improves it.  Same with fashion, you integrate inspirations from what you see on the runway into your existing stylistish framework and the effort you spend on it improves it.	episode_done:True

How woefully unprepared they are for this entirely predictable coup is baffling to me.
text:I‚Äôll be honest I just think it‚Äôs really funny that the right is probably going to tout this as some giant win lol.  Like, the capitol building is not that difficult to get into and apparently the only people present were DC metro police; which are basically just glorified mall cops. Not to mention the venn diagram of cops and trump supporters is pretty close to a circle so I doubt anyone had much of a vested interest in stopping them.

You can also get a cute long cardigan to throw over the matching set, and wear a nice pair of fluffy slippers (I like mini uggs or LLbean moccasins.   Do your hair and makeup, and wear perfume that reminds you of winter. You can also get a cute beanie that matches your set, Uniqlo has cashmere ones for $30.   Hope this helps!

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls‚Äù catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your ‚Äúfashion house designers‚Äù but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I‚Äôve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.

text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:real question - what's the difference between "capsule" and "uniform"? I have a tendency to wear the same thing, or very similar things
text:In my book a capsule is more oriented on the mix and match part - where things are cohesive and fit together. E.g. my wardrobe is the following colors and my 3 blouses can easily pair with my 5 bottoms of all types.    But the uniform is more like I always wear these shapes and these items - there is a standard structure to my outfits - black pants, neutral t-shirt, jean jacket.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:I wouldn't say I inherently hate the brand but I think Champion is an example of a brand that exploded a few years back/to now basically all because some celebrities or whoever wore it- and everyone who wears it now is most likely a ding dong hypebeast type or the VSCO type girl or whatever. Like I'm old enough to remember it being bottom tier Wal Mart level shit you'd get borderline made fun of for wearing- but now all of the sudden it's enjoying this moment. So it's just that perceived inauthenticity and collective pivot in peoples' minds to a fashion name to people rather than just athletic apparel that irks me somehow.  However though, the Todd Snyder Champion stuff is PHENOMENAL- it's not the mainline stuff. You don't see any of those assholes rocking that.

text:What is your favorite clothing/accessories subscription box?	labels:Is your main goal of using a subscription service to save time shopping or because you need help with picking the clothes?  For me it would be to save time shopping because I love picking my own clothes, but I have always felt that the inventory with the subscription services is too narrow.  Another reason I have shied away from subscription services like Stitch Fix is trust.  I don't trust that they aren't sending the inventory they are trying to get rid of before they bring new inventory in.  I like to use a platform where people save their favorites and I can shop from what they have saved!
text:It‚Äôs definitely that I need helping choosing clothing! I have always enjoyed shopping but it is usually difficult for me to find clothing that fits my body type and style. Hence, why I thought it would be great to try a subscription styling service! I do like this perspective though, I hadn‚Äôt really thought of the trust aspect before.	labels:Totally get that.  I like being inspired when shopping and really like seeing what my friends or people in my broader circle are shopping for.

text:What are your 2021 Fashion / Style Goals?	labels:I feel like I've been chasing after a curated wardrobe and style for years. No matter how many lists or moodboards I make.   This year I'm saving up a bunch of money, going into stores with my list and finally completing it. I have to go into stores because online shopping is such a gamble. So often things don't fit right or are see through. I only want to buy pieces I love.  I'll be coupling this with a ruthless declutter.

text:Your Chore Coat Isn‚Äôt Up to the Task	labels:I think the writer of this article just wants the chore coat to be something it's not. I own a couple, one treated more like a patch jacket/travel thing, another one is vintage, and I've done "Real Work^TM" in both, and liked the amount of space, a little warmth, and pockets for the jobs, while also being something i wear while camping in the fall, getting dirty in, and light enough to wear here in the south.

text:TheRealReal x Gucci	labels:It‚Äôs not generous. $1 for items priced $300-$15000? They have a huge margin.   Also, the Real Real regularly puts the market price/retail price for goods higher than they actually are so that the goods are only a few dollars cheaper than new.   I‚Äôm sure people can find deals from time to time but I‚Äôm not a fan of the site.
text:I find TheRealReal useful for a few things - my Mary Katrantzou love has been well served! - but they selling things like Outdoor Voices for literally the same as retail AND you'd have to pay their shipping costs which would exceed how much it costs to get it from OV.  Def only useful for *very* specific things.   If I use them, I try to only go for designers not super popular for replicas because they've consistently been lax about checking for authenticity and if I want better replicas I might as well go on Taobao or WeChat.	labels:Wow I did not know that about their authentication system. Do you think Stella McCartney clothing are likely to be replicas on there?
text:Less likely for Stella in particular - they are (or were till at least 2019) an official reseller of those products so they were getting a lot of their inventory directly from Stella McCartney.   My gut is that there are certain products (Hermes/Gucci logo belts, Chanel quilted bags, a Burberry scarf) that are more likely to be dupes initially and it would be better to stay away from TRR and try to find it elsewhere.   TRR is currently facing several lawsuits about how they misled investors in how their authenticators are trained, Chanel also alleges that they filed off serial numbers as a practice.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I don‚Äôt know about everyone but for me there are pieces of jewelry I own that even if not currently trendy I still use and reach for time and time again.  Hoop earrings - not large and not too small - a pair in gold and a pair in silver.   Diamond studs. Pearl studs.  Thin bangle bracelets - again silver and gold.  Thick cuffs. Depending on my outfit I like having the weight of a cuff on my wrist. It can make me feel like Wonder Woman!  I think bold rings are beautiful on my hands. I have a ring my Mom gave me. It‚Äôs an oval dome turquoise stone set in gold. It‚Äôs an unusual piece and I love it!   I have a good quality watch I only used for special occasions because it clashes with my Fitbit.  I have a very old (60+) gold crucifix with intricate open scroll work and a tiny red ruby in the center. It‚Äôs about an inch long and I‚Äôve been searching for the right chain so it lays right about my cleavage. The gold is from Greece so it‚Äôs hard to match the color of the gold. I would wear this all the time.	episode_done:True
text:Where do you find inspiration for your Outfits?	labels:Instagram and Pinterest primarily. I also like to people watch and if I see someone in a really cool outfit and I have similar pieces in my closet, I‚Äôll try to replicate their look.

If I think of any more I‚Äôll try to update.

text:Fall Jacket Recommendations	labels:What I've recently purchased: Levi's ex-boyfriend Sherpa lined denim jacket . I'm a denim jacket junkie and needed a sherpa-lined one to carry me through the fall/winter season. It rarely drops below 35 degrees where I live even in the dead of winter so I should be able to get a lot of wear out of this. Hopefully they are still "on trend."   What I'm on the hunt for: Wool plaid shirt jacket/overshirt/shacket (whatever you wanna call it). The only thing is I'm not wanting to pay over $100 for it and all the wool blend or 100% wool ones are out of my price range. I might buy a vintage pendleton wool flannel in a couple sizes too big and wear it as a jacket. Zara, & Other Stories, Aritzia, and Mango have had a few shackets I'm interested in but I'm waiting on the right one at the right price.  I also want to buy a camel wool knee-length coat for the winter. I'm taking my time to find the right one because it won't be cold enough to wear it until at least November where I live. Also, I'm pretty broke so I can't really justify spending over $200 on it, but I don't want to forfeit TOO much quality, so I'll probably buy second-hand.

I‚Äôve been able to add a few sweaters/tops into my rotation that I feel confident look good against my skin tone. It has definitely helped me dip my toes into wearing more color and feeling confident doing so! Before I had an idea of what colors actually worked, I felt uncomfortable buying/wearing color.  I didn‚Äôt really think adding an accessory in a color helped me feel more comfortable. Understanding color theory a little more wrt how it works on my own coloring felt more intentional in my opinion, then I just went for adding a few tops.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)?

But I definitely love to have those days were I dress up and look presentable, but that‚Äôs mostly just jeans and a nice top/sweater in winter or a sundress in summer. I have an addiction to formal dresses so although I won‚Äôt have a use for one for a while in COVID, having those gorgeous dresses in my closet makes my heart full. I say get what makes you feel confident and happy, whether or not you‚Äôll wear it every day or once a month.	episode_done:True

I did way too much "fill the hole in your soul with stuff" this year, for obvious reasons, but I feel overburdened with the amount of clothing in my life now and I need to make a conscious effort to pare things down. If I run into a genuine need, I'll continue checking secondhand options first before buying new. I'll also continue logging outfits daily with Stylebook, because it helps me be honest with myself about what is and isn't getting worn in my closet (both for getting-rid-of purposes AND for informing-future-purchases purposes), *and* it'll help me focus in on what I gravitate toward in my day-to-day life rather than continually shopping for some nebulously just-out-of-reach fantasy self.   Summed up:  * Buy less, buy secondhand, buy practical, buy for TODAY (not a dream and a half from now), and buy only what is genuinely needed (very likely *nothing* for quite a while).  * Continue evaluating what I really need in my life, and how much, and adjust accordingly as time goes on with the goal of seriously paring down my closet to a manageable size.

I am not saying it is or isn't, but I definetly don't want to come as this scinecy/bookwarm/fashionista type  and tbh I am not that bothered from sun, like I hate it sure, but never had a sunglass and never really complained, so technically I can buy prescription sunglasses, just want to know as to why so many people think it's nerdy/dorky exaclty	labels:Weird, I‚Äôve also found them weird most of my life. I can‚Äôt quite describe why I think they‚Äôre dorky but I will say that most people I see wearing transitions just aren‚Äôt very fashionable people. To stereotype a bit, these people mostly fall under the dorky/nerdy types and tend to be older people as well.  Of course, it could simply be that people who like transition glasses tend to be less concerned about appearances and value functionality more. If you‚Äôre confident about your overall look, I don‚Äôt think transition glasses would look bad at all.   Now if you‚Äôre a so-so or horrible dresser, transition glasses become more of an eye sore.	episode_done:True

text:Experimenting With Different Focal Lengths & Landscape || Portrait	labels:For a straight on shot, yes, a longer focal length will look more objective and usually better, as well as compress the depth of field. But, I'd say the shorter focal lengths would be more appealing if you composed the shot to take advantage of the lenses!  A wider lens will look best when you're making use of and exaggerating depth, so maybe a seated pose with the legs stretching towards camera, or shooting from below or above, getting closer to details of the subject.  I do a decent amount of photography, and I wouldn't take out a wide lens just to take the exact same shot I would've with a longer lens. Adapt your approach to your gear!
text:Thanks for responding! I agree with the last paragraph I have a 20-70 and have been shooting between 55-70 mostly for the portraits. Thanks for the ideas with getting more stylized shots with the wider lens, I'll definitely explore trying some more unique angles out.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:kind of all of them? It seems like you have to pay pretty steep prices now to get the quality of clothes that mid-price mall brands had in the 1990s and early 2000s. It seems that most stores have switched to a model of selling poor quality pieces at huge markups with the expectation that they will sell most of the stock at clearance prices. The GAP used to have quality staples, and J Crew was "fancy." Now GAP is really the same quality as Old Navy, and don't know what J Crew is anymore. The quality has certainly dropped, but I also don't get what is up with the designs since you can't even get a reasonable women's suit there these days. Madewell is not made well. Anthropologie used to sell unique pieces with really good construction, now it's roughly the same as other fast fashion, though I do appreciate that they added petite and plus sizing and carry some high end brands too. Levi's main line is terrible now, and to get the heritage quality, you need to get the Made and Crafted line, which is really expensive!  I mostly shop secondhand because I can't afford the stuff I like. When buying new, I try to wait for sales and avoid buying anything "final sale" or with complicated returns unless I know it will work. Clothes that I used to get at Anthropologie, I now get from Sezane, Ulla Johnson, Doen, and Samantha Pleet. I started buying vintage jeans over Madewell/Levi's or expensive craft brands‚Äîmy 1980s Chic and Gitano jeans were probably sold at K-Mart/Target but are better quality than anything I have gotten from Madewell. I don't wear jeans/denim enough to justify craft denim prices. Patagonia is still very high quality technical wear; I just scope out the Tyler sport outlet and secondhand for deals. Shoes are hard because I don't like to get them secondhand. I switched from Adidas to Veja and Diemme for sneakers (you can find Diemme shoes for huge markdowns on Yoox during the winter and summer sales‚ÄîI don't think they are worth retail price).
text:What sort of secondhand stores do you shop at? My local thrift and consignment shops only have the recent, poor quality of items, but marked up because of the brand.	labels:Due to COVID, I am doing most of my secondhand shopping on poshmark and depop. You can get very good deals on vintage on poshmark, and it's a lot easier to find mid and plus sizes than vintage shops. Just include "vintage" in your search terms and look at product measurements. I thought I would never be able to find vintage jeans my size, until I realized that my modern size 12 is a 16/18 in 1980s vintage. Then I was able to find lots of denim.  When I go on road trips, I like to go to thrift stores in odd little places‚Äîthey tend to be less picked over for the things I look for. You can also find good stuff at lower end vintage stores and vintage by the pound. There is a cute antique store that opened up near me with a vintage clothing room, and I got one of my favorite skirts there for about $25. It's a corduroy midi skirt from some western wear brand, probably late 1980s-early 1990s. Thredup doesn't really do vintage, but if you search brands you like regularly, you can get super good deals on nice brands. I got a basically new Ulla Johnson dress for $60. I am also in a few facebook groups for brands that I like for new resale.
text:Thanks! I never thought about Poshmark for vintage clothing before, but that's a great idea!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts on Shein?	labels:Controversial opinion, but, they aren‚Äôt that bad.   Let‚Äôs have some empathy for a moment: it is an absolute privilege to be able to shop at a sustainable store and/or to be able to buy secondhand. Imagine being someone who hasn‚Äôt bought new to them clothing in years because they can‚Äôt afford to and then fast fashion prices are waved in their faces on clothing that fits them and is their style. I‚Äôm not going to tell someone to not buy clothing from a place they can afford. I‚Äôm absolutely not doing it.   People demonize fast fashion because they look at it as black and white and don‚Äôt understand that, if you‚Äôre shopping at SHEIN, you likely can‚Äôt afford the more sustainable sources/you can‚Äôt find what you‚Äôre looking for secondhand. I‚Äôm plus sized. I can‚Äôt fit into and afford a lot of the sustainable brands out there. And, people buy out the ‚Äúfashionable‚Äù plus size items in my local thrift stores to sell on Depop, so, I don‚Äôt blame people for shopping on SHEIN.  I‚Äôve bought SHEIN secondhand and I‚Äôve had items for years and I haven‚Äôt had any issues. I haven‚Äôt bought first hand from them in a long time but when I did, I never had any long shipping times or anything, either. I found the same defects I‚Äôd find at Target, like, a long thread here or there that I can easily snip off.   This goes for fast fashion in general‚Äîif you take care of your clothes and wear the appropriate size, you can make them last. It‚Äôs not like they spontaneously rip apart, you have to do something to make them do that. Steam your clothes to get out wrinkle. Tumble dry, hand wash, etc.
text:You raise good points, but I‚Äôm going to respectfully disagree - I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever any valid excuse to buy from a company who openly profits from exploitative third world labour. We can all do better.   Sustainable fashion is expensive, yes. But *usually* buying quality clothing is cheaper in the long run than buying lots of cheap stuff (I know this is easier said than done for people living hand to mouth).   Secondly there are options that don‚Äôt exploit people. Namely second hand shops and Depop. I guarantee - no matter what the item is - someone‚Äôs already bought it or something VERY similar and wants to get rid of it. Even when I have money I buy from there because... why wouldn‚Äôt you?   The ‚Äúwhat about poor people‚Äù argument always gets made but it just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me. What about the people who are being paid 40p a day in sweltering and unsafe Bangladeshi factories? Factories that are dumping toxic dyes into water sources? We all have a responsibility not to perpetuate the monolithic success of these horrible fast fashion conglomerates.	labels:I guess if you haven't been on this situation it is hard to see.  For years I couldn't even spend 10‚Ç¨ on a t-shirt nor a jean more than once a year. Literally all my clothes were a few (or a lot) years old or given by the neighbors (so they fitted me badly or weren't to my liking but I was appreciative either way). Not only they were old, but they absolutely *looked* old.  So yes, when I discovered Aliexpress, I did some shopping there. Not a lot, but at least I could finally get some new shoes and pullovers and not look miserable anymore. I could finally buy panties and some bras (even though I never found any bra that fits). Now that I can afford it, I try to be more sustainable with my shopping decisions, but until two years ago, it was impossible.  Also, higher prices doesn't necessarily mean more sustainable. Fast fashion is everywhere and I kid you not, I bought a pullover on Aliexpress that had a Zara tag and a few weeks after receiving it, this same pullover was sold on Zara for thrice the price. Even self-proclaimed sustainable brands have done some shit in their production.  Some people can't spend more money on clothing. If you can afford it, yes, try to avoid fast fashion as much as possible, but let's understand that this is a privilege not everybody can afford.
text:You can buy second hand clothing, often with the tags still on, for even cheaper than in the shops. I use the app Vinted (I‚Äòm in Germany) and it is literally bursting with H&M, Shein, Zara, and a zillion other fast fashion brands for dirt cheap. I see people selling brand new or almost brand new clothing for as little as 2 to 3 euros. You don‚Äôt have to avoid fast fashion, just don‚Äôt buy it from the shop because that will just drive production.   In 2021 though there really isn‚Äôt an argument in favor of buying new fast fashion. We know how shitty the industry is. Second hand clothing is BEYOND accessible with the help of the internet and the apps are literally exploding with clothing that people are trying to sell. Trying to defend these fashion empires who are running our planet into the ground and exploiting millions upon millions of people in the name of poor people is really unfair. That argument held water before literally everyone had a smart phone, but not now. Besides, as has already been pointed out, those aren‚Äôt the people driving the fast fashion industry. They aren‚Äôt making literal billions in profits every year from people buying a couple of shirts or jeans once a year.  I will probably get downvoted because this sub has a severe aversion to calling out fast fashion, but whatever.	labels:	episode_done:True

If you really want to do this and are comfortable with it then by all means go ahead. But from my own experience I did this, and actually did it fairly well after many years, but at the end of the day it stood out too much in real everyday life in a normal town, regardless of how nice the outfit was, and it definitely hurt my social reputation a lot. After toning it down a bit I immediately noticed a difference in how much more positively I was treated by people. You can still dress well, but remember context is key.
text:Completely agree with you. I live in a rust belt town struggling with poverty in PA and most of what I cycled through in the pics would get me comments on why I'm dressed up so fucking much. Even though majority of that never went beyond business casual from what I saw of a quick skim through. The daily uniform out and about here are currently hoodies and pajama pants. I keep the vast majority of my style to plain and clean tees/sweaters/sweatshirts and good fitting jeans or athleisure due to this which I'm perfectly fine with.   There is still a lot of good stuff in the collection here and is good for inspiration. At the end of the day, it brings me joy seeing good outfits come together from regular peeps.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:Don't forget that the clothes you see on TV or in films are costumes, even if it's not a "costume drama". They fit well on screen because the whole look has been designed - everyone's outfits, the setting and so on. So unless it's a deliberate choice everything is going to look cohesive. By deliberate choice I mean things like a character wearing obviously different clothes to most of the rest of the cast to show they're old fashioned, or quirky and so on.  I'm certainly not saying don't look to film and TV for inspo, but either try to modify what you see to more match where you are, or accept the fact you might look more dressed up than the majority and go with it anyway.	episode_done:True
text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Hi! Former stylist.  1) Pay attention to the fit of things and figure out what cuts and shapes look good on you. Paper bag pants and some joggers have similar fits. Some mini skirts and shorts hit the same place on your legs and can have the same waist height. Find your sweet spot and don‚Äôt be afraid to buy multiple things in silhouettes that work for you.   2) Get some statement pieces that you would die for. If you are wearing a pair of jeans that fit well and a t-shit purchased within the past 3 years with some awesome earrings you going to look and feel great. If you are wearing an amazing dress and simple white sneakers you are going to look and feel great. Don‚Äôt overthink things but try and wear at LEAST one piece you are excited about at a time.   3) Don‚Äôt buy things just cause they are on sale, you saw your friend wearing it, or you feel like you ‚Äúneed‚Äù something in your wardrobe. You should love everything in your closet in its own special way unless it‚Äôs workwear and you hate your dress code for work. Something as simple as a T-shirt has so many different factors like cut, material, neckline, sleeve length. Purchase what feels good and don‚Äôt bother with the rest.

text:I'm Not a Watch Guy I Swear - Street x Sprezza	labels:I am a watch guy, but very much a relatively broke one.  Had I known how much trouble it would be to break into watches, I might have said never mind and wisely walked away. I didn‚Äôt, though.   Some pointers for those interested:  1.	The cost of the watch is only the upfront cost. Like a car, a mechanical watch needs regular maintenance. Generally speaking, this will be anywhere from $300 to $1,000+...every 5-7 years.  2.	Because of point #1, entry level (~ $500) mechanical watches are not pieces you will pass down to your kids. In fact, it is usually cheaper to trash them entirely and buy new than to bother having them serviced.  3.	People will tell you there are deals to be had in the vintage market. That‚Äôs true, but it can also be difficult to find parts or people willing to work on them. 4.	There is relatively little offered between entry level and about $3,000.  5.	There is nothing wrong with wearing a quartz or digital watch.   All that being said, I still love my small collection. Just wish I had known those things from the start.

text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I had to start over once. Basically, I graduated college in 2008, during the recession. I was poor, and being paid for shit. As I found better pay, I also immediately had 2 kids, so I was a million different sizes, with lots of bills. As a result, my wardrobe was ill-fitting cheap stuff. It was a mish-mash of styles and sizes. Most was from Goodwill and other thrifts/garage sales, Old Navy, Forever 21, etc. My casual wardrobe was basically stained sweatpants that I never left the house in. Everything was purchased solely on it's cheapness, and my work clothes didn't have to "fit", they just had to pass as office attire. It sucked, and I didn't feel great about myself.  Once my husband and I finally changed jobs enough to get to a good place financially, and my kids got old enough that a lot of the baby bills subsided, I finally had the money to fix my clothes. Before I started, I lost about 40 pounds to be back where I wanted to be. I then went to the stores and tried on A TON of stuff to find out what looked good on me and what I liked. I only bought things that served a purpose for me, and I ruthlessly purged things that didn't. I also stopped buying from "fast fashion" places, and I mindfully thrifted/bought only quality pieces from quality brands.   It honestly took a couple of years, but I think I'm finally done. I actually don't own that many clothes, because I get rid of anything that isn't being used often enough. I find that having one good, black dress that fits me serves me far better than having 10 ill-fitting, cheaper dresses. It's my only formal dress, and I have used it for pretty much all weddings and funerals. It's comfortable, it looks great on me, and I change the look with my shoes, bag, and jewelry. My wardrobe is built around workhorses like that that cover many occasions and that I want to reach for because of how good they make me feel.	episode_done:True

I wear layers of Heattech and down in winter and very rarely leave the house in a dress and only then if I‚Äôm going by car. Uniqlo has replaced Lululemon as my favourite place for basics. Since I walk and take public transit all year round and my outerwear is what most people see me in during the winter, I‚Äôve got a closet full of winter coats and winter boots.

Returns are free.  I am going to ship this goddamn thing back across the Atlantic and they are going to lose out more on shipping than they would have just giving me the discount, plus the cost of a sale.  EDIT: I should be naming and shaming, it's Brooks y'all.
text:The stat that 50% of all businesses fail within five years makes sense. It's these types of decisions that do it.	labels:They're not gonna fail, they've existed for over a hundred years and they're maybe _the_ most well known bike saddle company.  It doesn't make it less frustrating though.  If they weren't so big/old/popular, this would be a bigger business threat.
text:They're also owned by Selle Regal, who also own Fizik and Crankbrothers. All occasionally great companies who also do really stupid things regularly.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:I‚Äôm following this because I still have yet to figure out accessorizing.	episode_done:True
text:What are your go-to basic fall tops? I‚Äôm talking long sleeve tees, sweatshirts, turtlenecks etc!	labels:Aerie ‚Äúsoft and sexy‚Äù baseball t‚Äôs. They hit in all the right places, are light enough for a warm day and layer beautifully with a cardigan or a longer tank top on chillier days. I prefer 3/4 length sleeves and these are the perfect length, they come in cute colour combinations, and look good with jeans or leggings. I am a SAHM so my fashion choices are inflicted by what is easy to wash, but I don‚Äôt feel unfashionable in these, even if the store is full of teenagers.	episode_done:True
text:What clothing items have you reverted back to since WFH/quarantine?	labels:I've really been embracing dressing more youthful. I'm in my early/mid 20s, and now that I've worked a couple years at the same place, I'm wearing more what I want than boring professional. I also started caring about what I wear and planning my outfits. Velvet shoes, corduroy overalls, rainbow prints, sequins, bold colors. Who cares? I've been called out for dressing "fancy" before, but I've stopped giving a shit in correlation with my confidence in my abilities. I'm a teacher...if anything, I'm showing the students it's okay to be yourself and take risks.

text:How would you style or rebuild your wardrobe around your holy grail fashion piece?	labels:I'll just start with the holy grail item, which is high-end denim that fits both my ass, waist, and thighs. I have an athletic build - big thighs, an ass, but not an enormous waist (but not hourglass, I'm rectangular by all definitions), and finding jeans that fit or even come close to fitting is a challenge. I don't want skinny jeans and am just fine with a high waist, but when I sit I need to not feel constricted and they need some stretch to accommodate my legs and butt. I went to my favorite denim boutique for a personalized shopping experience and tried on just about everything in my size. I bought some jeans, but they're still not what I was looking for. My favorite is my husband's old ass sevens that have a huge hole in the ass (that I still wear out in public because why not), but they're not super flattering, just comfy.	episode_done:True
text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:Honestly I think you have to give way more detail on your old pair and what you‚Äôre looking for.  In my mind the biggest hurdle to perfect jeans is the fit, and since every body is different this is highly individual. Some people might prefer stretchier denim for a more forgiving fit, while others look for stiffer fabric, and have less leeway.   Personally I still struggle to find a high rise, non cropped, fits my thighs and waist, plain dark wash, straight/skinny, 90% or more cotton, pair of jeans. But hopefully I‚Äôll find it eventually!
text:My jeans criteria are similar. I wear men's APCs.	labels:Thanks for the tip! I‚Äôm a little skeptical of men‚Äôs jeans though because I have 24‚Äù thighs, 39‚Äù hips and 29‚Äù waist. I‚Äôm trying to find a tailor I like to see if I can get my newest pair altered, b cause it fits the rest of my standards.
text:Hey there! I have similar measurements and American Eagle‚Äôs new curvy fit is actually great! It‚Äôs made for people with about a 10‚Äù difference between waist and thighs (mine is 11‚Äù). Unfortunately they are only about 60‚Äù cotton, and I have to scrounge to find washes that are professional enough to wear to work, but damn. They fit GREAT.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:I have clothes divided by sections of "cold" and "warm", then within that group they're color coded (rainbow) and within each colour subgroup they're divided by lenght. I do believe some prefer it better to be sorted by lenghts over colour, but I ahve too many clothes.  The exception are (foldable) tops and jumpers, which I seasonally store away in vacuum bags, and seasonal boxes for elaborate tights. It was a forced decision because I've "ran out" of space (more like, my mother did, so she occupied my wardrobe's top shelves against my will).  I am reasonably strict, because while I'm quite an organised person, I'm also quite messy (they're not the same) and I have too many clothes. So if I facilitate in any way, my wardrobe becomes an absolute war zone. It has happened too many times.  As for dirty clothing, I usually don't wear summer tops more than once because I sweat a lot. When I do wear them more than once, I place the hangar backwards. Everything backwards and jumpeers are washed at the end of a season, then either hung back or stored away.	episode_done:True
text:Stockings vs Tights vs Leggings	labels:no contribution here but I personally hate most tights because the inseams tend to be too short for me and tall tights are often more expensive and harder to find (sheertex doesn't make them anymore....why???)
text:Wow Sheertex killed tall? Sad. I found the regular to be short and bought the talls.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Inspo Album: Pattern Mixing	labels:ugh the polka dot dress with the heart coat..LOVE	episode_done:True
text:When did skinny jeans go out of fashion?	labels:skinny jeans haven't been on trend since at least 2015-2016 imo. that's when mom jeans became all the rage.  That being said, skinny jeans are pretty much staples for most people. They go with a lot of outfits and make a lot of looks.   Just because something isn't currently on trend, does not mean it can't be stylish.
text:I never got on the mom jeans bandwagon to me they seemed both uncomfortable (no stretch) and unflattering. If a cut of jean even looked unflattering on the runway models probably not a good sign for the rest of us.	labels:Personally I find mom jeans way more comfortable than even stretchy skinny jeans. They don't need to have stretch because they aren't skintight.	episode_done:True
text:Inspo Album: Mellow Yellow	labels:This album is amazing! I‚Äôm on the hunt for a mustard yellow sweater, and there‚Äôs a pic you linked where a girl paired her mustard yellow sweater with green pants and I want to do that (or pair with black watch tartan).  Thank you for sharing and adding some color into our lives. Yellow is such a beautiful color. Mustard yellow works with my skin tone and undertone the best	episode_done:True

text:Black > navy, don't @ me	labels:I like navy but I can't get around the feeling that it's a "default" clothing color. It almost feels subversive to wear black instead	episode_done:True

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall‚Äôs?	labels:Short of getting a bit of insider info, I think the only way to really have success at those stores is to browse them at least once a week (probably twice).  My aunt tends to go every other day and finds some amazing stuff‚Ä¶because she goes *every other day*.  She says it doesn‚Äôt take her long because she‚Äôs so familiar with their stock, but it still seems exhausting to me.  (As opposed to spending three hours scrolling through Poshmark in bed every night‚Ä¶)

text:Covid Dilemna - Finding my style	labels:Yep, I frequently play "dress up" in my own clothes and take pictures to analyze. If it's an option, you could try borrowing clothes from a friend or family member to try on and do the same. Remember to try different styling tricks, too, like rolling sleeves, belting, cuffing pant legs, etc or even pinning at different lengths or fullness to get an idea of what those silhouettes look like. It's not the cheapest, but you could also rent clothes or just buy and return. I'd only do that if there's something you want to try that you don't otherwise have access to, though.	episode_done:True
