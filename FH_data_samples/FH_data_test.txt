text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers. Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:I almost completely revamped my winter wardrobe this year and tried really hard to shop sustainably and thoughtfully. I had enough jackets (am currently rocking my mom's old leather jacket, a patagonia puff, and a mountain hardware insulated ski jacket depending on the day).   The big things I did add were 8 new tops (5 good, thick sweaters, 2 waffle long sleeves, and a hooded long sleeve). Everything I get was from REI or L.L.Bean. One sweater and one waffle shirt is an REI Co-op (their in house brand), an L. L. Bean, Icebreaker,  Patagonia, and Prana sweater, the other waffle was North Face, and the hooded long sleeve was Smartwool. I love them all and have gotten rid of almost all my other tops. They are so comfortable and can be worn in many ways.  My other big addition was Kamik Sienna mid duck boots in a coffee ish color. I am in LOVE with them. They look super cute with jeans and leggings and are well put together. I have worn them almost everyday in slush, snow, rain and my feet have never been cold. I can not recommend them enough. For Christmas I got my sister in law a pair of Kamik Rouge lo snow boots and everytime I've seen her (almost every weekend) she's been wearing them.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:I think you have to have one element that “fits.”  Like of you have the oversized thing, pick one thing that fits a little slimmer (e.g a straight pant over a wide pant).   Or make sure the shoulder fits for that oversized top - vs a drop shoulder - if the whole outfit is looser.   I also think you can be intentional about revealing a little bit of well chosen skin. Wrists, ankles, calves, collarbone. So you are not just overwhelmed by fabric.   And of course you can always just wear what you want and not worry about it.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 13, 2021	labels:The king is dead. Length is but a means to be longline or cropped or cuffed or stacked. All shoulders are raglan. Chest is where I put my delicate knits for safekeeping from the prying mouths of intrepid moths.    Measurements are pathetic quantifiers of a qualitative experience. The extra inches will drape from my anatomy pleasingly, like a banner proclaiming that fit's regime has been toppled dancing in the victorious breeze. M and L and 2 and 3 are guidance enough (S and 1 being made only for the woodland sprites who derive disgusting sustenance from their plentiful options on Y!JP).   While your tailor sleepily shaves another inconsequential centimeter from your shirt sleeve, mine envelop my hands, sheltering the delicate palmskin from the sear of a tea- filled mug. While you salve your chafed thighs from those jeans that "just need to break in", my pendulum swings within its harem, emancipated from the confines of low rises.   Will you hear the call of my silhouette, and learn how to breathe? Or will you continue to ride up the crevasses behind the aging corpse of the old king?   The post-fit era is upon us.

text:Menswear I Drool Over: FW/2021 Part III	labels:Yup I don't get fashion, none of these looks do it for me. Are you looking at it from the "huh, that neat in an artistic way" or "I wish I could incorporate that style element into my facade". Cause I might like some of the fabrics used or the way the cut highlights the figure but none of this stuff is wearable for me at least.
text:Both.   Most of regulars here are hobbiest, we’re more interested in fashion than the average person, and that means pushing the envelope a little bit, I don’t love everything in this album but I think it’s all pretty wearable tbh.  You also gotta keep in mind a runway show is by definition meant to show off the skill of the designer both in design and styling, obviously runway shows and look books are going to be more out there, it’s akin to art gallery, would you wanna pay to visit the MET and find out the entire thing is full of Thomas Kinkade paintings? How people actually style the items they buy is often much less out there and easier to digest.  I also think people not involved in the fashion world have a bad habit of assuming brands or designers are “telling you” to wear things which...look I don’t know where this idea springs up from, I guess the idea that people who like fashion are all vapid and shallow and just following trends dor the sake of it.   It isn’t true, the people here are making clothing that they want to make(obviously business and being able to sell this comes into play so if anything it's being toned down), it’s not telling you you need to go out and buy any of it, if it’s ok to not enjoy this and just move on.   So, yeah, most of this(that I like) I’m approaching from the standpoint of seeing things I’d like to incorporate into my wardrobe. And what I don’t want to I can usually appreciate just as art	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:Speaking of silk...I got some wide leg silk blend trousers from uniqlo last fall and the waistband was flappy in the front. There was an elastic in the gathered back so that was fine but there was no stretch to the silk in front so I them in for some darts.   They fit perfectly now! They are (.....were?!?!) great work pants and I got a lot of use out of them last fall.   I also got a really nice red trench coat tailored to fit. It cost about as much to get the coat tailored as it cost to buy but it looks great now! It was slightly too wide before. It fit pretty good in the sleeves and it was good on my shoulders but it was too boxy and now it’s much more tailored!!	episode_done:True

text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:First and foremost, this album is AMAZING!!! I fucking love the pieces, and you definitely channeled the essence Cassie so well with every outfit.   Truthfully I think there doesn't have to be a line between cute and sensible. I just make sure that I cater "cute" to my setting- like what's "cute" at the club, isn't going to be "cute" at work and vice versa. In terms of sensibility, fuck it. As long as your outfit is appropriate for your setting, and the heels aren't hurting your feet too much,  don’t worry about sensibility.   I typically like to interpret edginess into softer looks with significant color contrast, thoughtful accessories, and statement pieces. Like for instance, a soft colored dress with dark colored, edgy shoes and a bag to match the shoes. But statement pieces and accessories are the easiest way to give a cutesy, girly soft look some edge.	episode_done:True

text:Depends on your budget.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:Go on Pinterest and pin things that catch your eye. Once you have a board try and find similarities between the pins (for example ruffles, silk, strappy backs etc) and start searching up those things at stores that are within your price range.  In terms of comfort, look for materials you like and what silhouettes you’re into. If you tend to do tighter tops with more volume at the bottom then look for dresses that match that for example. If you know you like cotton blends look for those.    Also look for stores that carry petite sections or find a tailor in your area  Don’t go crazy trying to push yourself too far out of your comfort zone. Look for things that are your style but that you’ve never worn before.
text:Similarly, I often look at tv and movies to see what I like - whether it’s a piece of clothing or a general look that character has, it’s a nice starting point to see what you like and don’t like and the aesthetic you might want to go for.  I am 5ft and I find that certain types of clothing are more likely to fit at non petite sizes, like skinny jeans (since they can scrunch up at the bottom a bit and it doesn’t look wierd)and tighter skirts. Brand I have found good petite clothing at include Express, GAP, Ann Taylor, and Loft	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How many pairs of jeans and pairs of shoes should you own?	labels:Women can have things they enjoy having without being concern trolled about how much they really need it.   I don't see men getting hassled for the amount of electronic waste their hobbies produce.   I doubt every fifth post in the Funko Pop subreddit is about curbing consumption and how they should be rethinking their involvement in a plastics based interest.   Personally, I think they're wasteful as shit, but I'm not about to roll up into their space and shame them for it.  I'm so over the handwringing, guilt, and joylessness about fashion in this sub sometimes.

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:kind of all of them? It seems like you have to pay pretty steep prices now to get the quality of clothes that mid-price mall brands had in the 1990s and early 2000s. It seems that most stores have switched to a model of selling poor quality pieces at huge markups with the expectation that they will sell most of the stock at clearance prices. The GAP used to have quality staples, and J Crew was "fancy." Now GAP is really the same quality as Old Navy, and don't know what J Crew is anymore. The quality has certainly dropped, but I also don't get what is up with the designs since you can't even get a reasonable women's suit there these days. Madewell is not made well. Anthropologie used to sell unique pieces with really good construction, now it's roughly the same as other fast fashion, though I do appreciate that they added petite and plus sizing and carry some high end brands too. Levi's main line is terrible now, and to get the heritage quality, you need to get the Made and Crafted line, which is really expensive!  I mostly shop secondhand because I can't afford the stuff I like. When buying new, I try to wait for sales and avoid buying anything "final sale" or with complicated returns unless I know it will work. Clothes that I used to get at Anthropologie, I now get from Sezane, Ulla Johnson, Doen, and Samantha Pleet. I started buying vintage jeans over Madewell/Levi's or expensive craft brands—my 1980s Chic and Gitano jeans were probably sold at K-Mart/Target but are better quality than anything I have gotten from Madewell. I don't wear jeans/denim enough to justify craft denim prices. Patagonia is still very high quality technical wear; I just scope out the Tyler sport outlet and secondhand for deals. Shoes are hard because I don't like to get them secondhand. I switched from Adidas to Veja and Diemme for sneakers (you can find Diemme shoes for huge markdowns on Yoox during the winter and summer sales—I don't think they are worth retail price).
text:That was what I was thinking. So many brands seem worse nowadays. They're charging a lot for poorly constructed items, materials that are thin, a lot of synthetics.	labels:Do you think rapid shift to online commerce is shifting priorities from design and quality, to convenience and price?

text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:Size US11 here! Wearing heels is a breeze for me, personally, even if I'm over 6 feet tall in them! .. never thought about it this way, though. Makes a lot of sense that smaller feet would have greater strain while wearing heels. And yes, it is hell finding shoes my size. I usually wear men's sneakers. I only own two pairs of heels, and I'd say they're both about 4 inches tall.	episode_done:True
text:What are some unexpected surprises you've found with certain clothing brands that are known for other things?	labels:I was surprised that Abercrombie wasn't just mall crap for teenagers anymore. It's not the heritage company it once was either, it's just a lower-end mall brand now with a lot of solid basics.
text:Another recent Abercrombie surprise is their dip into athliesure with their joggers.  The Traveler Jogger is very comparible to Lululemon ABC Joggers, and the light weight version is essentially the Surge Jogger.  Still expensive at $79, but cheaper than Lulu and goes on sale.  I've picked mine up between $35-$45.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:For trousers/ pants I'd go with 2-pleat or ghurka trousers, both are high-waisted and look similar to what are featured in your general fashion board, actually I can see there are definitely Ghurka trousers in there. Same with Herringbone wool vests. Just by learning the names of the garments you'll have an easier time finding good brands.   The flecked suit you linked with the filson looking bag looks like Our Legacy's Midnight Sheep Jacket/Trousers from 2012. Good luck finding the exact thing, if you want to try grailed, Marrkt or ebay depending on where you live. Otherwise just include search times like "flecked" or "nep".  A lot of the clothing in the general fashion board looks to me like vintage workwear. I don't know what your budget is like but if you want to put a lot of money into it then brands like Belafonte, RRL and Pherrows might be quite good.   For the avant garde "Unique" stuff you have going on, try Rick Owens, Damir Doma, Julius, Number (N)ine, ann demeulemeester, and spend enough time in that circle and you'll figure out what you like

text:I'm Not a Watch Guy I Swear - Street x Sprezza	labels:I could not agree more about 36-38mm watches. I've always worn watches, inexpensive ones but I've always put one on first thing in the morning and worn it until I'm getting in bed at night--even if I'm doing nothing beyond sitting around the house all day. My small collection was all 40mm or 42mm.  A couple of years back I decided I wanted to take a slight step up from my $125 Orient automatics. I purchased a 42mm Hamilton Khaki Field and it just didn't feel right. I loved the aesthetic of it but I couldn't pinpoint what was wrong so I reluctantly returned it a few days later.    Fast forward to this summer and I couldn't get the Khaki Field out of my head. I read more about it, mainly forum posts, and read a good conversation--I can't recall on which forum--about the 42 vs the 38. I read enough to be coaxed into trying the 38. I remember opening the box and thinking, "this is SO tiny. It looks like a toy." One poster said to expect that reaction and wear the watch for a week and you'd come around on its size. Man, was he right. With 7.5" wrists I absolutely love 38mm watches. I ditched my older Timex Chrono Weekender (40) for a classic Weekender (38). My Orient Bambinos (40) now feel too large even though I thought they were too small when I bought them several years back. Every time I wear them I look at my wrist and wish the watch was smaller. Every time I see a character in a movie or show wearing a watch I think to myself about how bad and how huge the watch looks.  As for price, I also agree that most expensive watches are too busy or simply don't appeal to me. Even if I was loaded I wouldn't buy luxury watches.  A quick thought on wearing a watch in the smartphone era, at least in my profession, I sneak a glance at my watch during meetings or at times when it's not appropriate to pull out my phone.	episode_done:True

I don’t think I’d buy one from another company unless it was at the same level of environmentally friendly as a Patagonia one. Thank you for the recommendations though!

text:How do men's outerwear differ from women's? I found a really good deal on a 100% wool coat, but in men's...	labels:I would check out Aritzia for wool coats. I think right now they're on sale for more or less 200 dollars and they're made from Italian wool.   Otherwise, I would highly suggest getting the size as close to you as possible and consider getting it tailored--especially if you intend to get a nice coat that lasts a long time. I think it's definitely worth the money tailoring nice clothes to your body!
text:A word of caution about tailoring - it’s the shoulders that will most likely need tailoring, but it is very difficult and very expensive to alter shoulders on a coat, and may not be physically possible depending on how much you need them taken in.   I tried it once with a men’s peacoat and brought it to the best, most experienced tailor in town, and even he really struggled with it. In the end, he could not take the shoulders in far enough without ruining the structure of the coat. He did the best possible job he could, it was not at all his fault, but it cost a lot and I didn’t really like the result.	labels:Oohh boy... yeah the shoulders seem really exaggerated.

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:If you have the space to store your current wardrobe, then my advice to you is simply not to pressure yourself into getting rid of clothing that you're not comfortable getting rid of.  Minimalistic wardrobes are not for everybody, and you certainly wouldn't be helping anything if you were to throw away those clothes only to end up  buying replacements later.     Take the clothes that you don't think you need and set them aside, maybe in a box or the very back of your closet, and keep only your 'minimalist wardrobe' in the easily accessible location.  If, after a year, you find that you didn't really miss anything from the old collection of clothes, you won't feel as hesitant about getting rid of them.  If you have to dig a few things out of your stash, just keep them.  If you find that you've completely ransacked your stash over the course of a year, and ended up wearing everything you didn't think you needed, then, well... maybe minimalism isn't for you.	episode_done:True

Raw denim is unforgiving, so in the slimmer cuts I have found them **MORE** likely to have crotch blowouts than other jeans.    I've never had issues with crotch blowouts in your standard levis/gap/j. crew brands.  My first 2 pairs of raw denim had crotch blowouts, because I wore slim fits, and the point of tension is in the crotch.  My 21.5 oz and 16 oz raws had holes forming within 6 months.  I've since bought a pair of Samurai's in a straight cut and they seem as if they will last forever, but they are NOT slim.

That said, you can pull off any look you want to if you do the work! I actually find the egirl style pretty cute and I don’t think there is anything about being a fat WOC where the style wouldn’t be cute on you!  As for your family, this grinds my gears so much!!!! I’m old enough to be your mother and it makes me so sad when adults crush the creative expression of their children. You don’t have to ever fit in the box they want you to. As long as it makes you happy and you aren’t hurting anyone else, it’s your life to live and they are just clothes. If you can muster the courage to do it, have an open conversation about how your family makes you feel when they trash the style you like. Tell them it hurts and makes you struggle with self confidence in a world that already does that to fat WOC every day. I think if they get that it hurts you, they’ll stop being unsupportive.

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I catalogued all my clothes in an app and track what I wear. If I want to wear something different\~\~\~ then I look at the category of "unworn" clothing and pick something to make an outfit with. It's really helped me make sure I wear as much of my clothes as possible (obviously the black cocktail dress is going to see less use than the everyday pink sweater but it helps with more unique items like my t shirt with applique parrots lol). If you don't want to catalogue your clothes and put this much effort into it (lol) you could just move your clothes to another part of your closet after you wear them or reverse the orientation of the hangers after wearing. Try to move as much of your clothes to the "worn" side of your closet as possible. And when you pick a lesser worn item don't give up and just make an outfit of it! Who cares if it doesn't match perfectly, you'll do it better next time!	episode_done:True

Depending on your line of work and your confidence a good felt hat can do wonders. I wear a Stetson Stratoliner with a cattleman crease and a flattened brim. Looks a lot like a Stetson Open Road.

text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:As someone who dresses like an absolute nut job I have learned that generally speaking as long as your outfit is overall appropriate for the situation, you can get away with murder. Like I wouldn't wear a sequined micro mini or ballgown to my office job, but I would absolutely wear a velvet suit and a bunch of brooches. I have also noticed that when I wear pieces that I love, my confidence increases throughout the day. Sometimes I have moments in the day where I look down and think "dang, this outfit is cool and I feel cool!" Those moments just give me a boost of confidence all on their own. The last thing is that people are generally too busy with their own lives to notice what you're wearing. They're doing them, so do you and have fun with it!   edit-words
text:The work point: pre covid I wore really whatever I wanted to the work place so as long as it was still within the realm of appropriate. I wear bright colors, lots of patterns and textures, complete with eccentric eye makeup. My philosophy was that no one could tell me shit if I was the best dressed person there. I was and no one gave me shit. People often told me there were always excited to see what I wore!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Inspo Album: Vintage Wool Sweaters Need Good, Loving Homes	labels:As a born and raised Norwegian, now living in the UK, my love for wool jumpers is endless and my sadness is twofold. 1) I might be Norwegian, but I've also got extremely sensitive skin. Thus my heart may be set on wool, but my skin is absolutely not, unless it's very fine cashmere or particular blends. 2) When autumn comes my immediate reaction is "WEAR ALL THE WOOL JUMPERS", and then I remember I live in the south of England and it doesn't actually get that cold here, plus it always rains.   Neither of those points are going to keep me from now spending several hours looking at vintage wool jumpers online though.

text:What's Up With G By Guess?	labels:> Any thoughts?  It looks like stuff that ends up at Ross — cheaply made with nonsensical design elements.   If you like it, great, but I don’t think it’s a loss. Check secondhand markets for the remainders that are still floating around.
text:Their quality was better in 2010-ish. Designs too. But I did notice quality fading over time, as well as designs becoming more and more simple. The main GUESS brand has had this issue too. Sucks. I grew up loving the GUESS/G By Guess brands.	labels:The brand is definitely not even closely remote to what it used to be years ago, but I’ve been to one of the stores in Los Angeles and you can definitely find some quality pieces. I think it all depends on what you are looking for. Their denim is solid: not the best out there, but also not the worst. I would would wait for their sales, but I could see myself finding something to buy.	episode_done:True
text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:I too made this decision during covid. The Cara Mia bra is my favorite. Jockey makes a good Bralette too.

It was just the right weight to be worn indoors and out, a good thing since we had archery in the yard. All done by hand.

text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:Goodwill totally depends on the area. I'm from a college town and their Goodwill has amazing stuff, probably because there isn't a consignment store in town so they get everything. I live in a big city now and the Goodwills are completely picked through and don't have many trendy items but I would still go to find jeans to turn into cut offs or something. Buffalo Exchange is a consignment store so they don't accept anything damaged or dated, but its a little more expensive. I recommend Poshmark for workout clothes because you can search by brand and size. I buy shoes at Goodwill and don't have a problem since usually you can tell if they're heavily used or not.
text:My local goodwill is sooo overpriced! You’re so lucky! We have a local consignment shop run by my friend's mother and it is awesome, but I think they’re suffering due to the pandemic (the shop is very small and jam-packed).  I really want to check out the GW bins, too! It's definitely on my post-pandemic bucket list	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:Yes, I do think our age definitely affects what looks dated to our eye.   I’m noticing that some younger men are wearing some strange iterations of 80’s color-blocked track suits that to me look very Golden Girls. Also, I’ve seen shirt and shorts sets on rappers made out of wild print fabrics exactly like the ones I made for my toddler 25 years ago.  I’m older, so I’ve seen a lot of trends come and go. We are now at the point where they are starting to repeat and are designated as “Vintage”.  I have cultivated my personal style over many years (boho/western), and have seen it done well by Ralph Lauren and most recently Christian Dior in 2018(?) and enjoy the idea of wearing the beautiful things I’ve collected until the end of my life.

text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:This guide is actually really comprehensive and goes into the finer details. I think it’s easy to be like “just look at the basic bastard and go from there” and even some of the guides on the sidebar aren’t that great or informative. Developing a style takes time, takes years and a lot of mistakes in choices. Still I think taking a moment outwardly and asking “what do I want my style to be” and using the questions really would have had me avoid some of the mistakes I made and maybe sped me up to where I am now
text:Absolutely agree. Learning the technicalities behind stuff is great and all, but you really need to hash out your own taste otherwise that stuff is useless. I think having a style journal where you reflect and elaborate more is great. What kind of style, shape, fabrics, colors, patterns, etc are all questions you need to answer to develop better style. Having a journal or way to reflect on prompts gives you not only a think tank for you aesthetic but it also can inform how you purchase and style things. Lots of beginners just have no idea how to start developing, I certainly didn’t.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:To add onto some already really good advice, what you like may not be what you look really good in. This part took me the longest time to figure out. Key here is to keep an open mind. Your likes will probably change every 2-4 years, so when you buy new clothes, take note of whether it compliments with your features,is easy to mix and match with other things in your wardrobe and how wearable it is for your lifestyle. Once you start understanding a bit more about what works for you, even if your style changes over time, you'll know what to avoid or what to look for.	episode_done:True

text:Tailoring for the People	labels:Favorite ways to incorporate tailored clothing casually (easiest to hardest, IMO):  All of the tailored items should be on the casual side (OCBDs, patterned shirts, non-worsted jacket/trousers, textured and/or patterned fabrics, etc)   1. Swap in button up shirts for tees and/or layer under sweaters/sweatshirts, non tailored jacket, overshirt, etc.  2. Swap in trousers for chinos or denim. Knit, sweatshirt, tee, polo, hoody, etc for the top. 3. Button up shirt and trouser. Layer with knit, sweatshirt, non tailored jacket, overshirt, even a hoody. 4. Jacket with denim. Non button up shirt top (knit, sweatshirt, polo, clean solid tee) 5. 4 but with a button up shirt 6. Jacket and odd trouser (odd meaning it's not a suit). Non button up shirt top. 7. Jacket, button up shirt, odd trouser. 8. Suit and non button up shirt top. Could be tied with 7 if the suit is casual enough.	episode_done:True

text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:So, look, I don't want to tell you _not_ to do this, but if I've understood correctly you're looking at creating a bloodborne-inspired victorian/traditional wardrobe. There are elements of that style that have mainstream appeal today, high-waisted wool trousers being one example. However, when you take them in context with the more "interesting" elements you picked out it gives off serious cosplay vibes. Perhaps you should take the fact that the only places offering this sort of clothing are Etsy/cosplay stores as a hint that you should reconsider this idea.  You might be thinking, _what about the cyber goth vampire Rick Owens fits I see on this sub?_ It's a valid question. The key difference is that the style you're going for here has _such_ a strong association with cosplay and videogames and so little mainstream appeal that the number one association people are going to make is that you are cosplaying. Doubly-so if you're wearing cosplay-quality clothes from cosplay vendors. While the Rick Owens aesthetic may not have mainstream appeal it _is_ very accepted within fashion circles and _doesn't_ have that strong cosplay association.  So with that said my advice is to take what you've got and tone it down. Treat it like a high-fashion runway show and take inspiration from it instead of trying to recreate it 1:1. High-waisted trousers, great. Gaiters? Maybe just get some actual boots. Bloodborne-style woolen collars/scarves/hooded shawls? Wear a regular scarf that has an interesting shape or texture, or a shirt with a more exaggerated collar. Maybe the fact that you can't find retailers selling this kind of stuff is the limitation you need to make it work in the real world.  Or maybe I'm just talking complete shite and someone smarter than me can help you more. I hope that I've at least broken the ice and said what needed to be said so that people can try to constructively help you.
text:I appreciate your comment and understand what you're saying. Like I said in the post, I have tried many aesthetics and styles through out the years and I really do think I know what I'm talking about when it comes to dressing well. I have no need to prove anything to you but in my own social circles I've always been the stylish one and most of my friends come to me for advice or do the exact thing that I'm doing here, which is ask me where to go to find certain items.  I just don't really understand the fascination with people wanting to tell me that what I'm looking for is wrong, and forgive me if I'm misinterpreting this, and then I should stop and look for something more mainstream and appropriate? I mean to me, isn't that part of fashion? To step out of your boundaries and try new things?   If all your comment is is a warning that I may look like a cosplayer,  then I appreciate it. But funny enough, I am also a cosplayer and I think there is a fine line between items that will look like everyday clothes vs costume pieces and I'm doing my best to find those.  And either way, you won't know until you try it :)	labels:> If all your comment is is a warning that I may look like a cosplayer,  then I appreciate it.  That's all it is. There are plenty of people who try e.g. the Rick Owens aesthetic and fail to pull that off because they don't have a feel for what works and what doesn't. Confidence is also a huge deciding factor in whether you're pulling it off or not. I'm not saying it isn't possible, just that you really have to know what you're doing in order to be successful with it.  Like the other guy who replied to me said, if you have to ask you probably shouldn't.  > I just don't really understand the fascination with people wanting to tell me that what I'm looking for is wrong  We get _a lot_ of people coming through here and asking our opinions on wearing cosplay gear. Some items are asked about so frequently that they've become huge in-jokes in the community (BR2049 coat, Drive scorpion jacket, Bloodborne trench coats) so the first assumption people are going to make, particularly here, is that you're another one of those people. When someone comes here asking if they can pull off a Bloodborne-style coat the answer is almost always no. Not in the contexts in which you want to wear it, not in the outfits you intend to pair it with, not if the quality is terrible, not if you don't have the confidence to not care what the majority of people will think.  There's nothing wrong with doing this if you know what you're doing. If you're sure that what I'm saying doesn't apply to you then I really hope you find what you're looking for.   I genuinely look forward to any posts you make in WAYWT because I'd love to see someone successfully pull this off! If you have any inspiration images for complete outfits perhaps you could put an album together and post it here.
text:I would love to post pics once I find some stuff! I think maybe that's where it's getting muddled up: I don't think I asked if I could pull it off, I was just asking where to get them.	labels:You didn't ask, but people often skip considering whether they _should_ before they go full steam ahead and start spending money. Since this is an advice sub and the people asking questions are generally new to this and unsure of what they're doing, people here tend to err on the side of caution especially when it comes to more niche styles like this.	episode_done:True

text:What is your favorite clothing purchase of the year, and why?	labels:If I'm honest, with this year being what it was, the purchase I'm most excited about is four pairs of slim-fitting fleece joggers from Gap. A close second would be two pairs of decent-looking New Balance 574s.  I've been working from home since March and really only go out to get groceries, get a haircut, and occasionally go for a walk on a nearby biking trail. My uniform for the last few months has been joggers and a polo shirt, sometimes an Oxford. It's just enough that I still feel professional at work (I do video calls with clients), but it's the most comfortable I've ever been at work.  When I have to leave, throw those New Balance sneakers on. Cold? Grad a denim jacket. Had I worn this outfit somewhere nice a year or two ago, yeah, I can see that being a cause for ridicule. But now, I'm frequently the best dressed person I run across when I go outside. At work, some people dress a bit better, but it's still comparable.  I look forward to seeing what happens to fashion when we get this pandemic taken care of. Some people have been putting effort together to make things like joggers and sneakers work and look great, I wonder if fashion in general will adopt more of the comfortable trends.	episode_done:True

text:Can I see your casual natural-fabric outfits?	labels:I have been only buying natural materials this year as well. I'm not sure if denim gives you a sensory issue but I have found that a lot of men's and boys jeans are still all cotton. Depending your sizing and preferred fit, you could look for those. Otherwise I like linen pants a lot (pantsfessional on IG has some great looks). My other suggestion is to look in thrift stores, a lot of women's clothing used to be all natural materials so I have had more luck there with donated items.
text:It's not hard to find cotton jeans for women, either, I've got 100% cotton jeans from H&M, Old Navy, Levi's, Asos, Mango.  There's a pretty big difference between men's and women's cuts, not a lot of women have the shape to wear men's pants.	labels:Not all cotton jeans are created equal though. I was excited to find a pair at H&M a few years ago. They fit me perfectly at the store. Unfortunately after wearing for a few hours, they bag out like crazy. I swear they went up at least a size if not two. They’d shrink back down after washing, but it didn’t do me much good to have jeans that were only wearable once after washing and would look baggy by the end of the day.   Meanwhile I’ve got some Levi’s and LL Bean jeans (both vintage/thrifted) that hold their shape perfectly. Not sure I’ve ever washed either pair.	episode_done:True
text:Fashion Favorites	labels:Definitely wool coats—the longer the better, preferably with nice sharp shoulders and a big collar that stays up if you pop it. Blazers, too: anything with strong shoulders, a nipped waist and a slightly longer length.   Silk scarves and vintage clip on earrings—I have a bit of an obsession with both. The combination can dress up a lazy outfit in seconds, in a way that's appropriate for any occasion.  Flowy midi skirts and dresses, especially pleated or wrap-around designs. Much more comfortable than jeans, and eye-catching, too.  Blouses: button-front silk shirts, cotton Liberty prints, and anything white/cream with lace or ruffles.  And because we're still in a pandemic...silk satin face masks. I've actually enjoyed matching them to my outfits!

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.
text:Band tee, jeans/shorts (sometimes "fancy shorts"), flip flops/sneakers/boots. A lot of my clothes come from the thrift store. When it comes to shoes and coats, I prefer classic and quality over quantity. A great wool peacoat and converse for example. Quality leather boots and bags that last for years. I have a few dresses that I wear on occasion. The irony is that I used to get in trouble all the time over uniform violations growing up. Like OP, I love fashion and the fashion other people wear, but it's just too much of a whole "thing" to try to express myself through fashion, especially because shopping for "new" clothes is part of that. Music is a huge part of my identity, so whatever t-shirt I choose to wear that day says something about me.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:The White Issue: Has Anna Wintour’s Diversity Push Come Too Late?	labels:I wonder why the diversity question only comes up when it’s majority white, nobody seems to have a problem with company’s or people who go out of their way to promote everything that isn’t white. Since when was simply being white or Eurocentric offensive?

text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:Yes!    TBH I’m still doing a full face of makeup most days and wearing my favorite summer dresses around the house a few times a week.  I’m so bummed though that no one has “seen” me in my clothes other than may husband and kid and they could not really care less.	episode_done:True
text:What are your coziest winter finds/essentials?	labels:This year I've finally come to the realization that I can layer all the sweaters I want, I'm still going to feel cold if my legs are cold. So I got merino wool tights from Icebreaker (the 260 weight) to layer when I'm outdoors, as well as a couple of pairs of cheap "fur-lined" leggings for lounging at home (purchased from whatever Instagram brand advertised them to me first, I'm ashamed to admit). The wool tights are great of course, as expected, but the cheap leggings are a pleasant surprise! They fit decently although they're not as high-waisted as I would personally like, and they are definitely warm.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 22	labels:I have a newly bought G-star hoodie and it fits me almost perfectly and this is rare because i’m weigh 188 and i’m 6’4 but there is one flaw that has to do with the sleeves. Are there any methods to permanently stretch the sleeves of a hoodie maybe an inch or two?	episode_done:True
text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:I have a few what I would consider to be housedresses in this definition. They are simple in shape - two pieces of fabric, sleeveless, usually no dart, no waist, hemmed - lengths ranging from above the knee to down to the ankle. I've certainly worn them to work and otherwise in public, so they're not just "house" dresses. They're comfortable in the summer in non-A/C environments, like my home office, or the previous place I worked (also no A/C). You can throw on a little sweater for A/C environments, or where sleeveless is not 100% appropriate.  I'm wearing one right now.   I have never bought one new - they're always purchased at thrift stores. Since the sizing is pretty free with these, I may not even bother to try them on. Used, I'd say that they range in price from ten dollars on down.	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: Thoughts and Prayers	labels:I really think we need to bring back the worship of cats. We should also all dress up as cats and try to act like cats as much as possible throughout our daily lives. We should adopt all the cats and let them be our leaders. I guarantee you that if you had a bunch of cats with yes/no buttons randomly pick our foreign and national policy, we would end up in a better position than where we are now.

text:Jewelry trends for 2021	labels:I feel like delicate, minimalist jewelry in general is here to stay for a while longer among the general populous (I personally think minimalist gold jewelry is timeless). It's easy to maintain and it goes with any outfit; can be a day and night piece.  Might just be me, but I feel that high fashion is always trying to promote the big, bold, statement jewelry, which is fine! The way you describe your style mixed with the beautiful pieces you like, it sounds like it fits you to a T. Just not sure if it is trending that direction though. But I think that you should shrug off today's "standards" and wear what makes you feel happy and confident!
text:I think minimalist or non-statement jewelry is timeless to an extent like a simple colour t-shirt is timeless. The super, super, tiny and delicate pieces (a ring that's so thin it's almost invisible) will probably trend towards slightly thicker but still delicate pieces.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I personally swing wildly between an academic honors student, vaguely retro, more gender-neutral street style, and then something a little more punk. I just wear whatever I’m feeling like wearing on a given day (or what weather dictates, occasionally), so I don’t consider it strange to have more than one style. I admire the people that can just do one style and be happy, or have a capsule wardrobe, but there’s nothing wrong with enjoying mixing it up.	episode_done:True

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.
text:I feel this in my soul.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I don't have a capsule wardrobe, but have curated my closet with the... Spirit of the capsule wardrobe in mind? Starting with going through each item and doing a major cull, then really assessing what I have and what I "need" to make things work more to my liking. does everything go together all of the time? No, have I honed in so I have more options around my favorite pieces, yes absolutely!!   Also wardrobe tracking will help A LOT so you know what you ACTUALLY wear vs... your pinterest "look"
text:Would you mind expanding a bit on the wardrobe tracking idea? Sounds really interesting!	labels:I personally started using an app (closet for android) where you put in every item of clothing you own, and log each day what you wear, so you KNOW how many wears your getting out of each item. Logging every item was weirdly fun, and really made me asses why I kept what I kept. But the app was a bit clumsy, so I made a secret instagram account to just take an Ootd (outfit of the day) picture as I headed out the door (or when covid hit, on my way to the couch, ha ha)   If you have apple I have heard great things about their apps, some people on here use airtable (if you search the group there are loads of better informed wardrobe tracking, and mgetsdressed blog has many many posts about it)   I personally found looking at what I'm ACTUALLY wearing, not what I aspire to wear, helps me be realistic about what to add to my wardrobe, and being more aware of everything I own now I've done several purges makes me pull out lesser worn items to I have an excuse to keep them	episode_done:True
text:Fellow clothing trackers, what coveted items are you tracking now?	labels:Acne Linden boots in 38. There’s one listing on Poshmark but no photos of the actual boots, stock photos only. It’s been 7 years... they are my white whale.
text:I sell on poshmark nearly full time, if there is fraud they will absolutely refund your money in full and ban the seller if you choose to report them.   You can also comment on the listing and request that the seller add photos of the actual item. Many of my photos are stock because they just look more professional, but If a buyer requests an original photo I always provide it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I've been trying for this exact motif very much \[eta: aside from birds--which are easier to collect\], but aside from a pair of tiger-y pajamas I haven't found a lot of stuff! There was the J.

To start off, even though I’m not a fashion or costume expert or anything the clothing looks just so bland. Like it says almost nothing about their characters and just bland overall. Not unique.   They also took beloved characters and removed/replaced them. And there’s also the issue of whitewashing some of the characters in what was originally a pretty diverse show and it just looks like a mess.	episode_done:True

text:[WWD] Pal Zileri scaling down major manufacturing plant. Hope this isn't a trend for Italian RTW Tailoring mainstays, especially one as craft-driven as this.	labels:Pal Zileri is one of the big mass manufacturing heavyweights of high quality Italian RTW amongst Canali, Corneliani and Caruso.   They have historically done a lot of contract work for more fashion forward houses like Trussardi.      While " the death of the suit" may rightfully be cheered on, Zileri and some of these other brands offer  tailoring that very much defies the norm of stiff fused navy blue uniforms, instead offering  beautiful patterns, textures, fabrics and detailing along with very craft oriented construction.   I hope these brands and the craftsmen behind them will endure.	episode_done:True
text:Store closings at malls	labels:There’s been closings of things due to the pandemic but like Sears & JCPenney’s. Also on the food side there’s been restaurant closures.  As far as returns go, the place might be lenient with you on the return window and accept a return, worth a shot if you do find yourself going back to those malls.
text:I'd expect closings from Sears and JC Penny's...  I'm wondering how bad the carnage will be when this is over. I have not gone in person, just googled and found out they are closed.  Early in the pandemic, they were lenient. I wanted to return an item and at the time, the store was still in the mall but they were not open so I couldn't return. I returned by mail and they refunded me the shipping costs.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you care for your expensive/fragile pieces?	labels:Honestly not using the dryer is the best piece of advice (of course being allergic to fabric softener made my decision for me).  I have Forever 21 pieces in my closet that are at least a decade old.  They survived.
text:I do this too for my nicer pieces but there are some made of certain fabric that gets so stiff and no longer soft if you air dry it. Does anyone know how to make these types of fabrics that stiffen up without a dryer soft when they dry? I do admit, I don't use fabric softener when I wash so maybe that can be some help.	labels:I use a shared facility so the dryers are already covered in fabric softener residue (enough to make my skin break out into hives).    Stiffness is not an issue for me.  I'm used to it.	episode_done:True
text:Best of Techwearclothing 2020	labels:I dig techwear. I think it is probably the style most likely to bring lasting change to what we consider normal.  I bought an Acronym 3rd Arm bag back in like 2010. Still think it’s awesome. Just the perfect mix of tech and milspec.  You don’t have to go all in if you don’t want. But it’s the people pushing the boundaries that get it to the point where it becomes more accessible.	episode_done:True
text:Do you think fashion or style has age restrictions?	labels:I'm 35 and wear crop tops and high waisted jeans. Why do so many people on this sub care so much about what others think about them? Wear trendy items, don't wear them, just stop trying to make some women "other" than you due to some fashion superiority complex. Lord.
text:I needed this. I’m usually so confident in my outfits but there’s just something about turning 30 plus comments here and there from my older family members that make me second guess myself and make me wonder if I need to find a new style even though I love my clothes and style.	labels:For me I found after my 30th birthday the fucks I had available to give exponentially decreased. Wear what you like.
text:Me too! I'm 30. I honestly think they extracted my fuck giving bladder when they yanked my son out. Then at 3 months after birth, my hair fell out literally in clumps. I can't say I felt too bad about it, because I was kinda busy with a nursing 24/7 baby.  However, now that it's starting to grow back, I fit into my clothes better, and my son turned one and rejected them boobies all of a sudden in one day, haha!.. I feel inspired!   Fashion wise, somewhere in life when I focused my very least on fashion, is where I found my true joy for clothing. Not shopping, just.. Matching and organizing my closet and appreciating all that fancy stuff I hadn't used in years. I just feel more confident and better looking than ever before!  And yes, I have a pair of skinny high waisted jeans 🙄 They're not out of style, guys. At least not in Scandinavia.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Winston & Co. Shawl Collar Cardigan Review (But mostly preamble)	labels:Nice review :)  How do you deal with scratchy wool? Do you seek another cardigan or try other methods to mitigate the problem?
text:> How do you deal with scratchy wool  The thing is...if you're wearing this over any kind of long-sleeve shirt, the amount of actual contact with your skin should be fairly minimal. It may be that I have a higher tolerance but I've never run into a problem with wool sweaters being too scratchy so long as it's an outer layer.	labels:Yep.

I wear what I'd normally wear on the weekend during work hours.  I do miss dressing up for nice dinners.  I'd say the only thing changing for me is I'm spending a little more on casual clothes to get slightly nicer things. I love White House Black Market for that kind of thing.  I'll still splurge on a designer handbag once my current designer bag bites the dust.	episode_done:True

I’ve been using some of this for a while, and have been looking for ways to go from smart casual to a more business casual, and found a new person who tends to dress in a way which fits with my established comfort zone but with more of a leaning towards where I need to go (workplace with strict dress codes for professional and hygiene reasons). I know virtually nothing about this figure as a person or platform and don’t want to name them as I don’t know how I’d feel about them if I did. But their style? Perfect for my needs, and something I likely wouldn’t have come across otherwise.	episode_done:True

text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:It’s different for me now that I’m in my 30s and working full time. I’d guess around 10% of my salary (after taxes) averaged out... like some months I spend a lot more, others I don’t buy anything.   Back when I was in college, I did a lot of thrifting and shopping clearance racks! I still like second hand shopping and getting a good deal,  but now saving up for high quality items feels a lot more feasible.  Back in college when I really could only expect tiny amounts of money left over from my income after I paid my bills, it was much more fun to buy a pair of crazy leggings for $5 off the target clearance rack then to try to save up for something nice.  I also feel like I thought of shopping as a fun activity! It was much cheaper to go to the thrift store with my BFFs and get a fun/weird new outfit than to go for dinner and a movie.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 13, 2020	labels:Heyo,   I'm looking for some chino pants and am mostly concerned about the material.   Around a year ago, I bought some RSQ chinos and they were great, I liked the material, the fit (slim straight) was just right, and the cost was worth it ($45 a pair, BOGO 50% off)!   I decided to buy some recently and despite the website (Tilly's) saying they were the same fit/style, they felt off. The material isn't what it used to be I guess despite having the same ratio (97% cotton/3% cotton), it feels thinner. The pants also feel more loose on me, I made sure to order the same fit but I guess that changed too.   I'm interested in any recommendations where the pant material definitely felt nice and worth the asking price.   As for my price range, I wouldn't feel right spending more than $50 per pair as I'm just a college student.	episode_done:True

text:Yeah. I low key hate this. Not for the gender non-conformity, but for perpetuating the notion that uncomfortable and restrictive clothing and high heeled shoes are aesthetically desirable for anyone.	labels:They're aesthetically desirable for the people who like them. There's an unfair pressure on women to wear them, but that's not the case here. This man is under no obligations to wear them; he does so for no other reason than he likes them. I also wear restrictive clothing and high heeled shoes. They're aesthetically desirable for me because I like how they look. But my wearing them doesn't obligate anyone else to, and I'd argue that a man wearing them doesn't contribute to the pressure on women to wear them (and that's the only pressure because there isn't one on men). There's no victim in this case, at least not the way you're framing it.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:As someone who makes a decent amount of money casually flipping niche designers, it's become a bit of an arms race of bots/scrapers/market data warehousing for finding true steals.   Focusing on one or two designers (monobrand4lyfe) and learning the market well enough to flip items and pay for your retail purchase of what you _actually_ want is almost more reliable than hoping you find what fourteen seasons past item in your size in good condition.	episode_done:True

text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I work in an office and am supposed to dress business casual.   My entire closet is work clothes and while some of it is cute it’s mostly boring and safe.   I feel like my personal style is edgy and fun. I’m working on curating a weekend wardrobe and not focusing on work outfits until I have just as much weekend  and after work clothes. I’m thinking fun  Art teacher and also colorful mom clothes but we will see I also like basics a lot like jeans and a black top .
text:I love the idea of a weekend wardrobe! I work in an office where everybody is super casual (jeans and T-shirts) that whenever I dress up (wear a cute dress or even mini skirt + stockings in the winter), I get asked if I have plans after work or I end up feeling overdressed. So even if I do feel good when I leave the house, I feel super conscious by the time I get to the office. A weekend wardrobe sounds like a good plan!	labels:The best reply to those comments is "this is what I wear now" and then ignore them. They will stop asking if you're consistent for a couple weeks.   I'm in a super male dominated environment for both my jobs and my style is very Ms. Frizzle-esque.   One of my jobs is uniformed, other isn't. The former, I go absolutely nuts and colourful on my makeup (legit will wear glitter and draw designs with eyeliner if I'm feeling in the mood for it) and the latter meant I was more dressed up than about 98% of the staff (there was one cashier who was like me, she DGAF what people thought and would wear jewel tone velvet shirts and leather pants and studded boots when everyone else was in jeans and t shirts. She looked awesome. )     After about a week, people stopped asking questions.	episode_done:True
text:Can we talk sleepwear?	labels:Honestly, I would say go for the gauzy nightgown and the silky bathrobe. If you feel good in it why not? If you can sew, gauzy nightgowns tend to be rectangles with drawstrings (or more modern would be elastic) and then kimono style silky bathrobe which also would be rectangles in construction and you could make an eye mask matching the silky bathrobe... I think I have a project to add to my list...	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else have “irony pieces”?	labels:Unfortunately, my entire wardrobe as a construction worker.  I'm a construction superintendent, so I wear the same thing every day. Boils down to a thermal layer, hiking pants, a quarter zip fleece, a heated jacket, work boots, a vest, and a hard hat  After a couple years, I'm so used to wearing actually practical clothes that I'm annoyed to wear heels or deal with shitty pockets or worry about a skirt flying up.  I'm officially that queer woman who goes to the bar with her keys clipped onto her belt loop with a carabiner so I don't have to carry a purse

text:Work From Home Outfits I Should Wear More Often	labels:Loved the video, great advice, still hate virtual happy hours.  I'm literally feet away from relaxing on my couch, hanging out with my family, or enjoying one of my hobbies.  At 5:00, on the dot, my interest in your interests is non-existent.	episode_done:True
text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:When I was at my heaviest weight I was actually *proud* that I didn’t wear proper jeans for 5 years, instead I wore jeggings and leggings under short skirts/dresses.   Ever since I started losing weight I got accustomed to wearing jeans again and now I’m at the point where I wear them around the house all the time because I feel more put together and in leggings/loungewear I always feel kinda naked and uncomfortable.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:You're kinda making a mountain out of a molehill here. It's not hard to wear colors. Relax about it. It's not a disaster if things clash slightly. You'll be fine. There are no fashion police.   My usual style is I get either brightly colored top or a bright bottom (or a bright dress). The other is relatively neutral to avoid clashing or being overwhelming. This is not a hard and fast rule. There are times when it's fine to break it. It's just a guideline for when I'm in a hurry.  Match saturation and brightness. Burgundy and plum are fine together because both are relatively saturated and dark. Pale pink and lavender work together. Burgundy and lavender are harder because they don't match in saturation and brightness. They aren't impossible to put together and look good but it's a bit harder.  You will not look good in some colors. This is 100% fine. Try things on. Figure out what makes you look awful. You can do this. It doesn't need any special knowledge.
text:In total agreement with this. I kept trying to find my season/palette/whatever using a bunch of systems and always got frustrated. But then I found friskygatos on IG and she was just like... "Hold up colors next to each other and if you like them together, wear it." And her lizard brain concept was super freeing.  Today I wore an all pale pink outfit and got tons of compliments and felt fabulous. I don't even know/care if it was my most flattering color, but just the fact that I looked different than the sea of neutral outfits out there made me happy!	labels:> "Hold up colors next to each other and if you like them together, wear it."  That is literally how I choose outfits and I've been told I look well-put together.	episode_done:True
text:Do you guys default to a set of a few pieces even though you own a ton?	labels:Yup.  I've talked about this in multiple replies to these posts before (not that I'm able to find them right now because argh Reddit search noooo), but the gist is I have a bunch of items I routinely wear and a bunch of items I don't.  Now the clincher for me is that stuff I don't regularly wear, I sell.  I'm hitting that point where I'm going to sell off a bunch of stuff because I haven't put it on in 9 months and I don't want to sit on unworn things.  As far as "nicer" vs "less nice" goes - I've never let that stop me.  If I'm buying something, I better damn well wear it, whether it's $10 or $100 or $1000.
text:For me besides the stuff I mentioned above I think it also comes down to lazyness and not thinking about it. Almost like a uniform.  &#x200B;  I need to get my clothes ready the night before like so many recommend. Haven't ever done that.  &#x200B;  I'm also rebuilding my wardrobe and need to tailor a few things still.  &#x200B;  But the only stuff that does scare me to wear is white/lighter clothes. Those I can see actually ruining which I've done before :/	labels:It is easy to just wear things you already know will be a good outfit. That’s the other thing I always think of.	episode_done:True
text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom didn’t care about fashion until she started watching What Not to Wear on tlc. Then she threw out all her embroidered sweatshirts and appliqué jeans and got some more stylish clothes. She maintained this for a few years and now that she’s in her late 60s, she wears what makes her happy- embroidered sweatshirts and appliqué jeans.   I don’t wish she taught me anything but I think if she kept a pulse on trends it would’ve saved me from some teasing in middle school. But, on the flip side, is it fun to fit in? Middle school sucks regardless.

I was just daydreaming of where to find more options on another tab actually.. I'm really short though so I've been shopping in the little boys section.

text:Sorry you feel that way. When I wrote it, I tried to convey that I didn't put much thought into what I wore. Perhaps I could have said pajama bottoms with RRL cardigans. I don't have a perfect description for it, but I do think that the style Andrew is wearing there is a lot more coherent. I think there are ways to do that style thoughtfully, and not randomly. I didn't write this with the intention of making people feel unhappy with their current wardrobe.

text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:> should I try to incorporate things one at a time or just muddle though the vaguely uncomfortable period of time until I feel comfortable?  Yes. Fake it till you make it. Wear one nice, "dressy" thing at a time until you feel comfortable enough to dress up in an entire outfit. Wear it around the house until you feel comfortable enough to wear it outside. I used to be a tomboy who lived in baggy t-shirts and jeans, and I remembered being so self-conscious the first time I wore a skirt and flats, but I just kept wearing them, and soon the feeling wore off - I got used to being dressed up, and people got used to seeing me dressed up, so nobody commented on it anymore.  &#x200B;  > what to say when people make the, "why are you all dressed up" comment  because, "I just felt like it" never seems to be good enough.   Why? That's a perfectly legit reason to me. You deserve to feel good about yourself.	episode_done:True

text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:I try to think about my outfit as a balance beam. There has to be equal parts light and dark (unless it’s a special or formal event). If I wear a monotone outfit, I go with a contrasting or neutral color to support. if I’m wearing black slacks, I try to wear a top with pops of color in it. Then, I chose my shoes based on the color and complexity of the top. For casual wear I apply the same rule, but also take into consideration the style of bottom I’m wearing (I.e skinny jeans, yoga pants, boot cut, etc) and where I’m heading in the outfit. For example, a pair of yogas and a t could go with vans slip ons OR a pair of trainers. If I’m heading to grab lunch, I’ll wear vans. If I’m heading to the store, I’m more likely to put on the trainers.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:Since I’m in college, pre-pandemic I would go to swaps put on by the sierra club or the fashion magazine.

I think it would have been more difficult for people outside of straight sizes though.	episode_done:True

text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I used to follow the outfit challenges and posts on the blog Putting Me Together and I really like her approach - instead of specific items, it’s more like categories of items. Long drapey necklace. Statement necklace. Short necklace. Neutral dangly earrings. Statement earrings. Stuff like that! That way you can find what suits you within the category so it can be classic and something you will actually wear!
text:That’s exactly where I’ve gotten my inspiration from. Too many lists are dated on materials and wear but finding things like length and level of boldness are actually smart. I can’t tell you how “timeless” every yellow gold piece I got in childhood was out of style all through my twenties because white gold came in. Minimal jewelry was nearly out unless it was a signature piece. My dangly earrings over the years have changed but I always have at least one, same with my long necklace and my version of statement pieces.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:Underwear/socks/masks: 1 wear  Tee shirts/tanks/cotton tops/flannels: 1-3 wears, depending on sweat level  Blouses (silks, fragile rayons, etc): As infrequently as possible--basically if I spill or they smell  Sweaters: Similar to blouses, but I tend to do all of these in one big go (delicate cycle in garment bags with a gentle wool/cashmere detergent then lay flat to dry), so some get tossed in earlier   Dresses: pretty much never unless I spill   Jeans: once a month ish, or when I spill on them. Washing helps get them back to shape if they start to bag out too much, and eventually they will start to smell  Workout clothes: 1 wear  PJs: 3 ish wears   Jackets: rarely--fleeces, sweatshirts, really anything soft will be more often, but if it's anything heavier than that I just spot treat stains	episode_done:True

text:Why I’ve tracked every single piece of clothing I’ve worn for three years	labels:Who in the fuck needs 55 undershirts at one time?! I feel like I'm bordering on excessive at only 10.
text:I stopped taking him seriously after I saw how many undershirts he had and how he threw some out after less than 20 wears and throws out shoes after 50 wears	labels:Author here. I understand that. As to the 20 wears for underwear T-shirts, I might note that I always (have to) wear an underwear shirt to protect whatever I wear on top of it. Most of the time, it is a button down shirt at work. I wash the underwear t-shirt after each use. It may be due to my exceptionally high metabolism, but they really start being rather shabby after 25-30 uses, some after only 20 (especially if worn on hot summer days).   It actually really bothers me that I cannot make them last longer in my work context. When i divest they, I do continue use though as sportswear or garden work or whatever where it doesn't matter that they are a bit shabby.  As of shoes, that one pair that lasted only 50 days were really falling apart.
text:The undershirts I can kinda explain, I think you probably need to buy better undershirts and question what you define as shabby, but still.   The shoes I’m struggling with, what on earth would you be doing to your shoes that they’d need to be replaced after 50 wears? Or what shoes are your even buying ? A lot of shoes are just finally being broken in properly at 50.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How have you been doing your shopping since Covid?	labels:Online only/curbside pickup for the most part. I went inside into a fancy boutique once a few weeks ago because I was walking by and saw a dress in the window I had to have (plus they were having like a 50%-70% (but final) sale. But I was in and out in maybe 10 mins.  Almost all of the clothing stores I frequent have a website or even an instagram. In fact, one of them managed to get “online” really fast with just instagram posts and call to order. I’m still very much supporting my local stores in that I’ll order online and pickup and try them on at home and return if it doesn’t work. I’m a bit more selective in trying clothes now in that I’ll only try things that I’m certain I will purchase if they fit. But my purchases have increased a lot due to COVID sales.	episode_done:True

text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:I think a lot of people here that say their clothing falls apart quickly aren't properly caring for their clothes. Growing up I learned to wash everything together on cold. As an adult I had to read articles and watch YouTube videos on how to care for my clothing. I recommend everyone learn how to properly launder their clothing.
text:I agree, I've never understood what people are doing in the laundry to make their clothes literally fall apart after a few washes. Washing on the hottest setting and drying high heat, maybe?  Ive legitimately never had anything fall apart in the wash ever and I dont take particular care other than cold water and low heat in the dryer (plus not chucking things like sweaters, dress shirts and leggings in the dryer at all). And I used the communal machines in my apartment!	labels:Washing clothes after wearing them only once and doing it on a high setting, I imagine?  Obviously clothes need to be washed if they're smelly, grubby, or you've been sweating in them but it's perfectly fine to wear something a few times before it needs washing.  Also: buying poor quality clothes made from synthetic materials.
text:As to your first point I pretty much only buy poor quality clothes made from synthetics as 1) I have no money and 2) I'm allergic to wool, so I can't speak to that (Holla at me, urban planet, old navy and Joe fresh).  As to your second point, good point. Other than underwear thats true I do wear everything 2-3 times before washing.  Like I do believe people when they say the qash shreds their clothes, to be clear. I just genuinely don't understand what is doing it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.

text:Indoor layers	labels:For clarity, because I think I get where you’re coming from—are you saying that the outerwear makes the outfit complete, so you’re wondering what people do to complete their look after they’ve taken off the coat once indoors? I’ve often felt like this while scrolling through Pinterest and wondered the same.
text:Yeah that's what I took out of this as well.  A lot of those inspo posts on Pinterest are Pepe at fashion weeks and they're notoriously under or overdressed for the weather because they want to have the look. I have so many saved of cold NY fashion weeks and people in mini dresses and open toed shoes. AFAIK they're just running from their car to the paps and then inside again or suffering through it otherwise.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession). I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession 🤣

text:Building a sense of style and finding joy in fashion during a pandemic?	labels:I just wanted to say, don’t feel ashamed for liking Urban Outfitters! Or liking the same things as your classmates. It’s great that you want to find some that’s a little more unique to you, but there’s nothing wrong with liking popular things. Usually they’re popular because they’re good.

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:kind of all of them? It seems like you have to pay pretty steep prices now to get the quality of clothes that mid-price mall brands had in the 1990s and early 2000s. It seems that most stores have switched to a model of selling poor quality pieces at huge markups with the expectation that they will sell most of the stock at clearance prices. The GAP used to have quality staples, and J Crew was "fancy." Now GAP is really the same quality as Old Navy, and don't know what J Crew is anymore. The quality has certainly dropped, but I also don't get what is up with the designs since you can't even get a reasonable women's suit there these days. Madewell is not made well. Anthropologie used to sell unique pieces with really good construction, now it's roughly the same as other fast fashion, though I do appreciate that they added petite and plus sizing and carry some high end brands too. Levi's main line is terrible now, and to get the heritage quality, you need to get the Made and Crafted line, which is really expensive!  I mostly shop secondhand because I can't afford the stuff I like. When buying new, I try to wait for sales and avoid buying anything "final sale" or with complicated returns unless I know it will work. Clothes that I used to get at Anthropologie, I now get from Sezane, Ulla Johnson, Doen, and Samantha Pleet. I started buying vintage jeans over Madewell/Levi's or expensive craft brands—my 1980s Chic and Gitano jeans were probably sold at K-Mart/Target but are better quality than anything I have gotten from Madewell. I don't wear jeans/denim enough to justify craft denim prices. Patagonia is still very high quality technical wear; I just scope out the Tyler sport outlet and secondhand for deals. Shoes are hard because I don't like to get them secondhand. I switched from Adidas to Veja and Diemme for sneakers (you can find Diemme shoes for huge markdowns on Yoox during the winter and summer sales—I don't think they are worth retail price).

text:I'm Not a Watch Guy I Swear - Street x Sprezza	labels:As someone who had a very similar journey, this is a great insightful post into the mentality of how a non-watch guy becomes interested in watches. In my opinion, there is not nearly enough dialogue between men's fashion and the watch world (in the mainstream sense). Worth crossposting to r/watches	episode_done:True

text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:My hair has been white for a long time, and I worked as an educator. I wore and still wear all kinds of fun scrunchies, pony tail holders, barrettes, clips etc, in complimentary colors (but not matching ) to my outfits. Students always enjoy comparing notes! In a corporate setting hair accessories probably need to be used more sparingly, depending on the job.	episode_done:True
text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:Fashion is to style as reading is to wisdom.  If you only read the rainbow press you're not gaining wisdom.  Likewise if all your contact with fashion is the fast fashion catalogs you're not gaining style.  Still reading comes at different levels if you give a book by let's say Boudrillard to somebody who never read you're not doing them a favor.  Same with haute coture.  People need to already have a fashion framework to understand it.  Also if you read something and just vomit it out again verbatim at the next opportunity you definitely don't demonstrate any wisdom.  Same way if you copy a model's clothes you're not getting her style.  The way reading furthers wisdom is because you would try to integrate ideas of what you have read into your existing cognitive framework, and the effort you spend on your framework improves it.  Same with fashion, you integrate inspirations from what you see on the runway into your existing stylistish framework and the effort you spend on it improves it.	episode_done:True
text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Many years ago I moved from Hawaii to college in the Northeast. I would recommend 1) Buying it all there, because they'll have what's good for their climate and 2) starting out with cheaper options (thrifted, Old Navy, Target range) even if it's not quite your style. Don't spend much time, effort, and money until you see how you really feel after at least a year of seasons. Maybe you want warmer stuff than you thought you would, or realize you should invest in nicer socks, or discover you don't actually like turtlenecks, or shift to a different style when you're surrounded by a new area's vibe. Let yourself experience it for a bit without pressuring yourself to do it all right.
text:Yes! I love uniqlo's' merino wool sweaters for an inexpensive, nice wool sweater. They will shrink a bit though so watch out. They also have inexpensive turtlenecks if you want to try that look out.  I live in Seattle so it's not super cold here, but I still love wearing wool socks and lightweight wool sweaters.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:[Inspo & Commentary] Rings	labels:A quick note about colored gold: you state that it is a different alloy composition which gives rose gold its pink hue, which is true. But there is no alloy composition for gold which gives it a truly white color. It is a Rhodium electroplating that gives white gold its brilliant platinum-like (as Rhodium is a platinum-group metal) whiteness, and white gold jewelry will absolutely require periodic re-dipping in Rhodium to maintain that color. Exactly how frequent is up to your body chemistry and wear pattern.	episode_done:True

Anyways, I have the hardest time finding nightgowns that aren’t made for the elderly or aren’t lace nighties. I just want a cute and soft night gown! Until then I’m also in the oversized T-shirt camp.
text:Betsy Johnson makes the cutest night gowns!! I'm 24 and night gowns is pretty much all I wear too.

text:What clothing items have you reverted back to since WFH/quarantine?	labels:Sweatshirts that are 2 sizes too big and yoga/workout pants. Essentially, it’s my college wardrobe which works since I’m only 3 years out of college.
text:This is the direction I've veered as well, but its really new for me. I like dressing up and never owned any lounge clothes that I wore outside of bedtime, and when quarantine hit I had a mini identity crisis wondering "where the fuck do I wear all these nice clothes??? I don't fit in anywhere now!"  Started buying leggings and hoodies and felt really weird and intimidated. I realized I have no idea how to do casual dress. I never even wore t shirts. But OH MAN this is the most comfy my wardrobe will ever be! I know the time will come for my nice, lovely clothes to come back out but Im so glad I entered the world of loungewear!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I bought these very popular aritzia melina leather pants..an inspo album and fit pictures	labels:I love the outfits you recreated! I have these pants to, am your size/fit except I’m 5’8”. I did buy the 8, and the gapping is REAL. However, I planned on and do wear them primarily with chunky knits and shirt hems that cover the waist, and this wasn’t a huge dealbreaker for me. My only CC  is maybe getting them hemmed? A lot of the looks you recreated have an ankle length to them, which stood out for me!	episode_done:True
text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:Honestly lululemon. Find a pair that fit you well and with all the features you want and you’ll never turn back. Leg pockets and waist drawstring for me.
text:I haven’t shopped at Lululemon in years (seriously, probably 8 yrs) & I always loved the brand, but fell off the athleisure train.  I went online to order a pair of high rise, plain black, full length leggings hopefully slimming & the product ratings were just so bad that it surprised me and deterred me!  Do you have a specific style that you recommend?!	labels:They’re still quality. If you have a store near you, go try a few on and talk to an educator.

text:What trousers do people wear these days?	labels:Right now my kick is the paper bag waist pants. The right material can make it very classy and is so flattering. H&M and Macy’s or JCP has great options.  Aritzia is also great but can run pricey.	episode_done:True
text:London street style Inspo (circa 1985-1990s)	labels:Hi all! This album is just a collection of street styles taken from London circa 1985-1990s by Mr. Shoichi Aoki.      I was very much surprised when going through the photos today because of how good the fits are considering they're mostly from the mid 80s. These looked like styles from the streets of Tokyo & Seoul but they turned out to from the UK instead. I know in terms of fashion many countries draw inspiration from each other but I never expected the folks in London to be so in command and stylish from such an early period!      Another pleasant surprise was how similar these fits look to the current trend of streetwear, high fashion / avantgarde style in the recent 2-3 years. If I had no clue of the year these photos were taken from, I wouldn't have a problem believing that they were from recent years.

text:Fellow clothing trackers, what coveted items are you tracking now?	labels:The Steve Madden Trap platform chelsea boots 😭 DSW ran out of size 7, but I found a new pair on Poshmark and ordered. 2 months later, USPS tracking stopped and Poshmark refunded me. I'm still holding out hope that it'll magically be delivered... But I've also been lurking online 😅	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:The clothing examples will be dated because the book was published in the early 2000s, but Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine’s “What Not To Wear” talks about similar body types—minus broad shoulders and long legs. I’m short and have a different body type, so I won’t be much help here, but checking out Trinny and Susannah’s book might be helpful to get ideas of general clothing cuts that might work for you. They also have a series of YouTube videos called “The Rules” which repeat a lot of what’s in the book. I hope this helps!	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:The present always feels “neutral”. I think if you watch any reality show from the early 2010s, even as late as 2014-15, you’ll see a big difference from what was considered “no defining silhouette” then. things like just a tshirt change slightly in cut and shape over time.
text:People should watch old seasons of the bachelor if they don’t believe this. Professionally styled TV glosses over or tones down some of the trends you forgot about.

text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:I buy from The RealReal and sometimes Poshmark.   Poshmark has really good prices on some items, especially if I'm looking for something specific and not high-end, like a certain Express top I read about. (Ebay can be useful for this, too.) Prices on higher-end stuff aren't competitive IME, but I haven't looked for much in that range. Also be aware the shipping cost per item will add a good chunk to a cheap piece.  Prices on The RealReal are not cheap, but if you hang out a while you get a sense of what's decent, and sometimes you find something really neat for good deal. The best feature of TRR is measurements, something that's ruined me for other sites at that price point. It helps to be familiar with your own measurements and take into account materials and the shape of your body--I'm short, for example, so measurements are all well and good, but if my hips hit at the waist they don't mean much.   Caveats there: Be attentive to whether or not something is returnable; it's published on each listing. Bags usually aren't, as well as anything whose price has been marked down a lot. Also, shipping costs are $12 each way, so I eat the cost and buy several items in the same order, knowing I'll return half of them if they don't fit right. Shopping there successfully is a bit of a learning process, but I've really liked it overall.	episode_done:True

text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:OP, my boyfriend's mother was tested allergic to blue dye in polyester and nylon, so she can only wear natural fibers. You should probably get it checked if those fibers are bothering you. Maybe you have an allergy with some chemicals used to dye or process these fibers. The allergist will help you figure out the category of clothes you can and cannot wear.  In my bf's mom's case, she only wears 100% cotton, wool, cashmere, and silk fibers.	episode_done:True
text:Le Château is closing all stores (most likely)	labels:I remember when I used to shop as the warehouse with my mother (at the time they had section for girls).  I got my prom dress (100% silk) for 70$ instead of 200$ because it was the last one (XXS) and it had little repairs to do.   Unfortunately, I feel like they lost what made them unique (affordable but stylish clothes) in the last years.	episode_done:True

text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I'm a fan of combining bold pieces with more bold pieces. They say less is more, but I believe the inverse is true too: more is less. Meaning that when a piece feels like it's "too much," it can often help to add other "too much" pieces to balance it out and create a more intentional look.   The pink suit would rock with a base layer in red, light pink, tan/brown, or even a print or stripe if the mood strikes.

text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:I think it has to do with how immediately recognizable something is as being a particular brand’s, like the ever famous red sole shoes. Most companies don’t really have these kinds of easily recognized traits (outside of trade marked logos), because putting an identifying feature on everything you make severely limits what you can produce.   Most clothes look like clothes, and could easily come from any brand, and those I don’t find a moral issue with. Especially since many designs we look at and associate with a certain brand are only because we saw it for them first/associate that brand with prestige and assume they must have come up with it first. In reality, most of them are using designs that have been around and circulating amongst all of fashion, and no one can really pin point where they came from first.   Like with your example, those are two incredibly basic designs I’ve seen around for years from many different brands. I wouldn’t even be comfortable saying the cheaper brand is copying the French brand for sure and not any number of other companies. Sure, it’s sometimes very obvious when someone is getting copied, like when a Kardashian wears anything and Fashion Nova is selling it’s version the next day. But most of the time designs are kind of free flowing.	episode_done:True

text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I work in an engineering office, where the men usually wear a dress shirt + pants Mon-Thu and khaki + polo on Fri. My interpretation of “casual Friday” isn’t necessarily dressed down, but showing more of my personal style. I usually wear neutral coloured blouse + skirt, and on Fridays wear the same type of outfit but with a brighter colour and/or louder pattern, with bolder accessories.   Eg. Thursday is blue striped button down shirt and black pencil skirt. Friday is buttoned up Kelly green cardigan with a panda brooch, and shorter houndstooth a-line skirt.	episode_done:True

Congratulations on finally having shoes you're excited to put on and I hope they live up to every little bit of that excitement for you.  The best bit is that good quality shoes get *more* comfortable as you imprint on the cork inside and the leather conforms to your feet.

text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process? What would you prioritize?	labels:You know what?

I have all kinds of office appropriate slacks and cardigans and button up shirts in cutesy patterns, casual jeans and sensible shoes. I want to wear plastic corsets and fluorescent clip in braids and platform combat boots.
text:Yes this! I have  worked in all kinds of office environments and my style was rocker-professional.

This year I'm doing a no-buy year with a caveat. I can make myself as much clothing as I want!  Now, I'm a pretty great knitter if I do say so myself, but I'm also decent at sewing.

text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:I actually went to a swap last weekend! We did it outside in a yard.  The host had hung up clothes lines between a bunch of trees and when we arrived, we put our stuff on the lines.  That way everything could be displayed, but we could also wander around while maintaining some distance.  Where I'm from, at the end of the swap, the host donates the left over clothes to a women's shelter.  I've gotten some hits and misses from swaps, but overall it's fun.   It helps if the host invites people who are similar sizes or makes sure to invite lots of people with a variety of body types so no one is really left out.
text:I really like that outdoor format.  Did you bring anything home?	labels:Yeah! A Hawaiian shirt, pajama bottoms, a hat with a marmot on it, a fleece, a t shirt from the arizona sonoran desert museum, and an REI shirt for my man.  It wasn't a very "high fashion" swap haha
text:Nice!  With the exception of the Eileen Fisher sweater my scores haven't been high end either but several have been workhorses.   I remember I got 2 pairs of pretty decent skinny jeans, a workout tank, an olive H&M blouse that was work appropriate when I needed more, and a pair of black cropped pajama pants covered in tacky martini glasses that I adore.  I also got some guitar tab books and several novels, and a work mug.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:Good personal grooming-  neat hair, clean teeth/breath, “nails covered by at least clear nail polish” etc, Clothing- tailored, looks neat (no wrinkles, lint, excessive pilling, etc） Bags / shoes- I think these can really elevate an outfit, but remember even if your bag is $$$$ it still needs to be neat/ not too visibly worn out.  “Walking with confidence” is also important.   I think that Aly Art and Merriam style are good sources for finding your style.. Anna Bey’s channel I think is good for learning about modern elegance and at the very least self confidence, “living life to your fullest” and self respect even if you aren’t preparing to have formal dinners with a kind every evening or having an expensive lifestyle. I don’t know of other sources for “modern elegance”..   Knowing what lines and colors look good on you also makes a difference in your appearance.	episode_done:True

text:Does Anyone Ever Feel Like It’s Hard to Find Basic Clothing Items That Were Plentiful in the Past?	labels:I don't know if I'd consider a velvet dress a basic item.  My basic item is a good quality fitted tee and tank.  Old Navy used to be the place to buy these things but their quality has gone downhill a lot.  I just want a tee or tank that is good for layering, but is not so sheer that I can't wear it alone.  Is something made with fabric heavier than tissue paper too much to ask?  (And by fitted, I don't mean the Everlane oversized/boxy fit.  If I wanted that, I'd shop in the men's section.)

text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I have a pretty extensive budget that I still have plenty of room for clothes shopping in! I have had a budget since I started working professionally 3 years ago.  I have three sections: Bills (phone, rent, student loans, power etc), Expenses (food, gas, “fun”) and Savings (anything I’m saving up for: laptop, trips, gifts, my niece’s college fund, hobbies, and clothes! As well as an emergency fund where everything else goes).  I generally consider the clothing fund to be a low priority so I set about $40 a paycheque to it, but I don’t necessarily spend that much every two weeks. I also usually cap it at $500, where if it’s grown to that amount then I take my $40 every two weeks and put it to something else.   Generally I don’t spend all of it before a new paycheque comes along but if I do, I will use some of my “fun” money in expenses to cover the rest.   I have gotten two pay increases in the last two years as well as moved houses twice + paid off my loan (different bill amounts) so whenever I readjust my budget I start with my bills, generally keep my fun + grocery amounts the same, and then increase my savings categories a bit while mostly prioritizing putting the excess into my emergency account. When I started working I think I was setting aside $20 or $25 for clothes, now up to $40.  Maybe more long-winded than you wanted but that’s the jist :)	episode_done:True

I think if you watch any reality show from the early 2010s, even as late as 2014-15, you’ll see a big difference from what was considered “no defining silhouette” then. things like just a tshirt change slightly in cut and shape over time.

text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:I’ve never considered this.   I love fashion and I have A LOT of clothing. I also routinely sell my clothes on Poshmark when they no longer “bring me joy”. So aside from a number of my favourite pieces and basics, my wardrobe is always changing. My mom was quite interested in fashion as well, and she routinely tells me my thrift store finds look like pieces she owned in the 90’s. We moved across the country when I was young so holding on to them wasn’t really an option. I do have some pieces I don’t ever plan on selling and just holding on to as a time capsule or memory; a few political/ charity sweaters, my first Chanel earrings, the Marc Jacobs sneakers I spent 6 years looking for, a pair of bell bottoms from the 70’s with Coca Cola logos all over them.... I don’t know if I’ll ever have kids or if they’ll be interested in fashion but i can imagine myself as an old lady going through a box of my old favourite things and reminiscing.	episode_done:True

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I got my first fancy bag after calling off my wedding lol I figured it cost around the same amount as the dress I wouldn’t ever wear so why not? The woman at the LV store thought I was on drugs ... “are you celebrating something?” And I’m like as a matter of fact, yes, yes I am. I just lost a ton of money on a wedding but I dodged a bullet and left that POS. All she said was “well you can always make more money” anyway, I’m getting a Chanel bag for my next milestone birthday. Not sure which one but it’s gonna happen soon.
text:I love the story too! I am glad you treated yourself. What LV bag did you get? What Chanel bag are you looking at as well?	labels:I got a MM neverfull with the pink lining... I still love it! And I like the boy bag, but may end up with a tote of some kind instead.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 10, 2020	labels:The right fit is so difficult. I have been looking for selvedge denim that has the silhouette of joggers or skinny jeans (slim thru the thigh, hugs the knee and smaller ankle opening) with the comfort of more baggy jeans(doesn't restrict your crotch). Tapered fits are still a bit baggy in the ankle area for my taste.  Haven't found one that can do both. I ordered some Uniqlo jeans and I'll have the tailored, which still turns out to be a pretty good deal.  Any suggestions out there that can help me out. I'm debating whether to buy skinny jeans with a mid rise and 2" larger waist. Looking at the Gustin mystery grab deal, could lean toward a Skinny 35" since I've heard their fits are looser than most.  For reference : im 5'9 173lbs. my waist is about 34" and inseam around 31".
text:What are you looking for from a pair of selvedge jeans? They're typically not that skinny because they're either made with non-stretch cotton which would make them difficult to put on, or you're meant to cuff them for a more straight/wider look.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How to wear nice casual clothes with a cotton allergy?	labels:Have you tried looking for clothing made out of hemp or linen? You can find casual tshirts and whatnot that are 100% hemp fabric. You can also find causal shoes that are hemp (i have an older pair of Adidas that are 100% hemp fabric uppers). Plenty made out of leather as well.  Do you have a budget for clothes? A lot of companies that use these alternative materials are considered "premium" brands and carry their price tags accordingly.
text:Hey thanks for the suggestion. Sorry, I should have clarified this but I'm also allergic to hemp, linen, wool, and a few more obscure fabrics.  I'm willing to pay as much as needed for this kind of "alternative material" jean.  Leather might be an option but I'm vegetarian so it would need to be vegan leather probably	labels:I definitely recommend updating your original post with this info btw, it will yield you a lot more useful responses.	episode_done:True

My parents (and all of my relatives) expected me to dress super preppy (like a walking J. Crew catalog-- those were a thing then).  I was secretly alternative and was more about band tees and late 90s era Hot Topic stuff.  But I had very few Hot Topic type things because of my parents.   I remember putting black lipstick on as soon as I got to school and taking it off before I went home.  I hid the lipstick in my locker.    They still give me a hard time about how I dress and I simply reply with "I'm not you.

text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:I'm hoping those "Is it Wine o'clock?" shirts (or anything involving  women drinking wine to deal with life) you find at any mall store/Target directed towards adults.   Perhaps it's because I can no longer pass as a youth and will no doubt get thrown into the demographic these companies sell to, but it's always painful when you start to see a trend in clothes and you hate it, and it lasts YEARS.
text:I’m really confused by the economics of these. One time I counted how many different styles of “insert phrase here” shirts there were at Target, I think there were at least 10 or 12. But I never seem to see anyone actually wearing these? Maybe it’s just my demographic but I would think I’d see them on randos out in public too. Doesn’t seem like there’s enough demand to meet the supply!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:Reading through the comments it really seems like Modcloth's problem has been consistency of quality all along, and not just since the Walmart takeover. I personally used to shop the website a lot, (especially for quirky jewelry and accessories!) and while I have a soft spot for many of those pieces (especially the blazer I mentioned under another comment) now that I'm really sitting here thinking about it there were def others that didn't last well or look as good in person. I also started thinking about how at that age pretty much all my income was disposable (living at home, no kids) so I guess it didn't bother me as badly if something wasn't worth what I paid for it, especially if it was cute enough to make an outfit with once or twice. So maybe the real issue with the site is its failure to adapt to its customer base's changing needs. Or, alternatively, to attract new and younger customers by staying on trend. I think there's probably a market for quirky but still trendy pieces , but a "vintage" aesthetic is a hard sell when thrifting is much more common now (not to mention cheaper and more responsible).	episode_done:True

I wish we had an alternate with the sleeves down though. Chuck's depriving us of having MAXIMUM fun with layering the shirt, but I really like how the different colors pop out of the sweater. However, don't think the popped collar works very well with the neck of the sweater, worked better last week imo. ^^^I ^^^died ^^^for ^^^this, ^^^Chuck? ^^^for ^^^THIS!?     Rariora vs Salutorian: Really fuck with Rariora's drop shoulder cardigan. Top half feels like comfy wfh, bottom half feels more formal, to me it feels kinda incongruent. Sal's fit has really grown on me, the sock and sandals combo in the deets shot is so damn cool.  This one got more difficult for me the longer I looked at them. Haven't voted on this one yet, gunna let it stew.     NgoKnows vs **DeLaJoel**: DLJ knocks it outta the park here, such a cool fil. Colors and silhouette are just awesome all around. The shirt is such an awesome piece. Really dig Ngo's fit too, especially with the scarf. Feels like it should be in a Fall inspo album. But Cheesin' Joel is just too powerful.     **Chunsak** vs Thecomebackkid: Good god man. I really really like TCK's fit overall, but I think Chun's fit here is the best of the whole battle.

If I have to remove more than my bag and one additional layer of clothing to pull down my jumpsuit it's too much.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:I also hate wearing pants. Don’t know how cold we’re talking but up to around  40 F, I would pretty much wear any autumn-y skirt/dress and rely on my wool tights, knee high leather boots, and a long wool coat to provide warmth for my lower body. Personally, most of the skirts I chose to wear were 100% cotton denim, leather, or suede!
text:I like a mid-calf wool skirt that has plenty of folds, a wide hem, and a satin lining. The shape allows freedom of movement and room for other layers, and the smooth lining defeats friction so the hem doesn’t bunch up.   In the depth of winter, I’ll wear silk long johns and Cuddle-Duds pants underneath; the Duds are easy to pull off without putting on a show when I get to my desk. (I dislike changing in a bathroom.)  Lately I’ve had the thought that the ideal under layer might be those Indian-style pants with the crotch that comes down to the knee.	labels:I looove Cuddle-Duds!

I spent ALL my allowance money at the magazine stand as a young girl, I really miss those days!    Now I honestly rely on blogs like Who What Wear. Things move much faster now and there is sooo much more content that relying on a monthly magazine just isn’t realistic anymore IMO.	episode_done:True

text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Main tip would be to try not to care too much about what others think and do what makes you feel good. I started gaining more confidence when I actually started wearing the clothes I found cute. It was gradual of course and I felt a little self conscious at first but as time went on I felt so much better about myself until I became completely confident in everything I wore. It sucks that your mom discouraged you but I would just say not to mind it and do what you feel like doing. At the end of the day it’s you wearing the clothing- not your mom, and you should feel great wearing whatever you’re wearing! Good luck	episode_done:True

text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:I use them out of convenience mostly. After spending 15 years carrying both prescription glasses and prescription sunglasses, it's pretty neat to only have one thing to carry.
text:The functionality aspect I get it  I just don't know style wise if those frames as classic and elegant as they look would be ruined by the slight tint or enhance it  My store told me to go 1 size bigger if I get transitions as it makes the glasses feel smaller usually	labels:I don't really care much for it to be honest, it's mostly the frame that matters. That said having tinted glasses on a cloudy winter morning is a bit annoying but these things are sensitive. Anyway I don't wear my glasses constantly as I've got 9/10 eyes. If I had to, I'd probably opt for something different, like these sun lenses you can clip on your regular glasses.
text:Yeah, I was thinking that too, there is a sunglasses clip for this one actually, although carrying that around - might as well have a sunglasses, putting 2 glasses on each other is like looking from telescope with glasses haha  &#x200B;  That's my feeling, but it looks alright	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What’s on everyone’s Black Friday wishlists?	labels:I had one item on my Black Friday wishlist and picked it up yesterday when the sale started-- a Fitbit Charge 4.

text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I just found out about goodwill outlet bins recently and I am soooooo excited about the idea of going there , but I'm scared to go during COVID because I'm personally following a "only go to stores where I can maintain 6 ft social distancing space at all times" policy. I heard online that people get really intense at the outlet bins, and get right in your face and elbow you out of the way to grab clothes and all that stuff. I'm very curious, what are your personal experiences? Should I feel safe checking it out/are there new safety rules in place, or should I wait for a few months?
text:It depends on the location. My local one is not as disgusting as you sometimes hear, but it is absolutely people everywhere. An hour and a half away, everything is meticulously monitored and clean.   The hullaballoo generally occurs around the new bins that they bring out. I find that most people do the first layer or so and move on so if you dig deeper, there's still good stuff left there. I don't crowd for new bins even pre-COVID and when everyone's in the new bins, it gives you a lot of space to peruse literally every other bin in there.	labels:Thanks for the reply!

text:General Discussion - December 08, 2020	labels:A random thought about clothes..  I normally wear an airism undershirt (the seemless ones that are mostly Nylon not Polyester) and a merino wool sweater also from Uniqlo  Yesterday I decided to wear my airism with an OCBD (cotton) instead, and noticed a sharp increase in static electricity. like touching door knobs, etc.  Which is par the course in winter, until this year I started wearing merino almost exclusively.  I wonder why.. I thought cotton is neutral.. or is the interaction between cotton and nylon causing it?  i also thought Merino also causes static, but is the interaction between merino and nylon balancing each other out?  i'm using it in the same exact locations and environment.	episode_done:True

text:It’s 2021. A vaccine for the virus has been made widely available and businesses may operate at full capacity, including bars, clubs, salons, etc. How will this influence fashion?	labels:People will go ALL OUT. This sub usually salivates at the thought of athleisure taking over and killing fashion (and fast fashion) but that 100% wouldn't happen. Almost every woman I know is bloody sick and tired of not getting to dress up, not being able to wear lipstick, not having places to wear heels and vacation outfits. People would literally go crazy and it truly would be the roaring twenties. Dresses of all types, miniskirts, sparkle and glitter, heels for days, fun fabrics, bolder colors, leather pants, blouses with impractical sleeves, statement earrings – women would really be dressing to the nines *and* wearing bold lipstick colors to compliment.
text:I'm 100% behind you. At work, we worked one day out of five again after the first lockdown (until Lockdown 2: Electric Boogaloo here in NL) and suddenly everyone started to dress fancy?

text:Permanent Style - Tucked in T-Shirt	labels:i’ve been tucking my tee every day for probably about four years now. I dunno what it is, but it just really clicked for me. it looks especially good when you’re wearing the tee under an overshirt or jacket, since you no longer have to deal with the hem of the tee sitting at an awkward length underneath the jacket (or being *longer* than the jacket, which was an old pet peeve of mine). tucking creates a very nice line that looks like this: \_|-|_  generally, this look works best with boxier tees and pants, *or* very slim stuff a la the old “Saint Laurent” look. trying to do this while wearing your garden variety slim t-shirts and slim chinos is when you get into the uncanny territory of feeling like your dad in an unfashionable way.

I went through a phase at like 28 where I felt like I had to have this "timeless capsule adult lady wardrobe" and changed my whole style to fit into a societal expectation of what a 30 year olds style should be.

text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:Last year, I went on a no-buy last year for 11 months to assess what clothing items I really wanted and finally picked out a few pieces (a cashmere sweater, a pair of loafers, new boots) during Black Friday. I also learned how to mend simple holes in clothing and embroidered some boring shirts to make them feel "new". Tbh, It wasn't really difficult, because during quarantine/online classes, I wore the same few pieces of clothing every day.   This year, I want to clear out clothing that don't fit me anymore or are poor quality/uncomfortable/unfashionable. I recently moved apartments and it was ridiculous how much clothes I had that I never wore. My family used to be a lot more frugal, so all my clothes were from the clearance section (under $5 usually) of fast fashion stores and I picked them without regard to style/quality/fit. I never threw away clothing if it wasn't significantly ripped, so I even have clothing from when I was in middle school.	episode_done:True

text:Women who have moved for extended periods of time on 1 or 2 suitcases only, how did you do it? Here's the beginning of my process	labels:My advice: dress as you currently are, not as who you want to be. I feel like capsule wardrobes are always too aspirational.    Every time I pack for a long trip like "Oh, of course I'll love wearing this flowy, extra dress that I never wear," I'm not comfortable in it.    There are just a few things that I wear pretty much immediately when they're clean. I could live in that clothing. They're not really basics, they're just my favorite. That's what should go in your suitcase.

text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:My hair is bright purple now, and has been blue.  I do adjust what I wear with it- reds or oranges can look overwhelming- but still dress pretty brightly! I stick to cool colors + neutrals (white, black, grey) so nothing clashes overmuch with the hair, and try not to wear the *exact* shade of purple as a shirt or dress (then I look like a crayon).  Wearing just black and white tends to glam me up a bit, at which point the hair acts as a bold accessory.	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:Where are you from? Are you a student or a working adult? What is your budget and purpose of dressing up? Do you have any spare weekend to go into a megastore (e.g. Zara, your local department store...) to try out all types of colors and silhouettes to see what suits you? You're not obligated to buy even if you try it on. If anyone ask, just say you're just trying out and still thinking about it.             I suggest knowing your measurements (use a measuring tape!) and sticking to a capsule wardrobe. Black/White top + colorful bottom or colorful top + black/white/brown bottom with neutral shoes.       Keep in mind the stylish people on social media spend a ton on their clothes or rent/return them after taking photos so they are not exactly appropriate comparisons for everyone.	episode_done:True
text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:An easy transition from tees can be a cami (satin or something drapey) with a cropped or duster length cardigan. It seems more put together because you’re combining items and layering, but is still very comfortable. Add jewelry and mix up the shoes and you’re done. Variations of this can take you from super casual to the office to date night.	episode_done:True
text:Stylish ways to carry emergency medication?	labels:How about an ankle holster?	episode_done:True
text:Stockings vs Tights vs Leggings	labels:no contribution here but I personally hate most tights because the inseams tend to be too short for me and tall tights are often more expensive and harder to find (sheertex doesn't make them anymore....why???)
text:Wow Sheertex killed tall? Sad. I found the regular to be short and bought the talls.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:Take a similar shirt of different fabric in to get tailored and see how your like the experience and their workmanship. Then bring silk shirts in to ask if they think they can improve the fit neatly.  Honestly anytime someone says silk is hard to work with, I roll my eyes. Maybe it is for people with less experience with it the first time they sew it. But I am not by any stretch of the imagination a skilled seamstress (I would say I am an intermediate hobby sewist), and I love silk of all kinds.  My sister (who is actually a pro) says the same thing about stretch. Even very experienced sewists sometimes avoid stretch out of fear or describe it as very difficult, but she laughs because she taught herself to sew by fitting her jersey t shirts in high school to be tighter. It just takes a little experience and the right tools.   If it’s all chiffon, or any other very gauzy loose weave, THAT can be a bitch, because it just morphs into a different shape before your eyes, but even then, a few darts or tucks or a hem should be no big deal for a tailor even on chiffon. And that’s more about how the weave behaves, not the fiber, so it also applies to polyester chiffon, cotton gauze, power mesh, etc. Plus, the garment is already cut and constructed, so it’s not going to move around much if you don’t take it apart and rebuild it.	episode_done:True

text:How do ya'll express your culture or traditional fashion in modern clothing?	labels:I'm Ukrainian Canadian, so the easiest thing is embroidery. I wouldn't really be able to wear a true vyshyvanka to work just because of it reading too casual (thanks boho trends...) but I've been looking at vyshyvanka embroidery on dress shirts and have found some interesting things.

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:I have moved to different climates many times. My recommendation would to not purge or change anything until your move is complete. The reason is, you definitely get climatized, where what would consider "warm" in the winter to you now will feel chilly enough to wear heavyweight items you hadn't expected would work once you are climatized. A lot of items that you think will/won't work end up being the opposite, etc. You mentioned having less storage, so it sounds like you will need to offload/purge at some point, but I'd wait to do it once you get there and put it off for as long as you can to truly see what items work. I'll never move to a cold climate again but even moving to different warmer climates, I will wait to do any paring down/purging until I can get a little climatized and adapt.

text:General Discussion - December 24, 2020	labels:Have we come to a general consensus on what “well-dressed” or a “good” outfit is?

A bonus factor would be something interesting within the fit, be that through challenging pre-existing rules or providing something unexpected. I don’t think it’s a necessity to a good fit, but it definitely adds bonus points

I also just bought Jen7 by Seven --a straight ankle length & I really like them.  I buy most of my jeans at Nordstrom Rack or Bloomingdales on Sale.

text:Permanent Style - The Cold-Colour Capsule	labels:See, I'm confused. In what sense are blues not the coolest colors? Why does this guide almost entirely exclude navy? In what sense are brown, black, grey and cream cold?
text:You know how audiophiles all make jokes about how meaningless the terms used to describe sound are because sound is so hard to define in that way? Same thing here, “warm” and “cold” are very loose terms that probably mean something a little different to everyone.   I can see the argument for grey and cream being cold, brown can be warm or cold depending on the shade, not sure if I’d agree with black.	labels:Now *that's* an argument I understand. Although I still think the way he's communicating is strange. I think he means tonally neutral, bland, desaturated colors. "Cold" is a really strange way to say that, whether or not the term is technically ambiguous.
text:Yeah now that I’ve taken some time to think about it, I see what’s going on.   Simon’s definition of cold vs warm has to do with saturation of colour and undertones, which is why cool or warm browns and greys can exist, respectively. Your definition of cold vs warm seems to focus on the hue/colour spectrum from red to blue.   That’s what I was saying before, you just have different starting points/references so cool/warm mean different things to you. I seem to remember some confusion in his comments section addressing the same thing.	labels:Undertones make sense, but it seems like low saturation is a bigger part of his argument. Like, a cream with cool undertones quickly turns into a light blue. And I think of "cream" and "beige" and "taupe" as being warmer off-whites, and greys and stone as being more neutral / cooler on average. But he uses all of those interchangably, avoiding only "tan" and "khaki" and the very clearly warm terms like that.  He doesn't specify cool grays, cool browns, or cool olives. There are definitely warm / yellowish olives, I'd say it's easier to find warm ones than cool ones. And there are definitely cooler dark greens. Desaturation is a bigger part of his point, and he doesn't really address it.  Oh, and that's not to mention blacks, which... if they were cool, they just wouldn't be blacks. And blacks are technically saturated, too. True black is tonally neutral and fully saturated, not sure how they fit into either point he's trying to make, really.

text:Why Did Bottega Veneta Delete Its Social Media Accounts?	labels:I suspect this is a marketing ploy of some description - and it has certainly worked as I have seen this covered in multiple venues. It does start/re-start the conversation about the use and value of social media for brands.   As the owner of a small brand, our results over the last few years have been mixed. We haven’t committed a lot of resources to the various social channels but I’ve found they take up a disproportionate amount of time with frequently unmeasurable results. It’s easy to see these channels as ‘free marketing’ but they are anything but. It’s good to see bigger brands look more carefully at their returns here as the costs of doing things on social media has gone up considerably. And don’t start me on ‘influencers’!
text:Thank you for bringing this small business perspective to it. I only really follow small businesses on my IG. I tried to follow my favorite brands (Acne, YSL, Casablanca, etc) and I had to unfollow. They're just a mess and I never engaged with the posts. Jacquemes is the only brand that has a decent IG and it's basically just his personal account with some shots of their office.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:I have found people overwhelmingly wear clothes a size too small (like speaking to friends and whatnot). My sister, for example, buys the same size leggings as I do despite her hips and waist being 5-6 inches larger than mine, and then complains about them being see through. I have strong suspicions that this is the reason people find thongs horrifically uncomfortable as well.	labels:Once I realized that low rise jeans were more for me (bc I have a very short torso) pants became much more comfy for me! I bought a few cute pair from old navy and they’re comfy as hell!
text:I have the same issue! Everyone else looks nice in high waisted pants, and I'm trying to find all the mid and low rise because otherwise I feel like my entire abdomen is encased in fabric, from my ribs onward.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: You Are What You Wear	labels:I was born and raised in California which means I am effectively a lizard person—fragile and unable to generate my own warmth. I am forced to rely entirely on cashmere to keep myself from freezing to death.  I am a very luxurious lizard.  But if you look at the brands of all my cashmere sweaters (Grana, Halogen, C by Bloomingdales) I'm wearing the materials of the wealthy, but from pedestrian brands! I AM A POOR PERSON MASQUERADING AS A RICH PERSON!  And honestly, that's pretty much the most disgusting personality flaw one can have.

text:FAQ: Why/ when/ how do you cuff jeans?	labels:Why: I think it can add a useful visual break in a pant leg, and sometimes it helps the leg drape better. Or if you just want a different silhouette, like cuffing high with boots.  How: I usually do one big turn up of like 2-2.5 inches, seems to let the leg drape more cleanly with no bunching. I'm more of a stacking guy tho.	episode_done:True
text:Nike Among Many Brands Lobbying Against Xinjiang Forced Labor Bill	labels:Someone correct me if I’m wrong but afaik the companies are against a specific part of the bill that says they can face punishment regardless of whether an audit turns up evidence of forced labor, with their stance subsequently being twisted into being against the whole bill.  EDIT: added missing words

text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:For a while I struggled with this as well. But then I realized that If you see something that someone else is wearing or is admiring someone’s style, in a way that really is your style too. If you like it on you, you can wear in and have it be a part of you. IMO it doesn’t matter if your style differs from day to day. One time I saw someone with a super cool black outfit on the street and straight up copied it from what I had home, and I loved to wear it! Next day I wore something flowery inspired from a fashion commercial! Felt great in that too.   Clothes can be very fun if you let them! Best of luck.	episode_done:True

text:Do you guys default to a set of a few pieces even though you own a ton?	labels:Yeah. I definitely have a set of clothes that get worn every week or multiple times every week. Things like dark slim-straight jeans, Indy boots, Patagonia baggies, some flannels, Barbour jackets, grey crew neck sweatshirt etc. I think it’s totally natural to gravitate towards a set of specific items as the “core” of your wardrobe and in general it’s worth spending more money on those piece. And then the rest of my stuff gets worn way less frequently. That stuff kind of fits into two categories in my mind: 1. Items that fill the same niche in my wardrobe as another item which I prefer either due to fit, style or details.  2. Items that are unique in style, color, or fit and thus only work in a narrow range of situations / outfits.   For me, the difficulty is avoiding items that fall into that first category and instead looking for more interesting stuff that would fall into the second	episode_done:True
text:Learning to dress better	labels:Some great advice already.   There’s plenty of YouTube videos and Instagram accounts to draw advice from. For example:  Gents Lounge, Real Men Real Style, etc etc  You just have to search and find some you enjoy watching and enjoy the people presenting. Only problem I find is that everyone is trying to sell something or they all encourage buying expensive items. Not always practical.   What I will advise as a student or someone with a lesser budget, or indeed anyone, is you can easy make some outfits work by substituting high street/cheaper brands.   Keep an eye on local charity shops and ebay, If you find something you like and it’s good quality, you can get it for a fraction of the price. Then if you need to take it to your local tailors and have it tailored. The cost of cheaper secondhand and the cost of a tailor can still be far below the original market price of the item.  If you do this, ensure the item is sized larger as it’s easier to take in clothing. Damn near impossible to let out.   I like to keep outfits simple, clean and a good fit. I’m not one for peacocking or over the top fashion style.  Find what works for you and have the confidence to own it. You don’t have to be a cardboard cutout, be yourself.  As for hair, women don’t mind long hair, just as long as it’s clean, maintained and kept. Just because you are growing it long doesn’t mean you have to just neglect it.   Growing it long could be a chance for you to cut it later and find a style you like.	episode_done:True

text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:My first (meaningful) boyfriend gave me a diamond necklace when i was 18. It was lovely, I wore it constantly, and received many compliments. And then we broke up, as one does with their teen boyfriend, and blah blah blah, after a while I was like, "wtf do I do with this?"  I was *never* going to wear it again and selling it felt a little mercenary.   I ended up giving it as a gift to a girl I babysat/nannied for when she turned 18. It was nice because it was a way for me to give it to someone I cared about and I was able to give her a much nicer gift than I normally would have. And now when I think about that particular piece of jewelry, I don't think about my imploded relationship with my ex, but my relationship that I had with this girl as she grew up.
text:Snitching this idea. My niece is getting to that age where she really appreciates adult jewelry, and since I can't wear this necklace and feel good, she should have it. It *was* given in love.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items are my Native American Turquoise jewelry and my cowboy boots. Just purchased a huge $900 squash blossom necklace and have worn it constantly. My boots range from $30 for a secondhand pair to $750 for custom made and none are worn more or less than the others.  When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was “saving for good”. Ironically, “good” apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I’m just out running errands.
text:Were you able to make use of any of your mother's special items that were packed away and never used?	labels:While her things had so much sentimental value for me, our styles were vastly different so I can’t say that any of it was of use to me other than the mink jacket that my father gave her for their 30th wedding anniversary ( and she wore only twice because she was “saving it for good”). I’ve kept it to be restyled into a fur vest as I have a fake one that I wear constantly, so I know I’ll use it.	episode_done:True

Like, I am a trans man on r/femalefashionadvice and not on r/malefashionadvice specifically because I prefer “marked” fashion choices. The mfa subreddit is all so safe and subtle. Fashion from that approach seems to be more about price and posturing than the sort of things that interest me—cut, color, silhouette, textures, prints, all these aesthetic considerations are largely absent from male fashion.  I agree with u/sunmoonnife that class definitely plays a role here, and with OP that queer identity definitely changes one’s ability to go unmarked and adds some nuance on how marked clothing will be interpreted.	episode_done:True

I wasn't varsity anything in school so wearing a piece like this feels like trying to be someone/something I'm not and never was.

text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:I worked in an office environment since starting after university, so my "uniform" has been business casual  attire consisting of button up shirts and blouses that I interchange with bottoms (dark trousers or pencil skirts). I find that going for a light and/or neutral coloured top, paired with a dark coloured (black, navy or grey) high waisted bottom has been worked for me.  It's about balance I think. Depending on your personal style, you can try a patterned, or colorful top paired with a dark coloured/neutral bottom, or vice versa. Or try monochromatic pairing, or some kind of color theme to the separates. Starting with neutrals is easier, and then maybe venturing into other color palettes, textures and patterns, depending on what you like.	episode_done:True

text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:My heirlooms came from my grandmother, who was 5'2" in heels. I am built the same way, but have more inches than she did... so alas, that gorgeous Burberry trench coat simply cannot be made to fit.   However, Gram was a collector of cashmere and one of those people who believed that if you like a thing, you should have one in every color, and two in the colors you like best, against it wearing out. I have a handful of her sweaters, some of which are from the early 70's. These sweaters were everyday wear for her, and it does show, but they are SO soft and SO luscious that I wear them around the house on a regular basis. My cats don't care that they're two inches too short and have holes at the hem.   I did inherit some of her jewelry, including her engagement ring, which was put in a setting that my grandfather designed. Sadly, resizing the setting to fit me would have destroyed it, so I have that put away until I find a jeweler I trust to make it into a necklace with a new stone. I have an AMAZING opal bracelet of hers, also my grandfather's design, a silver wire cuff with the opals set in as the body of a spider. Gram never told my grandfather that the thought of a spider on her wrist freaked her out- she rarely wore it. I never met my grandfather to tell him how cool I think that piece is. Looks amazing peeking out from under the lace sleeves of my favorite LBD.
text:Same on the cashmere in multiple colors! My great aunt didn’t have kids, so I got some of her clothes, including 3 cashmere sweaters from Jacobson’s (probably late 60s) in red, black, and grey. They’re a cropped boxy shape with a mock neck, and I love them.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:When did skinny jeans go out of fashion?	labels:Women in fashion have stated that skinny jeans have been out for years now. They at first were replaced with mom jeans, than wide leg coulotts, than the high rise straight leg and now I'm seeing a lot of low rise boot cut. That being said in everyday life I am still seeing a large majority of women still wearing skinny jeans
text:After reading this I realized I've been wearing bootcut jeans long enough to be back in style again. I started wearing bootcut and straight leg in the early 00s and kept it as a staple ever since because I liked the cut.  The real enemy is low rise and mid rise jeans.. I feel like a high rise makes most jean cuts look better to me.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:I spent like two months investing in a bunch of nice wool sweaters that I could wear through the winter, put them in a separate laundry bin after wearing so I could launder them myself, but my ex washed and dried them on high heat and they all shrunk so badly that I couldn't even fit them on my dog. About $1500 gone.

text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:Cost per wear!!   T = How many times a year will I wear this item S= How much? W = worth  S/T=W  EX. Leather boots are $120 (S) Will probably wear them 3x a week for 6 months so that’s 78 round up to 80 times. (T)  120/80= $1.50 per wear  EX.2 Cute summer dress: $200 Will wear once a week for 6 weeks it’s warm where I am. If I find that many excuses to wear it. So about 6 times this year.   200/6= $33 per wear  After a while, you’ll start seeing prices based on cost per wear. It’s helpful to start yearly, but after a while you’ll be able to gage how long the item will last, then you can really do cost per wear.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone here has the habit of needing to buy a new clothing/set of clothings when attending an occasion/going somewhere?	labels:I was in the habit of thinking I need something new when attending a fancy event like a wedding. I would then donate the items. Nowadays, even before COVID, I wasn't getting invited to much so I don't have this problem anymore. In the future, I plan on wearing the same things again.

text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:i had this problem. i had a lot of cute pants and skirts, but like two shirts. i hated the idea of blouses (never worked a job where i needed to dress anything more than casual so it was ok), and wanted something stylish and practical.   so i got about 15 uniqlo airism long sleeved shirts for the winter in black and a pink-y color, for the summer i got about a million solid color cotton and linen deep v-neck tees from jcrew.   now i don't have to worry about my shirts anymore (which are always boring to me and i have a hard time finding ones that fit properly anyway) and i can focus on fun skirts and really loud patterned pants and my shirts will always match!  i usually pick up a couple trendy shirts each season so i'm not ONLY wearing tees, but this solution has worked really well for me.
text:This was me for the longest time. I loved skirts and jeans (I also looove cardigans), but shopping for tops just didn’t interest me. I ended up stocking up on plain tees during a big sale all in one go — also from JCrew!   Then I got a job in an office that was always warm, and without my cardigans as a “third piece”, my plain tees just didn’t cut it anymore, sigh.	labels:Yes! This is my problem. I also had stocked up on tops that need a 3rd piece. But they do not work on their own due to shape, or cut, or something else. I am not really a t-shirt as part of my outfit person, unless it is a graphic tee. And as I got bored of my cardigan, the more wrong these shirts felt.   I feel like I had the most stand alone tops during peplum wave v1.   I realize this puff sleeve moment is the time I need to stock up. The puff sleeve really works for me!
text:This is what I ended up doing! Basically “elevated” iterations of tshirts with some interesting detail — puff sleeves, peplum, etc. Also fun prints. IMO the brand Madewell does this very well, pretty much all of my “fancier” tops (really just a step up from plain tees) are from there.   Otherwise for boring tshirt days I wear a long necklace.	labels:I don't really shop at Madewell, but maybe I should look more closely.   I feel like t-shirt fit is hard for me, the shapes do not always work very well on me. My challenge is basically all my extra weight shows up below my belly button. I am pear-ish and I have a really short torso/high hips. So some tops that fit perfectly for tucking do not work untucked. And shorter tops need to be actually short, or they just look dumb because they hit in a weird place on my torso. And the shirt that fits my hips and lower waist is not a good fit on top, especially when tucking. So I ended up being super picky about the fit.   At the moment, the tops I am generally happy with are:   * 2 floral button ups * 3 striped shirts  * one cropped sweatshirt (lilac, it is new, but promising) * 2 long sleeve black blouses (but I didn't have the right bottoms, now I am a lot closer! I don't like wearing a fully black outfit so all my black bottoms were a bad fit. Now I have some patterned skirts and an olive one that should work) * 2 short sleeves silk blouses that may be a little too dressy for right now * pink peplum with balloon sleeves (sadly I got it like 2 weeks before quarantine, I envisioned it being super fun with jeans and I hadn't figured out skirts yet, but you know)  What I need are some interesting solid colored short sleeved tops that aren't black, and are in my palette colors, that can work with pants or a skirt.
text:My body type is essentially a skinny pear haha. Also have a super short torso for my height! I find Madewell’s Rhyme top and Park Popover are really great tucked, French tucked, or untucked. Madewell definitely has a muted color palette overall, so depending on your personal wardrobe that may or may not work. I’ve also had good luck with tops from Splendid. If you’re super short torso’d, you might actually want to try Petite sized tops if you haven’t already, even if you’re not technically “petite” in overall height.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I don’t know about everyone but for me there are pieces of jewelry I own that even if not currently trendy I still use and reach for time and time again.  Hoop earrings - not large and not too small - a pair in gold and a pair in silver.   Diamond studs. Pearl studs.  Thin bangle bracelets - again silver and gold.  Thick cuffs. Depending on my outfit I like having the weight of a cuff on my wrist. It can make me feel like Wonder Woman!  I think bold rings are beautiful on my hands. I have a ring my Mom gave me. It’s an oval dome turquoise stone set in gold. It’s an unusual piece and I love it!   I have a good quality watch I only used for special occasions because it clashes with my Fitbit.  I have a very old (60+) gold crucifix with intricate open scroll work and a tiny red ruby in the center. It’s about an inch long and I’ve been searching for the right chain so it lays right about my cleavage. The gold is from Greece so it’s hard to match the color of the gold. I would wear this all the time.	episode_done:True

I swear there's a posture change when I'm wearing ratty underclothes vs nice ones. even if no one sees it, I know it's there.

I've been to the showrooms in Calgary and Ottawa and they can't do measurements nor alterations. Vancouver, one of their "flagship" showroom, is amazing.
text:Wow that’s a big surprise. Would be very interested to check out their flagship showrooms. Have you compared to suit supply? Seems similar but a step up in price would be curious to hear how their showrooms compare.	labels:The decor of the Downtown Vancouver location is not that nice since it is one of their earlier ones, but I found the tailors and staff to be much more knowledgeable than the ones at other location. Their alterations, measurements, and customer service is amazing.   I haven't been to a Suit Supply but one is opening up next year so I'm excited!	episode_done:True

I'm not sure if they have molded around my body, or if my body has grown around them. I will always smile when putting these on, as so much life has been lived in them. I plan on keeping them in good repair until it is literally impossible.  I also smile since I noticed my grandpa got one of the same pattern around the time I did.  I thought that was cool.

text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:I've always loved vintage/historical clothing (Edwardian and 1940s/1950s are my favorite), but it's just not practical where I live (tropical country) to dress like that all the time, so I just add a vintage touch here and there to my outfits. I wear a lot of brooches, midi skirts, broderie anglaise blouses, and lace-up heels and boots. Usually I would mix them with more modern pieces or mix decades (so an Edwardian blouse with a 1940s skirt, for example) so it doesn't look like a costume. Most of my stuff I got from vintage/secondhand stores.	episode_done:True

text:MFA Theme WAYWT: Layering	labels:I love layering so much. My personal favorite obnoxiously layered combo is Henley -> Flannel button down -> Cardigan -> Chore coat.   Not sure how it feel about the fits with vests over a sportscoat/jacket. Especially with the jacket lapel pulled up and over the vest.
text:Hey! The vest over a sportsjacket is me! I too thought it was a bit bold — but I have seen it in some lookbooks before and decided to try it out. Without the lapels rolled over, it looks pretty atrocious, the parts of the jacket that stick out below the vest look misplaced. With the lapels pulled out there’s a little bit of continuity and the vest doesn’t dominate the upper body.   I definitely agree it’s not an everyday look, but for a layering challenge I thought I’d take a leap.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:When did skinny jeans go out of fashion?	labels:skinny jeans haven't been on trend since at least 2015-2016 imo. that's when mom jeans became all the rage.  That being said, skinny jeans are pretty much staples for most people. They go with a lot of outfits and make a lot of looks.   Just because something isn't currently on trend, does not mean it can't be stylish.
text:Skinnies fit inside knee high boots (which I know they aren’t currently on trend either) but I’m in the PNW, and we currently have 12 inches of snow and counting outside, so I do not care what’s in and what’s out. So long as it keeps me  warm and dry and isn’t hideous, it’s good enough.	labels:Wait, knee high boots aren't on trend? If so, what boots are and where do I go to find this out?    I thought there are tons of knee and OTK boots being sold in various retailers that last year or so... and the taller boots mentioned in a lot of casual fAsHun blogs?

text:> "[visually] small muscles = unfit"  It's such a ridiculous opinion steeped in toxic masculinity. And it's why r/fitness is literally just a lifting sub where people unironically ask if their 20 minute walk to the gym counts as cardio. But by that logic they're fitter than endurance cyclists, marathon runners, figure skaters, jockeys, circus artists, and dancers.	labels:> circus artists, and dancers.  Add rock climbers and mountaineers and gymnasts and you've probably got about the functionally fittest group of people and they're rarely "jacked". Toned for sure but many would pass for relatively normally sized people most of the time.

Inevitably the comments use the word "hipster" as an insult when it is so clearly a euphemism for "fag".    The whole thing is so gross and tiring. I guess that can be said for lots of stuff in 2020.

text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:I haven't yet shopped FashionNova/Shein. But have spent plenty of time shopping cheaper brands like Target, Old Navy, NY and Co, Kohls, H&M, Forever21. And honestly I have plenty of things from these places that have held up fine. Especially when you follow wash instructions and avoid the dryer as much as possible.   Even cheaper stores have some gems among the low quality items.  The biggest issue I found is that certain things needed to be replaced like annually or sometimes 2x a year. But on the other hand some stuff will just last forever. I had (have) some decade+ stuff from all of those places that still get worn.  Some were super frequent, some weren't.  Now that I am a bit older - I realize there are a few things I always wear - vetted by years of experience - that is makes sense to spend more on. I'll always use a black cardigan, grey cardigan, and black knit pencil skirt (ponte or similar) year over year - so those can be upgrade picks. But as for dresses? My vibe changes often so I am ok at saving on those and trading them out as I see fit. There are some that live in my closet forever, but really as long as I have a couple of black/white print dress options I am happy!	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 05, 2020	labels:I've gotten to the point that my printmaking and embroidery work are my "part time job", in that it can pay some bills and give me spending money, and allow me to live off of less work for other people.   Typically, i do repair work on people's clothing or sell paper prints and things like installation pieces and back patches, since I never got very far making art to hang up on gallery walls (I have sold a single-digit number of pieces that hung up in a gallery, but orders of magnitude more prints online or in a table show! WTF!)  Recently I'm trying something a little new- getting old, worn out, and/or vintage garments and doing all kinds of overdyes, sashiko, embroidery and quilting to them, mostly by hand. Then I plan to auction off or make a catalogue of these pieces as one-offs to buy. One of the pieces is a 1980s japanese denim kimono that i'm sashiko stitching in the traditional patterned styles, and I'm loving how it's coming out- but it still is scary to put so much time and thread into something that has no garuntee or obligation to sell at all... it feels much riskier somehow, even though all art is risky.

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I agree with you about black tights looking weird with certain outfits...my answer is that I specifically buy my winter skirts/dresses to look good with black tights lol. If it doesn't, then it's just not gonna be worn in the fall/winter, it's too cold where I live for bare legs and I have never really found other colors/patterns of tights that I like the look of. Plus it means that everything also matches with black boots so it just makes things easy.  Also I just want to shout the praises of fleece lined tights from the rooftop. Those and loose fitting dress=ultimate comfort, but looks like you tried. I agree with the other commenter who suggested sizing up in tights, they never fit right when I got my true size, now that I size up I don't feel like I'm constantly adjusting them throughout the day anymore.	episode_done:True

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

It's too much of a risk I could sprain my ankle from how much I walk, and I can't afford another sprain. My office is not business casual or sleek, but a no fuss "just don't wear t-shirts with slogans or anything" type of place. I am decidedly over my ho phase, despite my continued love of the clothes.

text:Alexander Wang accused of a history of sexual harassment - fashion in a year of reckoning?	labels:I work in fashion and feel that the rage and “do the right thing” mentality only lasts as long as everyone sticks together (during a moment like #metoo or the protests after the murder of George Floyd.) A lot of people working in fashion are on a gig-by-gig basis so it’s Everyman for himself as far as success goes. People will turn a blind eye to the wrong doings of companies if it means that they themselves can get another paycheck or take a step up the ladder. It’s not that they themselves are immoral but it’s a hard industry to make it in and you can feel powerless when you’re not at the top. When you are on your own, which is most days, you will lose sight of the bigger picture of an ideal future.  For example this summer I read that FreePeople implemented racist practices within their stores. I added them to a list of companies that I didn’t want to work for (I’m freelance.) A month ago I was offered an opportunity to work with them and even though on principal I didn’t want to, I still considered it because I need a paycheck and the name would be good for me to have on my resume and would lead to more work.  Until their are unions to protect freelancers the fashion industry will remain corrupt. Everyone is afraid of being blacklisted and/or broke.

text:FAQ: Why/ when/ how do you cuff jeans?	labels:**Why:** to make the hemline higher, to provide a visual break between your pants and your shoes (useful if they're a similar colour), or because they are raw denim that will bleed on your shoes excessively if you don't. I suppose some people also cuff in order to flex the selvedge ID, but why condemn yourself to a life of fruitlessly hoping that somebody will notice your selvedge ID?  **How:** idk, you just kind of roll them up. Usually a width of about an inch looks good, but experiment with wider or narrower cuffs as well as with the height of the hem and see what looks good.

text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:A few tips that work for me in thrift stores: - I pick one section and don't feel like i have to check out the entire store.  - I go through racks and touch everything and stop when I touch something that feels like a nice fabric - silk, cashmere, good wool, crisp cotton. This helps me get to the nice stuff when the racks are visually overwhelming. - try on lots of things! Sometimes you fall in love with stuff you didn't expect to.   On websites that are searchable: - have a very specific item in mind or a specific brand you like - narrow the search results by size, brand, color, and fabric - pay attention to the measurements to see if things will fit - don't be afraid to make low offers on sites where you can do that  I find online thrifting very different than in-store thrifting, because online, you can search for all kinds of specific things, where in a store, most of the fun comes from finding something unexpected.
text:Second on feeling fabrics quickly. If I feel a fabric that seems decent I’ll go look at the tags, what materials its comprised of, and what country it was made in. I don’t discriminate necessarily by country, but if it’s a fabric I’m not entirely sold on and it says “Made in China”, I’ll pass. If it’s a great fabric and it says “Made in China”, I’m fine with it.	labels:	episode_done:True

Shoes: Heels up to 3”  Loafers Flats Full vamp shoes  Khaki polo is the most casual outfit you can wear and be business casual while slacks and blazer or dress and blazer is the most formal. Full suit or dress and jacket are business formal.	episode_done:True
text:Feeling self-conscious with changing style around family - anyone relate? Tips?	labels:I eventually transitioned from wearing men's band shirts every single day (seriously I had like 30) to feminine clothing (age 17-19). Generally, I didn't even bother bringing it up to my family and they never commented on it. That said, I still felt totally embarrassed going from tom boy to standard women's clothing.  I'd say if they aren't commenting on it, just do you. If they start acting weird, try opening up a dialogue with them as to why they're having a reaction to your clothing. But it's very normal for people to change styles, especially at your age. Even if they do care, just dress in whatever makes you happy and they'll likely drop it. You'll feel uncomfortable but it's easier over time.	episode_done:True

text:Formula for a put together outfit that works for most aesthetics	labels:having to mentally rank your clothes every time you are about to put on an outfit seems exhausting. I'd also like to point out the person in your example picture is wearing 2 dresses, one sheer one on top of a floral one.  I don't think I would describe that outfit as "restrained" as much as "unique pieces but overall subscribes to the formula of a very normal outfit" in the sense that a dress with socks, a bag, and loafers isn't weird. You could just look at outfits you consider "chic", par them down to their elements, and emulate that.	episode_done:True
text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:I think there might be some correlation. First of all the older we get the less likely we are to try new things and I am sure that affects clothing too. But that does not mean that 40 year olds can't wear trends just because some of their age group don't.   I remember my mother sometimes saying that certain things have a grandma vibe for her or look dated. But for me it was something completely different, because I was not around when those styles were popular the first time (or I was a litle kid) so they don't remind me of that. And it's also obvious that I could not have bought it at that time and just never threw it out, because I am too young. So I guess some pices might look dated on a 40 year old, but not on a 20 year old.  On the other hand, I have no problem with older clothes if they are paired with other pieces that are more trendy. There is no reason to throw away your favorite sweater just because it's older than 5 years. Some pieces are classics.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 19, 2020	labels:So I know this has been a problem since the dawn of online multiplayer, but it really bums me out how disrespectful people are in these online competitive games. I was in a situation where our team had won the match but because I wasn't playing \*as\* optimally as a few of my teammates would have liked, they all started trash talking me over voice comms after the match was over. It's such a bummer because it turns me off from wanting to play, even if I enjoy the game itself.  /end nerd rant

text:FAQ: How do I know my clothes weren't made with slave labour?	labels:While not a direct answer to the question, I'll suggest that for those who are concerned about slave labor in the apparel industry and want to know what they can do to help... reduce, reuse, recycle.   You can reduce demand for new clothing by cutting back on clothing purchases where possible. If something doesn't fit quite right or is damaged, consider taking it to a tailor or mending yourself rather than immediately rushing out to buy a replacement.  When you want or need to buy something, consider buying used clothes instead of new where possible (easier than ever even if you don't have local thrift shops thanks to the rise of the secondhand menswear market on ebay, Grailed, TheRealReal, etc.).  Not that any of the above is a substitute for systemic change, but at least it can help you avoid becoming part of the problem.	episode_done:True

I REALLY do so hope.* I tried ***so*** hard this year. I realized that *layers* are a thing! God, so many *layers*. New colour combinations, mixings textures, jackets! SO MANY OPTIONS. This is my problem, though.. I think I've been going too far with my newly found appreciation for *layers.* I've been **hot**. The sweaty kind. Beads of sweat dripping down my forehead at all times. I've been having to drink twice as much water, as advised by my doctor. My doctor doesn't know why I've been so dehydrated, and honestly, I didn't know why either. Until a few weeks later, I was weak and tired, eye's sunken in with dark purple circles sitting beneath them, bad hand shakes. That bad physical health night, I began to remove my clothing to get ready for bed. I began by peeling off each of my four pairs of socks, (the first layer was a simple ankle sock for padding, the second layer was a sock longer with large frills all around ,the third sock was a sock that went to my upper ankle, shorter than the frilly one and the fourth pair with were giant fluffy socks), it was that moment, when my hand slid against my sweat-dampened foot, why I might be so sick. I looked over to my bed, where my pajama assemble lay. I glanced over at each piece of clothing, a sports bra, an undershirt, a tight long-sleeved, a loose fitting shirt, a big knitted sweater, a shawl, warm leggings, long socks, boxers and pajama pants. **The** ***layers***. That must be it!  I feel better now, I stopped wearing so many layers, but now I have *no idea* what to do with layers! I have no self control. I can't bring myself to just wear **some** layers, once I match an undershirt with a tee-shirt, it's game over.  Santa will be leaving me a book on how to manage my Obsessive Compulsive Disorders. I just can't stop once I get going.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:My normal ways are:  \- Know your measurements - Not foolproof as I found out when ordering a navy blazer online recently but certainly helps you out, especially on places like eBay  \- Ordering multiple sizes when shopping somewhere new - Technically cheating maybe and not always a viable option at high price points but this is generally a good way to see how a particular retailer fits you  \- Stick to retailers whose sizing you trust - This is obviously very limiting but sometimes I just want to try a style and I know the Uniqlo version will fit me well.   &#x200B;  As a side note too, when you try things on from brands, take pictures and save them. Then you can build up a catalogue of the ways retailers fit. This helps when you look back in six months and are tempted to reorder that thing you've been eying because you can't remember why you sent it back.	episode_done:True

Bigger cities/nicer areas you’re more likely to get donations of nicer quality items.   I buy a lot of my shoes from thrift stores, but it often takes a lot of searching before I find ones that aren’t beat up and worn.

text:Handbag conundrum: lesser know (and lesser seen all over the place) or standard luxury designer bags (think the usual Gucci, YSL, LV, etc.)	labels:Definitely buy what makes you happy. The fact that you have looked at the high end, well known brands and came away disappointed indicates that (this season at least), they aren't for you.   To answer your question directly: for me, personally, showing my own style is 1000% more important than showing the status of a luxury brand. Do the two sometimes overlap? Yes, and that's fine. But I don't personally get buying something *just* because it is a certain brand. Who are you trying to impress? What are you conveying with that logo (wow, you're well off? What kind of message is that, on its own?) I just feel like people who are super into labels, not the design or the style or anything else, just come across as kind of immature? The truth is, anyone worth spending much time with isn't overly concerned with what logo your bag has. (Now! I will concede there is a difference between showing off luxury brands and having higher end items, in some circles. Like, there could be some tension if you're hanging out with super millionaire socialites and everything you wear is from TJ Maxx...but in that case, I'd still say its important to focus on personal style first. And knowing about smaller higher end designers, rather than designers you can buy at a mall, is a whole different thing too...)
text:I’ve actually thought a lot about who I’m trying to impress with the logo and the short answer is, I don’t really know. None of my main circle would care either way. The longer answer is I think I’m really trying to impress myself. Maybe show to myself that I’m successful and can afford it? Show myself I worked hard for it and was able to attain it because I wanted it? I don’t know it’s a tough question which is why I struggle on if the bag is worth the cost even if I can afford it.	labels:It's ok if the goal no longer fits. That idea of what success looked like when you started probably doesn't match up with what you now see as success. Not buying something is often just as, if not MORE powerful than buying something. Being able to say, "I could, but I don't want to." is a huge change of perspective.	episode_done:True

text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:I think it’s a must but I don’t think it has to technically be a “LBD”. As long as the color is a dark neutral like navy, burgundy, or charcoal it’s fine and a very subtle pattern or texture is okay too, like an obvious woven or tweed. As for the dress part, it could be a non-little dress or even a jumpsuit. For me, I think it’s a relief to have a go to outfit for certain situations. Here are some imaginary ones for someone your age: your boyfriend/girlfriend’s conservative parents decide to surprise visit them at school and they want to take you both to a nice restaurant for dinner tonight; you need to attend a wake for someone who passed away suddenly; you get a call that there’s a new spot open for a highly competitive summer internship and interviews are only a couple days away. In each of these scenarios, it’s so much easier to know that you have a go-to look that is always appropriate especially since some of these can be stressful without worrying about your outfit.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:Can I just ask why “as few pieces as possible” is the goal and not, say, “every piece in my wardrobe has a clear function or two, and sometimes that function is ‘because I feel like it’ or ‘because sequins make me happy?’”  A wardrobe you like is one that lets you be properly equipped for everything in your life and gives you a nice little aesthetic pick-me-up while you do it.   Before even shopping, I’d say: Look at your life. What do you do at work? What do you do in the community for volunteer work? How’s your social life? Are you outdoorsy? Do you have messy hobbies? Do your hobbies include going out to clubs and live shows and festivals? How often are you running meetings, speaking with elected officials, serving on committees? How often are you attending religious services, religious rites of passage, or big-deal family events like weddings?  Start with taking an inventory of your time and what you need your closet to do to help you be as prepared as possible for how you spend that time. Identify the holes in your working wardrobe, like “I need a good outfit for going to funerals” or “I need a warm weather first-day-at-the-new-job look.” Then you can settle questions of personal style, budget and what items fit more than one situation in your life.
text:TBH I feel as if there’s this underlying feeling of moral superiority that’s rooted in the minimalistic wardrobe (for some people). I’ll keep myself from getting too bashed by saying, yes for some people it’s an economic or environmental choice but for a lot it seems like... Ascetic nomad seeking moral high ground.  It’s similar to the painting community where there’s a fetish for having a minimal paint palette. Wow! You were able to paint that using only four colors?!? Who cares so long as the final product looks good??	labels:I think that can definitely be an element on this sub and elsewhere in fashion, but at the same time, this feels unfair to OP.  OP didn't shame anyone, they just asked advice.  We don't know the reasons they're looking for a smaller wardrobe, but thats up to OP and its a valid question to ask without being shamed - just as no one should jump to conclusions or shame you if you came on here looking for advice on maximalism, being a collector, or just having fun.	episode_done:True

text:So uh, what’s the trends for fall this year?	labels:This might be totally wrong but I have a feeling that face masks are gonna be big this season.
text:I'm hoping they stick around as being acceptable to wear if you're feeling under weather like they do in Asia!  I'm happy there's so many design options too.  (Way back in January before the pandemic went wild I wore a paper mask to my office since I still had a bit of cough and people were weirded out.  Looks like for once I got ahead of the game...)	labels:I’m also hoping they stick around! I would love to be able to wear one when I’m sick in the future, and not be judged.

text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession). I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession 🤣

text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:My makeup tends to stay the same unless it’s for a formal occasion and even then, that usually just means I use an eyeshadow that’s even sparklier than usual and go just a little heavier on the blush. I tend to stick to light, shimmery, pink-champagne-white tones for shadow and generally rock a nude lip unless I’m feeling spicy. I have a couple good berry lips and some deep reds.	episode_done:True

text:From 'Doctor Who' to 'Outlander': How Fans Craft Reverse Engineer Knits	labels:Thanks for sharing this article! I've been knitting for over 20 years, and I would love to try my hand at some replica design, I just have to get through more of my queue and stash first.   I'm always excited when pop culture knits inspire more people to get into knitting. I've found taking this step to make my own socks and accessories to be eye opening about the value of garments and clothing. And as one of the interviewed knitters said, it is very fun to chose different fibers and yarn weights to make exactly what you want in the project.
text:> just gotta get through more of my stash and queue first.  Narrator: "They were never able to do so."  But forreal, I just cast on my first self designed sweater. I've been knitting for a year, but crocheting and sewing for a decade. Slow fashion is such a rabbit hole because before you know it you're trying to talk yourself out of learning to spin, cause maybe when you buy a house you could get a sheep? Maybe some angora rabbits?! But it's such a cool interest. As a young person I'm really happy that it's becoming a mainstream thing!  It gives me hope.	labels:Yep...very accurate.  I have successfully not purchased yarn for myself for 458 days now (not like I'm counting), so I might be able to reduce the stash a bit. But more than likely I'll cave here in the next six months while I still have 40k yards to work through.   The rabbit hole of slow, self-made fashion goes deep. The yarn, the yarn dyeing, the desire for an angora rabbit, the realization that you dont like drop spinning, but thinking maybe you'd like it on a spinning wheel...	episode_done:True

I never wish to be pigeon holed and one way I can help avoid such seems to never be notable in the same way - some days I have fashion forward eccenteic wear, other days it business formal with expensive jewelry, other days its "thot" fashion with big hoops and short shirts. There's power in not being predictable and if Im going to be judged regardless, I want to make it hard for them.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: What is the difference between off the rack (OTR), made to measure (MTM) and Bespoke?	labels:/u/blackstrider has a great TL;DR but I'll add a bit more detail to MTM and Bespoke.  MTM: The pattern/style is generally pretty fixed, often there aren't fittings, and you make adjustments by changing standard measurements like "I want to add 0.5" to the leg opening". Pretty flexible format but I find it takes a couple of garments to really figure things out which can be tough.  Bespoke: Often a pattern is created for *you*, there are multiple fittings (in-person). This is where you can get really specialized tailoring looking at the pitch of you arms, how much you round your shoulders, etc. Bespoke tailors/cordwainers will also have styles that they specialize in so don't go to a tailor that specializes in structured "English drape" if you're looking for a casual unlined jacket or something.
text:The pattern is fixed, but the style... isn't, it just isn't. Maybe there are some style options you don't have with some MTM shops, but quite a few give you almost all the style options you could want.  You don't have fittings, but, to be fair, you have remakes, and that's not all that different.	labels:I think we're just off a bit semantically. OTR/MTM/Bespoke can vary a lot depending on who's doing it. Especially with MTM. You're right that most MTM shops will let you customize quite a bit of things and have lots of options. But there are some that don't.   If a company for example doesn't offer ghurka pants then you can't MTM that into the pattern. There can also be limits on what measurements you can change/adjust.
text:Right, I'm not saying the styling options are infinite. I just don't think it's right to say that styles are "fixed." I mean, even the range of fit options you have available to you would make for a bunch of differnt styles. But I mean... Every MTM suit shop I've been at, and every online service I've looked through. lets you pick SB/DB, lapel style, buttons, pleats, side adjusters... That's the low end, and that's a lot of styling details. And a lot of MTM shops *will* do Ghurkas, if you ask nicely.	labels:	episode_done:True

My first purchases in 2021 were leggings, joggers, new sports bras/bralettes, and soft t-shirts. We were unsure for a while at my office how long we'd be working from home, but it looks like it's going to be through at least early summer, so I wanted to beef up my lounge wardrobe since I've basically been rotating through 2 pairs of pj pants and a bunch of ratty 10-year-old t-shirts.	episode_done:True

For brunch dates with a bateau neck tee that fits like a second skin, and for evenings with a low backed long sleeved version of the same.

The icy blue and lime green tones really pop against my skin too, and its just such a vivid contrast to the more adult, classic style I've been trying to force myself into in the last few years. ~~Plus low-rise jeans make my butt look amazing~~  Essentially, it's all of the clothes I remember loving as a child, as well as what I wanted to emulate from my cool older cousins!	episode_done:True

text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:Personally I’m still somewhat new too this but I’ve had many different fashion phases and have done many different looks throughout my three years of personal fashion experimentation. I feel the biggest thing that’s helped me is sticking to a sort of color scheme.    It’s definitely not for everyone necessarily but it’s helped a lot as I have grown my wardrobe, slowly adding more colors. It makes things very easy to match. I started with three colors ( I know that’s extremely little however) now I’m up to six!  I feel accessories ( not just jewelry necessarily but belts, hats , bags etc. ) are also very important to obtaining a certain look.   I feel organizing ones closet can also really help. There’s no specific way I’d necessarily recommend I organize mine by grouping items article then group them by color , as I mentioned color and matching things is very important to my personal style so that’s what makes sense for me.   Hope this could help some! I’m new at this too as I mentioned lol!

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 16, 2020	labels:I'm trying to find a nice warm jacket/coat to wear that will keep me comfortable below freezing and the wind doesn't cut through. It gets below 32F here (US South East) often, even down into the 20s & teens.  My clothing currently consists of blue jeans, chinos, and some high top black & white converses. Would love something I could wear with both. I've looked into bomber jackets and pea coats. Not sure what all else I should look into. I know I like fitted clothing rather than bulky. My family keeps suggesting the big canvas carhartt jackets, but they are a bit big and bulky to be wearing with chinos on my way to work.  As far as price goes, I'm not sure what decent jackets/coats (or any clothing for that matter) go for. I'd like to stay under $100 though, but would go a little more for the perfect jacket that would last me a long time.  Any advice would be very appreciated!	episode_done:True
text:Chore Coat Inspo Album	labels:What was that super popular blue one everyone was obsessed with about 5 years ago? I think it was more of a cloth material than canvas.	episode_done:True
text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:I think start by looking at pictures online on Pinterest or Instagram of styles you find aesthetically pleasing and create a little dashboard with outfits that catch your eye. You can also think about some of your favourite actors or singers that wear outfits you like and try to save the pictures you find. After that i would go window-shopping online on websites that fit your budget and look around trying to find pieces similar to any outfits you saw. fyi; i would browse on a website first and then go to the actual store to try out what you saw online, it gives you an idea of what you’re looking for.  I think imitation is the easiest way to start finding your style. Once your comfortable in a type of style you can start experimenting with it and picking more personalized pieces. Good luck :)

text:Kibbe System and Body Inclusivity	labels:I have negative associations with it because 99% of the time "red pill women" (or other women with deep issues) are the ones saying good things about it.  When I hear "Kibbe" I immediately think "red pill".
text:I had no idea it was a red pill thing, that's so off-putting. I wonder what attracts them to it specifically?	labels:As someone who was raised in a conservative religious household and who fully bought into the red pill women BS in my much younger years, u/PartyPorpoise hit the nail on the head. And to add to that, fashion for the red pill women isn't about personality, individuality or art or anything avant-garde, it's about looking "hot" as defined by society at large (aka men). The Kibbe system gives a sense of right/good/attractive vs wrong/bad/ugly in fashion. It's about being told how to dress (something I got a lot of from church) rather than discovering one's style for oneself.	episode_done:True

So many blogs are exactly the same, it's like they're all just copying each other. So many posts are just ads. I don't mean they *have* ads, I mean the entire post is just an ad for something.  I can only assume they've witnessed other influencers' success and are trying to replicate that for themselves. They don't understand most OG influencers worked for years to add value and build a following before they ever saw a cent. They're trying to skip to the end by following proven formulas and packing their content with as many ads as possible. That's my theory, anyways.	episode_done:True

I'd feel goofy in a pair of wide-leg ankle-cut pants and a Carhartt jacket, but I also realize that black skinny jeans and plaid button-ups are past their prime.  So what's a man my age to do?  I've been working on finding a balance lately, but it's not as clear-cut as I'd hoped.
text:I'm also in my 30ies. Not getting stuck in one particular style is not about making radical changes every few years, it's just incrementally growing your wardrobe with you.

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:The company already made money off of the original purchase of the shirt, so you buying second hand doesn’t really benefit them in any way. If you really want the item, buying it second hand is probably the most ethical choice you can make. If someone asks where the piece is from, just say you don’t know so they won’t be tempted to buy from the brand lol
text:I partially agree with you. But the company still benefit from second hand purchases.   The second hand price is based on supply/demand, buying the unethical brand even second hand shows demand and increase public perception of the brand then prices go up. That’s why some brands are still more expensive than others even in thrift store.  Yet if you like an unethical brand, like you said, buying second hand is better.	labels:It depends on where you shop. Your local charity thrift shop is not giving a kickback to the first buyer, but a consignment store is.
text:No matter where people buy, buying a certain product increases its demand which in turn increases the price and perception of the product.  So even if the shops don’t give brands any money, it stills benefits them overall through better perception and free branding.	labels:I agree with this, and think reformation is a great example on Poshmark. So many people are buying from reformation with immediate intentions of reselling it at full price. I feel like buying from their brand secondhand would still be supporting them in this case.	episode_done:True

text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:Honestly, to me it sounds like you might find alot of things uncomfortable because they don't fit properly.  Any item of clothing can be comfortable if it fits your body properly.  This is why rich people get things tailored.  I'm a grad student so I can't afford that, but I just make an effort not to buy things that don't fit, and occasionally I get things tailored.  It's hard though, most cheap brands that I can afford don't sell clothes that fit well so it's an effort.	episode_done:True

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom didn’t care about fashion until she started watching What Not to Wear on tlc. Then she threw out all her embroidered sweatshirts and appliqué jeans and got some more stylish clothes. She maintained this for a few years and now that she’s in her late 60s, she wears what makes her happy- embroidered sweatshirts and appliqué jeans.   I don’t wish she taught me anything but I think if she kept a pulse on trends it would’ve saved me from some teasing in middle school. But, on the flip side, is it fun to fit in? Middle school sucks regardless.

text:Anyone here has the habit of needing to buy a new clothing/set of clothings when attending an occasion/going somewhere?	labels:I did this when I was younger. And it caused a lot of closet clutter. So I decided to make a few rules for myself: 1. Limit the new outfit occasions to a small number of occasions. (Like my birthday! Or maybe holiday season).  2. Make myself wear said item 3 additional times during the year.  For all of the next occasions.  Like my b-day dress will be the wedding outfit. And going out outfit. Any for going to a play. And maybe even work depending on what I decide to get.	episode_done:True
text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I got my first fancy bag after calling off my wedding lol I figured it cost around the same amount as the dress I wouldn’t ever wear so why not? The woman at the LV store thought I was on drugs ... “are you celebrating something?” And I’m like as a matter of fact, yes, yes I am. I just lost a ton of money on a wedding but I dodged a bullet and left that POS. All she said was “well you can always make more money” anyway, I’m getting a Chanel bag for my next milestone birthday. Not sure which one but it’s gonna happen soon.

text:Reliable brands to buy in South America - Americans your opinions please!	labels:/u/bestmaokaina might be able to help you.  Personally, I think Tommy, Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss, and some lines from Armani are all low-end brands that bank on their names and established supply chains and distribution networks to get attention for cheaply made, uninspired clothing. Some Armani clothing is better, but it's all drastically overpriced. Lauren Ralph Lauren and some Polo Ralph Lauren are the same; some Polo Ralph Lauren is pretty good, but you won't find it in a Macy's or equivalent. The really good Ralph Lauren clothing is mostly only sold in Ralph Lauren stores.  Lacose is fine. Nothing too special, but not trash.  Ermenegildo Zegna is quite good. Better than Z Zegna, not as good as zegna couture, pretty nice in general.

text:The Future is Made to Measure	labels:For some reason, I thought Trunk Tailors was much more expensive.  Yeah, MTM is one of thos places where... although machines not ever really overtake the hand, efficiency from machines is eventually going to complement handwork to make something very good very cost-efficient, and then Bespoke and RTW will both be struggling to compete.
text:I think MTM is more of a long-term threat to bespoke rather than RTW. The technological improvements, which will theoretically make it possible for software to draft a pattern indistinguishable from one drawn up by a human, could eventually make it very difficult for bespoke makers to compete on fit. The market could shrink to basically just the guys who want to be able to say they bought bespoke for sentimental reasons.  RTW will likely always exist just because it’s cheaper and easier to mass produce clothes in standardized sizing. Maybe the higher-end RTW market shrinks, but  at the bottom I don’t see a future where Zara only stocks M2M suits ordered online in advance.	labels:This article was about bespoke, but there are a lot of businesses taking mtm from the other angle -- not only making it cheaper, but making it such a cheap marketing hack, using it to reduce dead stock  using it to reduce return rates... As it gets better, it's going to get more efficient through multiple dimensions and eventually, rtw is going to feel some pain too.	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:Hmm I don't set money aside for clothes specifically. I have a general budget divided into monthly bills, savings, food, and other expenses. Clothes usually fall under "other expenses", unless it would be a huge purchase that I'd have to save up for specifically - but that rarely happens).  I only buy clothes like 3-4 times a year, usually to replace old stuff, or if my wardrobe needs some extra something, or if I find a really nice item that I'll definitely wear a lot. I know what sort of styles, colors, fabrics etc I tend to go for. I avoid impulse purchases, I already have enough stuff sitting around because I have nothing to match it with or nowhere to wear it lmao	episode_done:True

text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:The most basic thing, fundamental, objective thing is if it uncomfortable or impedes your movements. Some of this you only figure out when you wear things particularly if they are too loose (too tight you usually notice faster), like tops or dresses too big their neckline might move a bit and look askew, or you step on the hem of skirts or dresses at you climb stairs. Skirts too tight might ride up, pants too tight might dig and create camel toe or the zipper give way and open...  For other things, say pant or skirt length it might be a matter of aesthetics, 5 or 10 cm lower or higher..  Probably the most important point for things to fit is the shoulders and armpits, so it does not impede movement and because outerwear, tops, etc, hangs literally from there. If fitted, the seam should be at the edge of your shoulder blade naturally.  Not everything can be altered to fit right. There might not be enough fabric for that, or it might just a design which was cut for different proportions than yours. Tailoring can do subtle tweaks, on woven fabrics (knits are harder, way harder), but the first and most important step of getting clothes which fit well is REJECTING things, lots of things, most things, almost all things. Trying many many things, being analytical so you can learn stuff (if it looks like that chances are it will loook  this other thing on my body, Brand X pants always fit me right and Brand Y pants never).
text:A note on knits--if it's 100% wool and it isn't washable, you can actually sew it up and cut (similar to a method called steeking, which is used to create sleeves in faire isle sweaters), fold the inner seams over and sew. The wool will felt to itself after a handwashing or two and the sewing keeps it together well because of the pull the woll fibers have on one another. It can be scary to try, but with practice it can really change how a sweater fits and is great. I've done it on sweaters I've handknit myself in particular, but wanted to mention it here in case anyone is thinking about wool items going into the colder months!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:I agree with the comments that suggested thinking about how often you’ll wear it, more so than the price. I used to prioritize price, but ended up with low quality clothes that just didn’t last. Now i find myself passing on some items even if they’re really cheap, just because it seems like it won’t last. I try to pick clothes by their fabric composition and pay attention to the details (stitching, closures, etc). For jeans I look for as high % cotton as possible. I like linen, rayon, modal and cotton for other pieces. I usually avoid nylon-y and thin, fast-fashion pieces. Then I think about whether that store usually has sales, if so, I wait. I very rarely get anything full price because there’s always some sale!   I’m usually willing to spend more on “core” pieces that I’ll wear all the time, like a coat, jeans, or work pants/shoes. For statement pieces or trendy shirts I usually wouldn’t spend that much. I think it just depends on how many ways you can style that item.  As for a&f and hollister - I have personally found really great quality clothes there. For a&f i love their linen pieces, jeans, pants and sweaters. They also have awesome sales. As an example, in september i got 2 sweaters for like 15 each, jeans for 40, and pants for 20ish from there, all really good quality, and I wear them often. For hollister, it can be hit or miss since it’s more casual, but I have blouses and jackets from there from several years ago still look new, but they weren’t expensive. Sorry for ranting lol!	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:A simple solid 2-button suit (a darker shade of grey or navy), simple shirt (white or blue), a simple tie (no in your face colors or patterns), and a simple pair of shoes (black or brown) will cover 99% of formal events. Most people won't notice the fit of a suit so long as it's not overly large/slim, but people notice wrinkles so make sure to press your shirt. A well tied tie (tight knot and dimple) also go a long way.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:I think that an under-discussed part of picking out a first suit for these types of things is getting out and trying them on before you buy. Being comfortable in a suit, even if it’s cheaper or in a less fashionable cut, is more important in interview settings than the eye to detail and quality that we normally discuss on here. A suit that fits in the shoulders, in a neutral color like navy or charcoal, that you know fits because you were able to try it on is way more important to your success than ordering something online that might be objectively better. Interviewers are looking for you to meet their minimum standard of professionalism, not for you to wow with with sartorial taste. Source: had a lot of interviews in college and law school.
text:I completely agree with this. I would add that suits should always be fitted for you by a tailor. It can make a cheap suit look like a million dollars.  I would just add that you should also be aware of the level of formality at your workplace. I work in diplomacy and anything trendy is a no-no.	labels:	episode_done:True

Ordered a NWT jacket from a seller and it came absolutely doused in Febreze and perfume. She'd also sold it to someone else before and had mislabeled the size, so presumably that person also received and returned the item. Tried to return it because it's not in NWT condition (New with Defects at best, but that's more of an eBay designation) and got denied by Poshmark.   A big RIP. I have contact dermatitis and patch tested positive for every fragrance they tested, so... dope. I'll open a chargeback but will probably get banned by Posh for it.

text:My incomplete guide for buying less in 2021	labels:Nice guide. Maybe for the inspiration board to also add in a visual inventory. I easily forget what I have already which feeds into temptation. Color scheme. What else feeds temptations? Trends and scared of not seeing it again. I would say if you love a piece immediately then buy it but don't take tag off. Try it out in real life first.  Also tastes change. Like I went from utility pants to wearing and liking tight jeans then back to wanting more room except I don't have any. So having an open minded/ wardrobe with pieces to take you out of comfort zone, not too far, wouldn't hurt.	episode_done:True

I stopped exercising (yoga pants and hoodies are so forgiving. Not to mention sports bras and cotton undies rather than sexy lingerie that made me stand up a little bit straighter and smile that secret smile to myself. )  I can be chubbier than I'd like right now, and still have nice style that makes me feel sexy and attractive and good about how I present myself.  I can wear cute shoes and accessorize again, even if I have a mask that covers my smile.   I can also take care of myself and enjoy exercise and healthy foods, and get to a place where I feel better about my body in a swimsuit.

Cheaper sweaters are noticeably thinner (both the threads and the sweater itself), which don't keep you as warm and don't last as long.   The good news is that there are some great options for getting high quality sweaters at low prices if you're willing to shop secondhand. For $150 you can find a gently used sweaters from Ines Meain and IMO that's a much better purchase than most of the cotton and fine merino wool sweaters listed in this article.

Your wardrobe is not more interesting because your white tee is better than another white tee, and by the time you've found the 'perfect' piece either the prevailing trend or your own preferences will probably have changed.  'Perfect tee' threads are usually highly-upvoted, but the answers have drawn from the same pool for the last goddamn decade:  - *Vintage/workwear (generally heavier, boxier, shorter):* 3sixteen, Buzz Rickson's, Lady White Co. - *Streetwear (generally lighter, slimmer, longer):* Reigning Champ, wings + horns, John Elliott - *"Normal" (somewhere in the middle)*: Naked & Famous, Arket, American Apparel when they still existed - *Edgy goth shit:* Rick Owens mainline for lighter and DRKSHDW for heavier, Kazuyuki Kumagai Attachment, Voidthebrand when they still existed - *Budget*: Muji, Uniqlo, Everlane, Bella+Canvas, etc., but no one really cares  It's functionally a solved question. You can pick one from the applicable list for your style, and it'll be *fine.*

We have allowed this thread because the discussion of dressing for the male gaze is one that is still relevant in 2020, but we want to be absolutely clear that the mod team finds the views expressed in this article to be out of touch with the current era and demeaning to women.
text:And yeah, no, I dress primarily for myself and then it's a distant second for pretty much anyone but hetero men.

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I wear a lot of dresses, skirts, and wide-leg flowy pants during the summer. I almost never wear shorts because I've always hated them. Breathable fabrics are important especially with humidity; you'll be a lot hotter in polyester than in cotton. Also thigh chafing is a thing, so I like to alternate between days I wear a skirt and days I wear loose pants.   I do tend to carry a lightweight top layer for air conditioned buildings. But it doesn't need to be something super warm; mesh or a loose weave is fine. I tend to like that layer to be something that won't wrinkle so I can toss it in my purse.	episode_done:True

text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:Planed obsolescence comes in to play. If the trend is over for the next season why make it last a year?  and adding to that is the cost of investment to change trends is higher for women with more possibilities with sizes and lot's of  inventory for each size. So the "Value"is in the changing for companys because it increases consumption but men don't have that.  For them if it falls apart or feels cheap they don't buy it and a shirt can last every season XD. So if it falls apart after a couple of months they are more likely to change brand for something of higher quality.  >>  >The lack of consumption and brand loyalty can lead to increase in quality with lack of differences and change cutting cost.	episode_done:True

text:Future of fibers?	labels:Personally I don’t find it very difficult or expensive to shop for clothing made with natural fibers — if anything it’s gotten even easier to do so with online shopping and websites showing fiber content right in the product description. I don’t have to seek out brands that specialize in natural materials either — my clothing is mostly from Madewell, which doesn’t really market itself as being all that environmentally conscious or sustainable, and is definitely not a high end brand, but they have tons of options for clothing made of cotton, silk, etc.   I will say it’s gotten harder to find sweaters made of 100% wool over the years, however. I have several wool sweaters from mall brands that I bought just a few years ago. I gained some weight since then and have been looking for replacements from the same exact brands and it seems like they don’t even bother with 100% wool anymore, all of their sweaters are now made with acrylic, nylon, polyester, etc. That’s the only natural fiber that I feel has all but disappeared from the mainstream for some reason.   I will also add that I don’t think man made fibers are necessarily “cheap”, either. We’ve come a long way from man made materials of the 80s and 90s. When I think of man made fibers of today, I think of technical clothing and gear such as outdoor or sportswear. Patagonia for example is the poster child for environmentally friendly brands, but most of their clothing is made from man made materials, and their products are far from cheap. Partly because it performs better for its purpose, and partly because it’s supposed last a lifetime.  Which leads me to my last thought — IMO man made materials aren’t necessarily bad for the environment. It’s really our habits that are bad, and the industries that cater to these habits. If we all bought a few items of clothing that were all man made and lasted our lifetime, that is arguably *more* environmentally friendly than if we were constantly buying and throwing away natural fibered clothing.
text:I think there's a very good reason for 100% wool sweaters being harder to find: wool is a very weak fiber, difficult to care for, and itchy. Cutting it with other fibers makes clothing that is more wearable, increases longevity, and minimizes all those negatives.	labels:I'm allergic to every type of animal fibre I've ever tried to wear (hello hives) so the rise in actually warm man made fibres is fantastic for me personally	episode_done:True
text:advice on how to stop buying clothes I don't need?	labels:Stick it in your cart then close the tab. Come back to it if you’re still thinking about it a few days later. Lots of things I’ve wanted I end up not getting once I put some time between finding it and actually buying it.

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:The company already made money off of the original purchase of the shirt, so you buying second hand doesn’t really benefit them in any way. If you really want the item, buying it second hand is probably the most ethical choice you can make. If someone asks where the piece is from, just say you don’t know so they won’t be tempted to buy from the brand lol
text:But the second question is where to buy second hand from? For example near me we have the Salvation Army and a church thrift shop. I used to live next to a giant Salvation Army donation center and loved it, but after learning about their philosophy and some of the shady things they’ve done I no longer feel like I can ethically support them! Then supporting the local church thrift is also problematic given their stances on social issues! When I lived in California I was able to find some thrift stores that actually gave to causes I support (out of the closet etc) but now that I’m in the Midwest there aren’t any of these! I just want like a thrift store that donates to something like education or food banks without the religious/social aspect.	labels:In my part of Canada, basically the only two thrift stores are Value Village (for-profit company which donates a portion of its proceeds to a diabetes charity), and Goodwill By Salvation Army (non profit/charity I believe? With a history of discrimination against LGBT community and poor treatment of workers with disabilities)   The most common reaction I get, when people say "where did you get that sweater" and I say "Value Village", is  "ewwww, didn't you know that's a for profit company! You're wasting your time buying used, you're so foolish thinking you're a good person when you're just supporting some *corporation*, that's so gross, you're just as bad as me so don't pat yourself on the back for shopping there, you capitalist!"   And like... Really?? Wtf is up with that response? I'd rather support a for-profit used clothing store, than a for-profit new clothing store like Walmart or Forever 21. Isn't doing something better than doing nothing? Or, as the saying goes," don't let perfection be the enemy of good?"    (especially when my only alternative to value village is... Pretty much the last charity I'd want my money going to)	episode_done:True

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting our 'Finding A Style and Building A Wardrobe' guide	labels:one thing i noticed in my fashion journey is the effect that location has on style, and to be aware of it. is it something you like, or dislike?  i went to college in the north east in the late 2000s and it was all prep all the time. i was in academia at the time, and fully embraced prep into my life, even though it felt like a facade.  then i moved to NYC and  i stuck out like a sore thumb lol. slowly, and without realizing it over the course of a couple years, my style went from typical new england prep with lots of fake pearls and plaid and corduroy and navy and JKP lusting, to all black all the time city girl.  i LOVE my style now, it just feels very "me" and can't ever imagine wearing a navy blazer again in my life. but if i was to move to the north east again, or down south or somewhere else with a different local aesthetic i would pay a lot more attention to my buying choices to make sure i   maintain my style in a way that i like, and if i ever decide to change it up to make it a conscious decision. it would have saved me a lot of money during that transition period when i had no cohesive items to wear together.  a navy wool blazer from jack wills doesn't really go with leather shorts!  &#x200B;  \[edit\] i'm not sure how it would be worked into the guide, though. maybe when talking about climate which heavily affects people's fashion choices and is also very regional, regional (even hyperlocal, different neighborhoods in NYC dress very differently) style trends could also be mentioned?   it would have been helpful for me when moving to a new city to have had that seed planted in my head. if you're freshly moved or have been living in a place for a while and want a new style, look at the people around you! they'll probably be wearing clothes that can be found locally, and if you like how people dress it's a great way to get inspiration on what's current in that area.   it's also great because if you DON"T like how people are dressing you can consciously make the decision to avoid those choices.
text:This is such a good point and I think it's the reason I struggle with my style. I live in a working class rural area, and the fashion is more geared towards sportswear.

text:General Discussion - January 16, 2021	labels:A dark and surreal week for me:     Accidentally went to the wrong floor for a meeting this week and stumbled across a sweatshop right here in beautiful New York, New York (the city so nice they named it the big apple), so this is your friendly reminder that "made in the USA" doesn't necessarily mean shit when it comes to ethically made clothing. Reported it to the DoL but I don't expect them to do anything about it.     In unrelated but equally bleak personal fashion news, In my search for some VERY obscure soviet-Czech trainers I accidentally stumbled across a sketchy forum of people selling battle-worn combat uniforms, complete with burns, bullet holes and blood stains. It's always fun to imagine you're living in a Blue Ant book until you actually start living in a blue ant book and life becomes very depressing! The first rule of the forum is you are not allowed to ask how these things were sourced.     Lastly the embroidery studio i work at was contacted for a large order of Rhodesian flag patches. I contacted the client to see if it was for a film or something and he was very cagey about their purpose, so I cancelled the order and refunded his deposit, which lead to me getting chewed out by my boss, who is apparently fine with making White Nationalist memorabilia if it's obscure enough to not get him in any trouble.

I’ll put on something that’s risky or different from my usual fits and think it looks awful.

I was going to return it, when he saw me trying it on and told me to pick a restaurant. I still don’t love the dress on, but he swears it looks amazing on me. (And he does not shy away from expressing negative opinions).   I’m just saying, sometimes we see what we expect to see.

There's nothing inherently wrong with sharing/asking for your partner's opinion about your style or wanting them to like how you dress, but it has to be something that you've both agreed you enjoy, not just one person offering unsolicited opinions. It also helps if they actually know what they're talking about.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:When I was in university I was super into the 1950s look. My wardrobe had been a mix of vintage finds from specialized shops, eBay & Etsy, items from vintage reproduction stores, and things from regular stores (H&M, Zara) that had a vintage flair. I never went 100% as it felt too much like a costume to me, but wore a lot of day dresses, circle skirts, button up short sleeve blouses, etc. Paired with more modern items like ballerina flats or high waisted skinny jeans. I also frequently wore red lipstick and either slept with rollers or used hot rollers in the morning to get retro curls.  This was 2012-2014 in western Canada and the reaction was pretty mixed - some students made fun of me and I got a bit of a reputation on campus for being a weirdo, and I got a lot of stares when out in public. That said, I also got some really positive reactions (mostly from women). I eventually moved on from this look but still LOVE vintage items. I have a lot of vintage lingerie and a still have a few of my vintage dresses, tops, and pieces of jewelry. I also recently bought this gorgeous linen blouse from the 1800s at a flea market in Paris that gives me Shakespeare vibes - I like to wear it with distressed jeans and ballet flats. I want to try to find more pieces like that as I think paired with the right items it can look quite modern.	episode_done:True

It's a little tedious, seeing as you will be hauling around a box for years, but if you take the approach of a museum curator, the old pieces can resemble pictures in a photo album, as opposed to clothing to be worn.

text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:To add onto the rest of the great advice in this thread, following the color trends can be helpful in seeing how color looks on others and how you can apply them to yourself. I follow some accounts that specifically photograph folks during fashion week in various locales, and there's so much vibrancy that occurs there with colors that you might not expect to fit together. It helps to have these (kind of) practical examples in mind before you go on blowing money on colorful goods.  I've never actually done a color analysis, personally, but intuitively over time you will get a sense for what flatters you. You can even try holding random household items like Clorox wipes (lol) or notebooks up to your face or skin to see if that color would work as an actual item on you, preferably in good natural lighting where it won't distort the tones so much. I also like to accessorize with one small bright thing at a time, like bags, belts, scarves, or jewelry. Another way to do this is with wearing nail polish, either different colors on your nails all at once or specific parts of a palette to see if that combination is flattering with your skin tone.	episode_done:True

text:Saturday Vibe Check - January 03, 2021	labels:I watched a couple of the new restorations of Wong Kar Wai's work. Really, really, really made me miss the feeling of seeing truly special films inside a theater.
text:I love Wong Kar Wai! One of the few directors that really makes me feel in a unique way, I've made everyone close to me watch fallen angels at least twice.. I don't know if you're a fan of the criterion collection but they just released a box set of his work! What were the new restorations?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:New Year, New Balance	labels:I had two pairs of New Balance made in England’s for a few years, around the time the brand started being cool again but long before the current resurgence - absolutely perfect shoes, great value for the miles and miles I put into them. Then they wore out and I tried Nike, Jordan and Adidas, kind of fancying a change, with typical mixed results. Why I didn’t just follow my experience I don’t know.  So I used Christmas as an excuse to get a fresh pair, can’t wait.	episode_done:True
text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:You see this a ton in the world of lingerie, maybe even more so than clothing.  I think it’s impossible for a designer to truly say they own a design element, so dupes and items that have been inspired by other designs are fine by me. If design houses are often ‘inspired’ by smaller indie labels anyway. They bring to trend to mainstream, and it filters down.   I don’t think the example you mentioned would hurt Sezane. The knockoffs allow more people to wear the trend who couldn’t afford ‘the original’ and seeing the design become really popular and trendy would probably make more people want to purchase it. The people who tend to shop from sezane or other higher priced retailers aren’t likely to buy knockoffs because they want higher quality.   The one thing I think is wrong is people selling fakes, trying to pass it off as a genuine designer item. This could either be a high quality dupe of a high end designer, or cheap amazon listings using a photo of the garment they’re copying, when the reality is they’re selling you something much worse. Unfortunately this kind of thing is becoming rampant as if you can shut down one retailer, they just make a new amazon/Ali express store and start again.	episode_done:True

text:Thoughts then and now?	labels:I know that for me and some people I’ve talked to, the concern is that people might interpret you as vain, flamboyant, or obnoxiously rich. Obviously being rich isn’t a bad thing, but pushing it in people’s faces is.  At my last office when I wore nice heels and cardigans I’d get attitude from other women basically saying they were more evolved or had more important things to do in their lives so they didn’t bother with heels, or implying that I was anti feminist. Some people made comments about my “not understanding challenges, etc”. I’d also get extra attention from men which is great, but not at work. To be clear I’m not even talking about my usual over the top style. I’m talking about office friendly Zara and Uniqlo with the pieces put together in a thought out way. It was a toxic office but, some just are.  A lot of people paint dressing down as something you do for comfort because you’re practical, hardworking, have important things to do, more than your appearance, modern, not shallow, etc so sometimes the criticism is that you’re not those things if you like to dress up and that can be really damaging.  In college I dressed nicely to class for a few semesters. It was a small school and when I had difficulty in a subject, it was heavily implied that I was having trouble because I was too focused on my appearances (I wasn’t. I just was thoughtful in my purchases and find dresses more comfy). Started wearing leggings and jeans and T-shirt’s and was taken more seriously when I said I was working hard.  When I went to the doctor dressed up they wouldn’t take my symptoms as seriously as when I dressed down.  It’s stupid and judgey and goes to show how many people don’t know anything about clothes. (Ie. It takes no effort to dress well if you’re thoughtful in buying them) but it’s a sentiment that exists in some places and it’s challenging to deal with.
text:I generally feel that in certain situations people should not consider others dressing up or dressing down, instead perhaps they are just dressed however they feel comfortable. I definitely feel more productive and focused when I wear clothes I consider nice, It’s not about attention or showing off at all. It’s just routine. Thanks for the reply.	labels:Same. If I wear trousers I feel uncomfortable and keep adjusting all day. I just feel more comfortable and myself in the “fancy” clothes I wear which makes it easier to work and get stuff done. To everyone their own and it’s just habit.	episode_done:True
text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I would upgrade some of what I already own and wear a lot to better quality versions, and save some to spend on good makeup.  Younger me might not have found that as exciting as buying a statement piece or two, but older me knows traditional statement pieces aren't my style.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I work in healthcare as well and wear scrubs to work.  I find that since I dress down on a daily basis, I tend to want to dress up a bit more when I’m not at work - heels, dresses, etc.  That being said, my wardrobe in general is fairly casual since I really have no need to business clothing.	episode_done:True
text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:The company already made money off of the original purchase of the shirt, so you buying second hand doesn’t really benefit them in any way. If you really want the item, buying it second hand is probably the most ethical choice you can make. If someone asks where the piece is from, just say you don’t know so they won’t be tempted to buy from the brand lol
text:yes BUT if the original buyers see the ability to sell on as one of the reasons why they buy from the brand (eg chanel). By buying it secondhand aren't you perpetuating that?	labels:	episode_done:True
