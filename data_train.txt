text:How would you store sentimental clothing?	labels:Safest way is to wrap in acid free paper, store in an acid free box (available at joanns and on line stores).  If you can’t do that, fold it and wrap it in washed, unbleached muslin fabric.   Make sure it is clean before you store it.  Perspiration and food spills can attract pests. If you hang it for display, do not place it in direct sunlight.  Also away from any source of moisture.	episode_done:False

text:How would you store sentimental clothing?	labels:I have a fabric storage box that I got from Michaels (probably readily available at any craft/fabric store). The only issue is its kind of odd shaped so finding storage wasn't as easy as just sticking it on a shelf (according to at lrast some sites...when long-term storing clothes, its.better to have fewer folds, so the box is kind of long and skinny? I am not a fabric expert so I'm not sure how true that is).   For random sentimental pieces, I did things like make pillows. I wanted to be reminded of them, but I didn't need it to stay clothing, if that makes sense!	episode_done:True

text:How would you store sentimental clothing?	labels:If you want to be able to look at it, depending on how well it folds up (like if there is a design on the torso that could be arranged on top), you could potentially put it in a shadow box to reduce the amount of wall space it takes up.  You could also get a decorative dress form and display it on that.	episode_done:True

text:How would you store sentimental clothing?	labels:There's a lot of good ideas put forward so far.

text:Sewing your own clothes	labels:Whether it's worth it or not completely depends on what you personally value in your clothes.  Economy? If you just compare any shirt to any shirt, it's often not cheaper to sew it yourself. Fabric is expensive and if you use patterned fabric, you're going to have a lot of scrap pieces due to pattern matching (if that's a priority to you, it's often not a priority in cheaper fast fashion clothes).  Fit, style and comfort wise? If you get good enough at sewing, you can customize the fit of your clothes, choose the fabrics you like, and sew them in a way that you feel is comfortable, without itchy seams, bulk, tight shoulders, excess fabric pouting or whatever.  They're going to be perfect for your taste.  Quality compared to the price? Here sewing your own stuff will definitely be worth it. You can choose a good quality fabric, prewash the fabric to ensure a good fit even after washes, have a proper pattern that suits you perfectly, and then cut the pattern out of fabric that you've pattern and bias matched perfectly, which also means no further twisting after washing. Basically, clever and good pattern matching is going to take the garment from looking 20 bucks to 200 bucks.  There are many more factors to include, like time and labor and interest etc, but basically, if you like it, see it as a hobby that will provide you with clothes that most likely are going to last better than ready made clothes for the same amount of money.	episode_done:False

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I require a relatively formal work wardrobe that includes suiting and tailored dresses.  After years of wasting time and money at the dry cleaners, I decided to rationalise my work wardrobe in a similar way to you some time ago.   Some brands, including Emporio Armani, Joseph, Me&Em and Norma Kamali, make very high quality machine washable polyester suiting and dresses that don't look remotely cheap or plastic-y. You can get suiting in machine washable wool from budget-friendly brands including Marks & Spencer and Next, but surprisingly designer brands don't seem to have taken up the opportunity. Wool or cashmere knitwear (any brand) can be machine washed if you invest in a modern machine with a wool setting and a specialist detergent. While deeper coloured cottons will eventually fade, it is otherwise resilient to machine washing and probably the best choice for shirts.  I would avoid silk. Even if it's washable, the colours will eventually fade, and it's hard to remove stains without damaging the fabric.	episode_done:True
text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I wear a lot of stuff from Rickis, RW&Co, and INC International Concepts. It's all fairly inexpensive, holds up well, and is machine washable.  "Dry clean only" is almost always a lie though. Clothing manufacturers are required to put care instructions on garments, dry clean only is an easy way for them to avoid responsibility if the garment gets fucked up while being cleaned.   Almost everything with a dry clean only label can be put in the washing machine in a mesh bag. If something seems really delicate (sequins, glitter, delicate mesh) then you can almost certainly hand wash it. Just avoid heat and you should be fine. At this point the only things I would dry clean would be items with sculptural/3d elements that would break down if they got wet.  I thrift most of my clothing, so I'm really daring about putting things in the wash, because if it gets wrecked I'm probably not losing more than $10. I've put dozens of dry clean only items in the washing machine and I don't remember the last time I wrecked something by doing so.	episode_done:True
text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:oooooh,so apparently my friends all consider me the laundry queen. I also have the strictest dress code out of all my friends. I will say that much of my wardrobe is machine washable,but even with those pieces I try to limit damage from washing. I have a couple of ways:  1. wearing more often and hanging up between wears to air out and limit wrinkling.  2. Depending upon the item,using an undergarment to protect from sweat etc.  3. Using a steamer to help remove wrinkles and refresh clothes.  4. If having to wash in a machine,gentle cycle on cold and air dry. I use a mesh wash bag for the most delicate articles. I find for a lot of "dry clean only" this method is usually ok.  5. For wools and silks etc. I use Eucalan.   edited to add: I don't really havs brand recs - much of my wardrobe is thrifted and even when I've gotten recognizable brands I don't think I'd be able to say with confidence if they were indicative of the brand's current quality.	episode_done:True
text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:When I worked in a bank (the most formal setting I've worked in), New York and Company was my staple (their quality has since gone way downhill sadly).  Their dress pants were machine washable and I would typically wear a shirt/cardigan combo.  Their dresses and skirts are also machine washable.    Now I WFH and I could wear PJ pants (or no pants) as long as I look okay on Zoom.  With a few exceptions, my industry is super casual.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:Bought a hoodie as a gift for someone. She specifically asked for the one I got; she provided the link and all. It arrived and was a major disappointment. The fabric was thin, the cuts and seams were weird as hell, sleeves were short, and more. It was obvious that it was just a "straight from crappy manufacturer" product with lies on the website. What's unfortunate is that I had a feeling prior to ordering it that it wasn't going to be good. It's just hard to tell someone that they're not good at identifying scam-like products that are all too common nowadays on FB and Insta.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online?

But its been over 2 months and i still havent gotten anything and i was never able to reach customer service!! when i finally did they said “no need for condescending messages we’re just trying to assist you” all i did was say “thanks again! babe!” 😩😩😩	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I’ve had decent luck with my targeted ads. I almost use it to my advantage now. If I’m looking for something, I’ll spend 5-10 minutes searching Google and browsing sites - then wait a few days. My Instagram will pop up with lots of places that I wouldn’t have necessarily found off Google but I am their target market.   Then I stalk. Check out the product reviews on their website, do a product review. com check, go into the tagged photos on Instagram to see people who are wearing the product and their feedback. Search comments! Companies not worth shopping with will have complaints under Insta photos or fake responses to their customers. Worse is no response to questions.   You can also find discount codes from their influencers on the tagged photos page that they wouldn’t necessarily share on their main page.   I’m a very cautious buyer. I need to have a good return policy if I’m shopping online from a company. So yes, I have a good experience but I put in a lot of prep into preparing my parachute before I jump.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online?

text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I casually browse AliExpress when I'm really bored, so I've got a really good eye for catching dropshipped products. This is why the only fast fashion sites I tend to use are SHEIN when their items are on sale. I've only bought 1 full price item from them because it had super good reviews.    Other than that SHEIN is basically dropshipped clothing that I *could* buy from AliExpress, but after shipping fees it would be about the same price and would take a month or more to arrive if it doesn't get flagged in Customs.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I went out on the thinnest limb of hope for Romwe after seeing ads on insta. I saw the cutest blouse and had to have it. Then I went online and was shocked to see the prices and may or may not have gone a little crazy and bought a handful or so pieces. Only until after did I do research and find multiple negative reviews.  Most of the items that arrived were not good quality. But some were acceptable so I kept them. The sandals lasted a little over a year. The blouses I still have and wear. They haven't decreased in quality. Of course, I also take care of them when I wash them. So, it's hit or miss.  But, honestly, I wouldn't purchase from there again. The anxiety that I can't be certain I'm getting what I'm expecting isn't worth it. And the thought that I might've been lucky this time but next time might never receive my order like others.  Rookie shopper move, for sure. I should've known it was good to be true. And, at least for 5 pieces I kept, it has worked out. But if a company cannot guarantee that their products are of an acceptable quality, you have better luck at target, from which I have a few items that are of way better quality. Also, forever 21.  The clothes do last (I know fast fashion is horrible but if you're on a tight budget, you can find pieces that'll last so you're not buying often). I haven't tossed out a single piece and I've owned them for years.	episode_done:True

text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Hitting up thrift stores to experiment with new looks is an easy entry point for a lot of people. I'm sorry your mom talked you into returning things you were excited about! That's a bummer.  I try to remind myself that realistically no one will remember what I wore. Or at least they won't spend time thinking about it. If I put together an outfit outside my comfort zone, I can take it off at the end of the day and it's like it never even happened. Same way makeup washes off, clothes come off in an instant too. The stakes aren't as high as they feel.  I used to feel boxed in by what I describe as "school picture day mentality," meaning I felt that every outfit had to be *just right*. It had to represent me perfectly as if that's how I would be preserved in other people's minds forever. But that's so goofy, idk why I thought that. Every day is a new opportunity and every outfit is temporary. I hope you can have fun and tap into your confidence!	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:If you're nervous about the look itself: I used to wear things I was iffy on when I was in a new or different place. Like, if I was worried a dress was too loud and attention-getting for my comfort level, I'd wear it when I was in a different city for the day, because if it did catch too much attention, who cares, I was never seeing these people again! Obviously this is harder to do in covid, because we aren't casually daytripping or traveling, but even just wearing the outfit to the grocery store, where you're probably not going to know everyone, vs wearing it in the office, where you see the same people all the time can ease you into being comfortable...	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Do you buy with your own income and do you do your own laundry? If yes to both then when your mother points that out again you say “thank you I will take that into consideration” and move on. That’s how adults should talk and the whole point of being adults. You can share your opinion but I don’t have to follow your every word. Then you experiment with light colours yourself. Buying from thrift stores or online second hand apps sounds like a great place to start. Then you can make those calls for yourself or confirm and see if you agree with your mother’s advice	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Main tip would be to try not to care too much about what others think and do what makes you feel good. I started gaining more confidence when I actually started wearing the clothes I found cute. It was gradual of course and I felt a little self conscious at first but as time went on I felt so much better about myself until I became completely confident in everything I wore. It sucks that your mom discouraged you but I would just say not to mind it and do what you feel like doing. At the end of the day it’s you wearing the clothing- not your mom, and you should feel great wearing whatever you’re wearing! Good luck	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Maybe for starters not listen to what your mom has to say. I was a tomboy and got girlie in a second when my first skirt turned out pretty. Mom told me I had scrawny legs which was exactly not a nice thing to say at the time. She also made me wear pantyhose with my skirts AND made me pay for them out of my allowance which was a huge bummer because I loved music and had a hard time buying albums as it was.  From then on I learned to do what I wanted to do.	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Get old!  I'm a Little Old Lady who DNGAF.

Have dressed the same for the last 25 years, since I left a job where I had to wear skirts.	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Confidence usually comes as a result of doing things. Part of this is trying new things and facing the fact that you might make mistakes; and that's okay, because it's a learning experience. It is not a crime to buy something and realise later it's not for you. Everyone does it.   Some people don't like the idea of making mistakes, so they try and protect themselves and the people they love from them. Sounds like your mother is like that. But at the end of the day, your clothes are for you to wear and wash. Her opinion is just an opinion. The only way you'll know is by wearing the clothes, washing the clothes and seeing how YOU feel about it.	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Wear them to the grocery store. Wear them on a walk around your neighborhood. Wear them to run errands or to get coffee from a new place.   The ultimate advice is to not care what other people think of your clothes, but that's just a lot easier said than done, especially when people you know are giving their unsolicited opinions. So wear them in spaces where you're not interacting with people or, at least, not with people whose opinions on your clothes matter to you. See what it feels like to be out in the world dressed how you want to be dressed and go from there.	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:For light colored clothes:  - Persil laundry detergent. It’s gotten stains out of things that I never thought possible - Keep a few Clorox wipes or a tide pen in your bag for random spots that may occur  - Carry a scarf in your bag to sit on, I always do regardless of what color my pants are  With new clothes, I’ll wear them around the house for a bit to get comfortable in them & make any adjustments to the outfit. IMO it’s a great time to listen to music, maybe have a drink/tea, relax, and enjoy the process. Invoke the feeling of getting ready for a Friday night out with your best friends.   Then it’s time to for the outside world. My lizard brain chose these beautiful clothes, it’s time to embrace them.	episode_done:False

text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:My mom died years ago, but I wish I could have taught her how to do makeup. Liquid eyeliner is a PITA and her attempts needed help. I miss her so much.   She taught me to always try it on, you don’t know if something that looks like a sack on the hanger may fit your perfectly.   She wore sweats all of the time, but her pale skin, dark hair and icy blue eyes looked amazing with cobalt blue. I should have encouraged her to wear that color more.	episode_done:True
text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:I taught my mom to have a little more fun, and to spoil herself. My mom has great style, but we live in the Midwest and looking at older photos of her I know later took on a sort of “mom” approach to style-to put it nicely, she likes good clothes, but appreciates them on other people. I have lots of photos of her in the 80s with amazing hats, gloves, and other things that had so much presence. I work in fashion so my goal is always to nudge her a bit so that she can feel like the center of attention, but not so far as to make her uncomfortable. This means buying nice and ornate little accessories for her, or introducing her to trends she might not know are age appropriate and easy to find at a good price. Last year I got her a 3/4 length sleeve top in navy from Jcrew with little ostrich feathers on the sleeves, and it was understated enough that it allowed her to feel like a celebrity wearing it, and it seemed to suit her. It BLEW HER MIND! This year she asked for a red clutch, and was afraid it was too specific. I promised that I would search high and low to find something perfect. There is literally no place I won’t go to find something specific if she wants it, and I often know where to look and have my eyes open all year long. I want her to feel special because she is the only reason that I do.	episode_done:True
text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:I helped teach my mom self love! She grew up without a mom (fuck cancer) and always struggled with depression, eating disorders, and self esteem. When I was growing up she tried but didn’t know how to teach me to have self confidence, and I picked up a lot of her insecurities. She eventually encouraged me to go to therapy (for other reasons) and I helped pass on a lot of the tools I learned for self love. My entire childhood she almost exclusively wore my father’s clothes, who was much larger than her, so none of the clothes fit and she never picked them out for herself. She still doesn’t care too much for fashion but she now buys clothes for herself that make her feel good, instead of just wearing clothes to be clothed.	episode_done:True
text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:It's a little thing, but the French tuck. I started doing it one day, and then I noticed she was doing it, too, a few weeks later. It was a fun detail to notice since I copy her so often (even at 28 y.o.)!	episode_done:True
text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:How to mix and match pieces. My mom finds a combination that works (often because it is the store display) and just does that. She'll "mix it up" by buying the exact same thing in several different colors, but she will still pair them with the same item. So, like red shirt and blue pants and the same shirt and pant but in green and brown, but wearing the blue pants and green top would probably not occur to her. Which is very uniform and fine, but she was complaining about how she has two closets of clothes and looks the same all the time...the first time I took a skirt and paired it with a different shirt than the one she always pairs it with, it was like she thought I was a magician. She also still has some matching-print tops and bottoms from the late 80s/early 90s and breaking the pair up (like, wearing the patterned skirt with a solid top) made them look fresh and new...But she is also the type of person who doesn't ever rearrange furniture on her own and rarely tries new recipes either. She just is good with sticking with things that she knows will do well enough.    But yeah. Shopping her own closet for new combinations was a lightbulb moment for her. (My grandmother is the same way. She literally hangs her outfits on the same hanger, so *those* pants go with *that* sweater, which is how she ended up with, no joke, 47 pairs of white pants at one point 😬)	episode_done:True

She was beautiful in middle age but had no income for clothes and stuff as she was a stay at home mom. She did however teach us a lot about femininity and hygiene and hair and makeup. I didn’t realize how much she had taught me until recently. As a preteen I watched a lot of What Not to Wear so I thought I had become a fashion expert (even if i only got one new outfit per year and it was an embarrassing monkey character T-shirt 🤣) anyhow I always tried to give her fashion advice to make her feel better about herself and in hindsight she shouldn’t have listened to my tip to buy green seersucker capris 😂 she died when I was 17 but if I could, I would treat her to all the nice stuff I can now afford to buy for myself 🥰	episode_done:True

I hope we'll get a chance to do that one day.   Back when she was working, I did help her pick some clothes and shoes so it was always flattering when her coworkers thought something she wore was 'cool'. She does ask me for style advice so I'm flattered she trusts me. I learned a lot about clothes and makeup on my own but as I get older I definitely find myself going for cozy pieces that are like a step away from what my mom would wear lol.	episode_done:True

text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:My fashion is evolving! I was raised in a strict conservative homeschooling environment, so until college my fashion was nonexistent.  In college, I had the same instincts for fashion I do now— but no taste. Meaning I knew the message I wanted to send but didn’t have the language down.  It took me five years, and several kind friends in grad school. I used the Curated Closet, lurked on this sub, and- I know it sounds weird- watched RuPaul’s Drag Race with a very fashion-forward friend.  I have three key “styles” and rotate based context: 1. Business casual— lots of black leggings and Uniqlo swing dresses, blazers, button-ups, minimalist sweaters. Clothing that says Take Me Seriously, I’m Here to Work. 2. Flannels and nerdy or artsy graphic tees. Laid-back mode.  3. Artsy, edgy, fashion-forward. I like the subversive and truly odd. As a confused baby in undergrad, this love combined with poverty drove me to a series of failed experiments. Notable: the notorious black sequin dress and top hat, a vintage 20s button up with poofy sleeves paired with high waisted jeans, camo jacket and flowy skirt. Now, my artsy style manifests in outfits like: Universal Standard Geneva dress, green bomber jacket, cherry Doc Martens and matching lipstick, dangling silver figure earrings, statement bag. (I’m currently in love with FashionBrandCompany’s garbage bag purse).   I put a lot of thought into my wardrobe and 75% are pieces that can rotate through all three. Black leggings and black dresses are great neutral canvases— the accessories make the style!	episode_done:True

So even if I do feel good when I leave the house, I feel super conscious by the time I get to the office.

I'm sure I got a lot of "why the heck is she so dressed up" stares. But I kept dressing cute and eventually people were like oh that's just how she dresses - i.e. you just gotta own it. (I did start slow though, so like I worked my way up from casual to minor upgrades to clothes to more cutesy looks)  Disclaimer: everybody's situation is different and this might not work for you. I'm just sharing what worked for me. :)	episode_done:True
text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I'm 65, retired.  Have dressed pretty much the same (not the same items!) for 25 years, ie jeans/cargoes/tees/denim shirts/hoodies. Prior to that I was in a job where I had to wear skirts, I wore collared tees/shirts, jumpers and cardies with them.  That takes me back to 1981.  Before that, too long ago to remember but certainly not "business wear", and before that when at uni/college/school, I guess the then equivalent of what I wear today.  Well school was uniform, I meant time not in school.	episode_done:True
text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I work in an office and am supposed to dress business casual.   My entire closet is work clothes and while some of it is cute it’s mostly boring and safe.   I feel like my personal style is edgy and fun. I’m working on curating a weekend wardrobe and not focusing on work outfits until I have just as much weekend  and after work clothes. I’m thinking fun  Art teacher and also colorful mom clothes but we will see I also like basics a lot like jeans and a black top .	episode_done:False
text:I love the idea of a weekend wardrobe! I work in an office where everybody is super casual (jeans and T-shirts) that whenever I dress up (wear a cute dress or even mini skirt + stockings in the winter), I get asked if I have plans after work or I end up feeling overdressed. So even if I do feel good when I leave the house, I feel super conscious by the time I get to the office. A weekend wardrobe sounds like a good plan!	labels:Thank you. I feel like a lot of my years of shopping for work clothes was just me surviving and not really being too fashion forward or myself  but now that I have a little bit more heads space and time to think about what I wanna wear outside of work I am really excited about creating a great wardrobe. That being said if you have a lot of cute pieces that you want to wear to work it would be Cool challenge to set for yourself to see if you can find a good middle ground  to use some of your nice pieces for work while still keeping it business casual. But yeah I do wish that in the past years I had spent more time on outside of work wear, I feel like having multiple interests and hobbies outside of work is super important and my wardrobe wasn’t reflecting that	episode_done:True

I'm in a super male dominated environment for both my jobs and my style is very Ms. Frizzle-esque.   One of my jobs is uniformed, other isn't. The former, I go absolutely nuts and colourful on my makeup (legit will wear glitter and draw designs with eyeliner if I'm feeling in the mood for it) and the latter meant I was more dressed up than about 98% of the staff (there was one cashier who was like me, she DGAF what people thought and would wear jewel tone velvet shirts and leather pants and studded boots when everyone else was in jeans and t shirts. She looked awesome. )     After about a week, people stopped asking questions.	episode_done:True
text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I had a school uniform til 17 and truly wore the most random clothing until I was done university. I never thought of the clothes I owned as a whole, and instead just picked up whatever piece of clothing caught my little magpie eye.   When I was about 23 I started looking at my clothes a bit more strategically in terms of “outfits” rather than “items” as in, if I want to have these cool funky pants then maybe I need to have a simple black shirt to go with it. When I started I definitely got sucked into the “essentials in every wardrobe” lists but in the last two years (since I was 24!!) or so I have learned stopped using those as a template for my own closet.   It also helped that I became a bit more confident in myself — I used to just want to blend in and be unnoticed and that showed in my wardrobe, but now I am happy to be wearing something a little more out there. I have always loved the ripped jeans, all black, big stompy boots look, but where I grew up was so not a big stompy boots country that you couldn’t even find items like that back in my day. Now that I’m older I’m more confident in wearing those kinds of items.    Since that is my main style I don’t vary too much from it, but I have been enjoying working on little “mini capsules” of items that are a style I like to delve into occasionally, such as a cowboy/cottagey look or just looking like a disco ball. I have a very narrow colour palette of 3 colours so  as long as my mini capsule items are the same three colours I can wear them head to toe for eg a full cottagey look, or I can just wear my peasant blouse and black jeans to tone it down. :)	episode_done:True
text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I had a general style from a relatively young age, like teenage years. Kind of preppy, kind of quirky, lots of animals on my tops, lots of jewel tones, etc. I'd play around with buying other types of looks, but most of them left my closet pretty quickly. In my early/mid 20s, I did have this horrible period where I thought I needed to "grow up" so I purged a *ton* of stuff and thought I was just going to stick to neutrals and sleek lines and be very polished, or my idea of polished...I was miserable and by the time I was in my late 20s, began rebuilding my wardrobe to be filled with more things that just make me smile. I do have some of my neutrals hanging around. I learned I don't hate them, as long as they have texture or dramatic sleeves or things like that. So I guess the experience wasn't a total wash...  But yeah, I'm 31 and my style journey is just kind of ending up where I was at like 3. (I mean, I just bought a sweater of a giraffe, haha) But it was really about just kind of accepting who I am and realizing I'm probably not going to outgrow a lot the idiosyncrasies the way I thought I "should" 🤷‍♀️	episode_done:True
text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I experimented with a lot of different styles over the years but I think I really settled into my style at around 23 years old. I’m 28 now and still dress the same, which may not seem that long but before I was changing pretty dramatically on a yearly basis. I think it just came with age and getting to know myself better. Before I was always chasing trends and trying to dress for others, but as of 23 I started to dress for myself and stopped caring if something was in fashion or not. It led me to discovering pieces and styles that I really loved, that also suit my lifestyle, which hasn’t changed too much over the years (living in a big city and working at an office that allows for casual dress).	episode_done:True
text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I was gonna say now, but I actually I had a pretty good idea of what I liked around 16.  I was low key obsessed with J-fashion, specifically Gothic Lolita, most my friends were all emo/alt, as was I, and I was reading a lot of Vogue, so I had good trend awareness, and balancing all those things to make outfits that worked was a lot of fun.  I had two distinct phases after that.  The first was that kind of aggressively flattering/appropriate style that a lot of people develop in their early twenties, which was a compliment magnet, and was also a lot of fun.  After that I had a phase that wasn't really so much a style as it was having a retail job and no strong preferences.  I wore some fun items, but there wasn't much cohesion, and it eventually made getting dressed feel like a chore.  I got tired of that in 2019, did the big chop, started my closet overhaul, and pretty much got down to writing myself a rule book, since I knew what I liked and wouldn't get sick of wearing. (Also, I tend to forget anything not written down.)  Turns out, most of that was based on what I liked in high school, and the handful of things that stuck since then adapted to my life now.  I genuinely like black, and am fine with only a handful of other colours I can wear head to toe.  I like a simple, compliment magnet of a shoe.  I enjoy a fun print or a ridiculous statement item- just in a limited colour palette.  I had my exploratory phase and didn't particularly care for it, so outside of life changes or new fashion loves, I don't see any drastic changes in my future.	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:One of the big things I learned is that there's a lot less room for error or experimentation with investments. I feel pretty fortunate that I had a pretty good idea of what I liked and didn't like, but I think if you're still wanting to experiment then it may be best to stick with very specific investments. For example, I started just with shoes (I have strong preferences) and outerwear (I wanted to upgrade shapes/colors I already loved). That'll help build confidence in moving to other areas.	episode_done:False
text:This is a good point. I started by replacing things I wore all the time with better quality versions. I also started with shoes	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:My new year's resolution is to only buy (at most) one new piece of clothing per month. I have a pretty well-stocked closet, but I also don't love most of my clothes. I did too much stress shopping because of Covid, and spent more money than I needed to on mostly cheaper clothes, and I made this resolution to help change my mindset about shopping.  With my resolution, I'm not even looking at outlets of other cheaper stores. Yes, it is still hard to stomach spending more money on clothes, but after I've had an item in my cart for a couple days and feel certain that it's the one new thing I want to get for the month, it has been easier for me. It  has also forced me to be much more thoughtful about what I need. We'll see how the rest of the year goes!  I think that thrifting can (obviously) be great, but it can be a lot easier to buy things that you don't love because they are great pieces that just don't work for you.	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:It sounds like you're having trouble staying motivated so maybe you need to remember why you wanted to change your habits in the first place - you mentioned that you wanted to reinvent yourself.  For me, it took years and it's an ongoing process to change the way I think/buy, as well as to save up ad afford the nicer things I wanted. I would say that some main factors for me to change were that I became dissatisfied with the quality I saw (once you learn to sew, you can't unsee it), and I had a friend who was starting to buy nicer things. She made more money than I did, so it took more effort for me when I wanted to buy some, too.  I had to learn to do my research - follow the brands/makers, see what sales and discounts they offered, if any. It might take a season or easily longer to learn about their habits before I made my move. I also had to learn about when to just buy something full-price - if I thought I would be so disappointed to miss out, I'd consider buying the piece sooner. I wear a XS-S most of the time, so these sizes tend to sell out faster. Most of the time though, I had to learn to be patient, be honest with my style/needs, and shop smarter.	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:Having gone through this transition, the main advice I would give you is to understand the categories and "slots" in your wardrobe before you shop for pieces, and if you have an item-type you like while you wish the piece were better in a particular way, upgrade that piece specifically, and take your time doing so.  For example: I learned I love well-fitted, thin turtlenecks with structured trousers and skirts, so now I feel secure shopping for high-end turtlenecks. But I also know I only have 4 "slots" in my closet for these - one black, one gray, one taupe/camel, one cream - so that's all I need, forever, and I can upgrade one piece at a time. I'm giving myself permission to wear the same things all the time, like a cartoon character, while I do so. :)	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:My experience with this is to upgrade pieces that I can use multiple times and that are essential. Purses, shoes, coats, jeans, sweaters. Then once those are in place then we move to smaller items — tops for each season, dress pants, etc. best of luck !	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:Going through the same thing right now - same age range and a student as well :) Honestly, COVID has helped my mindset a lot. I'm not wearing real clothes as much anymore, as I mostly live in PJs and sweatpants, so I'm re-evaluating why I have so many fast fashion pieces in the first place. Do I really need ten pairs of cheap jeans? No, and I don't even like wearing most of them anyways. There's a thrill of buying things on sale "just because," but after that fades, I'm left with a piece of clothing that I don't really **love**. So I just gravitate towards the same few pieces that I really **do** love, and I realized that I should just invest in a few quality things that I'll always go for.  Donating and selling a ton of my old clothes over the past few months has really helped me settle into a more minimalistic mindset. I also think about the ethical and environmental impacts of fast fashion a lot more nowadays, which really puts me off from buying things online from cheap sites. Thrifting is also a great way to save some money and be more sustainable while still getting quality pieces!	episode_done:True

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:You can find quality items + tailoring for less than $200. Make sure to read what expensive clothes are made out of - just because a shirt costs $200 doesn’t mean it’s good quality. You can also thrift good quality vintage clothing for less than $20.   I bought a blazer almost 5 years ago for around $150, tailored it, and it fits perfectly to this day. Pair that with a white 100% cotton t-shirt from The Gap ($15 max) and a real gold necklace ($$$$$) and you have yourself a business casual outfit for work. My dress pants and jeans are also all tailored.   I would say statement pieces - jewelry, shoes, bags - look cheap if they actually are cheap. Invest in quality leather shoes, an expensive watch, and gold/silver jewelry. I find that some tops and jeans from Forever 21 and Zara don’t look cheap if you tailor them and know how to style them. However if you buy cheap $20 shoes and a $5 fake gold necklace, an expert eye can tell and you’ll look quite tacky.   Just my 5 cents!  ETA: you don’t need to buy $200 items of clothing, but you also can’t buy $10 clothing. You need to find something in the middle. Don’t shop at stores like  Primark, but you can still find a decent blazer or pair of dress pants at Zara or H&M. My personal favourite for work clothes is Banana Republic. Their dress pants are less than $80 and they frequently go on sale. However, do NOT buy statement pieces at these stores as I mentioned before.	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:Once, very soon after starting my job, I bought some pants that didn't fit super well but I liked the color. I asked my friend, a lawyer and the best dressed woman I have ever met, whether I should keep or return the pants. She said the material wasn't great and the color wasn't going to wash well. She also said something that was a revelation and really stuck with me, "I'd hate for you to wear something that is beneath you." Until then, I'd never had the thought that I could be "above" certain clothes, but attaining a certain level of maturity and professional success did mean I should have higher standards. My parents never taught me anything about clothes and I wasn't discerning about quality till I'd owned and spent time in good quality stuff. When I compare old and new clothes side by side I see a big difference in the material, stitching, and cut. I don't think of them as investment pieces--to me, that's just a euphemism for expensive clothing, because I wore my fast fashion clothes for years too not months. The new mindset I have is that enjoying expensive clothing is fine. I'm not "undeserving". I'm allowed to pay attention to my appearance and spend resources on looking my best.	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:I have no idea if this is a good idea but it’s what I’m trying out. I transitioned to thrifting and focused on “vintage” aka <2020 clothes in natural fibers to find my style. Now I feel like I can recognize quality clothes, which cured me of any desire to shop crappy fast fashion. Now if only I could break my thrifting addiction...that would be the last step on the road to a small, high quality wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:can you tell me the major difference b/w style and fashion?!	labels:Fashion is a collective, style is personal.	episode_done:True
text:can you tell me the major difference b/w style and fashion?!	labels:Fashion is collective, is what's trendy. Style is personal. Sometimes the 2 overlap but most times people with style are wearing items that are not considered in fashion.   For example a celebrity has a distinct style (eg Billy Eilish). If everyone started dressing like her, then it will be in fashion.	episode_done:True
text:can you tell me the major difference b/w style and fashion?!	labels:One of my favorite quotes is by Coco Chanel: "Etiquette are for those without manners, in the same way as fashion is for those without style."  What this means to me is that fashion is a series of "rules" and transient ideas about what "good style" is, but isn't really a substitute for having your own well-defined, more solid and long-lasting style.	episode_done:True
text:Looking for aesthetically pleasing pajamas	labels:I will put in a rave review for Recliner pajamas. I now own way too many sets to mention, as I've been slowly replacing all my pj's with this brand.   I have the second skin nightgown which is a midi length nightdress that is super flattering, yes you could call it sexy (my husband does). I also love the PJ set long sleeve version.   Not silk, not gauze, but infinitely washable -- my very first purchase is 4 or 5 years old now and I've washed it every week and it still looks brand new, no piling, no stretching, no fading. It holds up to its claim and you can wear over and over again without getting stanky. I say this as someone who's been wearing this brand since I was perimenopausal and had hot flashes.   The second skin nightie is cut in a way that is super flattering--- but so are the Pj's which i am basically living in since COVID. I just sleep too hot so the PJ's are for day and the nightie is for night.  I did give the Lilly Silk Pj's a try but they don't stretch at all and just weren't as flattering or as comfortable.  I tried Lunya as well but I'm 5'0 and they were designed for very slim and tall people.	episode_done:True

text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it’s typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it’s a bottom, they no longer “stay up”.

text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it’s typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it’s a bottom, they no longer “stay up”. This usually happens with leggings or panties after about 5 or more years of regular wear with caring for the items properly.  I also had a faux leather jacket wear out after 6 years of regular wear.

text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:- jeans stretch and get droopy butt - shirts and knits get pilling in the fabric - clothes get random holes in them from the dryer or something - sweat stains  The sweat stains are the most annoying. I don’t really wear jeans anymore. But I sweat a lot as a person. I try to wear undershirts to protect my nicer work clothes but that doesn’t really work in the summer when it’s too hot for layers	episode_done:False
text:For the sweat stains - machine wash after every wear (don't wear twice) on an appropriate cycle, and use \*bio\* detergent and \*hot\* water.  This should be enough, but if stains do start to appear, use The Laundress Stain Bar (which contains borax) as a pre-wash spot remover. This regime won't work on old stains, but it will work on preventing any new stains.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How does one incorporate haute couture into everyday work outfits?	labels:My advice when incorporating an element that's "off" from the norm is to add another element in the same vein to balance it out and make it look more intentional. By "element" I'm including accessories and hairstyles, makeup. So you could pair a couture blazer with a blowout, or a dramatic blouse with a bold lip, or an iconic skirt with a high end bracelet. Also, outerwear is a great place to start if you're tentative bc you take it off once you get to work. Coats, jackets, bags, scarves.	episode_done:True
text:How does one incorporate haute couture into everyday work outfits?	labels:real haute couture should be treated as an art piece, first of all if you can afford to buy a piece of haute couture chances are that you not only need the money to afford it but also the power and most pieces are only made for events such as the oscars. if even that you still have the money and the influence in the fashion industry to be able to have haute couture in your closet, I wouldn't wear it for work tbh appreciate it	episode_done:True
text:How does one incorporate haute couture into everyday work outfits?	labels:I don't own anything that's truly haute couture, but I'm sort of a collector of independent, higher-end fashion. I'm a stay at home mom right now, but I LOVE the idea of mixing high and low pieces together. I also think there's nothing wrong with just going all out and letting a piece shine. I have actually displayed fashion pieces that I love in my home, especially when I can't wear them on a daily basis.  I have a beloved Rachel Comey wool purse with a drawing of a nude woman on it, and I display it on a mannequin in my bedroom, so I can see it everyday. One day, I'll carry it to the store, lol. I also have a Suno NY skirt that is way too small for me, but I bought because I loved the fabric pattern. I've draped it over a shelf or used it as a pillow cover to display it where I could see it.	episode_done:True
text:How does one incorporate haute couture into everyday work outfits?	labels:More info needed: What luxury designer* pieces do you tend to fall in love with? If evening wear or voluminous skirts are what makes your heart beat faster, there might not really be a good way of bringing that into your 9-5... but if you’re drawn to something like Balmain blazers (a personal weakness), it’s a lot easier to just throw one of these into your work rotation in place of a “normal” blazer. If you’re into a particular brand’s prints, textures, use of color, etc., then accessories are an easy place to start as well - a full blown Pucci dress may be a bit “too loud” for an engineering firm, but you should be able to get away with a silk Pucci scarf.   *Assuming you meant fashion house runway / main line pieces, not true haute couture which is really not work-appropriate unless you’re a model or actual royalty...	episode_done:True

text:Thoughts on Shein?	labels:As others have said, it's very unethical (but I think most places are at this point) and extremely hit-or-miss. But it can be much more cost-effective than similar places like Forever 21. You need to look at the reviews to make  sure you're getting a decent quality item, and even then the sizing is inconsistent, so be prepared to give some items to a friend when they don't fit. I would absolutely not purchase anything that doesn't have a lot of reviews since a lot of things they carry seem to be straight garbage.	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts on Shein?	labels:Don’t buy from there if you want clothes that last any longer than 4 months. It’s terrible for the environment and they have child labor as the reason they’re so cheap.  That being said, I know it’s a puller because a lot of people cannot afford the cost of clothes that are visually high fashion and shien is appealing for it’s low price. If you can afford to buy better and more expensive clothing, do so. It’s worth the price in the long run, and you won’t be helping this scummy company.  If you cannot afford higher, then I understand buying from shien, but recognize that they are a terrible company and see if you can find any good thrift stores or online resellers that may be around the same price range for a much more ethical choice.	episode_done:False

I’m not going to tell someone to not buy clothing from a place they can afford. I’m absolutely not doing it.   People demonize fast fashion because they look at it as black and white and don’t understand that, if you’re shopping at SHEIN, you likely can’t afford the more sustainable sources/you can’t find what you’re looking for secondhand. I’m plus sized. I can’t fit into and afford a lot of the sustainable brands out there. And, people buy out the “fashionable” plus size items in my local thrift stores to sell on Depop, so, I don’t blame people for shopping on SHEIN.  I’ve bought SHEIN secondhand and I’ve had items for years and I haven’t had any issues. I haven’t bought first hand from them in a long time but when I did, I never had any long shipping times or anything, either. I found the same defects I’d find at Target, like, a long thread here or there that I can easily snip off.   This goes for fast fashion in general—if you take care of your clothes and wear the appropriate size, you can make them last.

text:I would agree. I already commented but there's a huge market gap for plus sized women that Shein fills. It's beyond obvious most people posting and commenting on this sub aren't plus sized or are on the smaller end of it like me, size 14/16. Shein accommodates women up to size 24/26 or so and those women are more likely to need inexpensive clothes (obesity/poverty correlation, it sucks but its true). Most people on this sub can afford or have the option of a huge variety of ethical and sustainable clothes that are not Shein either due to being straight sized or having enough disposable income. If you're committed to ethical and sustainable fashion and you're avoiding all new clothes, fast fashion, and mall brands, sure, I'll listen to your critique of Shein, but please realize most American women don't really have that privilege. If you're out here buying Zara and Express, you can kindly shut the fuck up with your hypocrisy.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:My thoughts as this came up in another thread: SHEIN is mostly dropshipped, but if you *only* buy SHEIN clothes on sale you're often getting it at the same price as what it sells for on AliExpress without paying a lot for shipping *and* you don't have to wait a month or more for it to arrive from China.    I've ordered from both AE and SHEIN and tbh getting everything in one package in a week vs 10 packages that may or may not show up between 1-2 months after the order date is one thing that SHEIN does right.     Do I think it's a good company? No. But I'm a broke bitch who can't afford nice staple pieces, esp with my weight fluctuating so much due to covid and being depresso.	labels:	episode_done:True

What about the people who are being paid 40p a day in sweltering and unsafe Bangladeshi factories? Factories that are dumping toxic dyes into water sources? We all have a responsibility not to perpetuate the monolithic success of these horrible fast fashion conglomerates.  What gets me about it is that there's a pretty big luxury component to fashion. Clothes are a necessity, but how much do we NEED? Are we really so entitled to large wardrobes and constant output of new stuff?  Of course, the people buying the most stuff aren't poor folks, and without fast fashion some people would legit struggle to have the clothes they need. But I don't like hearing the "what about poor people" argument being used to dismiss the issues entirely. I buy cheap shoes when it's all I can afford... But that doesn't change the fact that people suffered for those cheap shoes to be available to me. It's just a difficult thing to reconcile, because either way, someone suffers.  I certainly don't judge anyone who buys fast fashion, I'd be a hypocrite if I did. I just don't think the issues should be dismissed.	episode_done:True

Anthropologie also stocks them and I’ve bought a couple things on even steeper sale from them, however the fabrics and construction seemed cheaper to me.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Hats - discussion	labels:I don't know anything about "hat energy" but I know that hats, like hair, look best when they're shaped, colored, and styled in a way that suits your face and outfit.  The bolder the hat, the more obvious it may be if you don't know what you're doing, but even with a more understated hat, a clumsy choice is going to be pretty obvious.  I mean, it's *on top of your head.*  I wear a lot of hats and I've been told I wear them well, but I dress in vintage style so I have outfits that are made to be worn with hats, a pretty good frame of reference in terms which hats to wear with which outfits.  More recent maintstream fashion is really not styled to be worn with hats, so fitting a hat in there requires a bit of crafty innovation, and it probably requires reducing your range of hats to the most basic casuals; floppy sunhats, berets, cabbies, beanies and baseball caps.  Each of those styles has an existing set of visual conventions:  While you don't necessarily *need* the whole tweed jacket and oxford shoe getup to pull off a cabbie, for example, taking some queues from that genre of style will help contextualize the cabbie in a way that makes it less jarring to look at.	episode_done:True
text:Hats - discussion	labels:I love hats but hats don’t love me.	episode_done:True
text:Hats - discussion	labels:I think "hat energy" is just the confidence to wear one. My ex used to visibly cringe whenever I tried a hat on and so I believed I was too ugly to wear a hat. After I divorced him, I started wearing hats regularly and now have a wall dedicated to my collection. I needed a little time to get used to seeing myself in a hat and I prefer wearing them with large sunglasses because it looks more stylish to me.	episode_done:False

text:Hats - discussion	labels:My "hat energy" translates to "college kid who skateboards and/or plays hacky sack." As in, I have an entire drawer full of knit beanies (both fitted and slouchy) that I cycle between. I have one in almost every color, some with pompoms, one with my first initial embroidered on, one Nike with a gold metal Nike emblem sewn on, some thin and others thick and chunky. I love beanies of all kind and will never part with my collection. I used to have a couple other random hats, like a straw fedora and a black and white printed sun hat, but they never seemed to mesh well with my fashion sense and I ended up getting rid of them to free up space for... more beanies.	episode_done:True

text:Hats - discussion	labels:I hadn’t heard of “hat energy” before, but I DO believe in it. I also believe it can be faked, as I have done my entire life. High school and college saw my collection of fedoras/trembleys grow. Kind of died for a while. Then my 20s ushered in wider brim hats because I’m pale and hate sun screen.   I get compliments all the time, and people love to say how they can’t pull off a hat. I always tell them I feel the same way and you’ve just gotta commit to it because it’s true.	episode_done:True
text:Hats - discussion	labels:Hats are great. When you wear one with aplomb, people remember you! It’s just a matter of practice. How to remove and put one on in public (which you may have to do, for example in restaurants). There’s hat etiquette which varies in different eras and places, but I go with not wearing a man style hat while eating, and during times of remembrance/commemoration, and when in doubt. I believe ladies hats can be left on indoors.  The other thing is, WIND. If it’s windy, you’ll need a chin strap or have it snugly on. A blown off hat is annoying.	episode_done:True

text:Hats - discussion	labels:Oh, BIG hat energy.  I think hats are the only accessory I consistently wear. Pom-pom toques in the winter, berets/wide-brimmed felt hats whenever it's warmer, and as soon as the sun pops up you better believe I have a beach-sized hat on my head...  ...in the middle of London.   I LOVE hats. I have a wall dedicated to them (best storage option I found, plus it looks pretty damn cool) and I'll wear them forever!	episode_done:True

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:Go on Pinterest and pin things that catch your eye. Once you have a board try and find similarities between the pins (for example ruffles, silk, strappy backs etc) and start searching up those things at stores that are within your price range.  In terms of comfort, look for materials you like and what silhouettes you’re into. If you tend to do tighter tops with more volume at the bottom then look for dresses that match that for example. If you know you like cotton blends look for those.    Also look for stores that carry petite sections or find a tailor in your area  Don’t go crazy trying to push yourself too far out of your comfort zone. Look for things that are your style but that you’ve never worn before.	episode_done:False
text:Similarly, I often look at tv and movies to see what I like - whether it’s a piece of clothing or a general look that character has, it’s a nice starting point to see what you like and don’t like and the aesthetic you might want to go for.  I am 5ft and I find that certain types of clothing are more likely to fit at non petite sizes, like skinny jeans (since they can scrunch up at the bottom a bit and it doesn’t look wierd)and tighter skirts. Brand I have found good petite clothing at include Express, GAP, Ann Taylor, and Loft	labels:	episode_done:True

Find a couple things you like and that you wear consistently and start to add as you go. So many times I convinced myself that I would wear something and it wound up in the back of my closet so just make sure you take your time!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:An easy transition from tees can be a cami (satin or something drapey) with a cropped or duster length cardigan. It seems more put together because you’re combining items and layering, but is still very comfortable. Add jewelry and mix up the shoes and you’re done. Variations of this can take you from super casual to the office to date night.	episode_done:True
text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:I used to always wear jeans and t-shirts too (and still do a lot of the time), but what has helped me is just paying attention to people around me and what they wear. Friends, acquaintances, strangers. For me, this helps a lot more than looking online because I feel like I can't really tell what the clothes look like in real life.  TV shows or movies help too, where I can see how the clothing a character wears contributes to their "vibe" and matches their personality or other things the creators want to show. Sometimes that's even better than real life because so much thought goes into what the characters wear and what it says about them.  A big barrier for me was the cost of buying new clothes when I'm not really sure if I'll like them long-term, so it's helped to borrow or trade clothes with friends to try new things out. One of my friends used to organize a big clothing swap once a year. Thrift stores, Facebook buying & selling groups, and discount places are also a good option.  Another barrier was that I had only really seen fashion as being about creating a feminine image and emphasizing a slim body type. I would always be upset with my body for not looking like that. I've recently learned I feel much more myself in more androgynous and masc clothing, which I think is why I liked jeans and T-shirts so much. Realizing what I actually like to look like makes it feel a lot more natural and intuitive.	episode_done:True
text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:T shirts and jeans are a great staple and can be totally changed up. I basically only wear t shirts and jeans too, but I’ll change it up a bit with different shoes - Chelsea boots, sneakers, timberland boots, loafers.   Also, different Jean types, tops and jewelry can change up your look while still maintaining the “t shirt and jeans” style.   I love to wear (and make) chunky gold jewelry that are cool accessories to laid back looks.	episode_done:True

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:Don’t feel pressured to be something you’re not. Less is more. If you’re happy in simple things, wear simple things.

text:I agree with you, as I aged and had other responsibilities I realised I did not care to follow trends.  Though I enjoy following fashion and learning what is going on. It is interesting to look at it as an expression of culture, social and public mood, technology advances, and as an artistic expression.  It's also interesting to see how fashion percolate (the famous Devil Wears Prada scene on the jumper).  On that same note, as fashion changes, it is difficult not to follow it. Trends come into most clothes we buy no matter what we trie to do.	labels:>Trends come into most clothes we buy no matter what we trie to do.  Exactly. And it's also really difficult to predict what will culturally "stick" as a more longterm trend that may even end up being a "classic." I remember when skinny jeans were becoming a thing and people decried they they'd be a passing trend, when they've gone really strong only until very recently (and even though they're no longer super fashionable, they're still a common "basic" at this point.)   I was recently watching an old episode of "What Not To Wear" and Clinton was aghast at the trend of people wearing white sneakers/trainers to the grocery store and anywhere other than the gym.

text:What is something you've heard as fashion advice that isn't worth following?	labels:I don't think any fashion rule should be followed. You should take heed of them, but there just general guidelines and tips not the holy word of the lord. If you are self conscious of your wide hips, then it's a good thing to be aware that a lot of horizontal striped will exaggerate this. Doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't, just that you should be cognizant to check before buying any horizontal stripes. Pretty much every fashion rule *can* be broken, but it takes you understanding why the rule is the rule before you can understand how & when you can get away with breaking it   I think *most* attempts to inject color theory into style advice is overly reductionist and doesn't quite work for most people (*especially* for non-white people)  I also think that most shoe advice and recommendations should be ignored. If you do not like heels or are not good at walking in heels, than no, 2 inch wedged are *not* a "laid back summer look for a garden party". You're gonna look fucking ridiculous clomping around. On the other hand, if you *love* platforms and know how to rock them, then there's very few circumstances where you can't figure out a way to make platforms work. Plus, people don't pay nearly as much attention to shoes as you'd think anyway. For most people, it's not in our eyeliner of what we look at when we look at a person. So just wear what you like regardless of the kind of shoes deemed "appropriate". I think that with "Personal style", shoes are substantially more personal than style compared to other items.	episode_done:True

Do you remember when MAC Prrr lipglass was huge and everyone was going crazy over JLo's makeup in the All I Have music video?!	labels:I remember Hilary Duff saying her favorite makeup was MAC Lipglass lmao. After that, I noticed how it was promoted everywhere by everyone. And Jennifer Lopez's makeup always looked amazing. She hasn't aged physically since the late 90's.  I still think the best makeup I've ever seen was in Mean Girls. Everything from the color choices to the application. Everyone just looked more alive lol. The baked face/matte colors/highlight and contouring that eventually became popular was pretty in it's own way but I felt like it made everyone look like plastic barbie dolls. I'm glad that trend is slowly dying out and I'm finally seeing more lipglosses and rosy shades being sold again.	episode_done:True

text:I watched the vampire diaries when I was about 13 (I was born in 2000, so I was too young for it when it first came out) and I remember being so jealous that Elena and her friends would wear those bootcut, mid-low rise jeans. In 2013-2015 jeans that were not skinny and up to your ribcage were barely socially acceptable.	labels:I’ve been re-watching Supernatural and the styles the women wore in that show take me back! I kept pointing out to my boyfriend the low-rise bootcut jeans/overall outfit and saying, “oh, I would have worn that in 2008!” I was in High School too when I watched Vampire Diaries and I remember how I wanted to dress like Elena. The Y2K trend I feel isn’t an exact copy of what we wore, but just pieces of the era made modern. Overall, the re-cycling of Y2K trends are very nostalgic for me.	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe not updated	labels:I feel like at 32 years old, I've passed looking at trends and have just figured out over the years what looks good on my body. I dont think anything I own is trendy by today's standards cause anymore I tend to look at fit, rather than style, if that makes sense. I used to walk by shops and be unable to decide which items I wanted to take home cause i thought everything was cute, and then end up with a closet full of stuff I hardly wore or felt embarrassed by later lol. Ive become much more selective and comfortable with the pieces I do choose to invest in, and dont think much about whether or not it's in style.  I still get compliments from younger and older people so I don't *think* I look outdated or backwards, but I dont care if I do, either, haha	episode_done:True

Alas.)	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe not updated	labels:i understand! i think it’s a smart financial approach right now. especially bc we’re, in my opinion, in a very “trendy” phase of fashion right now and a lot of hot styles are not going to last very long.  however, i have nearly the opposite problem! i normally don’t wear what’s “in fashion” as i have a very particular aesthetic, and i felt very very liberated and “seen” by the trends of last spring/summer, bought myself a very nearly full new wardrobe (i also lost a ton of weight so it wasn’t a completely impractical decision) and i am a sitting duck waiting for next spring/summer and i will be wearing everything i bought last year and i don’t give a damn if it’s not the trend anymore.	episode_done:True

text:Totally! I think we will see new trends being available, but average people simply wearing what they have with some updates vs entire wardrobe overhauls. I find it refreshing that there is less pressure to feel fashionable in regards to trends at the moment. I mean... I’m wearing stretch pants and lounge bras half the time now as I WFH.

text:Wardrobe not updated	labels:What makes sense for you, your life, your budget, your mental health, your storage space etc? These are questions I consider for myself.   Following fashion trends can be fun to engage in, but I'd recommend asking yourself whether you follow the trend because you like it or you feel societal pressure. Are you doing it for yourself? If so, is there something else you could be doing to substitute that would cost less money, use up less space, last longer, etc?   I've acquired a few things since Covid, and the later purchases have been way more mindful than what I bought initially. I've been investing more time into hobbies I've been meaning to get back into in lieu of online window shopping mindlessly. You see more things to buy, you'll likely have more urges to shop.   It does feel like my wardrobe is in a time capsule-- more so the idea of "these are clothes I wore pre-Covid" and now "these are the clothes I currently wear." In a way, things feel dated because they are no longer in active rotation. But I don't feel the need to get rid of things I like. If I no longer like them, then there's no reason to hold onto them.  I bought warm clothes for the winter and I've been very grateful. I don't pay a lot of attention to trends as an indicator for what I should buy, but rather if I like something then I might invest time into finding the right version of x piece. But lately... I can't justify too many purchases and that's okay! Enjoying trends vicariously is just as good as owning something.	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe not updated	labels: I feel like (depending on where you live) we are all stuck in a holding pattern. I would normally buy more "work shirts" at this time of year, but there isn't much point since I'm only on the job site about one day a week (and it's so cold indoors, I'm always bundled up anyway).   I've encountered some similar issues before when I had to switch to work from home a few years ago due to a move. A lot of my new purchases went unworn. If I learned anything from that experience, it was to spend money on clothes that are for the house or for trips outside, not for work. In practice, this meant a lot of yoga pants, but also light summer clothes that were suitable for walking the dog. Most of the work staples just didn't even register. I know it isn't fun, but it's not a bad thing to wait and see what happens in your area.	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe not updated	labels:Most of my wardrobe was office appropriate, so I’ve bought some comfy clothes and basics over the past year. I’d love to get some nicer clothes, but I’m WFH and there’s no place or occasion to wear them. I’d love to update my wardrobe, but I don’t want to buy things just to sit in my closet and possibly not fit or be out of style by the time I can wear them. Also, I still don’t know if WFH is temporary or if my employer will decide to keep us remote, so I wouldn’t know yet if I should update my casual or work appropriate wardrobe.	episode_done:True

If Im wearing my black velvet blazer set I’ll do thé likes of and orange and gold Smokey eye to make it more bold and less professional looking! I have a very dressy style with masculine, Victorian, and highly detailed elements so bold colorful makeup makes some of my more stuffy looks less boring. I’ve lately been after doing my foundation putting a bit of blush from the bottom front of my eye bags to the top of my brow bone. I love how it makes makeup a little more unique and makes me look a little less baby faced.  I used to wear very skater boyish/ art kid outfits and hair ( I still respect the style still though ) but wore heavy Instagram glam style makeup.

I have a light lavender/lilac coloured dress that I like to wear a plumb lipstick with or a lilac coloured eyeshadow.

I signed up when I realized that I had promise to pay for a family Italian cruise because I had my first well-paying job - But I didn't seem to be getting ahead even though I was making twice as much as I had before. Zero-based budgeting in general is the way to go but I love YNAB for making that system easy to manage.  The thing that works for me about zero-based is that I can really easily prioritize the things that are important to me and also see the trade-off I'm making for every purchase if I change those priorities. It keeps those little windfalls or pay raises from just vanishing into the ether. I got paid $64 last week for a poshmark sale, and I immediately put that money in my March rent category. Before, I would have gone and bought a new shirt, or spent it all on soup dumplings, or bought a new shirt and then spilled the soup dumplings I also bought on the new shirt. 😅  If fashion is important to you, then you can prioritize that and invest in a wardrobe that will give you joy. If it's travel, put your money toward that instead, and you'll feel the power to walk away from a good sale because you know it's just a distraction from your real goals. I still spend a lot on clothes and eating out, but I no longer feel guilty or stressed about it, because when I spend it's a conscious choice.  I guess this is more general financial advice than specific to OP's situation, but I find it useful for any of us who have expensive hobbies (aka all of mine) or potential big expenses like OP's.	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I have a pretty extensive budget that I still have plenty of room for clothes shopping in! I have had a budget since I started working professionally 3 years ago.  I have three sections: Bills (phone, rent, student loans, power etc), Expenses (food, gas, “fun”) and Savings (anything I’m saving up for: laptop, trips, gifts, my niece’s college fund, hobbies, and clothes! As well as an emergency fund where everything else goes).  I generally consider the clothing fund to be a low priority so I set about $40 a paycheque to it, but I don’t necessarily spend that much every two weeks. I also usually cap it at $500, where if it’s grown to that amount then I take my $40 every two weeks and put it to something else.   Generally I don’t spend all of it before a new paycheque comes along but if I do, I will use some of my “fun” money in expenses to cover the rest.   I have gotten two pay increases in the last two years as well as moved houses twice + paid off my loan (different bill amounts) so whenever I readjust my budget I start with my bills, generally keep my fun + grocery amounts the same, and then increase my savings categories a bit while mostly prioritizing putting the excess into my emergency account. When I started working I think I was setting aside $20 or $25 for clothes, now up to $40.  Maybe more long-winded than you wanted but that’s the jist :)	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I had a career and location change where I had a lot more disposable income than before and I definitely overspent on clothing/shoes/bags I didn’t need. It’s weird because it’s something I never did when I made less money. This years focus is to pay off debt and sell items I’m not actually using or don’t actually love. And stick to my budget on mint.com.	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:Raising awareness of what I actually use.   Complimenting people's insistence that you budget, you also need to know where YOU will find the best VALUE of your wardrobe spending. What do you use? What are statement pieces of your fashion? What brings you the most joy?   * I have been using a closet inventory app. Stylebook tracks the costs and number of times I actually wear my clothes with which outfits too.   Although some styling habits might seem like common sense (like basic quality t-shirts and winter coating pay off), I learnt about other neat tendencies:  Scarves vs Sweaters. Scarves might seem more versatile and can pair with so many outfits for other people. But honestly, I live in sweaters.. maybe because it's cold... or maybe because I want to be cozy. If I didn't have the style app, I would probably think about 'investing' in a cashmere scarf. Now, I'm so much happier to budget for vintage pre-loved cashmere sweaters.   Do I even put on my accessories? Bracelets? Necklaces? Nope. Apparently throwing on colourful clothes is my go-to. I save so much money, not buying any jewelry - no bracelets, no necklaces, no earrings. (It makes my savings happier)  * I prioritize my next purchases from there.   The other thing I've invested in: **10x spending more in proper clothing care.** Proper laundry detergent, keeping old toothbrushes to scrub stains, a foldable drying rack, a sweater comb, and leather conditioners.   * Clothing care, only way to keep clothes looking professional and last.	episode_done:False
text:Thanks for posting this! I’ve had the Stylebook app forever now but haven’t put in the work to enter all the necessary info.

text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I don't have a prescribed budget that I stick to, but I try my best to ensure I max out my generous 401k match and other accounts provided from my employer. I have a certain amount I keep stashed away as an emergency fund if I can't work for several months, some for paranoia from being raised lower-income and some for the fact that I live in a HCOL area. Other than that, I am super flexible with how I spend my money, which is ~dangerous~. Luckily, fashion and food are my only pricey hobbies. I'm really privileged to be in this position with a rewarding job and understand that this is not the norm for many.  I got a substantial promotion and raise this last summer, so I definitely have been overspending this year as I try to ramp my wardrobe back to my ideal self, rather than my more practical self; I was also purchasing a limited number of pieces since I was in a client-facing role making half as much. I moved from buying clothes on the more affordable spectrum (mainly pre-scandal Everlane, and KOTN) to buying pricier pieces, usually in the pre-owned designer spectrum (mainly bags, shoes, and outerwear ranging from $200-$3000). I'm finally scaling back by having a curated wishlist and aiming to resell any unused pieces (easier said than done).	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:Hmm I don't set money aside for clothes specifically. I have a general budget divided into monthly bills, savings, food, and other expenses. Clothes usually fall under "other expenses", unless it would be a huge purchase that I'd have to save up for specifically - but that rarely happens).  I only buy clothes like 3-4 times a year, usually to replace old stuff, or if my wardrobe needs some extra something, or if I find a really nice item that I'll definitely wear a lot. I know what sort of styles, colors, fabrics etc I tend to go for. I avoid impulse purchases, I already have enough stuff sitting around because I have nothing to match it with or nowhere to wear it lmao	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:Budget + plan ahead! I definitely fell for the lifestyle creep when I first started working, and it unfortunately took me too long to dig my way out. Now that I have, I use the 50/30/20 budget, and if there's something I want and it's not currently in my budget, I'll wait until the next month to get it when there is. I also mostly shop at Aritzia bc their sizing works best for me, so I've also learned their sale cycle and I usually plan ahead so that I do most of my clothing shopping during those times.	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I finished up grad school last year and started working full time, so I totally went through that transition. For me, I don’t have a set clothing budget, but I do have a monthly “wants” budget that clothing purchases go into. I try to be strategic and identify gaps in my wardrobe and work from there, buying things as I have the money/need for them. It has been a big change going from mostly buying secondhand to having more to spend, but I still love to thrift/posh etc. My budget now is significantly more than it was in grad school though, so I have more flexibility.   One of the more difficult parts for me was feeling like I needed nicer, high quality items for work. Those get expensive! For example I recently bought a wool dress coat since I only had a parka. I am lucky in that my work is quite casual, so most of my wardrobe works for both work and casual stuff.	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:When I had to buy business/work clothes, I invested in a really nice, fitted black suit, a couple of collared shirts, and a pair of flats. Those were my basic essentials that I knew I could mix and match with a lot of stuff. Everything else I picked up at Goodwill.   My coworkers commented on my cute clothes so I think it was a great strategy. I collected a pretty huge work closet for practically pennies.  After that, I've never had a clothing budget. My closet is a pretty good deterrent of overspending because I hate clutter and I hate having a crammed closet so if I think I dont have room and an item I'm looking at isn't worth creating room in my closet, I dont buy it.	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:For the last few years I started tracking all of my spending. I then make an educated guess for what my budget should be for the upcoming year, based on past averages and predictions about what type of life events might be coming up that year.   Each paycheck, I set some money aside to my Girly Savings. This way, when I do a bunch of shopping or find an expensive item, it's not just coming out of my general spending money.   Currently I'm setting aside $400/month to my Girly Savings which includes clothes, makeup, skincare, hair and accessories. I buy most of my clothes in large batches in the spring and fall so it helps me to have an accumulated stash of cash.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:Honestly, I feel like the best way to be sustainable is to just buy less.

text:Absolutely!! I do what I can, but mostly I just try to buy less because even cheap clothes are a huge portion of my income. If your budget is such that a $50 jacket is already a big purchase you're only doing every few years and a $900 jacket is impossible, it's ok to buy the cheap version and keep yourself warm.	labels:1000%! I have a parka from American Eagle that I got in high school (I graduated 11 years ago...) that I still wear every winter. Was it sustainably and ethically made? Likely not, but thanks to that $70 purchase I’ve avoided buying who knows how many new coats.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:My personal philosophy: If all you can afford is fast fashion, but you buy minimally and wear frequently and for a long time, no one should judge you for not being sustainable. That’s absolutely a valid way to participate in slow fashion. If you can afford ethical brands though, then I think you should purchase from them instead.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:I love that you brought this up. Of course, there are are ethical retailers out there that have lower prices, but if you are young and/or poor, there is a certain amount of fast fashion that you need to buy because it fits your price/budget. Even though it isn’t ideal, not all fast fashion is gone in a couple years, if you are buying less trendy pieces you can wear for a while.  Many things I’ve bought from fast fashion retailers I’ve had for years - I haven’t changed my height or weight much in over 10 years, so I have tops from Old Navy I have had for 10 years and other clothes that have lasted way past 5 years.  Reducing consumption is a key part of ethical fashion and even if you buy it from a retailer that is cheaper because that’s what you can afford, if you keep it a long time and don’t buy a bunch of clothes all the time, you are reducing demand and helping the environment.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:I’ve struggled with this as well. I think the most important thing is to just consume less. Easier said then done that’s for sure.   I’ve definitely had clothes from forever 21 last longer than aritzia. I’ve gotten clothing from thrift stores that have lasted me longer as well.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:The reason why fast fashion is often seen as bad is because fast fashion is synonymous with trendy clothes that wear out within 2/3 washes and unethical labor practices.   Trends change very fast and If a shirt is $5, how much do you think each person who worked on it is getting paid?  I personally have a hard time believing in sustainable fashion nowadays because so many brands that marketed themselves as sustainable have been found to use the same practices as unsustainable ones. This includes high end fashion labels that sell a T-shirt for $2000 but pays their employees the same as forever 21.   So I think of you can get multiple wear out of a fast fashion item, it’s a win for you as an individual. More expensive doesn’t always mean better practices or quality. I’ve bought more expensive items that lasted just as long or not even as long as my Zara items.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:r/zerowaste has had discussions on the topic. So has r/frugal I guess and there are a few other subs. I don't think there is a fixed rule. The world is changing too fast for that.  Maybe the key is to scale down spending, thrift as much as possible and be critical when shopping. Price does not necessarily equals quality.    The way I see it, high-end brands are just expensive. Nowadays luxury brands seem to be as mass-produced as anything else. Profit above all.  I also have realized that brand loyalty in the 21st century might have become a bit silly. I have trusted brands in the past but it seems pointless now, bc even sizing can change randomly.  Maybe customers shd spend more carefully. Buy what is needed, make sure what you are getting is looking good on you, it looks well-made and it feels nice on your skin. It is better to have fewer garments that make you look superb than many trashy pieces that will not do you any justice. Every person has their beauty, we shd only have and wear what makes us look fabulous.  My two cents	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:The most sustainable choice is the one that is already in your closet. If you already own something that wasn’t made ethically or sustainably, there’s no benefit in trashing it if you still like it and can use it. In a similar vein, there’s already so much clothing out there, that buying something second hand that’s still in good shape is often an option.  I think aritzia and j crew are still fast fashion, just more expensive fast fashion than old navy or forever 21- they’re still introducing tons of new products and feeding in to the consumerist drive to have the newest things.   No one is perfect, but we can strive to reduce our impact on an individual scale and aim to reduce our purchases, focus on buying used when it’s possible and try to purchase ethical and local when it’s not.  I definitely am not perfect on this front, but I try and buy from consignment shops as a first choice when I want something, and I’m working to choose smaller brands that have clear supply chains and ethical manufacturing. If it’s made in Canada (where I’m from) then that’s awesome.  At the end of the day I hope that my fashion choices exploit the least number of people and has the lowest environmental impact possible, and often that looks like me telling myself I don’t really need the new thing, even if I think it’s amazing and really really want it	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:Capitalism has made us believe we can always buy our way out of problems--that consuming differently will fix the consumption problem. The true antidote, like others have said, is buying less and taking good care of the items you have and like (ethically sourced or not). I don't think there is much difference between Forever 21 and J Crew, just the price. No one is going to advertise "buy less", "wash your stuff gently!" because...how do you make money doing that? It's on us to see the sham and make the changes necessary	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:Sustainable consumption complicated and everyone is going to have their own ways to go about it. It's good that you're keeping and using what you buy for years (no matter what the brand), so that's a start.  Synthetics are made of plastic and can release microplastics into the environment when they are worn and washed. Cotton takes up lots of land and water. Leather lasts way longer than pleather but then you have the cruelty aspect and tanning leather does require a lot of harmful chemicals. Expensive doesn't always mean ethical, but ethical clothing does tend to cost more. There is always going to be a footprint - not buying anything at all is probably the safest and most sustainable way but obviously we still need things now and then!   It's taken me YEARS to change my habits and transition to a better wardrobe, and even then I'm still not fast fashion-free. I had to wait to use up what I had and be able to afford something better. It took time to refine and define my style to determine what pieces would give me the most mileage. Each person will have to determine what is important to them when it comes to sustainability. Like, I'm not very picky about my purses but I tend to vet my shoes and what my options are when it comes time to repair or dispose of them.	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I usually don’t experience any negativity when shopping in the men’s dept. Go after what you’re into and don’t worry about the employees anyway! One thing I will say is for pants or shorts, in my experience, it’s better to buy masculine styled clothes fit for women. Then you avoid the weird men’s fitting and bulge.	episode_done:False
text:Agreed. My son is FTM and finds most men’s pants to be problematic because his hips aren’t straight. He does a lot of elastic waists and athletic wear. You’re probably better off with bottom items designed for women. As for the employees...I wouldn’t worry. People are more open minded than ever, and if they do act rude you can take your business elsewhere.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:No one has ever bothered me, I’ve even had a female sales clerk agree with me that men’s shirts are more comfortable.  I typically only buy men’s tops, tees or hoodies or sweatshirts. I don’t try for fitted, only loose, and usually go for second hand since I mostly wear it as loungewear.  Pants I haven’t had much luck with. If the waist can be cinched small enough, that means the hips barely fit or they are way too tight when I sit down or bend over. A medium is too large and can’t be cinched small enough.  Board shorts/basketball shorts are ok, the leg is loose enough to accommodate the lady hips, regardless of the waist size. I generally don’t like the look of these on me, but you may have different preferences.	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I only have bought outdoorswear that is designed for men, but SAs don't seem weird about it.

text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:Not trans and don't dress intentionally masculine, but I'm a woman who shops in the men's section all the time and it's fine! Just do it and after the first couple of times it'll feel easy. Anybody who is rude to you has the problem, not you, but it's never happened to me, including while shopping in other countries - - in Japan I wouldn't fit in most women's clothes, so I basically have to shop the men's and they seemed to think it was interesting and were happy to make the sale.  Maybe not the most apposite comment for your situation but wanted you to have the perspective that there are a lot of reasons you might be shopping there so you don't even have to feel like you're under undue scrutiny. One more suggestion: if you can, it might be easier to shop in a bigger city; in New York nobody would blink.	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I used to get heaps of stuff at the men's as well. Some  pieces are much nicer when made for them, don't ask me why.  Just go there and if you feel uncomfortable you can always say you have to try them on in order to see whether it fits your husband/partner/boyfriend/etc.   I actually did this many times, including for my dad, bc I knew how it shd look on me in order to fit them (sleeve length, shoulders etc).  Staff shd not really care, I guess -?   Imho, trousers are a bit trickier but I have bought men's shorts and pants as well, you just have to check them out and see....  Good luck and happy shopping :)	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:My partner shops in the men's section and hasn't had any issues, to my knowledge.   Brands that have worked include Lucky brand (especially for jeans), Banana Republic (boxer briefs and button-downs), and I think American Eagle (t-shirts, maybe shorts I think). I'll try to think of others.   They've also had a lot of luck at a certain local thrift store that carries a lot of menswear, which admittedly can be tricky to find and is especially challenging during a pandemic. That's a great way to find out what brands and styles work best for your body though: try out a ton of different ones.   Consider if there are any ways to access hand-me-downs from friends for this, too - my friends had a lot of clothing swaps in the before times and lots of my queer friends wear or used to wear men's clothes. If not your friends, there may be groups in your area that share or trade clothes. And on that note, regardless of your own identity, you might find some other ideas online by looking at queer fashion resources online.   Regarding the brands I've mentioned above, my partner's physique is relatively long and lean, so take this advice with a grain of salt if you are plus sized and/or generally have curvier proportions. For example, I'm close in size to them or possibly even a bit smaller right now, but I am smaller on top than on the bottom. That's pretty inconvenient for men's clothes, so I would probably need to shop a bit differently. There are definitely plus-sized and curvy queer bloggers out there who look awesome in menswear wardrobes, so hopefully you can find some inspiration about how to make menswear work for your shape.   Finally... If you have the funds, there are definitely custom options available. My partner got a custom suit for our wedding, including some tailored shirts. You can also get off the rack clothes tweaked by a tailor, which is probably something I would want to do.	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I have shopped the men's department before and never had issues with sales associates. The biggest thing was once, they wouldn't let me in the dressing room and I had to go to one on another floor, because there were already men in there (but everyone had their own room and the only communal space was the mirror area? Like, not sure why it mattered, I ended up making the purchase at the register near the other dressing room and the guy lost a sale, which may have been petty but...I'd used that dressing room before with zero issue, so 🤷‍♀️) But I have had issues with some cuts of men's clothes--they aren't really cut for boobs and hips, so I had to get them tailored. There are some companies that do masculine/androgynous looks for those bodies, like Kirrin Finch, that might be worth checking out!	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I work at a mid-higher end men's clothing store and we have women come in regularly for themselves. I can honestly say we 100% don't care who tries on/buys our clothes! We're just happy to help you find something you like and are comfortable in :) The only reason I can think of why you might not be able to try clothes on is if the store doesn't have their dressing rooms open, which unfortunately is the case for a decent amount of retailers around me. If you feel uncomfortable you can always just buy items you think you might like and return them. When it comes to pants I do know they're cut to have extra room in the "bulge" area. I'd recommend finding a lower-cut mens pant just so there will be less room in the fly. Welcome to the world of actually opaque white clothing!	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:Is there a way you could achieve the same vibe/aesthetic but using different cuts or shapes?

Maybe there’s something similar you could find too.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I noticed it’s the pants with pockets that creates that problem.  Maybe sewing them shut would help the silhouette issue.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:One thing we don’t talk about much is the importance of tailoring and undergarments for those 50s and 60s looks.  There’s a reason a lot of the actresses on Mad Men had to wear crinolines and girdles and cone bras with their costumes; that’s what created the silhouette.  Also 50s and 60s inspired clothes that have a lot of stretch in the fabric won’t hang or move the same. ETA:  oops, I see you said ‘men’s fashion’.  The part of my comment re: tailoring and fabric content still applies!	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:This is pretty much what finding your style is.  You're taking what you like or whatever vision you have in your head, and combining it with your reality; your budget, your time investment, your lifestyle, & your actual body.  That said, it's not impossible to pull of a specific look, but if it plays against your strengths, but it's going to be more of a time investment to get it right.  The most efficient way to do this would be to learn how to sew, so that you can either tailor or make everything yourself.  Alternatively, you've got to try on a ton of clothes to get the fit you wan,t and probably still need to get things tailored.  There are a ton of ways that you can get an outfit to lean one way or the other, either through styling or accessories.  Personally, I love a good menswear inspired look; but I don't love it on my body and I'm not gonna be bothered with finding curvy, petite pants when I don't even particularly like pants.  However, chopping off my hair really helped me feel a lot more comfortable wearing more feminine silhouettes without it feeling so feminine.  It might make sense to pick out the elements that work for you (colours? materials? tops?) and mixing it with other things that you like/work for you body.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I definitely feel this. I have a large butt/hips and do often find that they impact the shape of silhouettes that I'm trying to wear. I'm very inspired by menswear as well and dress fairly androgynously. I tend to modify menswear silhouettes slightly so that I can achieve something similar. I personally feel much better in high waisted pants with a tucked in shirt/sweater - somehow I feel like it emphasizes my lower body less and gives me a sleeker line from top to bottom, so when I'm drawing influence from menswear I tend to modify it with a higher waistline. I also make sure that I'm defining my upper body with tops that are more structured around the shoulder. Drop shoulders don't play well with me.  I find with these tweaks I'm able to both find a nice balance where I don't feel like I'm fighting against my body and I'm also able to invoke more masculine references and play with most silhouettes I like. Although it did take me a lot of trial and error to figure out it out.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:It took me quite a bit of time and money to realise that there are some styles I like looking at but do not suit me - either my body type or my personality, or both.  The hardest to let go of was the sort of floaty, drapey, effortless boho style. I wanted to waft around the place like a modern Romantic whilst gardening and being all artsy and shit. But my shape is basically round with hints of hourglass, my personality is not best suited to wafting anywhere (I bounce, mostly), and show me mud or art supplies and I will be covered in them before I've actually got near them. And any skirt that's made of light enough material to drape and waft elegantly, or goes below my knees, is going to be ripped to shreds within a day. So yeah - I admire those looks on other people and have discovered a style I like, that's practical for me and reflects my personality a bit.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:Figure out what inspires you about the style and then "translate" that to your own shape (and vibe and lifestyle etc). The retro men's khakis probably look good on the men in the photos because they're tailored to flatter that specific shape - they communicate ease and perfection and the possibility of summer fun. Try a capri pant in a bright or summery color that fits your shape to communicate those vibes on yourself.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I feel you on this. I love me some 20s and 60s, but my DNA said LOLNOPE  A lady on this very same site told me that she’s got wide hips, but can still wear some stuff designed for the “ideal” 20s body with help from shapewear.

In my case I think the problem stems from me getting pieces that I like aesthetically but that have something wrong with them that I ignored/didn’t realize until later. For instance I got these shorts that looked really cute but got really wrinkly around the crotch after I’d sat down, and then they just looked like a monstrosity. Like my entire outfit was completely overshadowed by my goddamn crotch haha. I ended up donating them because I realized that even though they were a style I liked and a great color, the fabric was not right for me. Getting a good pair of khakis that flatter your curves will go a long way. Get them tailored if there is something wrong with the fit on an otherwise good pair of pants. Just look for that holy grail pair that fits you nicely, and don’t buy stuff that is *almost* good enough but has a problem (unless it’s a problem tailoring can fix).	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I struggle with this as well, but I have sometimes succeeded in making a style work that didn't come naturally to me. The things that help me the most are:  1) Really studying the references I like. Where is the silhouette loose? Where is it tight? At what point on a limb are the seams tailored to fall? What are the other key styling details I need to recreate? With proper tailoring, I think you can recreate a lot of looks (think of how much contouring your makeup can change your face; it's easy to create illusions on your body even if your body proportions don't cater to the typical silhouette of the lewk)  2) Take photos of your attempts and study those. Having a reference photo of what you tried and then studying it in a similar way can really help you hone in on what's working and what's not. I especially recommend looking back on the photo over the course of a couple days. Seeing a photo of my own styling after some time has passed since I created the look helps me see what is and isn't working more objectively.  3) Experiment, experiment, experiment. This was easier when there wasn't a pandemic and you could go try lots of things on, but it can still be doable. And it often takes a LOT of experimentation, but it can be really fun if you're motivated to expand your style. May not be worth it for everyone though! I think it takes a hobbyist's amount of effort.   Of course, sometimes it may just be that you appreciate a style more on others than on yourself (I will never feel like myself in a bohemian look), or you don't appreciate it enough on yourself to invest the time it would take to nail the execution (which is totally fine!)	episode_done:False
text:I find photos super useful when I *cover my face* and revisit the photos a couple days later. I am able to be much more impartial about fit & proportions and am less hypercritical.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:kind of all of them? It seems like you have to pay pretty steep prices now to get the quality of clothes that mid-price mall brands had in the 1990s and early 2000s. It seems that most stores have switched to a model of selling poor quality pieces at huge markups with the expectation that they will sell most of the stock at clearance prices. The GAP used to have quality staples, and J Crew was "fancy." Now GAP is really the same quality as Old Navy, and don't know what J Crew is anymore. The quality has certainly dropped, but I also don't get what is up with the designs since you can't even get a reasonable women's suit there these days. Madewell is not made well. Anthropologie used to sell unique pieces with really good construction, now it's roughly the same as other fast fashion, though I do appreciate that they added petite and plus sizing and carry some high end brands too. Levi's main line is terrible now, and to get the heritage quality, you need to get the Made and Crafted line, which is really expensive!  I mostly shop secondhand because I can't afford the stuff I like. When buying new, I try to wait for sales and avoid buying anything "final sale" or with complicated returns unless I know it will work. Clothes that I used to get at Anthropologie, I now get from Sezane, Ulla Johnson, Doen, and Samantha Pleet. I started buying vintage jeans over Madewell/Levi's or expensive craft brands—my 1980s Chic and Gitano jeans were probably sold at K-Mart/Target but are better quality than anything I have gotten from Madewell. I don't wear jeans/denim enough to justify craft denim prices. Patagonia is still very high quality technical wear; I just scope out the Tyler sport outlet and secondhand for deals. Shoes are hard because I don't like to get them secondhand. I switched from Adidas to Veja and Diemme for sneakers (you can find Diemme shoes for huge markdowns on Yoox during the winter and summer sales—I don't think they are worth retail price).	episode_done:False

text:Clothes are not the only item that work like this. I hope this is not considered too off-topic, but ...the Revere Ware brand was one that went downhill rapidly after World Market bought Corning (which own Revere Ware) in 1998. I wrote this to the company more than ten years ago:  *At one time, Revere Ware meant quality. After maybe a decade of use, I bought a new Revere Ware tea kettle to replace one that had finally worn out. It lasted a few months before breaking. "A fluke" I thought, and bought another. It lasted even a shorter period of time. I am looking for a stove top tea kettle that will stand up to daily use that is not a disposable item. Clearly, this is not Revere Ware.  I will never buy a Revere Ware anything ever again.*   They then offered to send me a new tea kettle. I wrote back:  *While I appreciate this offer, I will never buy another Revere Ware product ever again.*  *I recently inherited some nice Revere Ware copper-bottomed pots, which are probably 50 years old (or more). These I will continue to use, as they are the quality that one used to associate with the brand.*  *But it is clear that Revere Ware no longer cares about providing a durable product. I have no interest in having you replace a tea kettle with one will break in the space of several weeks.*  *Good luck with the business model you have chosen*   And the business model? Well, World Kitchen discontinued Revere Ware in 2018. They ran it into the ground, until the brand name meant nothing. It's just really sad.	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True

text:How is sezane quality for you? Do they hold up?   I love the aesthetic, but both times I tried ordering from them, I was so disappointed with the feel of the fabric and thought I wouldn’t want to pay more than Madewell prices for the quality.	labels:It really depends what you get. My Sezane silk pieces are high quality for the price, especially during the archives sale. My 100% merino wool sweater is also super soft, warm, and pretty—as soft as cashmere but warmer and without all the pilling. I don't like the jeans and would avoid the viscose and polyester pieces. The shoes are overpriced; I have a few pairs that I got secondhand but I won't be buying any more. I have some good Sezane dresses too but they aren't as consistently good as the blouses. One thing I quite like about Sezane is that returns are free and easy, even during Archives sale. The customer service has been good in my experience too—if there are issues with your order, you usually get credit notes or free gifts.  The best quality pieces have just really thoughtful details—beautifully designed patterns, nice buttons, buttons up the back (so no gaping in front!), viscose (as opposed to polyester) linings, laces made out of cotton so they sit well and aren't itchy. It you like a tailored fit or have a very curvy body type the fit may not be idea. But I kind of like that tops are boxy/oversized because they fit my larger bust and shoulders, and I can just tuck them in for my preferred silhouette.  It's hard to describe how the pieces have held up over time because they are typically things I wear to work, and I haven't been to work in almost a year. I had one viscose dress that shrank, so I swore off the viscose! My silk shirts have done great with just hand washing. I have a wool coat that I got secondhand that has gotten very pilly, but I think that's just the fabric. I have had it for years, and there are no tears in the lining or loose buttons or misshapenness (issues I have had with many winter coats before). The linen is a little on the rougher side, but my linen pieces have kept their shape and the color didn't bleed with hand washing. I also have a secondhand pink cotton blouse that I put through the washing machine all the time and it still looks great.	episode_done:True

You can also find good stuff at lower end vintage stores and vintage by the pound. There is a cute antique store that opened up near me with a vintage clothing room, and I got one of my favorite skirts there for about $25. It's a corduroy midi skirt from some western wear brand, probably late 1980s-early 1990s. Thredup doesn't really do vintage, but if you search brands you like regularly, you can get super good deals on nice brands. I got a basically new Ulla Johnson dress for $60.

text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:I used to work in a funeral home and can tell you that I've seen it all. There will always be the guy that shows up in jeans and a barely nice t shirt, for some reason. There will always be a woman who shows up wearing a skin tight tiny club dress that barely covers her bum, but I guess she thought it was okay because it was black and also a dress? I've seen people wear sheer black clothing like somehow that's supposed to be a shirt. I've also been to funerals with wacky dress codes: everyone wears Hawaiian shirts or the everyone wears a chosen colour associated with the deceased.   But good rules to stick by: Wear clothes that are darker in colour; black, navy, dark green/purple. White dress shirts are appropriate, but having a jacket to go over it is ideal. If it's the summer and it's hot; boys, skip the jacket, but wear a tie and tuck in the shirt and girls, wear a flowy dress, ideally to the knee, with a light shawl or dress pants and a light blouse.   The purpose of the funeral is to pay respect to the deceased, and you want to keep the focus there. Wearing something too bright, or tight, or short, or casual can distract from what's going on and the importance of the funeral. The goal is essentially to blend in, not stand out, because the funeral isn't about anyone other than the deceased, so the attention goes to them. It's one of the few times that I believe everyone should put aside their own ego and allow the day to be about the deceased.	episode_done:False

The last funeral I went to was for my partner’s grandfather; he was a big bold man who liked bright bold shirts and hated black. We wore the loudest shirts we could get our hands on, most were made by my MIL. True they were still button ups but they definitely shunned the traditional funeral wear.	episode_done:False
text:That’s so cool.

And honestly, we all felt almost *happy*, like we were celebrating his life rather than mourning his death. There were a lot of tears, but there were a lot of laughs and smiles.

I did see people mostly in what I would call "Sunday Best" and this ranged from skirts + heels to nice pants and a simple knit top. However these were all funerals for people who lived in a super small town their whole lives and were farmers most of their lives, so YMMV!	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:I’ve been unfortunate enough to have been to two funerals in the past few years, and the idea of wearing all black to a funeral doesn’t really seem to be a thing in Australia. I wore all black both times because I thought that was what you were supposed to wear but lots of people wore casual clothing. I’m talking singlet (tank top), shorts and thongs (flip flops). I was very taken aback that people would wear that to a funeral but I guess them being there is the most important thing.	episode_done:False
text:Im in aus and the last funeral I went too (for an elderly aunt) there were a group of early 20 year old women in melb cup crossed with club wear. They were cousins of cousins type thing.  I'm talking like orange neon body con mini mini dresses with the fake tan, huge fascinators, glittery platform stilettos. When they walked in they seemed to realise it was not appropriate and spent a lot of the church service trying to yank their dresses over their bums and looking awkward.   At my wedding my brother rocked up with holey jeans, a flanno and a bouquet of dead roses he got from the servo for free.   I'm from syd so maybe that's it because people from melb really out do us in the fashion stakes.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:generally quite formal although in my family we don't tend to do black.

They've got a few options on amazon, but they're 40 or so bucks and that seems a bit much for something that may be awesome or very dated/weird looking in actuality.   I don't anticipate they'll get around to my vaccine until fall if not later, so I'm not "dressing" for summer at this point.

text:Same, My mom would set outfits together in the closet at first but I would always mix and match so she eventually stopped at around 4 years old. As long as I had clothes on my body appropriate for the weather she let me do what I wanted (even from before I could actually put on the clothes on my own). Some days I would literally put on a clown wig with my clothes and my mom let me roll with it. I’m 24 now but we did a lot of shopping limited too and thrifting at the goodwill &salvation army. My sister and I were the same size in everything until after we graduated high school so we always shared a single wardrobe. I could pick out what I wanted (within reason) even from a really early age.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:For the parents of girls	labels:My mom and dad bought all my clothes until I got a job and started buying all my own stuff.

My mom and I have very similar body types, but somehow my dad was, and still is, better at finding things that fit me nicely. My mom never really pushed her personal style on me and my sister, even though she bought and picked out 99% of our clothes growing up because it’s just hard to find little girls clothes that are the same style as women’s. My dad just liked to go in stores on a whim and ask employees what was in style at the moment, so he picked out some pretty good things.	episode_done:False

My parents were super controlling over what I wore, and I hated it.   So for her, we try our best to compromise. Like, you have to get dressed for school. Even if you are more comfortable in sweats than you are in PJs, we can compromise with athletic wear, but they have to be clean and fit correctly.   Now, in high school, she’s gone more towards skater/alt kid, which means she steals my clothes and shoes.	episode_done:True
text:For the parents of girls	labels:I have three kids, one girl, one boy and one trans-boy (13, 10, 15) who still dresses fairly feminine. My kids have always been allowed to pick their own clothes and style them how they want. Sometimes I give them advice on their fashion choices which they are free to ignore. They love my style and frequently steal stuff from my closet.  We don't have a lot of body type discussions in regards to clothes, because I don't want that to be their focus. I want them to focus on creativity and enjoyment of their clothes. Plus for my trans kid, their hourglass figure is a stressor for them. If they are struggling to style something, I help them out.	episode_done:True
text:For the parents of girls	labels:My daughter dresses herself, and chooses her own clothing. She is a whole and intact separate human being from me and has autonomy and her own sense of style. She is a late teen now, but this has been true since she has been old enough to put on her own clothing. In her middle school years she started altering her clothes, changing cuts and retailoring them to suit her taste.   I don’t make comments about her body or what I think she should do with it beyond staying safe and healthy.	episode_done:True

I just had to keep receipts, and subtract the cost when we got home. Besides cutting down on “you don’t really need this” arguments, I actually ended up learning some useful lessons from the process—in order to set my budget for the year, it was my job to figure out what I needed and lay out a proposal, which was negotiating practice (my sister and I competed to see who could get a bigger one approved!), and we had to use Excel to log everything. I might’ve whined a bit about the process in the moment, but now I see that it was a neat strategy, and I’m grateful for it.	episode_done:False

text:For the parents of girls	labels:My daughter is two and while she loves helping dress me (I'll ask her what colour I should wear today and she'll have VERY firm opinions about that), she's still utterly indifferent to dressing herself and prefers to run around naked XD         I absolutely HATED how I was dressed as a kid (lots of home made clothes in my grandma's very questionable fabric choices... the clothes were cute, the fabric would be like orange and purple plaid or garish green and gold stripes (why grandma, WHY????), so I have a lot of name brand clothes for my daughter that I got second hand (gap, tommy Hilfiger, tea collection, persnickety, etc.) for like $2-5 a piece (FB marketplace is really good in my area - pre-covid, people would just invite you into their front hallways, drop bins of nearly new toddler and baby clothes in front of you, and then let you rifle through them and then charge you a flat price for each item you picked.  Found so much good stuff that way.)      I'm very much going to let her develop her own style and experiment from as early as she wants.  As long as she is weather appropriate, I plan on taking a supportive, hands off approach once she actually shows interest.    She has definite fit preferences now though (when I do dress her, leggings are a must - no jeans or wide legged pants).  She also hates long sleeves.	episode_done:True

text:For the parents of girls	labels:Mom of two little girls - 4 years old and 20 months old. The four year old dresses herself in whatever she wants. If it is not weather appropriate, I make her adjust (like a long sleeve shirt under a tank dress). She rarely matches but I think it builds independence, confidence, and creativity. She hates it when I ask her to wear something specific (like for a holiday) so I just try to buy special outfits we will both love. I let her pick out some of what I buy for her (give her some options to pick from). We shop mostly online so it’s easy for me to have some control over what she can choose.   The 20 month old pretty much wears hand me downs lol and I mostly pick what she wears but she’s starting to prefer to select herself (she’ll tell me “pick dress” in the morning to tell me she wants to choose a dress). I will let her pick her clothes more and more as she becomes more independent.   I imagine over time my girls will start to put together more and more fashionable outfits as they become more aware of style and what their peers are wearing. I will always let them choose for themselves and only intervene when what they want to wear is truly inappropriate for some reason. And even then I will continue to give them options for alternatives and let them choose. It’s their body after all!	episode_done:True

text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:Oof, I definitely know those thoughts. I'm sorry your brain is being a jerk right now. <3  Something I've had some success with (and YMMV) is to constantly remind myself that "Clothes are supposed to fit ME, I'm under no obligation to fit THEM." If a pair of pants doesn't fit me comfortably, then the problem is with the pants, not my body. Items of clothing are inanimate objects and I owe them nothing. It's far from a perfect system and I don't always succeed, but it does help sometimes.  On a more practical front, have you considered using a tailor? From the problems you describe it sounds like you've got more of a waist-to-hip/leg difference than most brands allow for, and if that's the case, it's actually something that a tailor can fix pretty easily (and often relatively cheaply.) You would just buy pants that fit your legs comfortably and get the waist taken in. Fair warning, though: once you've worn clothes that actually fit you the way they're supposed to you'll never be satisfied with ill-fitting pieces again.	episode_done:True

text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:not sure if this helps contribute to the conversation, but i gained a little weight during covid, which isnt the problem, the problem is that i was eating shitty food all the time. i went up in bra size and pants about 1-2 sizes.  &#x200B;  so i made a point to go through my pants/shirts (i wear alot of crop tops in warmer months) and put them into a bag and they go in the back of the closet until i want to try them on again.

text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:I don't think there's anything wrong with preferring dresses and leggings and it doesn't inherently signify that you are somehow unworthy for pants or "letting yourself go".   The thing is, historically speaking, dresses were actually far more practical for a woman's body due the cyclical changes we all experience, from menstrual bloating/cramping, to minor weight fluctuations, to pregnancy and breastfeeding (historically there wasn't much choice about the last two but obviously now there is), cuz you could cinch up or let out your dress depending on how you were doing.   It's only now that stretchy fabric is truly mainstream that pants have truly become as practical and cost effective in that they can tolerate a lot more cyclical size changes, which are *normal*.  Edit: not to mention all the times people would gain and lose weight due to the availability of food.   I'd say I have a pretty confident mindset and 90% of my non work wardrobe is dresses and skirts/shirt combos. I wear undersummers in the spring and summer, leggings and sweater tights in the winter and I've gotten SO MUCH MORE USE out of my dresses... They lasted me up until my 8th month of pregnancy, I barely had to buy maternity clothes.

text:I cannot thank you enough for this! I’m a huge history buff,and I’m really interested in fashion and costumes, so the whole historical explanation really resonated with me.  I hope I’m paraphrasing correctly, but I really like what you said about separating your preferences from body image,because ironicly, my fellow adhd-friends who have the same anti-pants sentiments as me are all pretty petite and thin. Also on another ironic note, I definitely have been the fittest i’ve ever been when I’ve let myself wear what I want and feel best in, it’s hard to have the motivation to work out and eat for your body when you are so dang uncomfortable!

I had enough jackets (am currently rocking my mom's old leather jacket, a patagonia puff, and a mountain hardware insulated ski jacket depending on the day).   The big things I did add were 8 new tops (5 good, thick sweaters, 2 waffle long sleeves, and a hooded long sleeve). Everything I get was from REI or L.L.Bean. One sweater and one waffle shirt is an REI Co-op (their in house brand), an L. L. Bean, Icebreaker,  Patagonia, and Prana sweater, the other waffle was North Face, and the hooded long sleeve was Smartwool. I love them all and have gotten rid of almost all my other tops. They are so comfortable and can be worn in many ways.  My other big addition was Kamik Sienna mid duck boots in a coffee ish color. I am in LOVE with them. They look super cute with jeans and leggings and are well put together. I have worn them almost everyday in slush, snow, rain and my feet have never been cold. I can not recommend them enough. For Christmas I got my sister in law a pair of Kamik Rouge lo snow boots and everytime I've seen her (almost every weekend) she's been wearing them.	episode_done:True

When I put the hood up on a windy day I can’t adjust it so it just gets blown back down.  Artix snow pants- warm and can take a beating, very durable.

text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers. Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:I am very sensitive to temperature changes so I suffer when I wear layers. Every time I come indoors, I need to strip off everything except a t shirt but I’ll be shivering my butt off the second I go out. Best solution was to get a thick and heavy parka. I have the Moose Knuckles Beaver jacket (discontinued now). It’s so warm that I can wear only a bra under it and still leave it half zipped in -25C.   I’ve been wearing it for 5 years now and the only signs of wear are on the slightly yellowed fur that used to be white, and the stretchy cuff where some threads are coming loose. The only reason this even happened is because I wrap my whole hand in it while writing on paper, so there’s more friction on them than with exclusively winter use. I’ve even gone skiing and snowboarding with it when the slopes were icy and had absolutely no issue. I was learning too, so I spent more time on the ground than upright. It’s been beaten up quite a bit but i can honestly say that it’s still in at least 8/10 condition. The fur is also great since it doesn’t get ruined at all. I’ve been rained on too many times to count in this coat but you just gotta dry it and it’s good to go.   Compared to my aritzia coat, I’d say that it’s not even half as warm as my moose. It also doesn’t last anywhere as long and I ripped through the shell after a slip on ice. I think it lasted me 3 years, but the fur on it was ugly at the start of the second winter season so it required a lot of upkeep it keep it looking in better shape.	episode_done:True

text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:Anuschka Rees does a great job of explaining how to merge styles in one wardrobe:  “If you think about it, a style is nothing but a set of individual elements. To merge two different aesthetics, you need to break them up into their elements, carefully select exactly which of these you want to incorporate into your own style concept, and then figure out how to turn them into actual outfits.   *As a first step, you need to ask yourself which exact elements—colors, shapes, textures, specific pieces, details, and so on—of those two styles you want to be a part of your own unique look.* By doing this, you are reducing those big, restrictive top-level concepts into a simple set of tangible elements that are much easier to work with.”  For my wardrobe last year I wanted to add some typical cottage+cowboy style pieces, since I live on a farm now and it felt kind of fun. Using her method I broke down what I liked about the cottage/farm style into this: - patterns and colours: plaid, paisley, traditional embroidery, light colours, plant/animals print, fringe - materials: cotton, leather, suede, denim - items: flowy dresses + tops, cowboy boots, sandals   Using all of that I added the following items over the last year ish: - white embroidered denim jacket - black denim jacket with plaid lining - cowboy boots - flowy embroidered blouse - flowy paisley dress - embroidered jeans - fringe skirt  I usually have a tougher/punker look, so i can wear eg my plaid sundress with sandals + embroidered jacket for a countrier look, or I can wear it with my combat boots. I can wear my embroidered jeans with my embroidered blouse for a cottage look, or I can wear it with a colourblock sweater and ankle boots for a day in the city. It added a bit of feminine with the flowiness but also more of the masculine that I usually gravitate towards. Still really versatile!	episode_done:False

I have found that over the years I have incorporated other things but I have some unofficial style signatures:  * probably something colorful or patterned * I love pointy flats * I like to add one casual thing to a nicer outfit and vice versa * I mostly wear skirts and dresses * I have a few outfit templates: dress plus cardigan or jacket, slimmer pant/looser top, longer skirt/shorter top or tucked (this is a new one) * bigger earrings in mostly metal and geometric shapes (I do not really do colorful jewelry) * I love sneakers with skirts and dresses (since I was a preteen)  After that most stuff is fair game. Most outfits follow one of my templates and incorporate my rules. Over time you’ll find your rules too.	episode_done:False

text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:I think it can be huge to just have a consistent color scheme, even if you wear different styles, if you do it all in similar colors then it will always look cohesive. It will allow you to combine more style-specific items together, like combining something vintage with something more modern, or something more edgy/rocker with something more frilly/soft.	episode_done:True
text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:I've spent so much of quarantine trying to find my personal style! Here's what worked for me:  I got all the clothes I regularly, reliably wear, and I laid them out on my bed. Then, I wrote down some observations about them. The materials, the colors, the styles, the patterns...anything that seemed noteworthy. I realized I had three different color palettes going on, so I grouped them accordingly. After assessing everything, I tried to come up with a few adjectives to describe what I was looking at in front of me, and those adjectives became how I describe my personal style. In other words, rather than gravitating toward an aesthetic and trying to make my wardrobe fit into it, I just looked and described what my style, in practice, as it already exists, is.   And ever since I loosely nailed it down, now I make sure that any new clothes I purchase relatively fit those descriptors too. So everything I own is pretty stylistically compatible. :)	episode_done:True
text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:Personally I’m still somewhat new too this but I’ve had many different fashion phases and have done many different looks throughout my three years of personal fashion experimentation. I feel the biggest thing that’s helped me is sticking to a sort of color scheme.    It’s definitely not for everyone necessarily but it’s helped a lot as I have grown my wardrobe, slowly adding more colors. It makes things very easy to match. I started with three colors ( I know that’s extremely little however) now I’m up to six!  I feel accessories ( not just jewelry necessarily but belts, hats , bags etc. ) are also very important to obtaining a certain look.   I feel organizing ones closet can also really help. There’s no specific way I’d necessarily recommend I organize mine by grouping items article then group them by color , as I mentioned color and matching things is very important to my personal style so that’s what makes sense for me.   Hope this could help some! I’m new at this too as I mentioned lol!	episode_done:False

text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:Who I am is not defined by my outfits. If I have very different styles on different days it really doesn't matter. There are days when I leave the house wearing a corset, hoop skirt and three layers of petticoats. There are days when I leave the house in jeans and a t-shirt. I am still the exact same person.  A fashion style cannot tell you who you are. You have to know who you are first.   As far as the practicalities of merging different aesthetics, my approach is that I have a spectrum of  "looking like an escapee from a medieval vampire brothel" to "average 2020s adult woman". I mix things up between those based on how much attention I want to draw and what I need to do for the day. It's okay if things are perfectly cohesive. Nobody cares that much about a slightly gothy accessory on an otherwise unremarkable outfit unless I draw from way on the goth end of the spectrum. I get away with wearing medieval kirtles on public and no one cares. I get away with wearing medieval kirtles and modern boots and hats and no one cares. I also get away with wearing cauls and suits. No one cares.  People don't actually pay that much attention to other people's clothes. Which means that you can get away with a lot and no one will notice. Clashing really isn't as big of a problem as people think it ism	episode_done:False
text:I don't care how people see me, i want to feel good with what I'm wearing and i want it to be cohesive, but that's just my personal preference. I know people don't notice fashion inconsistencies because I don't and i also don't care much for what other people wear, i want everyonre to express themselves however they see fit. Of course, who i am is not defined by my outfits either but it is an expression of what i like and i have a hard time transforming that into the outside.

That said, you can pull off any look you want to if you do the work! I actually find the egirl style pretty cute and I don’t think there is anything about being a fat WOC where the style wouldn’t be cute on you!  As for your family, this grinds my gears so much!!!! I’m old enough to be your mother and it makes me so sad when adults crush the creative expression of their children. You don’t have to ever fit in the box they want you to. As long as it makes you happy and you aren’t hurting anyone else, it’s your life to live and they are just clothes. If you can muster the courage to do it, have an open conversation about how your family makes you feel when they trash the style you like. Tell them it hurts and makes you struggle with self confidence in a world that already does that to fat WOC every day. I think if they get that it hurts you, they’ll stop being unsupportive.

You being a woc does not make you less badass, I am not a woc but you ladies are literally stunning as hell and your skin tone doesn't prevent you from being the baddest bitch in your block. So what if you're not a skinny white girl, it's not like a certain skin tone or weight determines whether you can be an egirl or not. You are capable to be the baddest egirl being woc and not beansprouty. I'm not sure what to tell you about your family, but I know a girl who would always put on something baggy over something revealing at home and before she left for school, then take it off. That could possibly be an option for when you get to go outside, or just dress like that in your room or something. When I started wearing clothes I thrifted instead of shopping at my small town's h&m or the other 3 fast fashion stores I thought I would get judged, but actually quite the contrary happened and I got compliments on my vintage clothes. I'm not exactly dressing edgy,more very colourful, but at least from people our age, they don't seem to judge edgy clothes. And honestly, when talking about strangers and not family members, I don't think anyone actually judges that hard. Seriously, why care anyway? Other than sorta needing to conform to social norms when looking for a job, like when you need professional pictures for a CV because egirl makeup isn't seen as "professional" or whatever, there's nothing you have to lose. You're not losing friends over glittery makeup and short plaid skirts, if anything, they might rather admire you for your cool new style. And strangers? They're strangers anyway, you won't ever see that mean ass grandma at the grocery store who frowned at your eyeliner ever again, it's not like you dress and do your makeup for her. You'll be a super pretty egirl, you can do that shit	episode_done:False

Honestly I really appreciate other strange people's cool outfits when I see them on the streets. So, wear what you feel comfortable wearing, and if anyone shits on you for your choice of clothing, they don't really deserve your niceness anyway, they're not accepting how you want to express yourself and that is fucking shitty, but if anyone does, then wear whatever you like proudly just to spite their asses, likely they envy your boldness and your style anyway	episode_done:True
text:I want to be that bada*** biCTH (Ik it's spelt wrong, it's meme bro lol sry. Plus idk if we can swear, I don't post) tl;dr at the end cuz I tend to rant :)	labels:I'll start with #2. I started shopping for my own clothes around 16/17 . My family don't really care what clothes I buy with my money as long as my closet wasn't bursting at the seams.  I sometimes get the "are you really going to wear that/buy that" when they see me in something new. I remember buying a pair of wide legged, long jeans, and wearing sports bras as tops. Maybe it's because they saw how happy and comfortable I was in them that they didn't try to put me down for wearing stuff like that. What I buy is with my own money anyways, which does give me more confidence in some ways and probably helps them accept it too.  I know you mentioned ripped jeans -- I know some ripped jeans can cost, like, $150-$300 a pair. My advice would be to buy it with your own income (if that's possible, I know you aren't even 18/21 yet) and purchase things that you want to wear AND feel confident in wearing. It really sucks to spend money on items that sit around collecting dust.  My story with #3 is that people around me are either 1. creative energy or 2. dress with a similar vibe to me. I try to play a game -- if I'm going out in something "basic"/very messy, it's to blend in and likely not to talk to anyone that day. If I'm going out in something I love wearing, it's because I love it and I want to share it with the world. So I welcome the stares (and the questions). I try to match what I'm wearing to a purpose or mindset for that day. I value my own productivity more than how I'm being judged for something so shallow: my outfit. So my advice would be to find a purpose for what you're wearing, a purpose that is strong and way more important than how others might judge your outfit.  Honestly, I found that finding and building my style (which is really just a collection of stuff I will wear often) was a combination of having some financial independence and buying pieces that I loved to wear.

You're becoming a negotiation between different people, rather than your own self. You're totally focused on your appearance and your clothes as a way to get confidence, but that isn't the way. Body image is not related to the way that you look; study after study has shown that even after drastic appearance changes, most peoples' body image stays the same unless they work on it in other ways. Aim for body neutrality, and focus your efforts on things that will actually give you some level of self confidence. Consider reading the book My Body Is Not An Apology and detoxing your social media from "self-improvement" accounts that are only focused on appearance under the guise of "wellness."   What's your 5 year plan to become independent? What are you doing to become involved in your community? What opportunities have you not considered for your future - from teaching English abroad, to artist residencies, to trade school, to university, and beyond? Whose advice have you sought out? What have you read, and who have you contacted? What inspiring WOC outside the entertainment industry, who are NOT self-help "gurus" or "wellness "inspo", do you follow on your social media? The only thing you have to do now is become who you are. Concentrate on figuring out your values, your hopes, your dreams, etc, in isolation of what other people think. This is hard to do, but it's possible.  Dress however you want. The most common outcome of a teenage girl going on a diet of any kind is that she becomes obese; studies have shown that when compared to overweight teenage girls not put on diets, overweight teenage girls put on diets are much more likely to become obese. Set up healthy habits for yourself, like going to bed at the same time every night and getting an hour of good exercise that you enjoy - whether that's an hour long walk, or walking and jogging, or yoga, or boxing. Literally whatever.	episode_done:True
text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I have three or four distinct styles. Most of the time I like wearing dark, edgy punk-inspired clothes. However, I’m a style chameleon. If I need to be professional, I have a whole separate wardrobe of high-quality suiting. Take out my piercings, and I’ll have anyone fooled that that’s the realest me.

It's a combination of all my songs I like that creates my taste.	labels:My favorite songs blend two distinct genres together, like metal and synthwave (with a sprinkle of rap?!).

I have to blend them because there's so much I want to express! Yes, I am punk/emo, glam, neon, normcore all at once.

text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I guess I would say I do, because I don't "use looks/trends" I use shapes and colours that suit me and that fit parts of me i'd like to express.  And that does create a signature "look" without trying too hard because well.. I can't change my shape, and the colours that suit me are very defined within a colour palette.  I'm almost always wearing something stretchy that accommodates my body gently, and I like deep colours, soft colours and neutrals. I can have different elements (such as a romantic element, or a classy element) but the underlying fundamentals of "me" is there.  The problem with having different looks is that less pieces go together and some aesthetics don't really suit people as well as other looks might because the "structure" of the piece clashes with the person. I'm thinking of someone who might like sleek aesthetic inspired by 6 foot tall people, when they are more small and rounded, and it may be better to keep to their lines and add "touches of sleekness". Keep the air of sleekness but twist it in a way that suits them.. in other words, not "copy the aesthetic".	episode_done:True

text:I'm with you on the unscented detergent bit. They put WAY too much fragrances in them and they all make me gag.  I do a lot of hand washing, too. Many years ago, I ran out of Woolite and had to use shampoo...it works great. It gets hair clean, so it is a cinch to get clothes clean without an offensive amount of fragrance. I all my bras/lingerie tops and pantyhose/tights this way and they turn out pretty nice. I love making my clothes smell like Dove soap. :D	labels:	episode_done:True
text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:Note-- I have to do laundry offsite and pay per load.  I air dry my clothes, but draw the line at hand washing ANYTHING.  Underwear, socks, masks, gym clothes (in normal times), cotton facial pads-- after each use.    Bras-- 2-3 wears depending on how sweaty I get.  Shirts, bottoms, skirts, dresses--- Usually 3-4 times depending on use.  Skirts-- 5-6 times (these don't touch the crotch area so they don't get as dirty as other bottoms).  Outer layers (sweaters, sweatshirts, etc)--- As needed (I always have something under these).  PJs-- 3-4 wears  Sheets-- Every 2 weeks or so  Towels-- Washcloths-- after each use (I use two a day to wash my face), body towel-- after about a week.  Hair towel-- when I remember to (I only use this towel for my hair and wash my hair twice a week).  Hand towels, dish towels, etc-- as needed.  Other bedding-- (blankets, comforters, etc)--- twice a year (Spring and fall).	episode_done:True

text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:It depends on the item. Underwear, socks, and face masks get washed after every wear. Jeans get washed about 3 times a year. Wool gets washed once it starts to smell funky. If I don’t really sweat, shirts and blouses get washed every 2-4 wears. So I do a load of laundry whenever I have enough things dirty to do at least half a load. This is usually every 2 weeks for me.	episode_done:True

Pyjamas are worn twice before getting laundered.	episode_done:True

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I moved from the Midwest to Atlanta. If it’s a similar climate dont get rid of all your winter clothes! I got rid of so much thinking it would be warm year round but it still gets really cold about 3 months out of the year. I kept one good winter coat as well. Also because you get used to the warm weather high fifties/sixties can feel wayyyy colder than it should	episode_done:False
text:it's New Orleans! i'm moving from Maine	labels:That is so exciting! New Orleans could not be more different than Maine, but I hope you love it. I move from Oregon to Texas, and it was a huge adjustment, but now I really like it here.  Like the other commenter said, keep a coat and a few sweaters. When it’s “cold” here, it actually feels colder to me than when I lived in the North. The summer is pretty brutally hot, so I only wear natural fibers now (polyester makes me very sweaty), and lots of short and dresses. No jeans in the summer at all. You do need something to put on when you go inside because of the A/C, but don’t be like me and think you can still wear sweaters in the summer in the South like I did in Oregon.  Have so much fun! Moving to New Orleans is worth it for the food alone.  Edit: This is not weather-related, but the biggest difference to me between northern and southern dressing is that in the South, women generally look way more polished than in the North. I’ve been in Texas long enough now that when I go to Oregon, I’m always thinking “Why doesn’t anyone take care of themselves up here?” Haha just something to keep in mind...	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I live in Austin where the heat and humidity get prettyyy ridiculous. I pretty much live in skirts and shorts in the summer time. Tops-wise, I'm usually in short sleeves. If I'm daring to wear anything that doesn't show skin, it's loose and flowy!      No matter what clothes I wear, I think fabric makes the most difference. Polyesters and chiffons are the most miserable to wear in the heat and humidity because they're not breathable at all. Cotton and natural fibers all the way.      Hope that helps!	episode_done:False

text:it's New Orleans! i'm moving from Maine	labels:Awesome!! I’m not familiar about their winter weather but I assume it’s quite similar that you’ll want to keep sweaters and at least one coat just in case. Something you won’t need that I brought was heavy winter boots! You’ll be happy to say goodbye to those. As for your ac comment, I keep a sweater at work because it can get cold (I work an office job) but I normally wear dresses in the summer so I can go outside on walks without sweating	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:New Orleans is super humid all summer. Dresses, shorts, and athletic/moisture wicking fabrics will be your best friend.   You’ll be able to get by with one coat that you may never wear. I have pictures of me at Mardi Gras (in February) in short sleeves and jeans, perfectly comfortable.   Light cardigans for going inside are a great idea for southern summers. They have to blast the AC just to control the humidity.   It’s also important to consider what that humidity will do for your hair!	episode_done:False

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I used to live in the southwest and wore sundresses almost exclusively. Even maxi dresses would leave me with sweat dripping down my legs. But the AC would bring it back down to reality and I’d be wearing cardigans inside. Loose weave, 3/4 sleeves, or baggier are good calls.	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I wear a lot of dresses, skirts, and wide-leg flowy pants during the summer. I almost never wear shorts because I've always hated them. Breathable fabrics are important especially with humidity; you'll be a lot hotter in polyester than in cotton. Also thigh chafing is a thing, so I like to alternate between days I wear a skirt and days I wear loose pants.   I do tend to carry a lightweight top layer for air conditioned buildings. But it doesn't need to be something super warm; mesh or a loose weave is fine. I tend to like that layer to be something that won't wrinkle so I can toss it in my purse.	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:As someone who moved from Boston to Houston - leave your LL Bean behind.  You don't have to spend a fortune on new clothes (target is fine).  Women do not tend to wear khakis down here.  Loose linen pants would probably feel good though.  Colors will be brighter, bring sunglasses.  New Orleans will be a swamp most of the year, so whatever you would pack for a beach vacation.  You don't need snow anything (shoes, coat), maybe a light jacket for the colder months.  I didn't use my wool coat for a couple years, it wasn't cold enough.  You could probably get away with a wool sweater and layers under if it dips to the 30s and you're still acclimated to cold weather.  Yes to a light cotton or linen cardigan for the AC.  Do not underestimate the heat and humidity.	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:Having a heavier coat on hand isn’t a bad idea, especially if it’s already available - but for context I grew up in Austin, TX and the *only* winter coat I ever had I purchased specifically for a vacation. There’s an odd day every couple of years where you might want to use it... but for the most part people just stay inside and the weather warms up.  Things like a lighter fleece will take care of you pretty well on the coldest typical winter days.   A big thing I would recommend is a lot of light layers that are easily removed - cardigans, button ups, jean jackets, whatever. They served me well year round, even on the hottest days. I’m not sure specifically about New Orleans, but it’s pretty common to run the air conditioning really intensely in that part of the country (I swear my high school was kept at 50 degrees year round) and being able to cover my arms indoors was important to my comfort. Basically just something that’s light and easy to store away when you’re in the heat.	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I also live in Louisiana. You definitely want to have a pair of rain boots or waterproof shoes because of how much it rains in the spring and summer evenings. I have a pair of cute Chelsea boot style rain boots that are a lot easier to style. Also, get a pair of good quality sandals that are comfortable, I prefer Birkenstock’s.   I strictly wear shorts or mini skirts in the spring, summer, and most of fall, then jeans or leggings/joggers in the winter. I have denim shorts, chino shorts, and some cute dressy shorts, depending on the occasion.   I don’t really like dresses because it’s hard to find summer dresses that aren’t sleeveless, and I just prefer to have some kind of sleeve.   I personally would get too hot wearing a sweater in the spring/summer, and I am very cold natured, but I keep a lightweight jacket in my car in case I go somewhere and the AC is really cold. I am not really big on tank tops, so I just wear a lot of short sleeve tops. I don’t even rotate my tops because I will usually just wear the short sleeved ones under a jacket in the winter, and I only have like 3 sweaters anyway.   Also not big on hats, personally, and the only time I see other people wearing them are for photo shoots or going to the beach. However, I do recommend some nice sunglasses.	episode_done:False

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:Lots of good comments already so I'll just say plan for one additional layer in the summer when you work in a professional AC environment. I used to live in sleeveless shirts and dresses in the summer for commuting in my miserably hot car and the walk to and from the building, during lunch, after work.  Then I'd throw on a blazer or a cardigan once inside.	episode_done:True

text:Using Pinterest to Help Find Your Style (or: how to tell Pinterest it is no longer 2012)	labels:Great tips, I definitely have not been using the "More Ideas" button to its full potential.    I've been trying to pin fashion and style again, and I find I really miss the website Polyvore.  I never used it, but the ease with which other people made outfits and shared them meant that there was always something new to pin.    I follow a few fashion bloggers who seem to be popular, but I sometimes forget the work that goes into doing a blog post, styling things just right, taking the photos, etc.  Not to mention buying the clothes!  With that old Polyvore website, users were pushing out complete outfits everyday.  I hope something like that comes back around again soon, because I found the flat lay design of the pins easy to identify with.  With real people or models, I start to worry about whether something would work with my proportions, what kind of style tips they're using, etc	episode_done:True
text:Using Pinterest to Help Find Your Style (or: how to tell Pinterest it is no longer 2012)	labels:This is really helpful, and detailed. A lot of effort went into this! I am fascinated by how clear and organised your approach is.   I would use pinterest in a different manner more a style "mood board" than practical.      * So I might have events or things I am desiring (like a manifestation board). I desire to perform this year for example, so I have board for dancing style inspiration and a new board for each vision * Then I have a board for my "colours"; I am a Summer (cool season), so I have a board of colours and combinations that inspire me, such as baby blue and creamy white * I have boards with different themes, such as renaissance, vintage, exotic/seductive and in those boards I place pieces or photos that evoke those moods.	episode_done:True
text:Using Pinterest to Help Find Your Style (or: how to tell Pinterest it is no longer 2012)	labels:Thank you for the in depth breakdown! I actually use Pintrest for most of my fashion finding needs and I've been in the habit of reworking my algorithm often. As soon as I start getting recommended a bunch of things I don't like I start unfollowing boards and abusing the hide button like crazy. I also went through and organized all my boards with the new subcategory option to combine a lot of my boards together.   Another note that might help people is if you can't figure out why your still getting recommended out of date pins, go back into your boards that your feed recommends from and delete the older pins that you no longer like. I went back into all my fashion boards and went to the pins I'd pinned when I first got into Pintrest (in like 2012) that were definitely no longer my style. Once those were no longer there to draw from my feed changed pretty dramatically.	episode_done:True

I’ve been using some of this for a while, and have been looking for ways to go from smart casual to a more business casual, and found a new person who tends to dress in a way which fits with my established comfort zone but with more of a leaning towards where I need to go (workplace with strict dress codes for professional and hygiene reasons). I know virtually nothing about this figure as a person or platform and don’t want to name them as I don’t know how I’d feel about them if I did. But their style? Perfect for my needs, and something I likely wouldn’t have come across otherwise.	episode_done:True

text:Goals and Resolutions Check in: February	labels:My goals are going well! A couple of ours are essentially the same. Good luck, we got this!  1) Wardrobe Overhaul  At the beginning of the year, all I owned was athleisure. I was a very cozy, but very bored, person. So I’m working on filling my wardrobe with clothes that really make me happy, and it’s working! I’m in a fortunate position right now, so I’ve been spending the last stimulus check on ThredUp and Poshmark. I gotta say I am loving online thrifting.  2) Dress for my emotions rather than comfort.  Part of moving away from athleisure. My clothes really influence how I feel, so dressing up to look like a badass bitch makes me feel like a badass bitch. Even on days I work at home, I wear outfits to emotionally prep myself to enjoy being productive. I change into pjs when my work is done for the day, so I actually get to look forward to my comfy clothes rather than feel like it’s just another lazy day in leggings.  3) Focus on fit and proportions.  This one is harder but is making me feel the most ~fashionable~. I’m trying to identify how/why certain pieces work on me while others look slightly off. I take videos of myself where I make a bunch of tiny adjustments to my outfits to identify the little details I do or don’t like. This is definitely the biggest of my goals, and will take a long time to really figure out. I can often tell when something isn’t right about an outfit, but identifying that element is tricky.	episode_done:False

text:Yessssss to all of your goals! Your reasoning definitely resonates with me...

text:Goals and Resolutions Check in: February	labels:Later last year, I decided to go a year without buying clothes (with a few exceptions, e.g. if I end up getting a job that requires things I don’t have), so my style lately has been about making use of things I own. Last month, my goal was to spend time mending an article of clothing every week, and I’m happy to say I’ve salvaged a few things and improved my sewing! This month, I’m learning about embroidery. I want to add subtle decorations to pants.  The struggle is wanting to splurge on cute things. :( Another: sewing is time-consuming, but I often do it while I watch TV.  It’s cool to hear about your goals! I care about sustainability, too.	episode_done:False
text:Thats really awesome! I hope you have a good embroidery journey this month - that is definitely on my desire list this year as well. I have a jean jacket that I would love to embroider with the national parks I visit. I have a design in my mind and everything but it’s intimidating.  I also get the struggle of wanting to splurge on cute things or find time for sewing. I’ve tried to mend or embroider while watching tv but my lighting is terrible (that or my eyes are aging). I guess I need to get one of those bright task lights/reading lamps.   What was the most complicated or difficult mend you had to accomplish?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Goals and Resolutions Check in: February	labels:I think I have been doing well. I am planning on a low buy this year but needed some new pants since I lost some weight. So I just bought two cheap pants to wear at home but feel put together in case I need to go out (which I won't do any time soon). I am also appreciating better the clothes that I already own instead of constantly trying to find something new to buy. It's nice! Hopefully I won't fall into my shopping addiction this month.	episode_done:True

text:Anyone like wearing traditional clothing from you culture?	labels:I live in a heavily Mexican American area and lots of people are wearing face masks with traditional Mexican and Oaxaca style embroidery on them. They’re sold at a lot of locally owned stores and they look really beautiful.    I myself am third generation Irish American. In the winter I enjoy wearing the wool Aran sweaters that my family has passed down from Ireland (even if they’re way oversized for me, lol)	episode_done:True
text:Anyone like wearing traditional clothing from you culture?	labels:I'm Dutch, and apart from a few older ladies in small villages, traditional clothing has all but died out. Hardly anyone even wears wooden shoes anymore. :p   BUT we had a tradition of fishermen's sweaters/ganseys, and I actually have a photo of my greatgrandfather wearing a gansey with the motive of his village (I researched it) which I intend to knit my own version of. So if that counts, then yes!	episode_done:True
text:Anyone like wearing traditional clothing from you culture?	labels:I also love wearing my cultural wear! I was born and raised in the US, but my parents are from Vietnam.

I’d love to wear it as part of everyday wear, but it looks a bit formal for most occasions. I have seen some more modern versions and a bit trendier versions, so I’m trying to get my hands on that. As for now, I just wear my cultural dress to church on Sundays, which is a more appropriate setting.  But I wouldn’t worry yourself about what your mom has to say about it. If it you like it and it makes you feel good, then why not wear it? I bet you look amazing in them, it sounds so cute!	episode_done:False

I’m Dutch myself (my partner is Mexican), and traditional clothing here has kinda died out. The only thing I still use are my clogs as quick slip in shoes whenever I’m going into the garden, very practical haha	episode_done:True

text:Dressing for “housework” vs “working from my house”	labels:I've been a SAHM for 12 years now, and I learned early on that it was easiest for me to get up each morning like I was going to work, shower, and get ready for the day (do my hair and makeup). That means I'm prepared in case of an emergency or something unplanned. My uniform is jeans and a "cute" top. Right now, my kids are doing virtual learning, so I'm running around helping them, plus fixing their lunches and snacks, in addition to my normal chores and errands.   My favorite shoes are Gabor loafers, which I have in several colors. And I just purchased a pair of Dansko Nora loafers. They are super comfortable, lightweight, and have great support. I typically go barefoot at home (which is why my Bombas wear out), but I walk my dog every day and these are great for that.  I really love having a uniform, and I have several pairs of the same style jeans, and multiple tees in different colors and styles. If I have to leave, I can throw on jewelry, grab my bag, and I'm ready to go. I was a teacher previously, and having a system works for me at home. Huge hugs to all the moms doing double duty right now!	episode_done:True

text:Another vote for apron, with a suggestion to look up japanese cross back aprons. They provide great coverage, stay on without restricting movement and don’t fit tightly at all, so they work with multiple outfit profiles and multiple wearers.   There’s kind of a trick to putting them on quickly but once I got it it’s faster than the tie-on aprons I had to wear for work (and I wasn’t slow with those, either!)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Dressing for “housework” vs “working from my house”	labels:For the most part, my WFH clothes are versatile and can be worn for housework/lounging/telework.  I don't wear shoes indoors, just cozy slippers.  In general, my work-from-home wardrobe consists of things like wide-leg soft pants, cozy-but-washable sweaters, washable knit dresses, and jeans and a blouse for days that I'm feeling fancy. These are all things that I'm comfortable doing light housework in, e.g. cooking/dishes/laundry. Sometimes I'll throw on an apron over top if I'm doing something that might splash.  But one rule with all of my clothing is that I don't buy things that aren't easy care/machine washable. I have a lot of environmental allergies, so I need to be able to thoroughly clean things if they're exposed to pollen/animal dander/etc. And the bulk of my clothing falls into the range of mid to dark colors, so nothing's likely to stain.  Now, if I'm going to be doing heavier housework (e.g. scrubbing the bathtub, deep-cleaning the stove, anything gardening, anything involving bleach or paint), I'll put on old sweatpants and a tee. But that's the exception rather than the rule.	episode_done:True

text:Dressing for “housework” vs “working from my house”	labels:I wear Birkenstocks or Dansko and Sanita clogs for arch support as well as canvas Dr Martens and Converse with inserts.   Dr Scholls flats inserts are superglued into the Converse.   I have no shame.  It's easy to forget about shoes for a while until one day you're making weird pleasure/discomfort noises while putting them on because it's been too long since you've had adequate support.	episode_done:True
text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:Goodwill totally depends on the area. I'm from a college town and their Goodwill has amazing stuff, probably because there isn't a consignment store in town so they get everything. I live in a big city now and the Goodwills are completely picked through and don't have many trendy items but I would still go to find jeans to turn into cut offs or something. Buffalo Exchange is a consignment store so they don't accept anything damaged or dated, but its a little more expensive. I recommend Poshmark for workout clothes because you can search by brand and size. I buy shoes at Goodwill and don't have a problem since usually you can tell if they're heavily used or not.	episode_done:False
text:My local goodwill is sooo overpriced! You’re so lucky! We have a local consignment shop run by my friend's mother and it is awesome, but I think they’re suffering due to the pandemic (the shop is very small and jam-packed).  I really want to check out the GW bins, too! It's definitely on my post-pandemic bucket list	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:Unfortunately the thrift stores where I am tend to not be worth my time. Last time I went they wanted $16 for a pair of used Target brand shorts that retail for $24 new. No thanks.  I've been thrifting on Poshmark and eBay for years and have always had good luck there. Having to pay shipping on every item kinda sucks but I figure that's the price I pay for having access to thrifted items from across the country/world and not just whatever's available locally.	episode_done:True
text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:Kinda depends what you’re looking for. I love vintage, so small, local thrift shops in smaller towns can be a goldmine.	episode_done:True
text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:It really depends on your area. My favorite in my town in Salvation Army. You really just have to check all the ones in your area out and decide for yourself which has the best selection and prices. Also, figure out which days they do sales (my SA has a color tag for 99 cents on Fridays) and plan trips strategically. I moved from a city to a small town and at first was really disappointed in the thrifting since I rarely find modern brand name items, but the prices are way better, there is lots of great vintage, and I feel like there are less 'trendy' people shopping for the same style of items as I am.   So it also depends what you're looking for!	episode_done:True
text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:I'm a big fan of going local if you can. My city (Richmond, VA) has a place called Diversity Thrift that funds the local LGBTQ Community Center.

text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:Mostly I just go to Value Village (which I believe is affiliated with Savers) and goodwill. There are one that are more curated like Buffalo exchange and Platos closet, but i usually just stick to VV and goodwill.   Largely with these thrift stores the location of the store is what matters. Bigger cities/nicer areas you’re more likely to get donations of nicer quality items.   I buy a lot of my shoes from thrift stores, but it often takes a lot of searching before I find ones that aren’t beat up and worn.	episode_done:False

text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:My local Goodwill, is... adequate.  I've found some decent things, there but nothing amazing; it's overshopped, but one could find good things if one went regularly. There's a spot on the far side of town that's a great for, like, furniture and winter coats, but I don't hit it often.  We had a Salvation Army but it was, like all the other Salvation Armies in the area, incredibly terrible and I'm not sad it's gone.  The best spot in my town is the Hospital Thrift store.  It gives serious 'little old lady' vibes, but also consistently has very wearable, quality items as well as cool, funky stuff that's nice to look at.  Bonus is that it's tiny  (Covfefe restrictions have pushed the store limit to 10,) so digging around doesn't take long and is well worth the effort.	episode_done:True

text:Knee-high boots, classy heels, or trendy sneakers?	labels:Well I have been wearing sneakers with dresses/skirts on a regular basis since I was around 13 or so. Typically minimal types or when I was way younger even Keds. I am 42 now so that is like 30 years.   I also like pointy flats and those are a more walkable and polished option - and have been doing so since my early 20s. I also like ankle boots and have also been wearing those since my 20s.    These 3 are the shoes I wear the most - pointy flats, ankle boots, and sleek sneakers. I wear a lot of flats - those get the most use. The other two are regulars that can be a bit more seasonal.  In the before times it would be something like 4-5 days a week with flats and 2-3 days of sneakers. And in the winter or rainy season the boots replace the flats for many days.   I do not do heels very often and have been swapping out the ones I have for block heels since they do not get messed up on sidewalk grates. I love a slingback or mule so those are the styles I get the most.   I do not do knee high boots for a myriad of reasons.	episode_done:False

And the easiest way to get CS to initiate a quality return/exchange seems to be leaving a negative review...   Personally I love align leggings for everyday (knowing that they will eventually pill... but for me at least, usu more like a year or two in), fast & frees for lightweight running/spin (pockets!!!) and wunder unders or wunder trains for more of a sleek compressive feel (probably the best at achieving the slimming look you’re going for?).

Aligns are very popular, I love them they don’t slide down and are very smooth, however the quality isn’t as great. Wonder unders are popular too but they come in two fabrics that are very different from one another so you need to watch for that.

text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:Depends if I plan on always wearing something over them or not, but one of my favorite pairs is from Nordstrom, Halogen brand.

text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:Athleta’s Salutation legging in 7/8 length! I don’t like any more compressive feeling leggings, but lululemon Aligns are also a bit too soft and non-supportive feeling; the Powervita fabric on these is soft but also hugs so better for the ass lol. Also, I don’t like leggings that cover my ankles, and the 7/8 length is just right, though they also have full length. Also good if you want mid and high rise and pocket/no pocket options.   Someone else commented about Athleta’s Elation legging, and I’m not sure what the difference is between these two styles, but they’re both made out of Powervita fabric.	episode_done:True

text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I have a teal suit that is similar in brightness to your pink one. Some tops that would work/that I think work with my suit are: - white/cream button down - white/cream turtleneck - turtleneck or mock neck in a shade lighter or darker than the suit for a monochrome look - silver (for mine) / rose gold (for yours) colour camisole or shoes  - lacy bodysuit + heels - graphic tee + sneaker for a casual streetwear look (I don’t really like wearing sneakers with suits but lots of people like the look)  You can also simply wear the pieces separately!! I tend to wear my blazer a lot more than my pants.	episode_done:True
text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I'm a fan of combining bold pieces with more bold pieces. They say less is more, but I believe the inverse is true too: more is less. Meaning that when a piece feels like it's "too much," it can often help to add other "too much" pieces to balance it out and create a more intentional look.   The pink suit would rock with a base layer in red, light pink, tan/brown, or even a print or stripe if the mood strikes.	episode_done:False

text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:For the pink suit, I think it would look great with any kind of tutleneck. Black could be safe, but if you really wanted to go mad you could go for a green or bright blue. it would look so fun.   The top I think would look really fun layered over a form fitting tube dress and then paired with some flat trainers.   The jacket would elevate anything for sure, byut what's stopping you just trying on a load of outfits you have and testing them out in the mirror? Have a fashion show!	episode_done:True

As for the organza pink top, it would look lovely with some true black straight leg jeans and silver heeled pointed toe boots or nude strappy heeled sandals with your hair up in a bun and silver hoop earrings.	episode_done:True

text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I usually wear one statement piece with more basic items, but if I want to combine more dramatic items, I try to pick items that stand out for different reasons (unless I'm going for full on maximalist).   So like with the pink suit, it's 100% the colour that makes it stand out. So I would pair it with a top with a bold pattern, or a dramatic scarf that creates an interesting silhouette, or a belt or necklace that has a lot of interesting detail.	episode_done:False

text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I always like a graphic pattern. Maybe with 2-3 colors (like polka dots or something abstract). Or a graphic tee shirt. The pink suit can act as an almost neutral.    I do not love light pink paired with dark colors - so I’d pick something leading with a light color. Or a graphic pattern that is bright or light.   If your suit is hot pink or darker - I love mustard and bright pink. It is a really fun combo. Green is pretty classic. As is grey. Cobalt blue can be nice with a saturated pink. You could do tone on tone with another pink top.	episode_done:False

The loungewear sets are thin and warp when you wash them. The dresses are paper thin. Bathing suits feel like they’re going to fall apart. But they say “omg look how cute!” for a buck.

text:I mostly try to use the same clothes across hobbies, though maybe I can get away with this because I don't need specific clothes for hobbies.   For me summer is super thin wool. Fall and spring I add on a lightweight wool or puffer jacket. Winter I wear both the puffer and wool jacket and a rain coat to block the wind. Though I am worried about having too many clothes, so I was very careful about being able to layer across seasons. Having one coat for each season would be the problem for me. Having multiple that I can layer and get use throughout the year is fine.   I have a little linen that can be added in here and there for purely aesthetical reasons, worn between the lightweight wool and warmth layers.  I also work in tech, so it is all t-shirts and jeans, so I'm usually the one who is "over" dressed. I pretty much only work, hike and lounge at home. So everything I do is "casual." I haven't been to even a business casual event in over 6 years. So yes, lifestyle definitely means I just don't need many clothes.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is your favourite item from a discount brand?	labels:I have a 10+ year old floral dress from Kohl’s. It magically works for any occasion, doesn’t wrinkle, and needs no special care.  Works for a pool coverup, a bike ride, and a wedding. It also magically works across size fluctuations. I have gone 2 up and 2 down and it still looked cute.	episode_done:False
text:Not familiar with kohl’s as I am in Canada. What other brands would they be akin to ? Dress like that sounds amazing!	labels:Kohl’s is a low to mid tier department store. A bit like Target without the food/toilet paper stuff, and lower end than Macy’s. Fancier than Walmart. But it is like the unhip middle age mom suburban store - so you are supposed to be embarrassed to shop there. 🤣🤣🤣  Now in retrospect, I might have actually bought this dress when I was still in my 20s, barely! And now I am 42.   They have a wide mix of “exclusive” brands, and mass market ones like Levi’s, Nike, and Lee.   The ones I have the best luck with are the Elle brand (like Elle Magazine). And the Apartment 9 brand - which is like Target’s Merona and the Hudson stores INC.	episode_done:True

text:What is your favourite item from a discount brand?	labels:I used to work at a local boutique whose markup was unreasonably high but managed to be mostly fairly priced, only because of how ridiculously cheap the clothes came from the vendors and the store’s overall fast fashion policies.  Anywho, after a few weeks/few months on the rack, any piece selling significantly less than its peers was marked for clearance and shoved in a messy stack of racks and buckets at the back of the store. I have a pair of soft purple shorts and two perfectly shade/texture matching crop tops that have survived a considerable 3 years or so now, all of it definitely cost me less than $20 before my employee discount, I think it ended up being like $11 once all was said and done. I love them, but they’ve definitely outlasted most of the other items from the same boutique 😂	episode_done:False

text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:I love this! Personally, I love to dress *majority* of the time in what I would have to call, “neutral academia” which is edging closer to, “dark academia” but with softer neutrals and occasional splashes of pink. This tends to be seen as professional, so it’s my work go-to. The closest reference I have is from the Chinese drama Meteor Garden, the newer one (2018?), I was amazed to see the Hua Ze Lei and I dress almost identical. A lot of that style section of my wardrobe is from Abercrombie, Little Lace, Reformation, and Nordstrom.   On the days I’m feeling playful, I dress more, “girly grunge” where I mix distressed jeans, with baby tees or crop tops and layer on a sweater or open cardigan. That section of my wardrobe is typically from Tilly’s, WildFox, Free People, Patagonia, or PacSun.   The days I feel moody/sexy remind me of the edgy part of your posts. I don’t wear black often so when I do I’m sultry about it. I love wearing Doc Martens or Paladins with distressed black skinny jeans and mesh tops, or a edgy graphic tee/sweater, or I wear fitted black dresses with any combination of shoes. I’m also really into wearing lingerie bodysuits with outfits—it’s feminine in the bedroom but reads as edgy once you step outside your house. That section of my wardrobe is typically from Ruckus, Dolls Kill, Gooseberry, Intimissimi, or Nasty Gal.   I incorporate hard details with accessories. A soft outfit can be topped off with a dark brown or black wool hat. I’m always wearing my All Saints goat head necklace, shortened to be almost a choker, and when I eventually replace that I’ll be looking on Etsy for a new one. It’s so dainty that it looks sweet until you *really* look. I also tend to carry a black purse no matter what the outfit. Plaid, gingham, and houndstooth also feel (to me) to work well together when making an edgy/soft combination look.   Such a great post, and good luck cultivating your dream wardrobe; you’re going to look amazing!	episode_done:True
text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:Great album! I like to dress as girly or non-girly as I want, but always have dark nail polish to show that I'm edgy on the inside.	episode_done:True
text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:I love this style!! I don’t wear it a ton bc, well, I haven’t been able to go anywhere. I have a sort of style I’ve dubbed “glitterbitch.” Basically it’s throwing on whatever you want and topping it with sparkly eyeshadow. This is along the lines of what I like, I love the sweater in the thumbnail and stuff from Lirika Matoshi or Selkie, both sadly too expensive for me but still my inspiration. I think adding neutrals or structured pieces can offset the soft nature and age it up a little.	episode_done:True
text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:Oh my god that straw hat/doily dress?? Perfection!!!   I love wearing a 'cute' look at the grand old age of 37, but I try and make sure all the cute bits are always neat, tidy and made of quality materials to avoid looking too 'kiddy'. Quality fabrics and well-made vintage always elevate a look, I think!	episode_done:True
text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:You might want to look into Japanese fashion magazines for inspiration.

text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:I LOVE this album. As for walking the line between cute and sensible, I really think there is no wrong way to do anything with style as long as it is 1. appropriate (fits the environment and situation you're in), 2. fits properly (including not too short, not ill-fitting, etc.) and most of all 3. makes you feel like you are stylish and makes you feel amazing. The album you have created really incorporates hard edged details into a softer look well. Notice how it's just 1-2 items, mostly accessories. That's the way to do.	episode_done:False
text:You're absolutely right, as long as one isn't inappropriate, personal flair is a-ok. I actually often think to myself that when i'm elderly, I may actually like to wear say a cardigan with heart patterns or stars, but it will be in a relaxed fit and in a boyish 1920s silhouette.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:First and foremost, this album is AMAZING!!! I fucking love the pieces, and you definitely channeled the essence Cassie so well with every outfit.   Truthfully I think there doesn't have to be a line between cute and sensible. I just make sure that I cater "cute" to my setting- like what's "cute" at the club, isn't going to be "cute" at work and vice versa. In terms of sensibility, fuck it. As long as your outfit is appropriate for your setting, and the heels aren't hurting your feet too much,  don’t worry about sensibility.   I typically like to interpret edginess into softer looks with significant color contrast, thoughtful accessories, and statement pieces. Like for instance, a soft colored dress with dark colored, edgy shoes and a bag to match the shoes. But statement pieces and accessories are the easiest way to give a cutesy, girly soft look some edge.	episode_done:False

text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:I haven't yet shopped FashionNova/Shein. But have spent plenty of time shopping cheaper brands like Target, Old Navy, NY and Co, Kohls, H&M, Forever21. And honestly I have plenty of things from these places that have held up fine. Especially when you follow wash instructions and avoid the dryer as much as possible.   Even cheaper stores have some gems among the low quality items.  The biggest issue I found is that certain things needed to be replaced like annually or sometimes 2x a year. But on the other hand some stuff will just last forever. I had (have) some decade+ stuff from all of those places that still get worn.  Some were super frequent, some weren't.  Now that I am a bit older - I realize there are a few things I always wear - vetted by years of experience - that is makes sense to spend more on. I'll always use a black cardigan, grey cardigan, and black knit pencil skirt (ponte or similar) year over year - so those can be upgrade picks. But as for dresses?

text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:My 20s were spent wearing fast fashion as business casual! The really cheap brands (e.g. F21, Fashion Nova - this was before SheIn) did NOT work well for me - the low-quality was obvious in the fit and drape of the fabric, plus it was pretty difficult to find office-friendly pieces in the first place.  H&M and the Banana Republic/J Crew Factory Outlets (they're online!) were a lifeline, and I still wear many items!  You may also have luck with resale sites like Poshmark and ThredUp.	episode_done:True

text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:Full disclosure: I am not addressing any ethics concerns in my comment.   I've ordered a few times from Shein. I've gotten some really nice unique and flattering things that I get a lot of compliments on. I've only returned things that I didn't like on myself, not because they weren't as pictured. I find the exact measurements of every size and picture reviews very helpful. Don't order anything without reviews, at a minimum text reviews, and triple check the measurements and material on each item. I found the shipping to be decently quick and my refunds were processed quickly. No complaints.	episode_done:False
text:Same I've had really good luck with some shein pieces but I also will only grab what has good reviews and photos.	labels:Same here. You can tell from customer photos which things have suitable cuts for the office (e.g. houndstooth/tweed stuff can be great but can be bodycon and the model photos don't always emphasise this), and which ones look to be good quality.	episode_done:True
text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:I think you would be best off buying from reputable brands during their sales. Their returns process will be better typically too. A $20 blouse on sale from J Crew Outlet is usually going to be better than a $20 blouse from Fashion Nova. A lot of these sites have customer service issues as well.  I have purchased from ROMWE (basically SHEIN they are the same company) and depending on the material you may be able to score some things decent enough for Zoom meetings, but not good enough that you will want to wear outside of a webcam.	episode_done:True

text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:Back when I still had a waist, I'd pair my Edwardian-ish skirts with turtlenecks, to kind of tone down the vibe a little, but I threw cardigans over them, so things weren't *too* modern.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:I've always loved vintage/historical clothing (Edwardian and 1940s/1950s are my favorite), but it's just not practical where I live (tropical country) to dress like that all the time, so I just add a vintage touch here and there to my outfits. I wear a lot of brooches, midi skirts, broderie anglaise blouses, and lace-up heels and boots. Usually I would mix them with more modern pieces or mix decades (so an Edwardian blouse with a 1940s skirt, for example) so it doesn't look like a costume. Most of my stuff I got from vintage/secondhand stores.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:I regularly look like a time traveling medieval witch. My wardrobe includes modernized kirtles, stays and petticoats. So yeah.  I got started long long ago when I was a historical costumer who decided that I really liked the way my medieval gear looked for everyday wear. Plus it's pretty practical for a cold winter. I make most of my historybounding gear still though I'll pick up anything that I find randomly that I think I can reuse.   People around me rarely react to my outfits. Occasionally I'll get compliments on them but I can full on wear a late Victorian walking skirt in public and nobody notices that it's a Victorian walking skirt. They do notice the pretty embroidery and I get comments on that. This trick relies on having a fairly modern silhouette for most of my stuff though. No obvious bustles and corsets. Mix in the occasional modern style clothing and it just sort of blends into people thinking I have a quirky fashion sense.  I have never felt a desire to hand sew underwear for a guinea pig. I'm honestly not the biggest Bernadette Banner fan girl. She's cool enough but she rarely goes into enough detail for me to replicate her techniques. There are other youtubers I like better for showing off how to do stuff in more detail.   I currently working on a piece that's inspired by Victorian depictions of medieval witches that's almost finished though. Next up is going to be a dress that's kinda sorta based on a Roman stola but with elastic cord involved.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:Well, I’m no fashion expert, but I’d try...  - mixing and matching old-timey-style things with modern things (like a corset over a tee (or blouse, for more vintage points) and modern pants/jeans, an old flowey dress with a modern leather jacket, things like that) - maybe adding vintage accessories (an antique locket, vintage hair pins?) - styling your hair in more vintage styles (like Bernadette)  Hope this is a good starter! If I think of any more I’ll try to update.	episode_done:False

text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:I do this and nobody notices they aren't modern pieces, some are on trend. Victorian corset covers as camisoles underneath 90s flannel shirts, Edwardian mourning blouses paired with jeans and pistol boots, etc. Pretty much looks like modern day Sezane.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:When I was in university I was super into the 1950s look. My wardrobe had been a mix of vintage finds from specialized shops, eBay & Etsy, items from vintage reproduction stores, and things from regular stores (H&M, Zara) that had a vintage flair. I never went 100% as it felt too much like a costume to me, but wore a lot of day dresses, circle skirts, button up short sleeve blouses, etc. Paired with more modern items like ballerina flats or high waisted skinny jeans. I also frequently wore red lipstick and either slept with rollers or used hot rollers in the morning to get retro curls.  This was 2012-2014 in western Canada and the reaction was pretty mixed - some students made fun of me and I got a bit of a reputation on campus for being a weirdo, and I got a lot of stares when out in public. That said, I also got some really positive reactions (mostly from women). I eventually moved on from this look but still LOVE vintage items. I have a lot of vintage lingerie and a still have a few of my vintage dresses, tops, and pieces of jewelry. I also recently bought this gorgeous linen blouse from the 1800s at a flea market in Paris that gives me Shakespeare vibes - I like to wear it with distressed jeans and ballet flats. I want to try to find more pieces like that as I think paired with the right items it can look quite modern.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:I feel this! I’ve grown up obsessed with stories like little women, Anne of green gables, and a little princess, so I’ve always had an affinity for feminine, old fashioned styles. They are so wholesome and pretty 🤩 I’m a little afraid to dress that way in public since it’s not the norm, but I have some flowy night gowns with lace and ribbons and such, and I wear them to bed. I also have bloomer shorts with lace that were custom made for me. They’re so pretty. I’ve been buying more flowy dresses with little floral detailing lately. I don’t have a lot of money to spend, so I mostly buy from online stores, but you can get lucky finds at thrift stores, some unique pieces from Etsy, or from a specialty shop that specifically sells vintage clothing. A lot of those types of stores are located in downtown stores, so I’d look there!	episode_done:True

text:Office Clothes	labels:I am in a male-dominated field but in a sector of creatives in a professional office.  I usually wear:  -	Solid or patterned (houndstooth or understated plaid) pants. -	tops with interest like puff sleeves, boat necks, crochet detail, etc.  I don’t really like patterned tops. -	Tea length feminine dresses.  Not sheath style.  Usually a-line.  Most of my dress are in a mellow print.  -	cardigans or blazers depending on my mood  My personal palette is navy, forest green/dusty green, dark red spectrum, ivory, mustard, and sometimes black.  I can’t do pastels except pink because it washes me out, but they looks lovely on others.  I’d say 75% of my clothes come from Boden and the rest from Gap, Banana Republic, J. Crew, and some from Old Navy. Boden is my fav and their clothes feel and look nice in me and have lasted a while.   I get my pants mainly from any of those places that aren’t Boden.  Everything else, dresses and tops are from there for the most part.	episode_done:True

text:I am with you Pawbean. I am all about comfort At the office and cheap buys or things that I know will last. Banana republic had a version of the Sloan pant that they marketed at “travel” pants because they were breathable and stretchy. Loved them.

text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I bought/sold on Poshmark when it was starting to get popular, and found great deals and sold pretty easily on it. I stopped a year later - by that time, I had started seeing wholesale distributers flooding the site and making it alot harder for me to find actual used clothing for decent prices. I'd agree that there are likely too many sellers now compared to buyers - or at least too much merchandise compared to buyers. To me, that makes Poshmark too much like Ebay, and is no longer as distinct a platform as it used to be.  Edit: typos	episode_done:False
text:I mean tbh I have a harder time with random people wondering why something they bought at target two years ago isn't worth retail price or above now and arguing that its out of production so it's worth more (girl it's our of production because they don't keep producing the same things season to season oh my God).   I think some of this comes down to the encouragement of bargaining on the platform. People will say they anticipate being offered a lower number so they'll overprice something, but if you're a buyer that's just an additional layer of hassle that would stop impulsive purchases which isn't great for getting things sold.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:There's far too much merchandise, too much of the same stuff, too much complete junk to sort through, and a lot of sellers who have no idea how to sell their items. The categories and filters aren't that well thought-out, so you need to have a pretty specific idea of what keywords to search (or the patience to go through multiple categories). They could seriously improve the site for sellers and buyers by reorganizing their categories, adding boxes for measurements (and a checkbox for "listing contains measurements"), and removing items that don't sell after 6 months (the seller could always relist, but there are hundreds (probably thousands) of items that haven't even been updated in a year and sellers who seem to have abandoned their accounts).  As far as I know, you can't even set alerts for certain keywords or filters, which makes it even harder to use than Ebay--that said, when I do secondhand shop/browse I prefer Poshmark because it's easier to see at a glance whether the information is all there, which is a key aspect in whether I even consider buying an item.	labels:Yes absolutely with the old listings and abandoned accounts. I feel like everyone and their mother is jumping aboard the selling train right now, but the wholesalers grind my gears. No escaping them in this day and age, but eBay is worse than Poshmark because it’s nothing but Chinese scammers and drop shippers from Ali express and Taobao. Same for Etsy. Poshmark seems to have less of that (for now) at least in the categories I browse. But I agree there’s way too much crap on there. You can pretty much only sell if it’s a higher end brand name piece of clothing and not just general clothes because there are so many accounts with literally 1000 pieces of fast fashion garbage eternally listed   I’ll also add the constant invitation to go to peoples dumb selling parties and people constantly sharing my items is weird as a casual seller. I get that they’re trying to make it like a social media thing but it’s pretty transparent people are sharing my stuff so I’ll share theirs but I don’t have time for that and it clogs up my notifications so I’ve missed people bundling my stuff  Edited because i fumbled trying to correct it and hit send too soon!	episode_done:False

text:I agree. I like buying secondhand mostly so I used to use Posh/etc a tooooon and have pretty much stopped. I actually find better deals on eBay now for the same things. Sellers want to charge full retail (or more) for items and act like negotiating is a personal attack when that's literally what the site was designed for. Couple that with expensive shipping, no returns, and the high occurrence of issues with orders it just isn't worth it. The last time I was on this site was the summer and everything that I made reasonable offers is still sitting, now cheaper than what I originally offered, and because the sellers gave me attitude they lost my sale. I don't see Posh being successful for much longer, honestly. Mercari is just as bad and harder to find things on.	labels:	episode_done:True

I also prefer to buy secondhand for similar reasons.   Poshmark definitely has the best customer service. I’ve dealt with a lot of bad sellers (listing the wrong size, clothes not as described etc) and whenever I’ve reached out to Poshmark they basically refund all my money and let me keep the item. On the flip side, as a seller people have unnecessarily complained (item didn’t fit) and Poshmark didn’t allow them to send the item back for a refund—maybe Poshmark gave them a refund and let them keep the item but I wasn’t effected.

Ultimately I think the downfall of Poshmark will be the wholesalers and people who are doing it as a side hustle.

In the early days sellers closets were made up of actual clothes from their closets so they were all the same size and the style of the person selling. Now if I find something I like it’s impossible to find another item in someone’s closet because there are 500 random listings to sift through.	episode_done:False
text:Exactly my problem with it.  I get so excited now when I find a closet that's just a few items all clearly the same size.  Those sellers are usually more reasonable on price too because the items would just get donated.  The people selling full time as a job on there have kinda ruined it for me.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I’ve been selling on poshmark for 4 years, sometimes buying. I like it except for the point that it requires a lot of engagement.	episode_done:True
text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:What Poshmark has going for it is that Google will show items when someone searches. Mecari doesn’t have that. I prefer Poshmark for their customer service and typical clientele. Idk if one is easier than the other- Poshmark requires the most seller engagement whereas the others are “list it and forget it”.	episode_done:False
text:Mercari is a disaster from a buyer's point of view. Half of it is fake, and the interface is hard to navigate when I'm looking for something specific, which I usually am. I'd rather pay more on eBay. Poshmark used to be my go-to but only like 1 out of 3 things I buy actually ship. What a waste of my time and emotions.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are the Luxury IT Bags right now? And which ones are actually worth the $?	labels:The #1 It bag right now is the Prada Re-Edition. Because of that, you will be seeing a lot of nylon and half-moon shaped shoulder bags over the next few months. Bag trends go in and out pretty quickly, so it is much more important to pick one that you really love (especially when you are dropping that kind of money!). The Dior Saddle Bag is an older bag style that they brought back in and saw a huge resurgence in popularity. It's not as trendy as it was when they reintroduced it, but it looks pretty likely to stick around as a staple style for the brand. Dior has been getting more expensive recently. The price doesn't really reflect the quality (the quality is just as nice as many luxury brands with lower price points), so you are really paying for the brand.	episode_done:False
text:Yeah you’re right the Prada is everywhere but I’m really not a fan of it! It’s just so small. I think you’re right about the saddle bag too, not worth the cost especially for such an impractical shape! But it does look awesome with the various Dior straps	labels:Dior definitely knows what they are doing with the guitar straps! Which is why they charge $1k+ just for the strap on top of a $3.3k+ bag! If you want your bag to be relatively timeless, you can invest in something like a Lady Dior or Chanel Classic Flap, or opt for a more simple style bag from most any of the major brands. But if your style is more edgy and youthful like the Saddle Bag love suggests, you might just want to get what makes you feel happiest and what is most practical for your lifestyle and budget, regardless of what people are wearing at this exact moment in fashion.

All that said though, I’ve gotten into my mid twenties and my body has changed so now I can barely even wear sweaters at all anymore because I’m too damn hot all the time. Has anybody else had this change too? I used to be cold all the time and now I’m roasting in a t shirt at 70 degrees.	episode_done:True
text:Store closings at malls	labels:This has put a real damper on my online shopping too. I really miss shopping in person to try things on. I also only go to physical stores to return but now I realize if only I can try everything on (meaning stores actually have inventory and all sizes) I wouldn’t have to rely on the internet and returning when they don’t quite fit. Honestly all physical stores should have all sizes for fit try-on purposes but they don’t 🤷🏻‍♀️	episode_done:False

text:Store closings at malls	labels:The biggest loss IMO was the Aerie at my local mall, during the first lockdown back in March/April. I know #aeriereal is just marketing, but it really did made me feel comfortable going in there and buying and trying on nice sweaters and cardigans.   We're under strict lockdown again in my area, so I'm sure there will be even more stores gone once malls open again. I really do miss physical stores - my sizing is weird, so it really helped to be able to try things on without going through a cumbersome returns process.	episode_done:True
text:Store closings at malls	labels:There’s been closings of things due to the pandemic but like Sears & JCPenney’s. Also on the food side there’s been restaurant closures.

text:I'd expect closings from Sears and JC Penny's...  I'm wondering how bad the carnage will be when this is over. I have not gone in person, just googled and found out they are closed.

I returned by mail and they refunded me the shipping costs.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Store closings at malls	labels:I pretty infrequently went to the mall, but stores closing retail locations really doesn't impact their online store much. It can, if the stores are fulfilling the orders, but most major brands should be adapted to online long before today and are able to fulfill orders. It impacts the business in that they're not getting the retail location revenue but they're already established online with processes and can usually just adapt. Unfortunately, brands with retail locations can't be like Amazon because Amazon's business is really hosting the retail of other brands with some of its own products, which means it has more resources and volume to make various returns, deliveries, etc. more efficient. It's not without its issues itself. Unfortunately, it's a hard time for retailers. :(	episode_done:True

The first version was giving one of the people in our office headaches, so she changed up the components and that solved that problem. For me, most perfumes trigger headaches at best, and migraines at worst, so I avoid people who wear perfume. It seems like perfume has become less prevalent in recent years, and as far as I'm concerned I'm thrilled about that since it's difficult to avoid scents as a health trigger.	episode_done:True

I wear mainly Hermes perfumes only (because they don’t give me a migraine like a lot of other perfumes do), and I rotate between them based on how I feel and would like to be perceived if someone catches a whiff of my perfume as I walk by.

I would probably judge more on whether it is too overpowering.   I've always worn one that I think is nice, but I now wonder if it's too smoky when my clothing choices aren't overly feminine, so I'm wondering if I should mix it up with something more floral. Perhaps wear the smoky one when I'm in feminine outfits and wear something more floral when I'm in less feminine clothing.	episode_done:True

I personally don’t like matchy matchy bag and shoes unless I’m going for a monochrome look. I tend to match tones rather than colours. I like a patterned bag (say Gucci dionysus or Fendi zucca or LV canvas) as opposed to patterned clothes because I find they blend in well with a variety of outfit choices.   If I do colour, I will make sure the tone matches. I can’t stand mixing warm times with cool tones. Eg I have a cool tone lilac paid of heels that I love wearing with my cool tone magenta bag.   You can also do opposite sides of the colour wheel with shoes and bags like a green bag and a purple/magenta pair of shoes. But again keep to the same tones. The key with fashion is the tone of colours, and that includes neutral colours too. I would always suggest everyone does a colour/tone analysis and then stick to buying items in that range. It makes mixing and matching easier.	episode_done:False

text:Is Chanel going to be better off without Karl?	labels:Karl was a great creative and brought a lot of creativity to the brand, but it was A LOT different than Coco Chanel's classic, timeless, etc. His creativity helped elevate the brand with younger and trend-centric customers, which was good, without necessarily alienating the legacy customers who are not aspirational consumers buying the lower priced items but truly wealthy customers buying the $$$ items. It is a feat in itself to meet both, but that's also from excellent marketing and business team (not just him). The brand may be trying to cater more to its true wealth vs aspirational customers at the moment to keep the brand afloat during this time since the supply chain and margins are likely different, and the aspirational consumers are not able to buy as much due to impact on income, etc. But, fashion brands also play to the mood of the market, what more fashion-focused less trend-focused consumers are heading, etc. and it's global so it is much broader than just one country, etc. The new collection is still very fashion forward and very pretty. But, not as rocker/edge/creative as Karl's days. The thing with Chanel is that it has the younger aspirational consumer so hooked on its lower priced items, it really doesn't need to innovate for it - they consider the earrings, lower priced handbags, wallets, etc. to be status no matter what it is because they're buying the brand. Where, overall, it likely all works out. It's nice to see the change of vibe, but I did enjoy Karl's. His vibe was also getting a little tired, he was there forever. But, they are wise not to try to replicate him.	episode_done:False
text:Of course people like Chanel because of the status quo the brand gives off but Karl impacted it to greater heights which we have seen today. It was a dead brand before Karl joined.	labels:The brand was huge before Karl, Coco was alive until 1971, and it was a major luxury brand at that time, before and after. He joined in 1983. But he did a great job at getting the mainstream aspirational consumer and young wealthy into the brand, which is what it needed. I know women who are in their 60s and 70s who have Chanel from way back when. There was a time after WW2 that the brand struggled a little, but so did nearly all luxury European brands at the time. Overall though it's always been a key brand in the category.	episode_done:False
text:It was huge but it was struggling real hard to the point the owners wanted to just keep it as a perfume company. 11 designers after Coco's death.

They have now become my house project jeans. And every time I put them on I actually sigh they are so comfortable! Just enough give to just move with me. So long story short I have them on poshmark notifications, every time I go into a thrift store I look for them in my size. They aren’t super hard to find but I’m a 0 long and that’s not a size I see often. It’s to the point I know what they feel like compared to other jeans and can spot them really fast. THREE DAYS AGO I FOUND THEM IN MY SIZE AGAIN. I practically ran to the check out. When I pulled them out of the dryer and put them on I actually danced. They are so perfect! Don’t give up on your hunt it might be out there! I’ve decided to start looking for a replacement pair now so I never have to go with out them again.	episode_done:True
text:Fellow clothing trackers, what coveted items are you tracking now?	labels:Old Navy button down Christmas dog pajamas in kids sizes. My husband and I have had ours for a couple years and I got a used one for baby this year and next year but can’t find any after 2t and don’t want the tradition to die 😂	episode_done:True
text:Fellow clothing trackers, what coveted items are you tracking now?	labels:Omg I thought I was the only one who did this!   I bought a pair of amazing green boyfriend jeans from lucky brand in 2017. They had wonderfully deep pockets and fit me perfectly. my favorite pair. So comfy and flattering and went with everything. They were ruined a few months ago in a stain remover accident, and I have been searching for them online ever since. I actually found a pair in grey but the green ones are my white whale.	episode_done:True

text:Fellow clothing trackers, what coveted items are you tracking now?	labels:I can’t even find an image anymore, but aaaages ago—like, 2007–there was this Betsey Johnson dress. I think it was called Liberty; it was strapless, corset-tie back. It came in a blue and maybe a beige also? Anyway, I loved it, couldn’t afford it, and then they were out of my size. Occasionally I would search for it and only come up with a bubble hem version which was all wrong. It was elegantly tailored, maybe knee length. Call Me Ishmael. I will never harpoon this creature.	episode_done:True
text:Fellow clothing trackers, what coveted items are you tracking now?	labels:Guys, I don’t know if I’m depressed or if I’ve bought the entire internet during lockdown but I don’t really have a coveted item right now.  I have allot of new stuff in rotation and it looks like it’s going to stay cold for awhile, I could get into some new shoes I guess, I’ve just never been this ambivalent about shoes.  I bought really good mocasin slippers and I’m kinda over real shoes.  I haven’t really shopped in a way where I could do any discovery in about a year but I stocked up when Barneys closed.  I’m obsessed with bold granny quilt coats right now I have 2 and kinda want another, does that count?	episode_done:True
text:Fellow clothing trackers, what coveted items are you tracking now?	labels:Vintage 90s Eastland black lace up ankle boots. I had a pair I wore to death and held onto them for way too long because I was too sad to throw them away. They were incredibly flattering and functional. The right amount of both casual and dressy. Not the best quality, but I have yet to find a higher quality boot I like as much.	episode_done:True
text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:Not a lot of people still wear hats, but I keep hearing that many people *wish* they were still stylish to wear... so please feel free to help make hats fashionable again!  Typical etiquette for hat wearing is that if it's a very small decorative hat--something that stays close to the head--you may wear it indoors, but if it's a larger hat, you take it off indoors.  With something like a cloche or beret, which isn't exactly tiny but also isn't oppressively huge, it follows nearly the same rules as a coat:  If you're just popping by on an errand, it's fine to keep it on, but if you're planning to stay a while, you should take it off.  This is especially true if you're visiting a place of hospitality--a friend or relative's home, for example, or a restaurant--where somebody is offering comfort and relaxation, keeping your hat/coat on might be seen as a rejection of their hospitality.	episode_done:False

text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:Everyone still wears hats! I keep the hat on at all times usually but it depends on the hat. For example, if I am going to be indoors for a duration of time (longer than average grocery trip) I will sometimes take a winter hat off because it'll get too warm to keep it on, or if it is out of place indoors for a long duration. Wear the cloche out! Hats are a great and super easy accessory to up level a look and make items into an outfit.	episode_done:True
text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:Oh man I frickin love hats. I feel like I see beanies all the time (doubt these will ever go out of style completely), and berets become popular every few years. Sun hats are kinda like beanies, I think they’re always in for the summer.   I wear beanies all the time in fall/winter and have quite the collection. I recently have gotten into berets. In the summer I have a few caps, but I don’t wear them as often as I do my beanies.   Personally, I keep my hats on everywhere. No one needs to see my hat hair.	episode_done:True
text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:I wear beanies and baseball caps a lot. I leave them on inside usually (usually my hair get messed up by the hat, so I actively avoid taking them off). I know my grandparents used to have a rule about no hats at the dining table, so I’d take mine off then (this was when I was a kid and had a sunhat - it was also impolite to put your hat on the table even if there was room).   I want a bucket hat but haven’t found one I like yet!	episode_done:True
text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:Honestly the biggest issue with hats for me is wind. Especially in England. I pretty much exclusively wear extremely wide brimmed hats because I'm still doing the  'wide brimmed hat for a witchy vibe' thing - especially on a bad hair day. I find that very feminine romantic looks really suit hats like this and I have similar large straw hats that kinda go with anything soft and flowy in warm weather. The appearance of cottagecore really helped bring back big beautiful straw hats, including ones with large ribbon ties for the neck/chin.	episode_done:True

text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:To me above jeans and below full suit. No maxi dresses or tank tops.  Bottom: Slacks  Khakis Skirts   Tops: Button down Polos Blouses  Sheaths and other “work type “ dresses.  Shoes: Heels up to 3”  Loafers Flats Full vamp shoes  Khaki polo is the most casual outfit you can wear and be business casual while slacks and blazer or dress and blazer is the most formal. Full suit or dress and jacket are business formal.	episode_done:True
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:It's really dependant upon where you are. In South Florida, business casual is golf slacks and a polo, or a wrap dress with sandals (and this isn't the entirety of business casual in South Florida, I'm just pointing out things that would not generally be seen as such elsewhere.)   The best bet is to go online, find this group's Facebook or Instagram accounts and look at what people are wearing at their events. I doubt very much that anyone is going to bat an eyelash at you wearing a skirt, and I'm sure that your work clothing is absolutely appropriate for whatever events you're attending.	episode_done:False

text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:I usually do a nice blouse + skirt or a sheath dress for business casual. But I work in finance so my business casual may be different. I second the person who suggested looking for pictures online of events or consider making a friend at the club so you have someone to ask about this.	episode_done:True
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:My usual office wear is midi circle skirt and blouse, sheer black tights, pointy flat shoes, cardigan or blazer.  Or a midi or knee length dress, cardigan or blazer.  In some offices I've worked in, solid coloured jeans with no rips count as business casual.  I would wear them with solid coloured tshirts or knitwear and boots or shoes but not sports shoes.	episode_done:True
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:To me it's more about the materials and cuts than it is about the pieces, because fabric and cut define the range of casual, to business casual, to professional, to formal, etc. The same type of item can look any of these all depending on the fabric and cut. That's how I view it.	episode_done:True
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:I go to a lot of networking events in the STEM field, where the dress code is business casual, and I know that business casual in STEM is a whole different beast to business casual Law, and as Australians in a hot city, I'm guessing it's a lot different to a colder climate city. Probably way more casual.  After work networking events: whatever I wear to work. Generally long sleeved button up, mini skirt or skinny jeans, ankle boots, loafers, oxfords or sneakers. No effort into hair or makeup.   Networking event where I know there'll be bigwigs: I'll swap out the mini skirt for a pencil skirt, or a sheath dress. Definitely avoiding sneakers.   For an event with kids (like industry engagement): I'll make an effort to present more femme and do nicer hair, makeup, work heels, pencil skirt, polo. Sometimes blazer. I am almost definitely overdressed, but I think it's important to subvert the stereotype of female engineers as "pink steel cap boots" because that's not really indicative of me.	episode_done:True
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:I think it's basically woven or high end knit items that are tailored and polished. So chinos, a button down, a merino sweater, skirts, dresses, etc.   I think jersey knits, tees, jeans, sneakers---those can squeak in on a casual day and if styled impeccably, but I lean towards woven in general.   Coverage wise, it's usually from the neck to the knees continuously or more (meaning no belly shirts, no cut outs, and if it's sleeveless, it's not a tank top or camisole alone).   Tightness wise I think it's "skimming" the body. It's not tight, snug, or showing off curves, but it's not baggy in a casual way. I do think biz caz can be oversized, but that's like...advanced biz caz, like a loose linen dress with a loose linen blazer and simple flats on a hot day type deal.   Generally patterns and prints are small and discreet, no slogans, and no "novelty" items or promotional wear.   No workout items, no sleepwear or lingerie.   In your case, I think the events are indicating "smart casual" meaning no open toes/flip flops, no jeans, shorts, tees, or other overly-casual items.	episode_done:True
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:If you are a woman, then skirts are absoluely part of business casual.  In fact, there are still some business formal environment that insist on women wearing skirts, even though such a rule is coming to be seen as a red flag for workplace misogyny.    Business casual can mean pretty much anything that is less formal than a complete suit in conservative cut and color, but more formal than jeans and a t-shirt.  In some industries, 'business casual' might still mean suit and tie, but your blazer and skirt/slacks don't have to match and maybe you can wear khaki instead of navy.    In other industries 'business' casual might mean "just about anything that isn't jeans, shorts, or a t-shirt."  I've seen solid-wash denim trousers, bold patterned dresses, baggy sweaters, even sheer, sleeveless tops being worn as 'business casual,' even though I'd describe that more as smart casual.   If it's at all possible, try to find someone who has been to one of these events who can tell you more specifically what 'business casual' means to this club.  If not, then I would suggest wearing a white, button-down cotton shirt with a collar and a full or 3/4 length sleeve, paired with a simple, knee-length skirt in black, navy or gray suiting, black nylons.  It's boring, but it's your safest bet for something that'll pass muster while you scope out the crowd and find out what your other options are.	episode_done:True

text:What bag(s) are you eying for Spring/Summer 2021?	labels:Chloe and JWA never had great resale value. Wear what you like! I have a Chloe Lexa that I got for 50% off when it got discontinued and it‘s a great bag. I‘d never buy either brand at full price though.  I‘m trying not to get sucked into any nee handbag trends, I really want to shop my own closet this year. That said, I got a piece from the Loewe x Totoro capsule collection that I couldn‘t be more excited to wear this spring!   If I really had to pick, I‘d say that I‘m still eyeing a Loewe puzzle or a celine belt bag. I do like the Dior Bobby and the newly released Caro as well. Realistically though, I might add another everyday bag from Polène or Leo et Violette before I pull the trigger on any high end designer stuff. Price increases are getting crazy!	episode_done:True

I was there in a long red gown and everyone was in minidresses... I already felt out of place because I wasn't in a sorority, just was dating a guy in the frat.

But to my shame, after 5 weeks inside and 9 more predicted to come (UK) I am mostly thinking about  what I am going to wear. I AM GOING OUT! Fake fur, big red shoes, velvet, leopard and sequins are firm candidates.

text:I think this is an excellent example of when I think overdressing is rude.  How you dress communicates things. If you show up to a situation where messy and/or physical activities are planned and you're not dressed appropriately, you're essentially communicating distain for the planned activities.

If you knew you weren't going to participate in our frisbee game, why did you come to the frisbee party? Why did you come camping if you aren't prepared to let any part of you touch dirt - are you expecting everyone else to do extra work to make your camping experience squeaky clean? The only way to avoid that message is to dive right in and ruin your nice clothes.	labels:Aw this reminds me of the time when, in our honeymoon in France, we last-minute booked a grape-picking experience at a vineyard. I had no proper shoes so I just wore a pair of golden flats which were the most comfortable pair I had packed. When we went to the vineyard it was rainy and muddy and I felt quite judged by the looks when the rest of the people saw my shoes, they were all wearing rain boots or more appropriate gear. I was not expecting to go grape-picking in the mud when I packed! Anyway, the tour guide and the other women in the group made a bigger deal out of it than I did, I just went straight into the mud with my shiny shoes. It was incredibly fun and yes my shoes ended up all muddy but a good clean and they were good as new.	episode_done:False

I also think that the whole "they aren't QCing the bag, they're QCing you" is really fucking rude.  If I buy more bags, I wouldn't buy designer and stick to okay quality and mid-tier prices. There's nothing wrong with indulging if it's going to bring you joy, but I think that a lot of people drop $$$$ on a bag and then never  fully enjoy it because they're afraid of scuffing the leather.	episode_done:False

text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:I’d probably go with a lesser known brand/designer or something on a great sale (yoox, outnet, etc) instead. Some of the bigger names (like Kors and Kate Spade) I find to be mediocre quality for the price.	episode_done:True
text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:I think it depends on the bag you want! If you really truly want a specific Dior bag for example but don’t want to spend $3k on it, you could probably spend about $300 on a nice rep. If you actually just want a specific shape/leather type, you can probably look at Coach and Tory Burch, or even smaller contemporary brands like Mansur Gavriel or Polene.  I’d recommend making a wishlist of bags and write out pros and cons of getting authentic pieces vs replicas, including price and how much you actually want it.  For a while I’ve been spending money on contemporary brands and a few auth designer bags, but recently I’ve been fulfilling my bag wishlist through reps and it feels liberating honestly. You can save money and still get the bag you truly want, and if there’s a bag you really like and you want to support the designer in some way besides wearing their logo/brand, you can always save up for and buy the auth.	episode_done:True

They are just the tiniest bit too small for me. My mom’s solution was actually really simple. Just cut off a part of your feet! Long story short, I did that but the guy I am interested in, totally saw that and is now completely grossed out and it also kinda ruined the shoes.

text:Shitpost Saturday: Beauty is Pain	labels:I squeeze myself into the stiffest raw denim there is. I’ve heard of these things called leggings or stretch pants, but the idea that pants could provide a modicum of comfort means they must be entirely unfashionable. I avoid them. Instead, I adorn my lower half with the most unyielding, unforgiving denim they make. I don’t “break it in” or other such nonsense as that could potentially soften my rigid mom jeans into pants that I don’t grimace while wearing. If your bottoms aren’t leaving crease marks on your hips and thighs, then I don’t think they even count as pants.	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: Beauty is Pain	labels:I once had this gorgeous denim dress, smart and sharp, I looked totally hot in it. It was quite tight. One evening, due to my own poor judgment, I decided to wear this bloody amazing dress to a dinner. It was going great, we had an entree, then the main... until I reached the point where I had one tiny potato left on my plate and I knew all too well that if I eat this potato, either the dress will burst, exposing guests to an unsightly view of my semi-naked body, or the guests will be exposed to an unsightly view of everything I have eaten that day.   Since I am a person who got their life priorities straight, I elegantly excused my guests and I delighted their eyes with yet another gorgeous outfit. No potato was left behind.	episode_done:True

text:Underwear review: Soma vs. Parade after 6 months	labels:I bought a pack of Parade recently and the high rise brief cut is one of my favorite pairs of underwear. They do give a bit of a wedgie, but the fabric is light and soft enough that I don’t feel it and it isn’t visible under clothes. I wish they were cotton, but the fabric hasn’t given me any problems yet. I’ve been considering Meundies for a similar high rise cheeky cut, but am not thrilled about the price point.

I wear smalls in most underwear, and medium in others so based on them running bigger, I got small. They're loose in the hip/waist, but the crotch part is tight and uncomfortable. The bands are also really apparent under clothes, and there's a seem that gives me sensory rage	episode_done:True

Day to day errands, dresses can be super nice (with safety shorts). DO pick ones that cover your shoulders/back/neck if you can, those areas sunburn very easily!   After the sun goes down, dark colors are fine and will make lighter clothing look more formal.   As someone else mentioned, moisture wicking athleisure can be nice (think tennis/golf polo).  Sneakers work surprisingly well. Sandals are nice, but make sure you don't get sunburn on the tops of your feet. Also don't ever go barefoot, pavement gets hot enough to give you 2nd degree burns in seconds.      Notice how many times I say "after dark" here, there's a reason many cultures with hot summers have a culture of socializing/doing errands in the evening!	episode_done:True

text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:Hey, go on pinterest and keep exploring clothing styles, lookbooks, etc. Pin the ones you like...don't overthink it...they are just pictures; you have nothing to lose. After a while, look at your board and look at the styles that repeat or similarities in what you've chosen. That should give you an idea. It'll take time but don't worry....you subconscious likes and dislikes won't disappear just because you haven't thought about them in a while.	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:i would say to just experiment with pieces. when it’s covid safe, go to the mall and try on some stuff in changing rooms. see what “feels like you” and looks right on your body and run with that. style is dynamic, and sometimes you just stop liking things. it happens! i also recommend pinterest, go on there and look at outfits, and pin all the ones you like, then go back and try to notice similarities, either in aesthetic or specific looks. good luck on your style journey!	episode_done:False
text:Damn! I just posted my comment without reading yours and realise I've written almost the same thing as you..lol!	labels:double advice!!	episode_done:False
text:Great minds? Too cheesy? :D	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:I feel like others said Pinterest is a good idea. Don’t feel pressured to stick to a certain style though. I don’t feel anybody completely embodies just one single aesthetic, people are more complex then that.   Also as far as making it easy to put cool outfits together I’d say find some colors you like some being neutrals I personally recommend main colors 3 - 6. It’s definitely not necessary but it’s really helped me out personally!   I also feel organizing ones closet in a way you like can make one appreciate there clothes more and easier to style. Like I mentioned before keeping a pretty strict color scheme in my closet is very important to me so I organize mine by article of clothing and in a color gradient.   I was in a similar spot before accept I more willingly just let my mom dress me. I understand how hard it is but now I’ve had my own personal style for 3 years and the amount of growth, and style phases I went through is insane! I made a discussion post about style phases if you want to check it out! I now have a personal style and good sized wardrobe that I am really happy with!	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:a little late to the thread, but i would say first and foremost be practical...are you in a warmer or colder environment? Are you a student, or professional? do you go to a lot of fancy restaurants and the like in your free time (pre-covid obv), or are you more outdoorsy? This may seem kind of obvious but you'd be shocked at how many people don't think about these things when they dress, and your lifestyle is really important for creating outfits that you not only like, but will wear often! Pinterest is great but it can also be a little unrealistic sometimes. After you consider practicality its much easier to put together outfits and find things you like that match the occasion. Also, congrats on getting out of your parents' house, and good luck with the search!! you'll do great :)	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:To add onto some already really good advice, what you like may not be what you look really good in. This part took me the longest time to figure out. Key here is to keep an open mind. Your likes will probably change every 2-4 years, so when you buy new clothes, take note of whether it compliments with your features,is easy to mix and match with other things in your wardrobe and how wearable it is for your lifestyle. Once you start understanding a bit more about what works for you, even if your style changes over time, you'll know what to avoid or what to look for.	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:Loads of good advice already. I would also consider how you want to express yourself and be seen. E.g. Fun? Classic? Quirky? Uncomplicated? Elegant? That sort of thing, do some navel gazing. Do you want to show off your body or obscure it? What looks do you love on other people? What colours and fabrics do you love (or not).	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:Go thrift shopping and try on whatever strikes your fancy. I like thrifting for this because just about every cut, color, fabric and style are available and you can get an idea of things you like that are not in new retail stores at the moment. And everything is much cheaper, of course.   All the secondhand stores in my area have closed their dressing rooms, so this isn't as doable right now, but it is still fun to cruise the racks and get an idea for the range of clothing that is out there.   Have fun!	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:My advice is to notice what people around you are wearing.  Take notes!  Are you in school?  Glance around the classroom to get ideas.  Do you have a job?  Are your coworkers wearing mostly jeans, or something else?  You can balance that with what you see on pinterest.  I was in a similar boat in that my family was super poor growing up, so I just had to wear whatever was given to me.  It took me a while to figure out what to buy, I would end up in situations where everyone else would be dressed one way and I would be dressed another -- like, say, wearing jeans and a sweater while everyone else was in dressier attire.  It also helps to notice what you find yourself wearing a lot.  For example, if you start with two pairs of shoes, heels and sneakers, and you notice you wear your sneakers way more, then you've learned: you should own more sneakers than heels.	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:Like everyone said Pinterest is a good place to start. Maybe start by looking at what you find yourself picking out of your current wardrobe for casual days and days you feel like dressing up and see how you would want those styles to evolve since you’re a young adult now! I follow a lot of fashion you tubers as well and there’s a variety of trendy (bestdressed)/minimalist(Gemary)/ grunge(Sarah Hawkinson)/tomboy(madeyoulooks) style channels. I also find myself taking inspo from tv show characters.	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:My situation was the opposite as far as I know me and my sister were allowed to choose to wear what we wanted from as early as I remember. I also had a job as a teen so I could afford my fashion design hobby. I'm in my early 30s now and I think I finally found my style, but I'm struggling to feel amazing about it as I'm a bit overweight and I think things that I like simply look better on slimmer women.  Anyhow: I experimented loads as a teen and ever since, really. Buying things, wearing them or not, making things. It takes time to figure out which of the things you own get a lot of wear and which don't. You could go to second hand shops as it's cheaper to buy more here to experiment with. A lot also depends on any demands from your job, if you currently work. If you can freely wear whatever, you can go nuts. Some things that are great staples irrespective of style are some quality black leggings, nice trainers, good tops or bras for support, a nice handbag, backpack, and a few nice coats.  You could flip through magazines or websites and save any photos of style that appeals to you or simply individual pieces you like. Look at people in the street and take notes of any insights you gain from that.  I was very into goth stuff for daily wear until I went to art school and didn't want to get nice clothes dirty so I ended up wearing sports/athleisure gear. Now that I have a working from home office job I'm just wearing athleisure)chill stuff too but when I go out I try to dress in my style, which I've accepted is boho/eclectic/a mix. I've stopped trying to find a style and I'll just wear individual things I like, so I end up with a lot going on at times (big coat, patterned leggings, coloured trainers, hippie jewellery, an army style cross body bag etc. That's just me. I'm happy to look a bit strange and not according to one style.  You'll get there :).	episode_done:True

text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels: This seems like more of a psychological problem than a fashion problem. People tend to have different priorities and motivators. For some people, “fitting in”, “meeting societal expectations”, and things like that are very important. To other people, “Being true to yourself,” and “being individual” and other things like that are quite important. A lot of people end up straddling both though, and the decisions that you make should depend on the values you identify for yourself.   We are very influenced by the values of those around us, so you may feel this disconnect because what you value may not be the same as what your friends value, or what your parents value, or what people on the internet value. But we feel influenced by the values of others anyway if we want those people to like us. So what you should do is identify which things come from yourself and which things come from other people, and then which values out of that whole set you really want to embody. If you can label this more firmly, it may help to ‘own’ whatever decisions you make regardless of the values or expectations of other people.  It’s also important to remember that you can’t please everyone. People who value timelessness, elegance, and classic pieces might look at other people and describe their outfits as tacky, childish, too trendy, etc. Meanwhile those other people are looking at the timeless/classic people and describing their outfits as boring, aging, and bland. Neither camp is really better or worse, it’s just a different perspective - and it’s not like there are only two camps. But there’s no way to please everyone - so you just need to confidence to choose what you want to wear for reasons that feel right to you and then you need to own that choice.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:I think I figured out how to ditch that pressure after I realized that I didn't like most items in all those "10 things every girl should have in her closet" listicles. I know that's less about trendiness, but it is about realizing that "classic" pieces really aren't for everyone.  It sank in even more when I got older and truly experienced how today's "classic" is tomorrow's "dated": Trust me, in 20 years no one's going to think those silk blouses, ankle-length pants, and button-down dresses really were the end all be all of timeless fashion, no matter how plain and minimalist they look to young eyes today.   That doesn't mean fast fashion is great, if only because the business model is unsustainable in a plethora of ways. But that's not something wrong with your preference for novelty! People have always liked novelty in their clothes, it just wasn't doable to buy tons of completely new garments so they made smaller changes. Buying less really is a good thing for the world, but "buy it for life" is a nonstarter for women's fashion unless you're a true ascetic.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:When I was entering adulthood I mostly just bought secondhand clothes to experiment with and then resold them when I got bored or the trend was done (or if they didn't work for me). My "timeless classics" are pretty much just the experiments that worked - pieces that stayed in rotation or got so much use I needed to replace them with something similar later on, etc. I do keep on experimenting with little trends here and there, but it's also a nice comfort to have my classics around to mix in.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:There's no pressure? Buy what you want, wear what you want. That's what I do, and I've been an adult for a few decades now. A wardrobe that contains (also, or mostly, or some, depending on your preference) timeless pieces, is something that builds over time. You don't just go shopping one day and get it all a-la-Pretty-Woman.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:Wear. Whatever. You. Want. Life is short, fashion is fun, don't build a closet around what others think is acceptable to wear or own.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:What pressure? There's a pressure not to dress like a child when you're an adult, and I guess that intersects with trend-following, but it's not the same thing. Most fashion brands make their money selling to adults not kids.  While you can't quite 'wear what you like' and still be socially acceptable everywhere, you can most certainly follow fashion if that's what you want to do.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:I buy/wear items that I like, whether they are in style or not, whether they are considered classic or not. For example, I love high waist pants and maxi skirts - both were "trendy" a couple years ago and I'm so glad they were produced more as a result. I will keep wearing them even though they're no longer trendy, because I love how they look and feel, even if no one else is wearing them.   Another example for me: neutral colors are considered classic, as well as patterns like plaid and houndstooth. But I love fun colors and funky patterns, so those are what I wear most, no matter if others are wearing different styles.  Just because something is labeled classic or trendy by social media, fashion brands, retailers, etc. doesn't mean that we have to adhere to them. You can wear whatever style you like, whenever you like, regardless if others woild label those items trendy or classic.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:IMO there is \*almost\* no such thing as classic and timeless.  Just buy the things that you like, it's fine if you like trends and your style changes over time.  The idea that you become and adult and you must ditch trends is an internet myth, if you look at actual people (adults) that have some interest in style/fashion - they are following trends.  Maybe not in the same way or timeline as teenagers but they are not just wearing white buttons and trench coats all the time.  And even if they were, white button downs and trench coats are not exactly the same now as they were ten or twenty or thirty years ago.	episode_done:True

text:How would you style or rebuild your wardrobe around your holy grail fashion piece?	labels:I'll just start with the holy grail item, which is high-end denim that fits both my ass, waist, and thighs. I have an athletic build - big thighs, an ass, but not an enormous waist (but not hourglass, I'm rectangular by all definitions), and finding jeans that fit or even come close to fitting is a challenge. I don't want skinny jeans and am just fine with a high waist, but when I sit I need to not feel constricted and they need some stretch to accommodate my legs and butt. I went to my favorite denim boutique for a personalized shopping experience and tried on just about everything in my size. I bought some jeans, but they're still not what I was looking for. My favorite is my husband's old ass sevens that have a huge hole in the ass (that I still wear out in public because why not), but they're not super flattering, just comfy.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:eBay:  - Filter by fabric content. Try searching for wool, silk, cashmere, and other nice fabrics.  - There’s a filter for vintage that’s useful for finding unique items. Also make sure to look at sizes that you may think would be too big. Vintage clothing tends to run much smaller.  - Avoid stuff labeled as “unbranded” its mostly just cheap junk mass produced in China that is heavily advertised on eBay  for some reason - Make use of the extensive filters eBay has, you can use them to find very specific items.    Poshmark:  - Sort by recently price dropped. This means the seller is really trying to get rid of the item and you can get a better price.  - Don’t be afraid to make an offer. I’ve made offers I thought the seller would never accept, but they did and I got some great items for insane deals.  - Search by key words, the filters are not as good as eBay  - You can filter by your specific sizes, but I don’t recommend this on Poshmark. The system does not work well. For example, I put my dress sizes as 4 and 6, and they only show me dresses labeled those sizes while leaving out dresses labeled small or medium.   In general for online thrifting: - Ask the seller for measurements if they aren’t posted already, and compare to clothes you have that fit well.  - Filter by size, color, or brand to find more specific items.  - Create saved searches if there’s a specific thing you want that you can’t find	episode_done:False
text:For Poshmark sizing, you can also select sizes small and medium. So I usually check the pant size (26/28) “dress size” (2/4) and the regular size (s/m) to get all of the items in my size!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:I shop a lot on Poshmark and I find it helps to think of it as “slow” fashion. I don’t expect the instant gratification of typical online shopping.   I search for brands that are typically out of my price range, that I love. I save things by liking them and wait to see if the seller will make me a reasonable offer. People sometimes give amazing deals if something has been sitting long enough.   As others have said, use those filters!	episode_done:False
text:I've been able to get some great deals by finding a specific item I'm interested in and then doing a new search for just that item. I look through the available listings and if they're all in the same or similar condition I like all of the lower priced ones and wait for the offers to come in.  I do sometimes make offers myself, kinda depends on how much I want the item and how unique it is. Like, I'm much more likely to make an offer on something vintage that I know I won't easily find another of. I have one in my likes right now I'm waffling on but I really do want it. For offers, typically you can expect to make an opening offer around 50-60% of the list price and still be considered reasonable, especially in reseller closets. (Full disclosure I do flip on PM as a small side hustle, I mostly use the funds to buy new things for myself.) There's a 20% commission fee and the shipping discount comes out of the seller's pocket, so they generally list higher to account for these in their profit margins. If I'm lazy and just want the item sometimes I just make an offer that essentially gives myself free shipping lol, better margin for the seller so they're more likely to accept.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:I pretty much exclusively buy second hand/ thrifted clothes as I can get MUCH better quality clothing than if I were to buy new. I tend to buy off eBay, depop and vinted. I search for the brands I live pretty frequently (just the brand name, no other filters) then see newly listed items. I regularly pick up sezane, self-portrait, COS, Claudie Pierlot items at really low prices. It helps when people don't know the brand so well (Claudie Pierlot for example- just bought a perfect condition puffer jacket RRP £350, currently on the outnet for £169...I got it for £15.) Or for example a brand new La Perla full length night dress for £20.  I think it helps that I also sell a lot, so if an item isn't quite right I sell it on.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:Filters are your friend. I like to start with brand - otherwise the search is way too broad and overwhelming. If you fill in your sizing the app will automatically filter out things that will not fit you (which culls the list quite a bit). If you find an item you like try looking through the seller’s other listings as well- often I’ll find other items that appeal to my taste or discover new brands this way. I think you can suss out a lot about the seller based on the way they describe the items & pics they take too - someone who just Marie kondo’d their closet will have different kinds of items than someone who sells as a side hustle  The big appeal to me is the thrill of the hunt!! Happy shopping :)	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:I have a really hard time shopping on poshmark. I find I have to be super specific and it's not great for browsing. For instance "j crew tan cashmere cardigan" gets a manageable result but "flowy top" does not. I also uncheck boutique as that's all cheap stuff from china and search by brand when I have one in mind.   Ebay is has more filters which helps to narrow items down. I usually filter by material and country (only shop within the us since that's where I am, this gets rid of all the new stuff from china).  Also, I would definitely recommend thredup because you can return things. I recently placed my first order from them and ended up returning about half of it. They charge $2 per return and for free shipping you have to take store credit, which I think is fair and way better than just being stuck with something that doesn't fit. You can set up saved searches to make it easy to check for new items and also filter by brand/material/size/condition and sort by newest first.   Depop is also worth checking out, I find it to be a bit more curated and trendy than poshmark but often overpriced. There are less items so searching is more manageable, and search results are based on an algorithm (poshmark is just newest first). Also shipping is cheaper for small/light things.  Another one people are into is the real real, I haven't ordered from them myself but have seen it recommended. I think it's pretty much a higher end thredup.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:Some really great tips here! Here's my two cents:  1) If the seller doesn't respond to your questions, RESIST the urge to buy anyway. This seems really obvious, but I've made the mistake many times of panic-buying b/c I was afraid I'd miss out on the item, against my better judgment. Someone else may snap it up, but you've saved yourself the headache of wasting money on something that doesn't fit/is damaged/itchy/smells like cigarette smoke/etc.   2) Poshmark and eBay work better when you are familiar with the exact brand and model of clothing. They're not great for browsing due to just too much crap and too much inconsistency in the listings. If you don't really know what you want, I'd suggest browsing TheRealReal. They skew higher-end, but have a quite a lot of choice and have filtered out the trash and no-name brands already. Often you can find really rock-bottom prices for what you're getting (like Rag & Bone jeans for $30). You can search for something like "women's wool trousers" and then filter by size and color and sometimes style (cropped, wide-leg, etc). You'll be exposed to a lot of brands and styles you may not otherwise have thought of. Another pro (or con, depending on how you look at it), is that the clothing sizes are broken down into XS/S/M/L/XL categories, rather than numerical. So if you filter by "S" it will include 26-27 jeans, 34-36 Euro sizing, 40-42 IT size, etc., which is good when you're dealing with international brands. Even better is when the item includes measurements, which they often do, which are always more helpful than a number on a tag. Finally, on full-priced items (except for the really high end stuff), you can automatically get 20% by using their REAL code.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:Poshmark filters suck, but the fact that you can ask the seller for more details and they can offer you discounts means that you can find great things!  I find that if I like something, about 30% of the time the seller will offer me a discount right away, so start going crazy on the likes if you are ready to purchase something.  I always sort by new so you get first pick of the best stuff.    I search for specific fabrics, but this doesn't work perfectly on Poshmark.  I love linen, so I often just type "linen" into the search bar and see what I find.  The problem is that Poshmark doesn't have a fabric filter, so "linen-looking" items will end up in there, and sellers that don't list fabric won't show up there.  But I've found awesome pieces this way!  "My size" straight up doesn't work for me.  It's annoying, but I always manually pick my size once I get to a category.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:As someone who makes a decent amount of money casually flipping niche designers, it's become a bit of an arms race of bots/scrapers/market data warehousing for finding true steals.   Focusing on one or two designers (monobrand4lyfe) and learning the market well enough to flip items and pay for your retail purchase of what you _actually_ want is almost more reliable than hoping you find what fourteen seasons past item in your size in good condition.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:For Ebay, filter by "auction" vs "buy it now"    If I search for womens cashmere sweater size medium filtering by auction will take search results from 130,000 to 1,900. Much easier to peruse.	episode_done:True

That way I can see if it actually looks good on people who aren’t tall and thin or if it’s one of those things where it’s designed specifically for that fashion model body type.

Most petites are first of all still not short enough for someone under 5 feet (like, why is 5’4 considered petite?), and second are cut narrower, which is the opposite of what I need.  I typically end up with pants with stretch so it fits at my waist while also fitting around my thighs and sweaters/tops that are a size or two too big for my stomach so that my shoulders don’t look ridiculous.	episode_done:True
text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That?

I’ll put on something that’s risky or different from my usual fits and think it looks awful. All I see is how it is too tight in the bust or emphasizes my waist, then I take it off and move back to safer ground.   My husband’s favorite dress on me... I was going to return it, when he saw me trying it on and told me to pick a restaurant. I still don’t love the dress on, but he swears it looks amazing on me. (And he does not shy away from expressing negative opinions).   I’m just saying, sometimes we see what we expect to see.

If you have a sharp bone structure, try sharp and crisp styles, if you look fleshy go with soft draping fabrics, if you look short then split the silhouette by colors or a belt. These are just examples but they can be extended to anything. This is basically what the kibbe system does.

text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:Yes. I’m kind of somewhere between an hourglass and an inverted triangle shape, and only 5’4. So many outfits online have like 4 layers on top and then my shoulders look huge and it’s not cute. Or I look like a big blob because they billow out over my round hips/butt rather than draping all pretty like the stick thin girl I saw the look on online.   I wouldn’t say I have “solved” it but I’ve found a few ways to imitate the looks I like more successfully. Finding a slightly cropped version of a blazer or sweater I admire is helpful given my height, and also because I have hips and a round butt, long sweaters and blazers tend to look boxy and strange on me. I have also been learning about and experimenting with tucking shirts and sweaters a lot. Finally, minimizing layers or choosing blazers and sweaters that don’t have dropped shoulder seams helps keep my top half looking sleek. Unfortunately dropped shoulders seem to be all the rage everywhere I shop 🙄  I know you’re pear shaped so it’s different but I think you can look at the “vibe” of an outfit and imitate it in a way that suits your body. Mainly I try to look at a few outfits I’m drawn to, and figure out what elements they have in common or what it is that I’m liking. Maybe the colors, textures, silhouettes, etc. I like to save them on Pinterest and make note of what I want to find when I shop to pull those elements into my wardrobe.	episode_done:True

Maybe think of it like this as a test to see if it's the bag or the achievement of a milestone. If this bag (luxury or not) was found in a thrift store, and you couldn't find it in the store of the brand or online, and you left the thrift store without it, would you be worried that someone else would buy it before you? Or would you have a feeling of "meh, I'll find something similar?" If you would be worried about missing out on it forever, you want the bag.   You could also buy the super pricey Prada (or what ever luxury brand) and if having actually bought it feels wrong, you could return it.

It’s weird though because some take returns if you purchased online (YSL), but not in store.

She didn't care that "classy" people aren't supposed to wear one designer head-to-toe. When your inheritance is in hundreds of millions, you don't give a fuck what "classy" is supposed to be.

text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:Absolutely. I’ve gotten much better at buying for what I’ll actually wear vs aspiring to look like how the models (or influencers) look. I spent a fortune at Anthropologie from 2005-2010 and gorgeous dresses, most of which i never ended up wearing. I never really wore makeup.  From 2010-2012, I moved into Urban Outfitters basic-ness, trying to be a bit more edgy. This is when I started wearing winged liner every day.  From 2012-2016, I was all about Banana Republic, because of wanting to appear professional, but was so bored with my wardrobe. I toned down my liner but added neutral eye shadow.  From 2016-2018, I almost exclusively wore athleisure because of my work switching from business casual to casual. I was comfy af though. Minimal makeup all the way.  From 2018 on, I’ve limited myself to second hand shopping. My look is much more eclectic now, but I find the items I buy feel more like treasures to me. I wear everything in my closet and I’ve got a much more streamlined approach to shopping. If it’s not made of a natural material, I don’t buy it. If it’s not black, white, grey, blue, burgundy, or yellow, I don’t buy it. If a skirt isn’t an A-line silhouette, I don’t buy it. These hard stops have prevented me from making the same fashion mistakes over and over again. I’m a more efficient shopper and my wardrobe stays cohesive.   I’ve definitely experienced a glow-up with makeup, though. I feel like I’ve really nailed down the look I like and I wear it every single day - tinted moisturizer with SPF, neutral satin eyeshadow, winged liner, peachy blush, eyebrow pencil, and tinted chapstick. It takes me 5 min in total to do this look. I never get bored of it, either. When I have to do a presentation, I’ll wear bold red lips and that adds enough variety for me to feel like I’ve spiced it up.	episode_done:False
text:I’m a huge fan of A- line skirts too. I find them quite flattering!   Same with red lips they are timeless and always a good move!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:Oh no. Until I was 24 I either wore jeans + sweatshirt or full business formal and nothing in between. I had like 6 JCrew pantsuits when I was 14 because I did extracurriculars like mock trial and speech. I sold or donated my suit separates, because I don’t work in an environment where most of them would be suitable (I used to be an accountant, now I’m a sommelier). I’ve never been consistent in wearing makeup but I stopped tweezing my eyebrows.   I have one pair of jeans now, since I prefer wilder colors and styles (I have a lot of very funky flare pants now). I guess it’s on-trend now but I don’t like it because it’s on trend. I have one scarf I bought when I was 16 that I am wearing right now and will wear for the rest of my life, and a ring I bought when I was 12, but I haven’t had any clothes for longer than 2 years.	episode_done:True
text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I definitely went through a lot of style changes too!  Middle School- I wore what was “in.” Tight t shirts from Aeropostale and sweatpants from Abercrombie.   High school- I geared more toward my current look. Jeans and t shirts, or dresses and leggings/tights if the weather allowed. I was very much an Ann Taylor/Loft fan because of their petite sizing. Sometimes I wore slacks and t shirts because slacks are more comfortable than jeans imo.  College (right now.)- I wear a lot of things similar to what you described as your current style! Not nearly as often as I’d like due to weather and dresses aren’t always practical. I did just get a bunch of new stuff from Collectif if 40s/50s vintage inspired clothes are up your alley. They have a big sale right now too! I also would check out shoes from American Duchess and Remix Vintage if they’re in your price range	episode_done:True
text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I’m Op but I’ll share mine -  At around 14 I had a quick phase of really liking the very early sort of e- kid bright and trendy fashion. Hot topic forever 21 sort of edgy stuff. Skinny jeans only. Small wardrobe. Didn’t look great and got bullied a little for my new look. Lowkey wanted to look like a gorillaz character. Still kinda do though lol.  Then there was a transitional trendy masculine street wear phase from when I was late 14 to late 15 . I only really wore ripped jeans, graphic tees , always a belt , with vans or converse that matched the shirt. I started getting of compliments on my style from peers.  I then had an art kid style phase late 15 - 16 years old . Very similar to before but I started adding different style jackets and pants. This was an important phase because I started adding different accessories like print socks and hair stuff.   Really quick 90’s inspired phase. I tried dressing like 90’s Britpop singers lol. A small step back I’d say.   Late 16 to current ( I’m seventeen ) changed my style over quarantaine . Asking questions here changed everything. I realized how much I loved my more dressy clothes and fell in love with the l’ecole des femmes clothes. I stopped following trends and went for mature more romantic and currently Victorian styles. Man repeller slightly masculine inspiration too. I wear skirts, tights , blazers, dresses, hats, neck scarves and blouses now. I also sold my years worth of converse and vans to buy oxfords and heeled dress shoes. Though my peers understand it a little less I have never been happier. Very confident in my style currently.    [Quick note - It may seem crazy to change my style so quickly but when your young you tend to go through clothes more quickly as you grow and teens tend to be more rough on clothes ]   Thank you for reading : )	episode_done:False
text:I love this because I had almost the complete opposite transition. I went from aspiring to have a slightly dressy, classic style 14-16, and then in the past year and a half (17 now too lol), I had a drastic shift towards recognizing that as put together as dressier styles look, it’s not for me.   Luckily, I barely had any clothes anyway, so heading off to college soon, I decided to focus on what I actually value (comfort above all, feeling like myself in clothes, and replacing things I currently wear a ton) and now find myself in a much more colorful (unless i’m feeling all black), streetwear-esque look. Yesterday, I wore an outfit that I can’t stop grinning about today, and that never used to happen before. Absolutely ecstatic getting to play with clothes in a way that isn’t 100% “trendy” and is just more *me*.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:1.  yes, I wear some items from 5+ years ago, but I style them differently.  2. I'm 21. At 13 I wore lots of neons, but I basiclly did it to annoy my teacher who said bright colours are slutty (yes, I find it confusing too)  At 14 I switched schools and dressed like a  1960s stoner. I realized quickly I wasn't into it and that I was just copying people around me.  15-18 was grunge. Docs, faded denim jackets, jeans with 42 holes in then, plaid skater skirts . I dressed like it was 2012 when it was actually 2015-2018, but for a change I was dressing for myself, without intentions to annoy/ conform to people.   18-21 got a job where I had to wear black every day , as a result I was sick of grunge.  I started weating more colours, and becsme intrested in both 1940s snd 1970s fashion.   3 . It took me a long time to switch to grunge because that was my first real style that I built up, but switching to my current style was easier and quicker.  4 . I don't really dress trendy. If I notice a trend I really Iike I buy it, but I'm ok with wearing absulotly untrendy things.	episode_done:False

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:I'd say to some degree yes. Most fashion houses are rtw/couture first and accessories second. They dipped into the handbag and accessories market to make more money, but the real quality (and bread and butter) for most fashion houses is their rtw.   Chanel is in this weird spot where they're trying to outrun the secondhand market and regain the exclusivity they once had. They're trying to be Hermes but they could never be Hermes because Chanel is not known for their leather.   So yes, I think when it comes to handbags/SLGs/accessories most luxury houses are trying to put out the latest and greatest and kind of mimic fast fashion to some degree. They're appealing to a market that can't afford to become their regular clientele. The people whom they can't text when the latest $7000 tweed jacket is released each season and know that they can walk away with a $10,000+ sale. So brands are trying to push out the latest and greatest handbags, SLGs and shoes.   In terms of rtw, I do think the traditional fashion calendar is very fast paced, but several brands have said they will step away from the traditional calendar and cut it back down to 2-3 releases per year. It will be interesting to see what this means for S/S and F/W collections.   Commenting more on the handbag/accessories market:  I say this as someone is kind of handbag crazy, but I do wish people would do more research about the brands and bags they purchase. People assume that just because a bag is marked up it's handmade by an artisan who specializes in leather but that isn't the case for most brands.   If anyone is looking for Hermes alternatives I highly suggest Delvaux. Valextra and Moynat also have fantastic craftsmanship. But I bought my first box leather bag from Delvaux last year and it's on a completely different level from Chanel.	episode_done:False

I also don’t see a lot of effort from luxury brands as well to counter the fast fashion feel and perception. Less craftsmanship and no real effort concerning environmental effects or lowering their carbon footprint.   It’s a shame and I think the whole industry needs big change.	episode_done:False

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:Any time you're paying more than a few thousand dollars for a basic article of clothing, you're paying for the brand; because you could have that same blazer or pair of trousers custom made by a tailor/dressmaker in the same or better quality, for a lower price.  This was the case in the 50s and 60s as well, but at the time, high quality clothing was more common, sewing skills were more common, clothes were expected to last longer, and the general public had a better understanding of what good-quality clothing looks like; people bought Chanel expecting quality construction, of course, but the main appeal of buying from a prominent Parisian fashion house was knowing that anything Chanel made would be in fashion for the upcoming years.  Now that we are immersed in fast fashion, nobody has the knowledge to hold luxury brands accountable, and fashions change so quickly that a well-made 'up-to-date' jacket from a reliably fashionable brand would be a pointless investment.  It just doesn't make sense anymore for luxury brands to invest too much on quality if there is no longer any demand for quality.  This is not *only* a recent thing: I've seen gowns from the court of Marie Antoinette made of materials costing 30+ years of a working man's wages, yet were hastily thrown together with big, sloppy stitches and tacks.  That's just what happens when your client wants their garment *right now* and will only wear it once or twice.  If you want something that's really well-made and is going to last a long time, there is certainly a market niche for that, but it's become more of a middle-class niche for people who *specifically* care about quality and durability.	episode_done:False

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:I'd say to some degree yes. Most fashion houses are rtw/couture first and accessories second. They dipped into the handbag and accessories market to make more money, but the real quality (and bread and butter) for most fashion houses is their rtw.   Chanel is in this weird spot where they're trying to outrun the secondhand market and regain the exclusivity they once had. They're trying to be Hermes but they could never be Hermes because Chanel is not known for their leather.   So yes, I think when it comes to handbags/SLGs/accessories most luxury houses are trying to put out the latest and greatest and kind of mimic fast fashion to some degree. They're appealing to a market that can't afford to become their regular clientele. The people whom they can't text when the latest $7000 tweed jacket is released each season and know that they can walk away with a $10,000+ sale. So brands are trying to push out the latest and greatest handbags, SLGs and shoes.   In terms of rtw, I do think the traditional fashion calendar is very fast paced, but several brands have said they will step away from the traditional calendar and cut it back down to 2-3 releases per year. It will be interesting to see what this means for S/S and F/W collections.   Commenting more on the handbag/accessories market:  I say this as someone is kind of handbag crazy, but I do wish people would do more research about the brands and bags they purchase. People assume that just because a bag is marked up it's handmade by an artisan who specializes in leather but that isn't the case for most brands.   If anyone is looking for Hermes alternatives I highly suggest Delvaux. Valextra and Moynat also have fantastic craftsmanship. But I bought my first box leather bag from Delvaux last year and it's on a completely different level from Chanel.	episode_done:False
text: "regain the exclusivity they once had" - Is that possible? Chanel has too many brand ambassadors that just doesn't scream Chanel.	labels:I think they’re headed in the right direction with all of their price increases. When Chanel increases their prices, the prices on the secondhand market go up. So I guess that’s kind of on their side. On the purse forum, people say the goal is for the jumbo flap to be 10K.   I think it’s fine for Chanel to evolve from the Lagerfeld era.	episode_done:False
text:They need to evolve and create a new identity post Lagerfeld era.

I remember about 10 years ago I saw a story about someone who took a photo a day of their face over an extended period of time and I was floored by the commitment and the progression of how much someone changes facially.  It was presented in one of those flip-book-esque ways.    I was intrigued by the idea of taking a photo a day as some sort of time capsule/chronicle and started taking outfit photos when it was somewhat shameful and indulgent (at least to me then) but now I have a whole archive of outfits from ten years ago.  It does chronicle emotions and whatever period I was going through as well so your piece resonated with me a lot.

When I think of Fendi, I'm not a fan due to the overt branding on the baguettes. I don't think this collection really strikes me as interesting, though I am a fan of look 31 and the blue piping detail. The graphics also don't excite me a ton, except for the cursive Fendi coat in 23 (and I actually love the pop of the turtleneck and gloves and piping - so whimsical!) This collection confuses me as it's simultaneously very muted but also funky, but I don't feel as though there's cohesive messaging.

text:You definitely have a point. While this collection leans more graffiti, I think the rest of his art is a bit more abstract than a lot of graffiti art I’ve seen (though in fairness I don’t follow the graffiti scene closely), and the sweater vests and puffy coat showcase that for me. Maybe I’m just excited because I’ve been eyeing some of his art prints and now his art is available in the form of fashion.

text:> Noel is just famous.  I think part of the reason for this kind of collab is that the collaborator brings their followers to the audience for the clothing company’s work.  There are a lot of choices for customers out there nowadays, and to sell high end things you first have to get people to look at them.  Fielding‘s signature look is playful and casual, but still meticulous and of high quality.  For the well-paid WFH crowd, who are no longer spending their clothing budget on daily office wear, I think this collab is a good marketing strategy.  Plus, I like the bold colors, and the cozy tactile stuff - high fashion but comfy - is really perfect right now.	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:I found myself at age 27 having lost every good pieces I ever owned, had gained 32 lbs, and was wearing the same two pairs of leggings from Ross basically every day. I’m 32 going on 33 now and have built a beautiful new style, I don’t have everything, but a lot of great wearable pieces.  My advice is to start with what you’re missing in that moment, and buy ahead for the season when you can.   Do not try to buy everything at once!  Pay close attn to materials (what you like vs. don’t) and remember to look for that when shopping online. Things that will last and are versatile.   Accessories are fun 🤩 invest in pants shoes and bags and jewelry!  Don’t just buy things because they are on sale, be thoughtful about what you’re choosing.   Do not be afraid to buy things oversized!  I was so afraid to up size for so long that I ended up with tshirts I never wear sweatpants sweatshirts, jackets etc. even SHOES!   Which brings me to my last point, remember to bring socks when trying on boots!  Xoxo 😘	episode_done:True

How often are you attending religious services, religious rites of passage, or big-deal family events like weddings?  Start with taking an inventory of your time and what you need your closet to do to help you be as prepared as possible for how you spend that time.

But one thing that doesn't come up in the conversation often (at least that I've seen, and it was something that honestly didn't occur to me until I'd been seeing these conversations for a long time) is *laundry*. Like, if you have only a handful of items, do you also have the time and space to do washing at least once a week? That could mean having to go to a laundromat or it could mean handwashing in a sink and hanging things to dry. If you have an in-home washer and dryer (or at least washer) it's a little different, but otherwise, that is something to consider when you don't have many options...I'm not saying capsules are bad at all! Again, I think there are tons of reasons why people like them.

text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:I've done so twice and the first time was a disaster.   I was trying to combine advice about "classic and timeless" pieces with a look based around an entirely different aesthetic, and it turned into a mess. I was still holding onto outdated assumptions about what was fashionable. I was trying to do too much at once. I have almost no pieces left from that year.  I am convinced that for 99% of people, "classic and timeless" is a scam. If you sew your own Victorian-style pieces, that's awesome. If you have a lot of time and money to spend a lot of time looking for the perfect 100% silk and cashmere pieces from different decades, that's awesome too. Otherwise, there's a good chance that you're in denial about a dated wardrobe. A better goal for most people is to get to a place where you can update with new pieces slowly - maybe 2-3 per year. I will be buying one new wool sweater this winter.  A good place to start is with what you already gravitate to in your daily life and your own closet. Imagine that you really want to go to work (or your favorite restaurant or to do something fun on the weekend, whatever you do often) tomorrow wearing something that makes you feel special and look your best, but you're going to be wearing it all day, so it needs to be pretty comfortable. Which outfit do you pull out?   In my own wardrobe, I can look through the outfits I passed by and say why - too casual (although sometimes those are perfect for another activity), I just don't love it and it would never be my first pick, too tight, too cheap-looking, not my style, too boring. It's easier to build around what you already like than to throw everything away and try to buy things based on an imaginary person that you've never actually been. Get rid of the things that you never gravitate toward, and see what's left. From there, you might need just a few more wish-list pieces to get that smaller wardrobe you love.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:My advice to my past self would be:  GO SLOW. However slowly you think you’re going, it’s still too fast. Find one piece that you really love- beautiful color, perfect fit, quality material, in a style you like- before even thinking about more.  Trying to plan an entire wardrobe (even a tiny one) and then trying to shop for the plan, just landed me with a bunch of stuff that wasn’t quite right. Going slowly, piece by piece, helps to make sure I’m making a good purchase rather than something rushed, trying to fill a perceived wardrobe hole. It’s also helpful, because if you go slowly one piece by one piece, you’ll also be doing “with as few pieces as possible”, and can stop when you have what you need and love.  My second point of advice to myself would be to stay off the internet, focus on what I actually like for myself, and not get distracted by all the pretty things on all the different people.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:If you aren't married to the idea of capsules:  Buy seasonally appropriate basics and rent fancier work clothing or special occasion garments from Rent the Runway (or another rental brand). It's a good way to take your time with building a wardrobe you like while trying out trends you may be curious about but hesitant to pull the trigger on. It's worth noting that your wardrobe is never really done. Things get worn out, fall out of favor, stop fitting your lifestyle, or you just stop liking them. I think if you have a solid foundation (jeans, slacks, a few blouses, sweaters, t-shirts, undergarments, a few pairs of black and brown shoes) you can find flexibility with styling beyond that without feeling that you have not enough clothing or a million things and nothing to wear.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go?

text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:When you're looking at pictures for inspiration ask yourself if you like the clothes or if you like what you feel the clothes etc represent. If you buy clothes because of what you feel they represent you may end up wasting money and having to do another wardrobe re-vamp.  To give you an example: I find myself drawn to drapey, flowy, bohemian, artsy types of clothes. The sort that tend to look good on taller women with small busts. Now I'm a firm believer in wearing things you like regardless of whether conventional wisdom says they look "good" on you. But in this case what I was being drawn to was the lifestyle I felt those clothes represented, not the clothes themselves - which it turned out did not fit my lifestyle, my personality or my shape. It took quite a few expensive mistakes to realise this.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:I had to revamp my wardrobe over the last two years as I changed jobs and sizes.   I had just finished a no-buy year, while I lost weight so was starting with nothing at all.   1. Buy decent undergarments. As a large busted woman, I can’t tell how anything fits without a good fitting bra. There’s r/abrathatfits to get a good measurement as many women are wearing the wrong bras. I got a size and sister size from this, went to a bra shop with a good range of bras and tried a few on to find one everyday one that fitted perfectly. Get a decent sports bra while you are there if you exercise at any speed above a gentle stroll.   2. Know what you need for where. Having items for work, weekend and exercise is important. Some people don’t separate work and weekend wear that much and others have wardrobes that look like they belong to different people.   3. Start with one or two items/outfits (especially if trying a new look) before committing. There’s no point in buying a whole wardrobe that later doesn’t feel right. I had a strong sense of what I liked and still bought a couple of oopsies.   4. A classic/go-to item might not be a classic for you. I love the look of skirts but never ever wear them. I only wear trousers and/or dresses so wasted my money on a couple of classic black skirts for work. I have worn them exactly 0 times.   5. Take risks in the dressing room. Try different colours and silhouettes on in actual shops and think about what you like/don’t like about each piece. I have changed my style a bit as it is free to try it on!   5. A decent blazer that fits well makes any outfit more formal when you need it- even us more casual people.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:You're kinda making a mountain out of a molehill here. It's not hard to wear colors. Relax about it. It's not a disaster if things clash slightly. You'll be fine. There are no fashion police.   My usual style is I get either brightly colored top or a bright bottom (or a bright dress). The other is relatively neutral to avoid clashing or being overwhelming. This is not a hard and fast rule. There are times when it's fine to break it. It's just a guideline for when I'm in a hurry.  Match saturation and brightness. Burgundy and plum are fine together because both are relatively saturated and dark. Pale pink and lavender work together. Burgundy and lavender are harder because they don't match in saturation and brightness. They aren't impossible to put together and look good but it's a bit harder.  You will not look good in some colors. This is 100% fine. Try things on. Figure out what makes you look awful. You can do this. It doesn't need any special knowledge.	episode_done:False
text:In total agreement with this. I kept trying to find my season/palette/whatever using a bunch of systems and always got frustrated. But then I found friskygatos on IG and she was just like... "Hold up colors next to each other and if you like them together, wear it." And her lizard brain concept was super freeing.  Today I wore an all pale pink outfit and got tons of compliments and felt fabulous. I don't even know/care if it was my most flattering color, but just the fact that I looked different than the sea of neutral outfits out there made me happy!	labels:> "Hold up colors next to each other and if you like them together, wear it."  That is literally how I choose outfits and I've been told I look well-put together.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:I think an important question you should ask yourself before just trying to incorporate color is  are you actually dissatisfied with neutrals/does color really inspire you? I think the biggest reason I wear color is because when I look at it, it makes me happy, it inspires me to want to wear pieces, and I get excited shopping for it.   In looking for color to incorporate in with your neutrals, I would just first find out what colors you feel drawn to - sure maybe some you’ll find will be things you like, but maybe aren’t the most “flattering” or versatile, but I still think that’s a good place to start, because fashion should be fun.   As far as practical advice, wearing color is a lot easier when you have neutrals to pair it with. I tend to wear one bright color/color family with neutral tones and tie it in also with my accessories. Things like earrings or accessories can be good places to introduce color if you are feeling nervous about it as well.  Also, learning about the color wheel and the undertones of colors can be really useful for color matching.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:This sounds counterintuative, but you should try colourful patterns. Than, you take one of the colours from the pattern and wear another item of thar color. For axample, I have a top with  white, orange, blue and olive stripes, and I can easily pair it with any bottoms in these colours.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:Assuming you wear jeans and a t shirt now and then, go out and buy a cheap t shirt or two in a colour you like. If you find yourself wearing them regularly, buy some more bright items. If you don't wear them much, then perhaps bright colours are not for you, at least now, and you won't have spent much to find out.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:Start with colors that go with your existing colors. Navy goes really well with mustard yellow. Mustard yellow goes with black and white effortlessly.   Once you have that down, then choose colors that go with the colors you added. So, if you added mustard, than, brown goes with mustard. Viridian goes with mustard. Pink goes with mustard. So on and so forth. Some colors will look good on you, and some won’t, so, the best way to incorporate colors is to just try colors on.	episode_done:False
text:I love mustard as a neutral!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:As someone who used to exclusively wear black (not exaggerating, it was a manifestation an anxiety/ocd problem- lots of therapy, baby steps, and now I consider leopard and hot pink neutrals), I found it easiest to start with accessories (especially shoes!) and patterns that were mostly black. Dark florals go with just about everything. Once I got used to that, I branched out into floral pants and funky sweaters. There was definitely trial and error, and I spent a ton of money on items that ultimately went to consignment it goodwill. However, now I have a really good idea of what I like, and while I still love a good neutral moment, my wardrobe is probably 1/2 colorful pieces, 1/4 non-black neutrals, and 1/4 black pieces.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:Don’t over think it. Just rip off the band aid. Head to a store that has basic tops (sweaters or t-shirts depending on your location) and pick a colour that makes you smile. Bring it home, try it on with all your bottoms til you find a good combo - given your focus on basics, there will be more than one!  Uniqlo is good for this, also banana republic usually has a table of sweaters with a few “this season” brights (last year I got an amazing Kelly green sweater there - works so well with navy!)	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:Colorful skirts are good options to try out. I also have a mostly neutral wardrobe, but I discovered that I can pair basic white shirts with a more colorful skirt.  It looks fun, but still "safe" because I don't have to worry about what color suits my skin tone.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:To add onto the rest of the great advice in this thread, following the color trends can be helpful in seeing how color looks on others and how you can apply them to yourself. I follow some accounts that specifically photograph folks during fashion week in various locales, and there's so much vibrancy that occurs there with colors that you might not expect to fit together. It helps to have these (kind of) practical examples in mind before you go on blowing money on colorful goods.  I've never actually done a color analysis, personally, but intuitively over time you will get a sense for what flatters you. You can even try holding random household items like Clorox wipes (lol) or notebooks up to your face or skin to see if that color would work as an actual item on you, preferably in good natural lighting where it won't distort the tones so much. I also like to accessorize with one small bright thing at a time, like bags, belts, scarves, or jewelry. Another way to do this is with wearing nail polish, either different colors on your nails all at once or specific parts of a palette to see if that combination is flattering with your skin tone.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:I hopped on r/coloranalysis and got an idea of my palette. I’ve been able to add a few sweaters/tops into my rotation that I feel confident look good against my skin tone. It has definitely helped me dip my toes into wearing more color and feeling confident doing so! Before I had an idea of what colors actually worked, I felt uncomfortable buying/wearing color.  I didn’t really think adding an accessory in a color helped me feel more comfortable. Understanding color theory a little more wrt how it works on my own coloring felt more intentional in my opinion, then I just went for adding a few tops.	episode_done:True

text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:What do you mean you don't have the time to shop online? Fashion is like anything, if you want to develop a style, it takes time...for most of us that's not a cost, that's a benefit :).  If you say the stores around you are limited, you MUST go online. I'm almost jealous of you - you're going to experience so many beautiful things for the first time if you haven't been looking before!	episode_done:False

text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:Well, i won't claim to be a style icon but my recipe since i was a teenager is essentially as follows:  1.  Buy used.  I mostly thrift but also look on used slow fashion instagram, Etsy, Poshmark, etc.  For thrifting, there is no secret - just go often, don't feel any pressure to buy something every time you go.   2.  Only buy natural fibres (silk, wool, cotton, linen) - this isn't hard and fast as I have thrifted down puffer jackets, etc but if it is touching my skin it isn't acrylic or polyester.  3.  Buy things that are interesting.  A unique shape or colour, or a beautiful material, it stands out on the rack. I mostly don't thrift fast fashion, it was shit to begin with - I am looking for vintage tags and high quality clothing.  Look at how the seams are finished, how the buttons are sewn on.	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:You're asking a couple of different questions  1) how do I build a style without much time or money?  Pinterest is a good way to do that.  Everytime you do have time and see a look you like pin it.  Pin whatever pleases you visually.  Can be other things besides fashion too.  Then when you have a bunch of things pinned look for a common thread.  Maybe it will turn out that you're a person who never knew she loved organic, flowing shapes in blues or graphic designs and structured fabrics.    2) figure out how well what you like goes with your body type or coloring and if there are ways to bring the two together.  I have a big butt so I may be able to wear some of the things i like and not others.  I also look like crap in orange but can get away with coral so I'd go for coral instead or tiny bits of orange print on a background of a color that does flatter me.  3) Yes there are staples that are classic.  black or navy or gray or for some people brown pants however if you're not a black or navy or gray or brown person you might be better off figuring out what you like first and then what would be a staple for you.	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:The most important part of expanding my closet as a college student with limited resources was  changing my mindset from always wanting brand-new clothes to appreciating thrift shopping. It's just so much cheaper and most of the clothes are in perfect condition. In addition, the vast amount of different styles from even different decades makes it much more fun to shop at.  Jeans are my absolute favorites to thrift. The wear (and tear) makes them so much more unique!	episode_done:False
text:I agree with this mindset wholeheartedly. Fashion is an incredibly expensive hobby for me, personally, and I let it be because I can afford it now, but you can absolutely build a wardrobe off of thrifting and purchasing secondhand clothes. And in fact, once your mindset shifts to this, or even to concepts like capsule wardrobes, you'll force your mind into building more styling options with what you have, even if it's not the vast wardrobe that you might see from influencers or bloggers.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:Where are you from? Are you a student or a working adult? What is your budget and purpose of dressing up? Do you have any spare weekend to go into a megastore (e.g. Zara, your local department store...) to try out all types of colors and silhouettes to see what suits you? You're not obligated to buy even if you try it on. If anyone ask, just say you're just trying out and still thinking about it.             I suggest knowing your measurements (use a measuring tape!) and sticking to a capsule wardrobe. Black/White top + colorful bottom or colorful top + black/white/brown bottom with neutral shoes.       Keep in mind the stylish people on social media spend a ton on their clothes or rent/return them after taking photos so they are not exactly appropriate comparisons for everyone.	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:I would start with good quality basics. Having a good foundation will allow you to expand with more trendy or style defining pieces, but it’s very hard to achieve a personal style without the first step. Unfortunately it does take time to find the right pieces, but I would suggest watching fashion YouTubers as a resource so you can see people try on clothes and get a better sense of the fit or quality.	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:I almost exclusively online shop. I wouldn't say that I am a trend setter or anything, but it is so much easier to look at photos online of people who have the same body shape as me whose fashion I admire, compare those photos to what I have in my closet, and purchase what is missing to make the outfit work all in one place. It sounds like a lot, but I find this so much easier, less anxiety-inducing, and less time consuming than brick-and-mortar shopping. Plus, usually returns are just a drop off somewhere with a digital reciept rather than waiting is line at a customer service counter with a paper receipt that I have lost twice, ripped, and had to tape back together. A little tidbit: the biggest trick to online shopping is to KNOW YOUR MEASUREMENTS!!! A cheap measuring tape works wonders.	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:Volume (a lot of items) and access (lots of designer things) doesn't create personal style. Personal style creates personal style, and it is a huge spectrum of things. There is no "one up" in personal style when it is authentic and your own. You'd simply appreciate all the style around you as its own, and appreciate and focus on your own style and look. Most people on social media have tacky, pointless style. They're wearing clothing, etc. for likes and clicks. The problem with this is that it means you're always cycling through what generates likes and clicks - not what is unique and stylish about you. You don't need new clothes. You don't need to change. You need to recognize your style and own it, and find the validation in it how it comes versus mirroring/measuring it to someone who is operating for validation and attention.	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:I've went through this myself, and the thing that has helped the most is to build that skill inside your head of "what does style mean to me?" The answer to this question is different for everyone, and you'll see it reflected just on the WAYWT threads - whether fashion is highlighting your existence in a certain social sphere, whether style is function over form, etc. What I did before my "outlet" grew was to source my inspiration online and think about pieces that I had and why I did or didn't like or wear them. You can do this with your existing wardrobe, or by window-shopping, which I know isn't so easy in COVID times, but you can do it online as well. What features do you love about your existing clothes? What defines "nice clothes" to yourself? I used to think that it was all about polished business casual clothing, because that reflected the work environments I had to survive in. Your staples will also be defined by what you think flatters (or unflatters!) you the most.  To be honest, I think style takes time; time to hone in on what you want or how you want to represent yourself. And if it doesn't take time, it does take money, and that's why being a stylist is a viable career path as well. But you do not need money to build or learn about style. My style has changed vastly from when I moved cross-country multiple times, and when I've changed careers. But style doesn't need to be static or done immediately. :)	episode_done:True

text:Winx style, a nostalgia trip	labels:The albums look dope! And I agree about the remake . I used to love the show when I was little and I don’t have high hopes at all. To start off, even though I’m not a fashion or costume expert or anything the clothing looks just so bland. Like it says almost nothing about their characters and just bland overall. Not unique.   They also took beloved characters and removed/replaced them. And there’s also the issue of whitewashing some of the characters in what was originally a pretty diverse show and it just looks like a mess.	episode_done:True

It’s baffling how wrong the remake is.	episode_done:True

I was obsessed with Winx as a kid and was initially SO excited when I heard they were making a live action version (partially because I feel like we are having such a good fashion moment rn where they really could have done the amazing Winx styles justice) but then when I saw that mess of a trailer? They look like they’re wearing the most basic clothes girls wore at my mistake of a Christian college, the removed girls, and *please* do not get me started on the white washing of some of my faves!!! What a major bummer! But your albums brought me joy and also some ideas for my own wardrobe lol!	episode_done:True

text:Villanelle's Killer Wardrobe, Once Again	labels:I'm usually paying attention to her face because she's such a great actress but I had a lot of fun looking at these outfits and paying some more attention to them. I find it interesting trying to break out what she wears when she's not playing a character and what she wears when she's trying play a character or when she's not trying but still is being manipulative. (**POSSIBLE SPOILERS UP TO END OF S3: DON'T READ AHEAD IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED AND DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED ALSO IF SOMEONE KNOWS HOW TO BLOCK THEM OUT AND CAN LET ME KNOW THAT'D BE AWESOME)**  &#x200B;  The little girlish dress with the cut out heart when she's pleading with her mom to form some kind of relationship with her and the pink dress when she's trying to trick Konstantin into thinking she's worried about him so she can steal the card with the next job on it.  When she's feeling herself and doesn't have to play a character she's usually wearing a patterned suit or some comfy black pants and a cool top. When she was playing Billie she wore two kimono-inspired jackets, which is pretty interesting and I just noticed the continuity for that character. When she was starting over after she thought Eve was dead she's wearing stylish romantic dresses which match her new villa in a way.    &#x200B;  **END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS**  &#x200B;  Anyway I enjoyed the album, she has a really interesting style and wears everything so well.	episode_done:True

text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:All my non athletic leggings are from American Eagle. It’s been a few years since I purchased some from there since I don’t currently need any (plus they all all seem to be high-waisted nowadays) so I don’t know if the fabric makeup is the same or not, but I’d give them a try. I also like some of their joggers. In case you need any athletic leggings, Under Armor has been comfortable for me. Just the basic cold gear or heat gear though. The higher rated ones (2.0 and up) have a thicker inner layer which I did not care for on my skin. Too much of a “snag and drag” type sensation if I had any dryer patches of skin.	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:I always get itchy in tights! Falke makes 100% wool tights and socks that feel great and are highly durable, but they don’t have the ability to look really fancy like a nylon pantyhose (though maybe there’s a silk option or something).   I don’t have a problem with most leggings, but I’ve seen wool leggings by icebreaker and smartwool. Both those brands can be pricy, but I snagged my partner some nice icebreaker base layers on their Black Friday sale for over half off (doesn’t help this second, but watch for sales if the retail price seems too icky)	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:\--lululemon align leggings (size up).  Closest to wearing nothing that I've found in a legging.  \--gap pure body modal joggers.  These are actually like wearing nothing.	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:I LOVE Aerie leggings! I usually look for ones with some cotton content (100% synthetic irritates my skin.) But I just bought the Aerie offline goals leggings and they are like butter. No irritation, so comfy. And leggings are 25% off right now on the app!	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:I like fleece lined tights. The lack of a seam really helps with itchiness and the fleece feels softer against my skin instead of clingy. I just buy cheap ones I find during sales, but ones I bought from aerie recently are really nice, we'll see how they hold up after a couple of washes.	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:Natural fibers only!

text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:They are expensive, but for wearing under skirts/dresses, I find that silk or a silk/cashmere stocking blend works best for me. I find them used or gently used, and do my best to take extremely good care of them. I also found that going on an anti-inflammatory diet helps quite a bit, and using unscented everything and being very careful with my laundry soaps. I use wool drier balls, and am in love with those, too, in place of any softener. I generally sleep without clothing/underwear, unless I am staying at my parents or in-laws, in which case I opt for a fairly modest silk nightgown. At home, I wear 100% cotton leggings or a dress for leisure wear.	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:I've found that cotton is best, with up to 5% spandex. It's not a sexy look, but cotton flannel pyjamas are very comfy and cause no skin issues for me. I also have a couple pairs of cotton-stretch joggers from Amazon for home wear, and a pair of truly ancient 100% viscose leggings (they're basically see through now, which is probably why they're so soft). Honestly I usually wear a cotton dress around the house though - I find anything tight-fitting on the legs can cause trouble.  For tights, Falke has always been more comfortable than average for me. I buy a size up, which seems to reduce the pressure and itching.	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:I always found tights and leggings to be itchy until I tried the Vuori Performance Jogger. They aren't skin-tight and are incredibly soft. My skin can't handle fleece, regular sweatpant material, or anything remotely scratchy. The vuori joggers are my new favorite pant - I have multiple black pairs and can't sing their praises enough.	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:OP, my boyfriend's mother was tested allergic to blue dye in polyester and nylon, so she can only wear natural fibers. You should probably get it checked if those fibers are bothering you. Maybe you have an allergy with some chemicals used to dye or process these fibers. The allergist will help you figure out the category of clothes you can and cannot wear.  In my bf's mom's case, she only wears 100% cotton, wool, cashmere, and silk fibers.	episode_done:True
text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.	episode_done:False

text:I love this answer, and I think that’s also why certain looks on certain people end up looking so costume-y. If a look is not authentic to your life and to who you are, it’s not going to have the effect you’re hoping to achieve.  The notion of appreciating fashion without feeling compelled to wear it yourself also ties into the conversations around cultural appropriation. As beautiful as I find traditional attire from other countries and cultures, or as cool as the fashion is in many countercultures, I don’t NEED to wear those outfits on my own body to appreciate and enjoy them.	labels:	episode_done:True

I have tons of Pinterest boards for aesthetics that are totally impractical for me, but I just enjoy looking at them and imagining the lifestyle of those characters. I only have a couple of boards that are for items I would practically wear.

text:This is a Good Comment.  Especially the part about reacting to the model's body and styling as well as the items of clothing. And man, it can be real tough to come to terms with that sometimes. Having a cohesive style certainly helps with the styling aspect in these situations, but the part about the body is rife with stress and emotion for a lot of people. There's no one right way to deal with that. Everyone just needs to find the line between what they like and what they actually want.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Well-said! Body type especially has a big impact on how an outfit/style is perceived. Models showing off androgynous styles rarely have curvy body types. Meanwhile, "sexy" looks often go hand-in-hand with curvy. And the "off-duty model" look pretty much requires already looking like a model, otherwise you're just a chick in casual clothes. A beautiful woman looks good in damn near anything, that's why most models are beautiful women, lol.	labels:	episode_done:True

Effortless, breezy, maybe wandering around Paris window shopping on a nice spring day... but in reality I’m working from home on my couch. Structured trousers would be uncomfortable AF, cotton/linen blouses would be a wrinkly mess, my cat would get fur everywhere, I’m allergic to wool and I don’t wear shoes in my house, because ew. Or I’m going for a walk in my neighbourhood after work and it’s raining and dark, so I need a waterproof/reflective jacket and sturdy boots. It’s fun to look at pictures of nice styles, but they aren’t my reality.	labels:Ironically, right before the pandemic I was looking at buying a new suit, as I was just months into a new job that required me to be a bit more "business" (at least on 5 or so days a year) than my previous "distracted-professor" type jobs.

I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.	episode_done:False
text:Omg you’re so spot on, this is exactly how I feel. I often forget to look at the styling choices that create the whole look - such as the hair, the pose, the setting. I’m like “wow she looks amazing and effortless and so so cool” and perhaps that doesn’t have to 100% do with just the clothes, but perhaps the way her arm is draped over a chair, or a pose where the legs are spread lazily apart in a pair of wide leg jeans.	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True

text:Totally agreed, and this is why it makes me a bit squirmy when people say "wear what makes you happy!" in this sub, in the sense that it should be the last word in clothing. Yes, of course you should wear what makes you happy, but what makes us happy to wear is not so simple for a lot of people.  There are tons of things I don't particularly love in isolation but make me happy on my body, and conversely things I love in isolation but *don't* love on my body, and that can come from many angles: pure aesthetics but also fit, comfort, personal goals, how I'm treated when I'm wearing it, etc etc. What exact elements contribute to any of these is really the crux of personal fashion, and it's a far more complex conversation than just "wear it if you like it".	labels:Yeah, "wear what you like!" is an unhelpful platitude. It's the "just be happy!" of fashion advice, it doesn't tell you HOW to get where you want.	episode_done:True

I’m losing weight (retail workout/anxiety diet) and my taste is getting really forest gothy. I don’t have time or energy to sew right now but I have dyed a lot of my fancy fabrics black and hung them all up. I love seeing all the tonal and texture variations.

I added the social media part moreso so people could try for themselves, because I do keep my social media private. However, I really do think you need to have some kind of goal other than "I'm going to try and dress like Blair Waldorf" to make it fun and keep momentum going.   I suppose I could post outfits here with my face blurred if anything comes together particularly well! However, because I'm not buying any new clothes, not all of the references are as spot on as they could be.

text:It is very fun! I think to myself, "what would this character do with my closet?" so even though I don't have the low-rise jeans and tight satin tops of the 2000s needed to make more exact replicas, I still have a sense of what colors, fabrics, and silhouettes the character would go for. I am also fairly curvy, with prominent dark curly hair, so have to make adjustments there as well. For example, most of what Gabrielle Solis (Desperate Housewives) wears looks much less "classy" on a curvier frame, so to get her "vibe" I have to pick different pieces to fit my body type.	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:Most of my moves have been apartment-to-apartment in the same climate (four distinct seasons with extremes in temperatures in both directions), but I still like to use the time spent packing as an opportunity to reevaluate/purge. Generally I look at fit, condition/quality, and whether or not pieces fit with my lifestyle (e.g. if you work in a formal office you might need more formal clothes and less casual ones, and the reverse is also true).  It's also a good excuse to get rid of clothes you keep out of guilt (e.g. things you don't wear often but were a gift or that you feel bad getting rid of) so you only move things you love and are excited by.   When thinking about climate, you might not need a ton of warm sweaters, but you may still want to keep things like cardigans or lightweight sweaters for air-conditioned buildings. I live somewhere with hot summers, but I still always keep an "office sweater" at my desk because people can be a little overzealous with the AC. Yes, it might be 97 degrees F outside, but when you step inside to a 68 F building, it can be a bit of a shock. Bonus points if you own a top layer that's thin enough to ball up and put in your purse. I love breezy kimono-style layers as a hot weather third piece, but jewelry/accessories also gain more importance when trying to feel put together.  In general, try to think of your clothes in categories, and if there are categories you don't think you'll wear as often, keep fewer pieces in those categories. Also think about what things you may want to keep but store (maybe in an under-the-bed box?) for rare occasions. For example, I hate shorts and almost never wear them, but I do have a couple pairs that I keep for camping trips so that I don't need to rebuy on those occasions. Will you need warm clothes for visits to family/friends in colder climates, and if so, what quanitity?	episode_done:True
text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:When I moved from a very hot climate to a super cold, snowy one I was in a weird place both financially and with my wardrobe. It was supposed to be extremely short term but ended up being long term/possibly permanent, which definitely messed with my expectations for my wardrobe.  Eventually I got rid of all my "warm weather" clothes for various reasons, mostly size/style ones, and when I was able to started to stock up on winter wear. I didn't know what I liked so I just kind of went for it. For example, I thrifted tons of scarves only to barely use them a couple years later because I realized I only like infinity scarves. The same thing happened with multiple categories because I was so desperate to fill the missing chunk of my wardrobe.  I agree with the advice to wait as long as possible before making drastic changes. Its hard to know what you'll actually end of needing, much less what you'll like or enjoy using. See what you can pick up secondhand to try out styles that suit your new climate best before investing a lot of money or time into altering your wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:Was coming here to say this as well. I recently moved from the Midwest to Florida and my body adjusted pretty quickly to the higher temps here. It’s my first winter and I find myself still wearing my warmest wool and cashmere sweaters, winter coat, and gloves. It’s all relative, so a 30F degree drop day to day is going to feel cold regardless of if you started at 90F or 60F. I would also recommend trying to wait a year if you can before purging. I think I could safely purge my snow pants if I wasn’t planning on using them when I visit my parents. It’s also hotter longer here though, so I could definitely reduce my sweaters by 20% (the ones I reach for last anyway) to make room for more hot weather clothing. Hope this helps and good luck with your move!	labels:In regards to the snow pants: I personally would definitely find a way to store stuff like that if you like to travel or visit family. I have always lived in southeastern Texas but my husband and I tend to be able to travel when it is winter up north and I *definitely* have super cold weather (for me) items I only break out when I travel.

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate?

My open knit cardigan works all year round. You really have to be realistic and ask if you’re going to wear it in the next couple of years and how you’re going to store it. I would get rid of things that you could easily replace and polyester/polyamide (because it’s not as breathable and caused me bacne).   For the third piece, consider accessories. Belts, necklaces, bracelets, scarves, bags, hats, and earrings can add interest to your outfit.	episode_done:True

By the time I finally took it out , the soft brown leather had a big wet stains all over it which could not be fixed. I couldn’t bring myself to throw it away because it’s a gift from my mom, so I decided to dye it black. It’s been 2 years since the dye job, and the dye has held up really well (might upload the current pic if enough people are interested). I’ve also helped friends refresh their leather wallets/accessories/furniture using black leather dye, all with good results.  Every time I see people saying that their dye job has chipped/faded (I remember a few youtubers trying to dye their beige Chanel bagsblack), it’s likely because one of the following three reasons:   1) the new dye was not treated with a sealant.  2) the coating/sealant from original piece was not completely stripped, or had oils/waxes (from hand/leather care products) remaining on the surface preventing the dye from sticking. 3) the material is not leather, but polyurethane.  Applying sealant is absolutely crucial for longevity IMO. r/leathercraft has helped me so much!  Beautiful work OP!	episode_done:True

text:If you’re not yet ready to commit to investing in an expensive good quality winter coat (long ones are indeed more expensive!) before you get to feel out conditions for your new climate—an intermediate solution I recommend is that you wear a light/thinner puffer & a waterproof rain coat over it. Your puffer will keep you warm (and you can wear it solo on clear days) and the raincoat will give you snow/wind protection. They will also trap heat and warm the *air* surrounding your body, which is key!  Costco base layers are also wonderful quality and super affordable (and I think you can get them delivered online). I wore them on a pre-pan trip to Iceland during NOVEMBER and I would have to like race to rip them off when we got indoors because I would begin literally sweating lol but so warm when outside!	labels:Even a fleece and a raincoat will keep you warm.

Also, as u/BeeVoltage pointed out, be cautious about going second hand for your waterproof layer and try to stick to items with tags still on them or that were released recently as waterproofing does wear out over time.	labels:Second this! No such thing as bad weather, just bad clothes.   Make sure to check FABRICS when buying secondhand. Wool, Cashmere, down (not polyester fill) for sweaters, hats and overcoats, cotton, silk, or long underwear made for underclothes. You will want hats, gloves, scarves and good socks, and sturdy shoes. All can be cute and fit any aesthetic.   I moved from southern west coast Canada to interior Canada and learned that layering was my friend. Long underwear camis, cotton tights, jeans, sweaters, usually a ultra thin down with a wool coat overtop, hats, scarves, and gloves. Cover that skin!	episode_done:True

A lot of people think they need a new wardrobe or a lot of new items, but really it's often just wearing things they already have differently.

text:Is black tie comfort fashion a thing?	labels:As far as the baggy thing I don’t have too much info  But my buddy has a similar sensitivity and he gets almost all of his non cotton clothing (so generally, suits) lined with his safe fabrics by his tailor.

text:Is black tie comfort fashion a thing?	labels:Yes I call it formal pajamas. Brands like Johnny Was, Citron Santa Monica, and Eileen Fisher (her silk, velvet, and silk georgette). Plus the $$$ designer versions of these. A draped  band collar top in a brocade, and matching loose pants isn't quite black tie but it is formal!   For absolute black tie, I'd say maybe...Donna Karan Urban Zen + major jewelry. something like that. Like a full length avant guarde kaftan in shockingly expensive silk with shibori tie dye or something.  However perfectly fitted vintage clothing + sensitive skin likely isn't happening.   But you can translate aspects of that to your style---like for example you can get a full length ruched parachute silk skirt with granny boots and a draped lace top + a "mourning coat" for a funky "Magnolia Pearl" lagenlook formal style.	episode_done:True
text:Is black tie comfort fashion a thing?	labels:I'm not super experienced in vintage fashion, but something that is overlooked in modern fashion is the use of undergarments. In the case of black tie formal dresses, I'm sure there is a way to get a tailor to put in a cotton lining or perhaps find a slip that could fit underneath? Someone please correct me if this is not an option, but I don't see why you can't have the best of both worlds!	episode_done:True

text:Ever been censored at work because of what you wear?	labels:What kids wear isn't really relevant, it's what other teachers wear. I likely wouldn't be allowed to wear a feminist shirt to my work if someone complained even though 99% of my coworkers agree. It is inherently politically - that's the point of it!   I would get them to write down explicitly how they define political. Allowing vague rules allows them to apply it unevenly as it suits them, so get them to **write** it out. Plus, once it's in writing, you have evidence to give to your union rep if they try to hassle you over something not outside of their guidelines.  When I worked at a restaurant with older customers,, I got an upper ear piercing, so I had to wear my hair in a super weird low ponytail that covered the tops of my ears because non-lobe piercings weren't allowed.   I live in a liberal area and though political speech/expression isn't allowed at work because we're government employees, solidarity with marginalized people that doesn't specify a political issue wouldn't be considered polticial. our union literally handed out buttons in solidarity with George Floyd to wear on our work lanyards, and PRIDE/ally stuff is handed our by an employee resource group. As long as it's not saying "defund the police" or "keep gay marriage legal!" or something, then that's not politicial thats at most a social issue	episode_done:True
text:Ever been censored at work because of what you wear?	labels:Right after high school I got a job at the bank.

I think they had butt pockets similar to jean pockets. I was embarassed at the time, but it’s pretty funny in hindsight. S	episode_done:False

When I'm traveling, all the extra space in the bag is used for things like carrying a light cardigan, small water bottle, headphones, small notebook, and other necessities for the day. It's been great for it's versatility.  I've thought about the idea of getting a higher end purse, (I think the Neverfull Tote from LV looks nice) but I honestly can't seem to confidently justify spending 10x more on basically the same thing (large tote bag) I currently have.

text:To answer the justification question - cost per wear. My own NF is going on 12 years old now and still looks reasonably new, and I am not (and have not been) particularly kind with it either. I've tossed it around, dragged it on planes, beaches, through Asian wet markets etc. and it's still happily trucking along. The LV Canvas is notoriously hard-wearing.  Along the same line, quality of material used to construct the item. I currently also own leather bags from Everlane and Away. They're both well made, but you can tell the leather is substantially lower in quality, thickness and overall substance than say, my mother's Prada totes with leather that feels really thick and luxurious and plush. And with the Everlane bag, the unfinished suede interior is much rougher than the unfinished suede interiors of say, Celine bags and the leather is much, much thinner.  And while not all designer bags will age well, there is a reason Hermes bags can be handed down through generations but my Everlane bag will probably die before I do.     ETA: LV aside, the aftercare services are also generally pretty amazing. There are brands that will take your bag back and "spa" them for free or nominal fees. You don't get that kind of service with Madewell or Everlane.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:To go on a total side-rant here, isn't it nice to be able to carry all this stuff?? I don't carry as much as you but I really like having lip balm, ibuprofen, and kleenex with me at all times. Women often complain about the sexism of pockets (and that's legit) but can we also recognize that it's nice to be able to carry all this handy stuff all the time, which is totally socially acceptable for women and not for men?	labels:Yes, for sure - I’d be lost without half this stuff, and in my opinion, these are such handy items that a lot of people would be hard-pressed to find in an emergency type of situation and would be appreciative to have. Pockets are great, but there are definitely limitations.	episode_done:True
text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:The weather is kinda crazy right now. Sprinkle in the mornings. Hot in the day. Cold at night. So my current bag is the Longchamp Neo crossbody. It's my Mary Poppins bag that also keeps my hands free.  I carry my life in my bag six days a week for work. I don't baby my bags and this is easy to dump out and wipe clean.  Inside: I have my small wallet. Essentials punch with neosporin, bandaid, hand sanitizers, extra gloves, extra masks, some meds. Tiger balm, salonpas, hair ties, pads, wipes. A diaper. A beanie with a puff. Tea bags, instant coffee packets, sugar packets, mayo and mustard packets. Soy sauce. Chopsticks, spoons, and forks. Various random snacks. Electrolytes drink mix packets. My makeup bag. A note pad, random pens. Phone charger cord and battery charger. Glasses case...  That's what I see so far. I carry alot.  If I am carrying light. I have a Coach Cassie Crossbody bag that I carry for going out.	episode_done:True
text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:Phone (consider the size of your phone if you’re going to utilize dedicated phone pockets on the bag or even just going for a very small bag. Now that I’m thinking about it, I don’t know that my current phone would fit in my WOC), keys, wallet, pill case, eye drops (more so if I’m going to be out for a while; if I’m just running to the store this is not important), extra contact lenses if I’m wearing contacts, sunglasses, lip balm, mask. In more conventional times I’d also sometimes have concealer or lipstick with me for touch ups but now what I carry is pretty minimal. I sometimes have a few other things thrown in there depending on the circumstances but these are my every day items. I carry a specific bag for work since I need to carry my laptop and files for work.   Edit to add: hair ties!	episode_done:True
text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:Phone, RFID wallet (smaller size but thick, holds like 15 cards lol), glasses case, keys, 2 small bottles of hand sanitizer, pen, random papers, lip balm. Will add pads/tampons during that time of the month.     Also, two zippered pouches. One has my car registration (street parking in the city where there are a LOT of break ins, so I don't leave anything with my identity on it in the car), and the other has lactaid, tylenol, hair ties and Bobby pins, mints, band aids, oil blotting papers.     Pre-pandemic I also carried face powder and a travel brush and probably up to 4 lipsticks/balms etc. Now am not wearing face makeup or lipstick.	episode_done:True
text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:It really depends on what I’m doing and where I’m going, but generally day to day I carry my wallet, keys, reusable shopping bag, pen, lipstick, hand sanitizer, hand lotion, extra mask, perfume, hair ties, a foundation/concealer pen, a book, headphones, tissues, sunglasses, and mints	episode_done:True
text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:Back when I had a full time job, a large cross-body bag and inside a wallet (cash, Id, some cards) phone, headphones, charger,sunglasses, water bottle, chapstick, sunscreen, some pens, typically also a book for my commute to work.	episode_done:True
text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:There's some variation, but usually:  Phone, keys, wallet, a compact, sunglasses, a pouch with chapstick, Halls, a pen, headphones, and Tylenol, a lipstick or three, a notebook, a book to read, my planner, a phone charger, my keep cup or water bottle (or both), and hand sanitizer and a mask at the moment. Sometimes a travel umbrella.   I manage to fit most of all of that, sometimes with an exclusion or two, in my Fossil Rachel satchel. I love it.	episode_done:True

That being said, you can look in your closet for what you *really* love/looks good on you and find something similarly cut but in a different pattern/colour.

text:How do you guys find your style if you can’t try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:I’ve been going through my closet and donating/selling everything to clear space for when I can get some new stuff to go with my style changes from 20’s to 30’s. I’m teaching college now, so I really need to change my style so the students stop mistaking me for a student.   I took advantage of Zara’s big end of year sale online and got three amazing new coats that needed replacement in my wardrobe to begin with. I can risk buying tops online because the sizing is usually correct, but for pants, dresses, skirts I’ll have to wait for the case count to go down. I’m in AZ, so like, they don’t really have precautions right now, but I’m limiting my going out to just selling stuff and leaving. Built up some huge store credits!  Edit: right, I’ve been trolling style blogs, insta, and pinterest for months to decide on my new style.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys find your style if you can’t try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:I think you can still return clothing you buy at the store that you aren’t feeling once you try it on at home! So I would say buy the thing you want to try, try it on at home and if it doesn’t work out just take it back to the store. This might not be the case at every store, but at the stores around me they take returns no problem.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys find your style if you can’t try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:I’ve been getting really into buying and selling on secondhand apps like depop and poshmark this quarantine! It takes out a lot of the cost concerns cause it’s cheaper than buying new and if I receive the item and I don’t like it, I can just sell it for the same price I bought it for. Plus I’ve cleared up a bunch of closet space by selling my clothes I don’t wear anymore. Done pretty much a complete closet overhaul in the past few months for just a few hundred bucks. Gonna come out of lockdown looking like a whole new person!	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys find your style if you can’t try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:In college, I worked at a dept store.  A good part of my day was cleaning out dressing rooms and I saw some things that I would rather not see (ie human feces, every bodily fluid imaginable).    As a result, I avoid all dressing rooms like Covid.  I'll hold things up in a store, but I won't buy from a place I can't return.	episode_done:True

text:How do you guys find your style if you can’t try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:Little Old Lady here.  Comment on another post called my style "artsy androgynous".  No hand me downs (LOVED them when I was in a position to get!!), but graphic tees/denim shirts/flannels/hoodies/jeans/cargoes.  Never aimed for a style my whole life I don't think, but this is how I ended up, clean, warm/cool, comfortable.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys find your style if you can’t try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:Amazon has an amazing return policy.

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:I have a shitload of skirts, plain-colored shirts, and sweaters. Basically I find a thing I like and I get it in every color.  The only thing I don't do that for is pants, because I don't like wearing pants that often, and dresses are their own thing and don't need to be monochromatic.	episode_done:True
text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:I keep most of my wardrobe relatively similar.  My work outfit is one of five pairs of pants, a button down, or a tee with a blazer.  My weekend uniform is athletic wear or jeans with a tank or tee in one of like five colors.  Mostly everything is black, gray, white, light blue, navy, with some camel and tomato red.  Only dresses really deviate here.    I play with shoes, makeup, and sunglasses to mix up my basic wardrobe.  And my bikini collection is relatively extensive, I have more bikinis than pairs of pants.	episode_done:True
text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:In the old days where one got dressed I had somewhat of a personal uniform:   The perfect black pant (own four of them, cheap from h&m but perfect for me) plus the same blousish top in all nice colors they sell it in (short and long sleeve) plus cardigans in all nice colors they sell it in, though mostly black ones. Some neutral blazers. Some dresses.  For fancy appointments I own the same etui dress and blazer combination in black, navy and grey.   Shoes black leather (ballerina, winter, closed shoe, pumps).   My whole wardrobe fits in one ikea pax (1 meter/3 ft). Generally it is boring bottoms and some more color for the tops. I always feel huge in colored pants.	episode_done:False

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:My vibes are so #1 and varied it is a little ridiculous. I'm definitely a closet maximalist and I love having very varied pieces. Always have been like this too, in college people liked to joke that they've never seen me repeat an outfit.   I will say some of my stuff fits similarly. Like MOST of my pants are high waisted skinnies, but in a bunch of colors/patterns. I have like...10-12 beanies that are all different colors...  I'd say my handbags is the part of my wardrobe I change out the least. I have a black pleather mini backpack and a beige woven cross body that are my go-tos, with like 3 other bags for special occasions.	episode_done:True

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:My closet definitely has #3 vibes. I go out of my way to thrift EVERYTHING besides specific pieces I’m in need of. I have a very boho/neo-hippy style with some funky pieces. When it comes to bottoms, I like to be consistent with skinny jeans, mom cut jeans, and harem pants. Then, I usually style a patterned shirt or t shirt with basic pants. If I have some funky pants, I’ll throw on a mono colored shirt. For shoes, I almost always wear docs (I have a black 1460 8-eye pair & a brown 1460 pascal leather pair) or vans (my 20 year-old spirit is shining through lol).	episode_done:True
text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:I have a maximalist capsule wardrobe where everything matches by way of a specific color palette.

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:I have evolved some classics I keep- I admit I dress a bit like a children's book illustration character from the first half of the last century meets femdom faerie sex witch- so it's a lot of simple collared blouse under unornemented cashmere sweaters, black opaque tights, solid saturated colours largely in jewel tones, positively ridiculous big hair bows and then flip flop into corsets and strapy, or lacey things.    I go through periods of realizing a 34 year old wearing thigh highs with maryjanes is confusing and periods of comforting myself that the lesbian in clarks and stripey socks look makes me happy and as an elder-millenenial I am basically a generation adrift.    Probably the hardest part is realizing I don't have to buy new clothing. Like, I have enough of most things and it doesn't wear out fast enough to justify replacing it, nor does it really no longer spark joy.    I have stuff that fits from college that still has *years* of wear left. Unless I gain another 20lbs more than my natural yoyo, or suddenly take up a physical job, basically only socks, shoes and underwear will need updates from just material failure.	episode_done:True
text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:The majority of my closet follows the capsule wardrobe mentality. Colours are black, white, tan, navy & stripes. Mix of tops and bottoms that generally work well with each other for mixing it up.  I live in a hot climate as well so am slowing swapping all my fast fashion over to linen clothes as they fall apart.  My only exception to this capsule wardrobe are my bohemian, flowy, colourful print dresses (brand is Jaase if anyone wants to know) that are great for the beach, pool or hot weather. No need to pair these with anything as they are dresses. But outside of this, I stick to my standard capsule wardrobe :)	episode_done:True

text:That’s a really good point, but could you elaborate on what makes a dress appropriate for certain seasons, other than temperature considerations? I wear jeans and t-shirts all year long, so I’m very ignorant in this whole area.	labels:A summer dress could be more breezy fabrics, light florals, pastels. Winter could be heavier fabrics like velvet or long sleeves, darker florals could work for winter or fall.	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:I literally just spent a lot of time picking a “wedding guest” dress and one thing I tried to take into consideration was the fact that I don’t go to a lot of weddings, so I tried to nab something that will fit me through weight fluctuation since I plan to rewear it to weddings in the future. I also tried to aim for the middle ground between “covered enough to wear to a conservative wedding” and “not so dowdy I feel 30 years older than I am”. A wrap dress to the knee ended fitting this bill for me!	episode_done:False
text:Agree with you on buying for weight fluctuations--the dresses that have lasted me through the years tend to either tie at the waist or are designed to be looser in the waist area. In my 20s I definitely gravitated toward more form fitting dresses and while I don't regret buying those at all, they are long gone... however if I found a sleeker fitting piece today for the right price and the right specific event, I probably wouldn't pass it up. But for future events TBD I definitely play it safe.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:That’s a really good point, but could you elaborate on what makes a dress appropriate for certain seasons, other than temperature considerations? I wear jeans and t-shirts all year long, so I’m very ignorant in this whole area.	labels:To me, a winter dress either has long sleeves or is worn with a blazer/jacket to cover up short sleeves. Winter dresses are either long (past the knee) or if it is short, is worn with dark colored stockings/nylons/leggings. Winter dresses are typically darker colors- blacks, browns, dark green, navy, burgundy, etc.  A summer dress is usually lighter in fabric and lighter in color- whites, yellows, periwinkle, taupe, etc. A summer dress can be long- but if it’s long than the top should be short sleeved or tank top/halter etc so you don’t overheat.	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:Not white, not red and depending on area, not black. White and red are the bride's colors (culturally dependent). If the bride wears white, red can be considered attention grabbing. If the bride wears red, her culture probably views white as a mourning color. Black can be seen as an objection to the wedding and mourning - very regional.   Something conservative enough for church weddings. Knee length, covers shoulders? Shoulder covering can be fixed with a cardigan.   Something light for a hot outdoor wedding.   In my area, most weddings are cocktail or semi formal aka short dresses are fine. Formal would imply floor length gown, so if the store has a good one, that you like, and you think someone seems more likely to go full formal, that might be a good call.   If you have seasons, then one for each season. Think about the weather in your general area. How cold or hot does it get?	episode_done:False
text:> not red  Christ, yes. One of my old college buddies who I haven't been close to in like a decade wore a bright red dress to my wedding. The photographer took a million photos of her, to the exclusion of older family members I'd have rather had photos of. Part of that's on the photographer, of course, but it wouldn't have happened if she hadn't worn BRIGHT RED.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:One short cocktail length and one long if you feel like it. I personally wear fancy cocktail dresses no matter how fancy the wedding  I like black and navy bc you can rewear a ton. Color is great too. Just go for classic cuts.	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:Personally I try to avoid maxi dresses. I just feel that because the wedding party is often wearing floor length dresses I don't want to look like I'm trying to be part of the wedding party when I'm not. For this reason I also don't wear whatever the wedding colors are. So I would try to get a few different colors of dresses so that way you can try to avoid looking like you're trying to be part of the wedding party.  Also don't get too short or revealing, you don't want to look like you're trying to take away from the bride's attention. Also don't wear white for this reason.	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:I would get:  - a knee length/mid-calf black, brown, grey, or navy dress (good for anything and you can pair with colourful accessories for a wedding if you want)  - a flowy maxi dress (good for outdoor weddings in hot weather)  - a fun one that is still appropriate.   Avoid:  - excessive cleavage  - tacky rhinestones  - white dresses and anything close to white.  - completely red dresses   - black dresses can be a bit somber but I think can work if accessorized properly. Try to make sure it isn't too funeral-looking.   Things to keep in mind:  - at least one dress that covers your shoulders might be a good idea for any more traditional/conservative weddings.  - keep the length classy  - look for timeless styles, dresses you can wear in almost any decade and look good. Your fun one you can have fun with and have it be a trend that might not work 5 years from now.  - don't buy a dress you don't have the undergarments for/don't plan on buying undergarments for. Eg. Do you have massive boobs, and can't wear strapless bras? Don't get a strapless dress.	episode_done:False

text:Exactly!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:I'd get something dark that would work with a coat for cold weather (if you have cold weather there) and a spring/summer dress.   Weddings in my family involve lots of food and lots of dancing, so I always wear something that's comfortable like a wrap dress or floatier fabric vs. something stiffer and structured, but that's just me.	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:This may not be everyone's cup of tea but I love wearing oversized long sweaters or sweater dresses with sheer tights and then thigh highs over that. I'll usually wear this with combat boots or some type of heeled boot as ankle booties don't look great on me. You can also wear this with a skirt/shorts and a sweater and then a coat on top. Add a hat, scarf, gloves as needed.  This combo worked great for me in the fall when I lived in Canada.	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I agree with you about black tights looking weird with certain outfits...my answer is that I specifically buy my winter skirts/dresses to look good with black tights lol. If it doesn't, then it's just not gonna be worn in the fall/winter, it's too cold where I live for bare legs and I have never really found other colors/patterns of tights that I like the look of. Plus it means that everything also matches with black boots so it just makes things easy.  Also I just want to shout the praises of fleece lined tights from the rooftop. Those and loose fitting dress=ultimate comfort, but looks like you tried. I agree with the other commenter who suggested sizing up in tights, they never fit right when I got my true size, now that I size up I don't feel like I'm constantly adjusting them throughout the day anymore.	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I also hate pants for the same reasons as you. But I also live in a Nordic country which is hella cold.   I just wear thights that are made of comfortable quality fabrics (sometimes cotton/wool blends) and I buy at LEAST one size bigger than my actual size, with wide waistbands. I want comfort above all, and for me this works.  Also if I only had to deal with cold weathers in the morning, frankly I would just put the thights on in the morning and then take them off later and put them in my bag.	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I live in the freezing north and I still wear skirts in the winter. Because I'm insane and like to look like I'm from the 1890s. (I wear fleece or thick cotton tights with long wool skirts.)  My personal thought is that the height of the shoes doesn't matter if it's wet out. I will just wear snow boots or rain boots if those are called for, and fuck the aesthetic.   If it's just dry but cold, my personal rule of thumb:  * Higher skirt = higher shaft, longer skirt = lower shaft. Basically, ankle boots with ankle-length skirts, knee-high boots or thigh-high boots with miniskirts. * I include a contrasting-color knee sock as "the shaft," so a knee-high boot with a miniskirt is equivalent to an ankle boot plus knee-high socks with a miniskirt. * I sometimes layer tights with knee socks/thigh-highs or just wear the socks alone, and if the socks are calling attention to themselves (either by color or pattern), I wear them with ankle boots to show off the socks.	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I do not like black opaque tights very often. I love a patterned sheer-ish tight - with polka dots or some other thing. A loose enough pattern that hints at your skin below.. I have also had grey sheer pattern tights and other shades, but I a dark skinned black woman, so I have some different color constraints. I generally prefer darker tights over paler ones since I am darker.   As for ankle boot height? I prefer right around the ankle, or even something that has more of a profile of a shoe. I am not a big sock wearer, but if I do want ones to be visible, the need to be an interesting pair,   I'd pick colors that mimic your skin tone or pickup a shade in the dress/skirt you are wearing. I also do not love big contrast between the sock and the tight. But it depends, if the tight matches the dress/skirt - then contrast in the shoe is fine. But otherwise I like the shoe and tight to be closer together.	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:What length skirts do you gravitate toward?  Most of my skirts/dresses are mini or midi length, so I usually wear ankle boots or knee high boots.  I like my ankle boots to hit at the thinnest part of my ankle (right above the bone) and my knee high boots just below my knees.    I’m not a huge fan of mid calf, because that cuts off my leg in an awkward place and I don’t have enough leg to be doing that. (I’m 5’1”.)  My choice of boot depends on  1) how cold it will be 2) how long I’ll be in the cold 3) my coat  For example, if I’m going for a girls night (pre covid) I might decide to wear a mini with ankle boots, but have a longer coat that I can keep me warm if we’re moving around.  If I’m going to the farmers market, I might decide to wear a midi dress with knee high boots and a wool coat, so I can take my time.  I’m a big fan of knee high boots with midi dresses and long coats. The overlap really keeps out the cold. It’s definitely a 70s kind of vibe which isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. but maybe people will come around because Nicole Kidman rocked this vibe in the undoing...	episode_done:True

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:Leggings under dresses instead of tights (with tall or mid boots).

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I see people wear black tights with light colored or even spring dresses and I can’t stand it! Black tights don’t go with everything! Personally, in winter it’s all about fabrics. Heavy fabrics will look better with your boots and tights. I have a pair of black suede thigh high boots that keep my legs warm and go with pretty much everything in my closet. If I think black is too harsh, I have brown heeled booties that I wear with various patterned nude tights. Also sweater dresses are amazing because you can wear them with actual leggings and any boot! I also have a coat that’s nearly floor length to keep my legs warm if need be.	episode_done:True

My parents spent a good deal of money to get me them and I asked for them, and let a random bitter writer shame me out of wearing them. This year of the pandemic has brought about a new side of my personality that's just like "fuck you, life is too short and fragile to not wear what I want and be cozy AF" and I do not regret it.

text:Jewelry trends for 2021	labels:I feel like delicate, minimalist jewelry in general is here to stay for a while longer among the general populous (I personally think minimalist gold jewelry is timeless). It's easy to maintain and it goes with any outfit; can be a day and night piece.  Might just be me, but I feel that high fashion is always trying to promote the big, bold, statement jewelry, which is fine! The way you describe your style mixed with the beautiful pieces you like, it sounds like it fits you to a T. Just not sure if it is trending that direction though. But I think that you should shrug off today's "standards" and wear what makes you feel happy and confident!	episode_done:False
text:I think minimalist or non-statement jewelry is timeless to an extent like a simple colour t-shirt is timeless.

text:It’s also literally timeless if you are buying 14k/18k jewelry - it will last for years with the right care! Which also makes the delicate style more attainable in that regard - less gold material ($$$) needed.  I do think there will be some post-recession/depression like trends that will start emerge in 2021, but only to one or two items in an outfit. Like for some, it may be adding fun, costume jewelry and for others it might be reflected in flouncier dresses or statement bags, etc. It’s tough to predict and may not happen until after the vaccine reaches the majority, but I’m here to see it!	labels:Be careful about certain pieces, though.

Blazers, too: anything with strong shoulders, a nipped waist and a slightly longer length.   Silk scarves and vintage clip on earrings—I have a bit of an obsession with both. The combination can dress up a lazy outfit in seconds, in a way that's appropriate for any occasion.  Flowy midi skirts and dresses, especially pleated or wrap-around designs. Much more comfortable than jeans, and eye-catching, too.  Blouses: button-front silk shirts, cotton Liberty prints, and anything white/cream with lace or ruffles.  And because we're still in a pandemic...silk satin face masks. I've actually enjoyed matching them to my outfits!	episode_done:False

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:Definitely a different shoe style. If I’m not wanting to buy a whole new on trend wardrobe, a simple pair of shoes and how I style my hair for the day goes a long  way to “add a bit of spice” as the kids say.   Ex. Keds—> docs. Tan wedges --> black platforms. Ballet flats —> loafers. Bootie—>blundstone. High heel —> sneaker. Obviously stick to the style you want, but imo shoes completely change an outfit.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I've found that actually cutting down on the number of clothes that I have (selling what I can, donating the rest), has actually helped me be more thoughtful and creative about what I do have, rather than being overwhelmed by the sheer number and defaulting to basics.  Stylebook is great at well - building looks, having the app randomly create outfits for you, but also saving inspiration photos. Sometimes I see people on IG and think "wow that outfit is so great!" and when I really look at it closer, I realize that I'll have similar items in my closet already, but I didn't think to combine them in that way. So I save those photos in the Stylebook app as a reminder of how I can shake up my basics. If you do choose to use the app, you'll see what you actually wear and may feel a bit more justified in letting go of pieces you don't reach for that are sunk costs & taking up space.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I play in my closet a lot. Just take a Saturday and try on different combinations. Layering really helps too and trying out different color combinations. And of course I use Pinterest and IG for inspiration, I really like what the women wear at Fashion Weeks so I try to re-create those looks. I follow style that's like mine and then of course where I aspire to be or just that I find interesting and different.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I have a similar style and I like adding 1-2 accessories to a basic outfit. My favorite is scarves! Not only can they be cute and lightweight, they can also be cute and big and cozy, like you’re wearing a blanket all day but it’s socially acceptable. Other accessories could be a pair of statement earrings, or a chunky belt, or a long necklace. Sometimes I just try different hair styles to feel like I’m doing something different.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:Okay I am totally in the same spot as you. So tired of wearing grey, I want to rid my closet of the colour. The best solution and not to rid your whole closet is to buy colourful accessories or go to a consignment store and buy statement pieces to wear with your basic wardrobe that would be at discounted prices compared to online retail like Free People and Anthropologie  (I recommend not going to thrift stores because that's more basics typically). I also have a rule that if a t-shirt or any article of clothing hasn't been worn in the last 6 months its time to donate it, that's at least 2 seasons of wearing it not being utilized. As for up-cycling your own old clothes you can buy fun iron on patches that can be added on plain hoodies or t-shirts for a pop of colour much like the brands Comme de Garcons and Scotch and Soda.  You can also embroider shirt collars, or the pockets of jeans.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:Echoing a few suggestions here re: accessories and shoes with some examples I’ve done this fall/winter.  My standard fall/winter wardrobe is also a sweater, jeans and ankle boots. Some variations I’ve tried:  I saw Pinterest inspo of statement red socks with Oxfords and I usually only wear oxfords in spring/summer because it feels too cold in fall winter. I bought a pair of red/burgundy cashmere socks from j crew and wore those today with my black oxfords, black jeans and white sweater with black stripes.  Wearing “dressy” sneakers. I bought some MOMA vans, I have a out of burgundy suede and tweed new balance sneakers I wear to work and I want to get a basic black pair of adidas shoes. Similar goes for slip on sneakers, I have a pair of Kate spade leopard print Keds and a red leather pair of Olukais with a pretty floral design.  I have an amazing blanket scarf and even wearing a very thin black sweater or long sleeve t shirt with the blanket scarf I always get compliments even though that’s my comfy outfit. It’s not a chunky sweater but it’s still warm.  When I want to look a bit dressier I really do love wearing sweater dresses or just thicker regular dresses and tights/leggings with ankle boots as well. For slightly thinner dresses throwing a long cardigan over top.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I am a very ordinary person so take this with a grain of salt. What I would do is a commitment to wear sth "new" every day. It's just not how you put it on and look at the mirror, but it also has to do with how you feel in it all day long.   Sometimes it's gonna work, sometimes it won't but you can have fun with your wardrobe everyday and hopefully you will find what goes well with what you have inside that huge wardrobe.   You are young so you can be daring.  You will be surprised.  Good luck and happy trying :)	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:Shoes and other accessories can be much cheaper to own and can completely change the vibe of an outfit. A different pair of shoes alone can take basically the same outfit from grandpa-core to vintage feminine to streetwear. For example I have pretty basic black cotton blend dress that I can wear with platform sneakers for a streetwear look, with flats or booties with pearl or diamond earrings for a "classy casual extra feminine" daytime look, and thigh high boots and berry lipstick for a "baddie" look on a night out.  Jewelry, makeup, and shoes are just fun easy ways to play with being someone else for a day without own multiple different sets of actual clothing. In my experience costume jewelry and second-hand or outlet retail shoes (like from places like TJ Maxx, Ross, Burlington, etc.) hold up much better for the lower prices than fast fashion fabrics do. So I like to get quality clothing and basic accessories, but then have cheaper more "out there" accessories/stuff for variety and experimental/trendy moments.  That ends up being way cheaper and more sustainable than buying a new top or skirt that will fall apart or be out of style in a year every time I want to feel different for a little bit. A change in hair and makeup is even cheaper and more sustainable because often you can use the same products, but just with different techniques/styles.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:Here is what I recommend:  1. Spend time in your closet regularly creating outfits. Most people know how to dress themselves, know what they like, etc. but they do not put the work/time into working with their wardrobe, or they do not do it enough. Set aside a time every few months to do it, even if it is just a mental effort of thinking out ideas and writing them down. 2. Constantly experiment. Wardrobe items turn into outfits and looks when there are elements and aspects to the look -- layering items, color combinations, mixing prints, etc. If your style tends to be neutral/basic, then this can be achieved with elements to the items like different necklines, trim and details, etc. 3. Try to create at least 3 outfits or more with each item you have. Make it a practice including when you are considering making a purchase -- i.e, what three outfits can I make if I buy this? 4. It is good to look for inspiration, but if you don't take time to make looks, it will not be useful and effective. 5. Understand your default/go-to looks and items and work them differently. Next time you french tuck the sweater with the jeans and boots, maybe try cuffing the jeans, or layering the sweater with something, or doing something unexpected with the look. This will broaden the use of your wardrobe items.  It can be helpful to have someone else you know come into your closet and show you how they'd work your wardrobe items. You could post photos of items here and ask people, "how would you wear this?" that could spark some new ideas as well.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I catalogued all my clothes in an app and track what I wear. If I want to wear something different\~\~\~ then I look at the category of "unworn" clothing and pick something to make an outfit with. It's really helped me make sure I wear as much of my clothes as possible (obviously the black cocktail dress is going to see less use than the everyday pink sweater but it helps with more unique items like my t shirt with applique parrots lol). If you don't want to catalogue your clothes and put this much effort into it (lol) you could just move your clothes to another part of your closet after you wear them or reverse the orientation of the hangers after wearing. Try to move as much of your clothes to the "worn" side of your closet as possible. And when you pick a lesser worn item don't give up and just make an outfit of it! Who cares if it doesn't match perfectly, you'll do it better next time!	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:I think that how you want to be perceived is representative of who you are. This is something I've battled with over the years, not just in terms of clothes, but behavior, etc. We try to act better than we think we are, we try to dress based on how our ideal "me" would dress. At times it might feel fake, like you are pretending, but the truth is that us striving to improve ourselves (based on what we define as "improvement") is one of the biggest indicators of who we are.  Obviously in a way, our taste in clothes will be dictated by people around us, but that's true for everything in life.  At the end of the day, if what you are wearing makes you feel good, then that is your sense of style. If it ever changes, that is because of changes to who you are. We are not static, we grow and change based on our environment and internal growth, and all of those are great :)	episode_done:False
text:This is so inspiring! I’ve always been sort of hesitant about wearing certain clothes and styles (eg. Boho, chic/sexy) even if I really like them, because I feel fake just like you mentioned, almost like I don’t deserve to dress like that because my personality doesn’t necessarily match the type of personality I associate with those styles.   But what you said about improving ourselves and how that relates to fashion is such an uplifting outlook. especially since I’m working on growing as a person and what to adopt more traits that I associate with the styles that I admire like confidence and a more laidback/spontaneous outlook.   Thank you so much for this amazing advice. I’m excited to carry this attitude with me into the new year.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:One thing you could do in search of your "real tastes" is to make a Pinterest board (or equivalent) of pictures you find beautiful and evocative - pictures that do NOT include clothing. If you think about style in terms of anything else - home decor, for instance - don't include that either. Think pictures of landscapes, animals, buildings, even abstract art. It sounds crazy but it really works - patterns will emerge. For instance, my board includes things like white billowy curtains, pink clouds, sea glass, foggy beach pictures. There's a general mood that I can't really describe or quantify through more defined "style groups" like goth, boho, romantic, etc. It's just what I find beautiful.   From there, find parallels to clothing. White billowy curtains -> white billowy blouses. Pink clouds -> pink fluffy sweaters. Sea glass -> sea glass jewelry! Foggy beach pictures -> muted colors, soft textures. If you are more artistic you might not even want to create clear-cut parallels but would prefer to think in "moods," whether a certain piece of clothing evokes the same mood as your board. That works too.  I get that how you want to be perceived is part of you too, but I still think it's useful to understand your more fundamental aesthetic preferences. Personally, I feel like after spending awhile in the world of style bloggers, youtubers, etc. it's easy to appreciate a huge variety of styles or to like certain things only because of exposure. It makes it hard to hone down what exactly you want from your own look. For ME, moving outside the world of clothing seems to do the trick.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:I don’t think you can be 100% original (Did you sew your own clothes? Create the patterns? Dye the yarn?), so I’d just ask myself if I like what I’m wearing, and if others disliking it bothers me.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:Both go hand in hand, and usually the confidence that comes with those fashion choices will end up building up to a style you may finally feel your own; although I think everything is influenced by something else, so just enjoy dressing up to whatever you feel suits you and your mood!	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:I've always wondered this myself. Early on in my career I used clothes to signal maturity. I'm 100% WFH now and I've suddenly realized that I really do like dressing up and I do dress for myself.  That means 4 days I week I'm edgier and bolder than before -- I have a much bigger range than I thought. I've always worn a ton of dresses and skirts -- still do but it so many different silhouettes and patterns. The other 3 days I am in black leggings and a comfy sweater.  However, I think when I return to the office I'll still dress for the job I want, but after work change back into my Doc Martins.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:There is no way your sense of style isn't defined by others. It's impossible, everything we wear and do is marketed to us	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:In art school, we learned about finding out own aesthetic. Finding it involved copying others' work for a while (never for profit, btw). We learned how to develop our own hand in this process, what worked for us and what didn't. In turn, our aesthetics became really a combination of several other artists.   I think fashion and style is the same. There's influences of who we follow, but the more we try and experiment, determining what works for us and what doesn't, is when our unique style will emerge - and it'll still even then be a combination of several other styles. Experiment, figure out what's important to you in your own style. It takes time and intention.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:I know that social media can subconsciously influence the way we perceive ourselves and the world around us. Perhaps try taking a little break/limit time from exposure to social media? It might change the way you dress. Also, I find that educating myself about the world of fashion has really opened my eyes to all the possible things that one can wear, so maybe try reading up on some fashion history/watching educational videos to hopefully gain a deeper appreciation for garments? But honestly, the "real you" should be the you that you feel most comfortable and happiest in. Good luck!	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:For a while I struggled with this as well. But then I realized that If you see something that someone else is wearing or is admiring someone’s style, in a way that really is your style too. If you like it on you, you can wear in and have it be a part of you. IMO it doesn’t matter if your style differs from day to day. One time I saw someone with a super cool black outfit on the street and straight up copied it from what I had home, and I loved to wear it! Next day I wore something flowery inspired from a fashion commercial! Felt great in that too.   Clothes can be very fun if you let them! Best of luck.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:There's that saying that "you don't know what you don't know", right? I couldn't conjure up a completely original and personal style out of thin air without pulling up inspiration and learning about all kinds of different styles and clothes and fabrics and aesthetics et cetera et cetera. My style is just a big mix of all kinds of trends from the last five years, but it's personal to me because I curated it.  I like to think of personal style as an iterative process similar to design, you build on top of what's already there, see what works, what doesn't, remove unnecessary things until there's nothing left to take away. What remains is just right. The one thing to realise is that it's not something that happens overnight, most people who have a really strong sense of personal style have been doing it for years or decades.	episode_done:True

Sometimes I look at these clothes and decide that I missed this or that, but most of the time, it gets cycled out after a while and donated somewhere.

text:[Inspo Album & Commentary] In Recursion: Japanese Traditionalist Futurism & Futurist Traditionalism (x-post from /r/malefashionadvice)	labels:I figured I'd x-post my latest inspo album on MFA to here, given the potential crossover appeal; several of the brands discussed have unisex clothes or womenswear lines, and/or tend towards a masculine-leaning androgynous aesthetic. While the album primarily depicts men, women and individuals whose sex and gender are unknown to me also make up a fair proportion.  I tend to steal a lot of inspo from FFA myself, so I hope this might be useful to someone here or otherwise provide some uncommon inspiration.	episode_done:True
text:Fashion "fantasies" coming true years later?	labels:A little bit different, but I remember as a kid being like "man, wish I had the confidence to wear belly shirts, they look so cool" or whatever we called them back in the 00s, and now that they're being styled with high waisted pants and skirts it's like, the best of both worlds, in that I don't have to have my full stomach out and it's way cuter this way anyways. AND the nigh waisted/crop solved the issue I had with clothes and my wide hips: low-rise pants would slide down and shirts would always ride up unless they were loose enough, so I would have to CONSTANTLY adjust.  And on the reverse note, any shirt I have that isn't cropped gets tucked in, which is funny considering how ridiculous it always seemed to me to tuck in shirts back then too.	episode_done:True

If I do make purchases I want to think about them long and hard, and really justify why I need them. I also want the item to be perfect if I’m going to buy it - I have a bad habit of buying things that are « good enough » in the pursuit of what I really want and that’s definitely contributed to my overflowing wardrobe.

Makeup, clothing (including bras, underwear, and socks), accessories, shoes (can replace only worn out athletic shoes), tech including headphones/charging cables (can replace my laptop or phone should they die), books, craft supplies (unless I get a custom Etsy order and need something for it), stationary/office supplies (I can only buy a 2022 planner).

I stopped exercising (yoga pants and hoodies are so forgiving. Not to mention sports bras and cotton undies rather than sexy lingerie that made me stand up a little bit straighter and smile that secret smile to myself. )  I can be chubbier than I'd like right now, and still have nice style that makes me feel sexy and attractive and good about how I present myself.  I can wear cute shoes and accessorize again, even if I have a mask that covers my smile.   I can also take care of myself and enjoy exercise and healthy foods, and get to a place where I feel better about my body in a swimsuit.	episode_done:False

text:What are your 2021 Fashion / Style Goals?	labels:My style goals for 2021:  1. Be more creative with my style. I want to wear my more funky and unique pieces more often, and to make some of my pieces more personal by embroidering them with cool designs.   2. Shop my closet. I probably have about 60 pieces all together including accessories (I know this from my Stylebook app) and I’ve realized that I can combine them in all sorts of new ways to create many different kinds of outfits.   2. Take videos of my crafted outfits. This has helped me a lot in seeing what is working on me and what needs a few tweaks. For example, I took a video of myself wearing a tucked in fitted turtleneck with high-waisted jeans and a belt. I felt it looked very nice in the mirror, but for some reason, it looked off in the video. I quickly realized that due to my height, my high-rise jeans weren’t hitting me at my natural waist, but were instead fitting closer to a mid rise. After noticing this, I experimented around with what I had, and settled on adding a unique 80’s jacket which made it look a lot more styled and proportionate.	episode_done:True

Hadn't heard of Margaret Howell before.  She's definitely the queen of balancing the top piece with the bottom piece in unconventional ways. And her footwear styling really makes the whole look.

One of the biggest breakthroughs I had in terms of my style was accepting my new body/silhouette and figuring out what cuts work for my new body.

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Lifestyle and body changes will take place and impact your wardrobe and style needs a few times over the course of your life, and 20s is sort of when most navigate this for the first time. The most important thing to determine is what if anything in your current wardrobe can work for you now, including your work looks, and what look you want to have with your style for work. This should fit into your industry and be appropriate, but it can still be 'you' (your vibe, etc.), it just takes some thought and planning. Clothing is 100% the wrapper so to speak we all wrap around ourselves, and can reflect who we are, where we are at in our lives, how we feel about ourselves, and alot of other aspects about yourselves. Aim to tie it as closely to you, and what your life needs are. That is how it has been effective for me here. If you want to share some workplace appropriate looks you like, we can help further!	episode_done:True
text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Had something similar happen, and let me just say - the first step is to find two or three good pants that you feel good in. For me, it was to leave behind shops like forever21 or New Look, and I started shopping at shops like Torrid. I know some people hate torrid, and some of their clothes are cheesey. But let me just say - they do the BEST jeans. I have bought them in size 10, 12, 14, and 16, and they fit and grow with me as my body changed and fluctuated, and then when I lost some weight, the smaller pairs still fit.      Just remember, you have to ignore the size on the rack, and instead go based on what feels good. Good, buttery jeans that make your butt look rocking are a huge confidence booster for me. Tops that hid the ladies which grew sort of uncontrollable after changing the pill also helped. Structured blazers with t-shirts and dark jeans = perfect office look for any size. Statement necklace or simple earrings always a bonus. However you are, as you said, you deserve clothes that fit, so get em, girl!	episode_done:True
text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Not really answering the question, but my issue has been the opposite. I'm about 10lbs lighter now than I was in high school, and I've stayed short and tiny my whole life. I basically kept my high school wardrobe all through college, then packed it with me when my husband and I got married and I moved. I didn't see the issue and thought it was ludicrous to get rid of an entire closet of clothes that were still intact and fit me well, until I started getting more serious about my career as a professor and realized my "professional teaching clothes" still read as "student attending an award ceremony."  Starting over the summer, I began weeding through my closet and donating anything that didn't make me happy or I couldn't imagine myself wearing in front of a classroom of college students or colleagues (except for my loungewear and workout clothes.) I felt A LOT of guilt at first, because I realized how many pieces I held onto for the nostalgia or just because they fit. I had to invite one of my closest friends over to help me make the tough decisions and she didn't let me talk myself into keeping a piece I initially put in the donate pile. That really helped my perspective, and now I can make more objective decisions without needing a cheerleader.   Once I got rid of about half of my closet (spring/summer and fall/winter wardrobe combined,) I gave myself permission to buy a few higher-end pieces that are much more my style but also fit both my daily life and professional needs. Neutral colors and versatile silhouettes. I feel so much less stress and guilt when I open my closet now, it really feels like I've moved into a new chapter of myself. It's my dream to have a 10-15 piece capsule closet, but one step at a time.  I'm so sorry I just went on a big tangent. It's been an enlightening quarantine for me obviously lol.	episode_done:True

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Me!! I am currently working through this - I actually created this new account specifically for FFA so I can feel more comfortable sharing outfits. 3 years ago I left a creative job to become a stay at home mom, and since then I had another baby and have been all over the place size-wise. Pre-kids I had a very defined personal style and was really connected to my local arts community and my wardrobe reflected that.   Now I’m kind of in a lost place (after two bouts of post-parting depression, the last one clearing up right as the pandemic started) and I have no idea how to integrate my personal style into my “new” lifestyle.   Currently I’m working on uploading my entire wardrobe to StyleBook, to hopefully track what I’m wearing every day to find trends so that I can clear out things I don’t wear or that don’t fit. I’ve also started browsing Pinterest and Instagram a lot more to encourage myself to wear things other than sweats every day. Even though I’m at home with two toddlers all the time, I think I feel better about myself when I put on real clothes that fit and make me feel happy!

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:I can't speak on the weight gain thing other than I'm sure you still look lovely and I hope you still feel beautiful right now as well. Weight gain is nothing to be ashamed of, but I commend you for trying to be healthier - that shit isn't easy!!  As for the "wanting to look professional but wanting to look / feel like myself", I think a LOT of people struggle with this. I feel like for the emo look, wearing all black can still be seen as very professional, I think the issue more would be the cuts of the clothes. It also depends on your profession / workplace - obviously some places are much more lenient and you can get away with a lot more skin. Maybe wearing jewelry that is more alternative can also be a good way to look professional but feel like yourself.	episode_done:True
text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Are you me?!  Clothing is 100% the way I manage to feel even remotely confident in my body. I have by no means actually figured this out – especially since I gained weight during the pandemic AND had abdominal surgery (no more crop tops for now since I don’t care to explain the marks) this year – but these are my tips:  1) Get rid of stuff that doesn’t fit you. I’m not sure if what you’re describing with weight stabilizing in a stable relationship is eating-disordered behavior, but in my similar situation, it absolutely was. I am pretty triggered by things that don’t fit, especially across the bust, which leads to my next point...  2) Bra fitting changes everything. I love how you note your old style was “lots of boobs” because mine was too, but kind of by accident because I had ill-fitting bras, and, by transition, clothes. I cannot recommend r/abrathatfits enough because whether “lots of boobs” is still you or you want to transition from it, a well-fitted bra makes everything look more professional and makes everyone look incredible...and feel incredible, too!  3) Tailor to your favorite parts of you. So, I took this really radically and now make my clothes. But that’s not an option for everyone. What is, however, more of an option, is taking things in at the waist, getting things hemmed, and putting in darts (triangle folds) to better fit curves. Depending on where you live, these “operations” can cost like $9-20 only and make the biggest difference. I have stubby legs, a ridiculously short waist, and bras that work as hats, but in my clothes that actually fit me, you don’t see those traits so much as the total look...and I like that look! I think tailoring is the best way to make clothes work FOR you, not you have to work around the clothes.  I hope that helps!!	episode_done:True
text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:I had an accident earlier this year and now have a slow-healing wound on my knee that won’t close up. I have to wear a dressing on it, so tight jeans are a no-go. I got into the habit of dressing down every day, at first because of the pain, which was unpleasant for the first few weeks, and then because I felt down about the injury (and Covid-life in general).  It was a bit of a revelation when I realised some of the more interesting trousers in my wardrobe are perfectly fine to wear, as they accommodate the dressing. It’s been reassuring to know that even if my body isn’t moving in the same way as before, I can still get dressed up if I want to. There’s definitely some restorative power in pulling on a decent outfit from time to time.	episode_done:False
text:I had a similar no jeans allowed dilemma! I have a medical problem that makes tight pants/denim not an option (except the occasional legging day). At first that meant I had wear the few pairs of androgynous-looking joggers which is a fun style but started to make me feel really frumpy and sad having to wear them every day. Now I’ve built up some trousers that look more put together and have a loose fit and conveniently usually an adjustable waistband, which has worked great for my recent weight gain. As a result I’ve also become much fonder of tight tops to balance out the looser pants.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Let me ask you a few questions here...do you even like these clothes or are you more comfortable in something else? Are you dressing for you or for men? If for men, if a man is disappointed by what you're "hiding" then he's not worth it. There are plenty of great men out there who like you and your body just the way you are and they don't really care what you're wearing.   I would say we are all hiding some flaw...for me, I'm hiding my mom pooch belly. I can hide it well in clothes, but naked...nope! It is right out there. If someone doesn't like that then that's on them and speaks to how shallow they are, which is an instant turn off for me.  Love yourself first.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I have a similar body type, though recently it’s gotten very slightly curvier. I’ve felt the same way, but literally everyone does this, not just us! Clothes create illusions. You’re not a fraud at all.   I’d also consider who you’re dressing for, like the other reply said. If you love what you wear obviously don’t do different because of something I say! But I felt a lot better about myself when I stopped trying to change my body type with clothes (which doesn’t mean I stopped wearing all of my more “flattering” pieces). But I actually found a lot more confidence dressing in clothes that are easier for us to pull off. For me, that’s 1920s and 1960s inspired dresses. The “sack” shape and drop waists are actually often really flattering on us (even with my short legs) and it’s unique because most people don’t find them flattering.   Yes, I probably look less traditionally sexy. But I’ve gotten lots of positive comments on the style that mean more to me anyway. I’ve gotten “Mad Men” comments so some people think it’s sexy anyway!   My advice is to step out of your comfort zone and try to find things that make you feel wonderful outside of people’s expectations of what your naked body should look like.   Good luck! I’m sure you look stunning.	labels:	episode_done:True

Exactly! It’s for this reason that (in most instances) I usually prefer people not notice my clothing enough to compliment any specific item.   As an example, I can wear a bright coral sweater and receive many compliments on it — but that’s because coral washes me out so badly that the sweater is all anyone notices. Or I can wear statement earrings. They’d utterly overwhelm my face, but I’d surely get comments and compliments.   A neutral grey sweater is a much less exciting item and is less likely to attract attention or compliments on its own — but I know that grey  makes my skin and eyes/hair pop in a way that make *me* look good as opposed to the clothing.	episode_done:False
text:This is such a great way to describe it!

text:>I’d also pay attention to the content of the compliment.  This is so interesting, but this is kind of hard too, sometimes. I had thought that maybe the novelty of the color was the reason for most of the compliments, but I have had several people who know me well also tell me that they like the color because it looks like it is natural and not like I dyed it (which, I guess is true since it is the result of a botched lightening job and not actual dye?).  Then again, these people also told me for years that they liked my bangs ... maybe they're all just benevolent liars. Unfortunately my hairdresser quit during the pandemic due to having a vulnerable family member so there's no one now I trust to tell me the truth about my hair.	labels:Well, I think it’s also important to recognize that people have different tastes and preferences. Lord knows I would never let my husband, who I love dearly, choose my clothes.   It’s also possible to have multiple things be true simultaneously. The color is unusual, it looks natural on you *and also* it’s not what you wanted (I’m guessing, based on “botched lightening job”).  Hair color is tough because it doesn’t lend itself to the “well, I’ll keep it in the closet and see how often I actually wear it” compromise that most of us make with clothes that we’re iffy about. Unless you’re a big scarf person or like wigs, it’s kind of an either/or question.	episode_done:True

text:I made this effort a couple years ago and it was life changing. It started with me silently observing and thinking nice things about people, but then it turned into me telling total strangers they look baller and it just brings so much joy into the world. Even if you just do the silent-to-self thing, it alters one’s outlook and I think makes one kinder.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:I've kept things like this a little longer due to people's compliments, or tried a little harder to sync them with my wardrobe in a way that I like better, but the vast majority of the time I end up donating or ceasing to wear the item in the end anyway.   Ultimately, aside from overarching situational appropriateness, other people's thoughts about my clothing choices (positive OR negative) have very little impact on my style and like you, my key motivator is my own comfort and confidence.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:Sometimes, I look really good in an item of clothing, but it doesn't feel like me. Looking good doesn't always mean I'm comfortable with the way I look. So yeah, I've gotten rid of items of clothing that looked amazing on me.	episode_done:True
text:Street style	labels:I have a pair of dark grey Old Navy overalls that is my go to for running errands. I wear whatever shirt or sweater underneath and pair with lace up boots and usually a winter hat. It makes an easy outfit and I feel cute.	episode_done:True
text:Street style	labels:I have sort of a range depending on what I am doing, but generally I do a lot of really easy dresses, easy skirts, tank tops, etc. By this I mean cotton stuff you can find on Asos. I don't really like jeans so for me a lot of upleveled leggings so not the traditional cotton but other fabrics, slim jogger style pants, etc.	episode_done:True
text:Street style	labels:I really like combining my jeans with vintage sweaters and sweatshirts. Also I like the combination of plain turtleneck and fun patterned pants :) by the way I have an Instagram where I take pictures of cool styles I see on the street, it’s @adoquinculture if you want to take a look for inspo. Also Pinterest is great if you haven’t used it yet.	episode_done:True
text:Street style	labels:As opposed to when I’m at the office, I tend to wear a lot more like loose, slouchy, oversized tops/sweaters, shorter skirts (pleated/schoolgirl-ish ones especially), more printed t-shirts, more stretchy cotton dresses, and more large belts with chain or stud details. Stuff that feel a little too revealing or edgy or casual for work but that I still like.  Typical free time outfits for me would be a stretchy, short tight, or flared cotton dress dress, thick tights and a big cardigan, or a short pleated skirt with a camisole and an oversized, off-shoulder sweater, or a long is-it-a-shirt-or-is-it-a-dress and patterned leggings.	episode_done:True
text:Street style	labels:This winter I found a coat I fell in love with, wool, oversized, soft pink, it turns heads on its own so I just find different things already in my closet to wear with it. That tends to be my approach I find... I fall in love with a certain look/item, and then proceed to wear the s*** out of it for months until my craving passes or the season changes.	episode_done:False
text:Great idea!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:So what works for me is whenever I'm getting dressed and there's an item I wish I had to complete the outfit I mentally note it. Make sure to think of the category of item Ex Black Cargo pants, Brown hoodie w/ no drawstrings and no logo, white chunky sneakers. Etc.   Then as time goes by, the categories that come up over and over are the most important to grab first and would improve the most outfits. I add them to a list  If I'm shopping and I want something but it's not on my list then I try to pass on buying it. When a deal pops up and it's something on my list it's a no brainer instant purchase.   I try to be patient and wait for items that meet all my picky criteria. If I'm not in love with it I don't buy it. If even one thing is not right, I pass.   And final thing is I aim high whenever I buy for these categories in quality and spend time hunting. Ex: If I have $250 for a jacket I try and wait till a $600 jacket goes on sale for $250. You can find investment worthy designer for near regular retail prices and it's worth the extra money.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:Quality over quantity. ALWAYS. During this time, Christmas sales are so tempting, and I work in retail so it’s hard not to go into work and think ‘what can I buy today with my 50% staff discount, and the others sales going on at the mall?’  I always go in a shop with a minimalistic mindset, and while I’m no true minimalist with clothes, I hate clutter and excess. But I still love to experiment with fashion (I went to school for it, it’s hard not to be creative). Look in your wardrobe, watch YouTube or look at Instagram and have intention on what style of garment you want that will suit you. Also, have patience in finding the right one you will be happy to keep for a LONG time.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:I'm going to try and do a clothing no buy in 2021 (I can only replace athletic shoes) so take what I say with a grain of salt.  For me, it is a matter of knowing myself.  The current trends (the boxy, oversized, neutral aesthetic) do not work for my body type (pear).  The other trend that does not work for me is the cropped/ankle pants trend.  I look like a small child who just outgrew their clothes.  I also know what I do not wear (black or khaki pants--- reminds me of retail work uniforms of years past).  When I purchase something, (in my mind) it has to "pay for itself."  Meaning I have to think of at least x times that I will wear the item before I will buy it (special occasions are the rare exception).  X means the dollar amount.  So I have to wear a $30 sweater at least 30 times to make it worthwhile.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:When I go to grab a piece and I either don’t have it, or I’ve worn it out, or it no longer fits. But I also don’t keep stuff that doesn’t fit when I try it.  I feel too guilty and like I’m throwing hard earned money away otherwise.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:This is small but one piece of shopping advice I still use is, ‘will I wear this tonight?’ Obviously for many items that is not a literal question but I find if I say no that may not be the right item for me.  Helps me pass on things that are nice but not right for my personality or lifestyle. I actually learned a lot from Ines de la Fressange’s book Parisian Chic. It’s a very general style book, it’s less about her taste, which is great, and more about how to have a quality collection that fits you.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:In general, nobody needs clothes, but want clothes instead.  You wish you could get a subscription for your clothes and identify gaps etc etc. You can, just get a personaly stylist, they'll do that job for you.	episode_done:False
text:I second this: I’ve bought too many clothes too many times to fit into a trend that doesn’t fit my style or body type.  Keep the clothes you’re comfortable with, donate what doesn’t fit/work for you anymore, and spend some time discovering your style identity before making any purchases.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:It starts with your personal style. If you don’t have one or you don’t know what it is, than your shopping habits will show that.   What I used to do was take photos of myself wearing the clothes I liked that I already owned, and when I’d shop, I’d try on clothes and see if they were fitting in a way that would both accommodate my style and also the other clothes. It helped me choose clothing that wouldn’t go weeks together in terms of length. I also used to take photos of my closet so I could avoid buying things I may have forgotten about.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:If you find yourself wearing a particular piece all the time, try and think what makes it a favorite, and what wardrobe home it fills. I’d then keep my eyes open for one or two similar pieces.   For example I bought a short sleeved button up on a whim and loved it, so now I have a bunch that I love and I wear all the time. They fill a good hole in my wardrobe (layers well under cardigans, fun print, work appropriate).	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:I think once you have your basics down, pay attention to the kinds of things that you find yourself wishing you had when you're getting dressed or when you're out.  If you keep consistently wanting the same things, long term, then it makes sense to add it to your closet.  It also helps if you get super specific about what you want and don't pick up things that kinda work, since you'll just end up buying a ton of similar things.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:Have you done a styling session with your current wardrobe to put together looks? If so, how did that go? It sounds like there is a chance you could/may need to work in your closet a little to put together outfits if you have not already. This is also a great exercise to identify what you really have to work with, and what you need. That'll help you round out what's missing and make your wardrobe more workable.	episode_done:True
text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:I sort on ThredUp by particular brands or really specific items. Like my most successful shopping experience there was looking for a silk leopard-print button down shirt. It let me sort by shirts in my size, made of silk, and then I picked animal print for the color. I found so many good options that I bought three! If I don't have that kind of specific search or a particular brand I want to browse, I find it pretty hard to look through.	episode_done:True
text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:Big plus one on filtering! I have a saved search of my favorite brands in my sizes in new or like new condition that I check periodically and more targeted searches like “wool and cashmere sweaters from 3 brands I like” that I use more often. Size filtering and material filtering can be the most helpful, as can brand filtering. Setting up a brand filter can take the longest but a big saved search of brands you like can help a lot in browsing.  Also plus one on payout—payout percentage increases with the dollar value of the item, and it’s so much lower effort for me to sell through them than through Poshmark. Poshmark takes forever and you have to spend so much time putting together good photos, detailed descriptions, and offers to potential buyers (plus then there’s the whole expectation of making you package cute with tissue papers and whatever to get good reviews). My time is just worth more than the additional payout I get from them. Thredup also will donate and recycle items they can’t sell, which turns it into a one stop thing for me. I will take my higher end items elsewhere for a first look, but if my local high end consignment shop won’t take it, I’ll let Thredup have a pass at it. Love the convenience factor.	episode_done:True
text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:Personally I don't care that ThredUp gives me very little money because I see their clean out bags as an effortless way to give clothes I don't want a new purpose. I'll have a bag of clothes lying around forever so I can “take it to goodwill” or “sell them on poshmark” but I never do. ThredUp either sells my clothes to a new owner or recycles them and maybe I even get a couple bucks out of it.	episode_done:False

Occasionally I will come across something that looks amazing from a brand I don't know, I will look it up and buy it if its a high quality brand. I generally stick to natural fibers, as polyester and rayon can be very hit or miss without feeling it. I don't buy anything with any damage. Thread up also has "premium" section but I find its kinda random what gets in there. You can also search by price >$10 and it will weed out a lot of junk.	episode_done:True
text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:Easiest way to sort out the crap - filter by fabric.   I always filter to only look at clothes with cotton/linen/silk/leather/wool. Sometimes low-quality blends pop up (Forever 21 makes clothes with like 2% cotton, which to me is just a waste), but in general you get better quality, more unique pieces.	episode_done:True
text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:As others have said, I think ThredUp is much better if you're going there with specific pieces or even just your favorite brands in mind. I have saved searches on my favorite brands that I know I can get for a great price there. That being said, I'm taking a break from ThredUp because I've had terrible experiences with the last 3 orders I made with them where I ended up returning almost all of it. They've been bad about listing something as "you might mistake it for brand new!" and then when it arrives there is definite fading that wasn't apparent in the photos, obvious lightening under the arms, pilling, etc. Very frustrating.	episode_done:False

text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Your comment about thinking each new piece will “complete” your wardrobe is so spot-on - I’m the master of convincing myself that once I have a [insert item here], my clothing collection will be complete and I’ll never need anything again. Surprise, surprise - there’s literally always something new that I “need” to “finish off” my wardrobe.   Like you, I’m trying to learn to work with what I have and narrow down exactly what I feel best in. I like high-waisted everything, plain tops in neutral colors, subtly patterned pants, button-downs that don’t need too much ironing, and a variety of jackets and shoes to switch things up. (Which I already own in spades.)   For 2021, I’m hoping to curb any non-necessary shopping impulses and am creating a shortlist from which I cannot deviate (as there are a few items I still want to add, such as a camel coat and a ski bib).	episode_done:True
text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:I did a no-buy year and a low-buy 6 months after that in 2018. I'm probably going to do the same this year.   I started as I needed to spend as little as possible as I had a pet who cost a lot for an ongoing chronic illness before he died.  I think I became more selective about what I bought. I also unsubscribed from a whole lot of sites. I also  became much better at money management and making outfits work in different ways. Also, by the end if I didn't wear it, it was worth thinking about what didn't like about it so I wasn't tempted by something inappropriate in the future.   The only reason it ended was I changed jobs and lost significant weight. But now my new wardrobe is complete, I don't need anything in the forseeable future. I'm probably going to just go through clothes seasonally  and  make a list if I need anything.  I did this before my no buy year and it worked well, but I had a lot more than I needed. It should work better now as I'm comfortable with the amount.	episode_done:True
text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Your post really resonated with me. First and foremost, hats off to you, for real. I definitely would not consider a no-buy during 2020 easy, at ALL. Yes maybe on a superficial level it would seem so since we are all just sitting around in onesies watching Netflix, but shopping - especially for new clothes - is an extremely effective way to self-soothe and lord knows we have needed a lot of that in 2020.   I personally broke up with fast fashion in 2019 during my second pregnancy (which really was easy in a way, because I didn’t actually fit into anything so it was difficult to justify purchasing new clothing). I’ve had a few weak moments but have discovered sewing/dressmaking. It is really exciting in its own right because, as you said, I actually have a personal style and a lot of my dream pieces are actually super attainable. It also just feels so good to finally be outside of the hamster wheel of endless trends, sales, promotions, influencers, newsletters, marketing and whatever else have you. Good luck in 2021!	episode_done:True

I have considered challenging myself to a no buy with one exception - I can make things. I love knitting and sewing and I’ve really enjoyed creating items to wear. However it is so easy to buy fabric for the same reasons you listed above. My goal is to be thoughtful in what I make, also focus on making things for other people. I can still fulfill that creative drive that way.	episode_done:True
text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Love your post.  I recently-ish got a sewing machine and am making myself only wear stuff I make.  Sewing can be an expensive hobby, however, I feel the clothes I do make would be less expensive than what I'd buy because I tended to go for nicer brands or linen sellers on Etsy (which can cost a pretty penny).  So, overall, I'm spending less money, have a new fun hobby, and it also makes me be more intentional with what I make since I'm not the fastest sewist.  Edit: also, in addition to unsubscribing to sale emails like you mentioned, I also moved all my shopping favorites in my browser to another folder that was annoying to get to.  I didn't want to delete it in case I do need a new winter coat or something (and can't remember brands). But this has really helped my window-not-really-shopping.	episode_done:True
text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.	episode_done:False

text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:I think if you see the same clothes on Shein, then the boutique is not being honest about where the clothes are coming from. Someone on this sub linked a cute “handmade” smart watch band from a shop on Etsy. When I went to buy it, I found the exact same watch band on Amazon for $10 cheaper. It was clear the Etsy shop was just marking up a mass-produced item and claiming it was handmade. They even used the exact same pictures as the Amazon listing. When shops aren’t honest about that stuff, I have no qualms purchasing the exact same product somewhere cheaper.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:Chances are, if you find the boutique selling the same things as everyone else is on Instagram, it’s dropshipped. You’ll have to look at reviewers (not anyone paid) to really know. I watch a bunch of Youtube videos and if not available, check reviewing sites.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:I know that legitimate IG shops exist. But for me personally, any IG shop I've "discovered" has clearly been either a scam or uses drop-shipping. I simply refuse to shop on IG all together.  I really recommend thrifting and organizing clothing swaps with friends (if/when safe, of course!) and/or using online alternatives like Poshmark, as someone else suggested.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:I don't trust boutiques on insta, they always seem to be fake low quality stuff. Generally you can plug the items name into a google search and see how many variations come up. Or use the same descriptors they do. Reverse image search on chrome works too.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:Find actual boutiques in your town/nearby cities etc. Either use Google maps, try posting on reddit/facebook pages from those nearby towns or cities.  Then check if they have a website. I would expect the contact details to have their actual street address (verifiable on google maps and street view, or a drive past), contact details (call them up and ask some questions) and their refund policies etc.    Most of the actual boutiques I know of - their photos (Instagram especially) are all taken in store, in front of the store, or nearby. They typically use the staff working there or regular customers as models - you tend to see the same faces.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:These are all pretty much dropshipping the same cheap clothes from Ali. Unfortunately affordable and ethical usually mutually exclusive because our idea of what cheap clothes should cost is based off a fast fashion model that can't work at a smaller sustainable scale. I would highly suggest the used market for affordable ethical clothes. threadup and poshmark are my go tos. But if you want to buy new Universal standard and Pact are good. Its also worth remembering that a lot of 'ethical' brands are really just greenwashed so who knows.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:I haven't had a lot of success with boutiques found on ig - I have a hard time deciphering if they are drop shipping like you mentioned.   You could try Poshmark - I find it helpful when I'm looking for something specific. Other than "shopping your own closet", shopping secondhand is also thinking more ethical and sustainable. Plus, you can find styles you like at a fraction of the cost.	episode_done:True

text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I moved from a tropical climate to a place with seasons and my style totally changed! Now I loveeee dressing up for colder weather (even though I hate the cold) and have neglected my summer style.  I think my style before was really based on the culture of where I lived - super beachy and low effort. Moving to a bigger city helped me develop my own style.	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:When I moved from a very seasonal American city to South East Asia, I for whatever reason thought that I _needed_ to live solely in very thin, very loose cottons and breezy skirts. I didn't bring a single pair of jeans or boots because I was fairly certain they would cause me to immediately melt into a puddle. For a period of time, I prioritized the heat over everything, so my style became really plain and blah, whereas I used to be fairly experimental back in the US.  Luckily, I then realized the key to dressing in the heat is just finding a balance. A thin turtleneck is fine with a skirt. Jeans and boots work fine with a tank top. Light weight blazer or loose oversized button-ups have replaced coats and sweaters, but still allow for some layering.   I've come to a good place with what I view my style as now, but I find that I do have to repeat a lot of basic "outfit formulas" and feel a bit envious of people who live in the cold and can layer to their hearts content. I think the cold weather lends itself to more creative combinations, whereas being stuck in perpetual summer makes me feel confined to a life of sun dresses.	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I moved from a place which has four seasons but it often grey and overcast to a place just a little north of the tropics with a lot of heat and sun. I still favour similar shapes but now in much lighter fabrics. The biggest difference has been the amount of colour in my wardrobe. I’ve gone from a mainly navy and blacks colour palette to wearing such a variety. I find myself often wearing seasonal colours as if I’m trying to create seasons which simply don’t exists in the weather!	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I think it did for me, however im trying to fix that. Id say my style in general is feminine/pretty and dressy. The weather in one location was mainly rainy, but also had alot of hills. So I ended up wearing jeans, a sweater/shirt and trainers for the majority of my duration there, unless I was going out. In that case, my style showed through more. Ive now moved back to my home country which has all seasons. During the summer, its hot so im normally in a feminine, flowy dress, but once winter hits, its just way too cold lol. Ill kind of go back to swearing jeans, a sweater and boots, but try to style it with more accessories (colorful scarf or a checkered jacket with some mid sized earrings). I bought a pair of knee high boots, a skirt and a couple thicker winter dresses this year to push myself to maintain my style whilst staying warm. We shall see if I stick to it, lol.	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:Moving to San Antonio encouraged me to explore my summer style! I'm into linens, rompers, light fabrics, and sleeveless/short sleeve button shirts. Its been a lot of fun. I used to rely on layering to complete my outfits. Now, I look at accessories (mostly earrings, scarves, and belts), textures, and shoes to tie everything together.	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:Where i live does not get extremely cold but you definitely have to change your clothing if you dont want to freeze to death.  I can still wear clothes from the summer in winter here but it’s all about layering! I have a ton of scarves, coats, jackets and most importantly, tights to wear under dresses, and skirts. I also almost exclusively wear my thigh high boots in winter/fall	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I have lived in the pnw my whole life, and when my husband and I moved to cali we were shocked with how our style changed because it NEVER rained, and any rainproof clothing just became sweat too much clothing. Only breathable fabrics!!!	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I moved from a place that was overcast and rainy most of the year where even the summers didn’t get warmer than 24C and the winters were around 10C to a place with hot (30C), humid summers, rainy and overcast late falls and cold (-10 to -30C) winters and where spring is so short it doesn’t count as a season. Boy has my wardrobe changed. I wear dresses, baggy pants and shorts in summer, the stuff I wore all year (jeans, t-shirts, sweaters, light rainwear) in the former place now works for fall. I wear layers of Heattech and down in winter and very rarely leave the house in a dress and only then if I’m going by car. Uniqlo has replaced Lululemon as my favourite place for basics. Since I walk and take public transit all year round and my outerwear is what most people see me in during the winter, I’ve got a closet full of winter coats and winter boots. It’s taken nearly a decade but I’m ready for every possible occasion and temperature and every storm.	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I moved from the Midwest to California this summer and I was so excited to incorporate a lot more linen into my wardrobe!  I got rid of lots of old sweaters and my winter boots and left my winter coat at my parent's house for visits.    I now own 3 pairs of linen pants, lots of breezy linen tops, and more sandals.	episode_done:True

text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Don't try too hard to fit into a style box or get too rigid about style rules. Be very honest with yourself about how something makes you feel as much as how it makes you look- and remember that being comfortable and confident makes literally any look 1000x better.  And for less woo woo advice- type of fabric makes a huge difference, the cheaper stuff usually isn't worth it. That's probably applicable to a lot more than women's clothes though.	episode_done:True
text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Keeping proportions in mind has been helpful for me (I am long-waisted relative to my height).

text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Honestly I think the best rules are the ones you come up with for yourself that suit you body best.

I think most people would come up with rules like “never wear 2 different plaids/ prints/ etc in one outfit!” But I do all the time because it’s fun for me	episode_done:True
text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:- Above all wear what makes you happiest   - Many women feel the best when dressing to their body type (apple, triangle, etc)  - Many women also feel best when dressing in their colors (autumn, spring, etc)	episode_done:True

text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:I would say start looking into what specific fabrics do and how to clean and treat them. You can invest quite a lot in a good cashmere sweater, but if you don’t wash it properly no amount of money will safe it. Same goes for a skirt from a fast fashion retailer, is it worth the x amount of money if it is made from an acrylic fabric? Wouldn’t you rather pay less at a budget retailer for the same quality?	episode_done:True
text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Lots of good advice here already. One thing maybe worth adding: be aware that a lot of women's retailers use soft-feeling but lower quality fabric. At places like Zara and H&M, the men's clothes will be made of nice cotton or wool blends, and then nearly identical garments in the women's section will be flimsy rayon blends (knitwear, especially). It's easy to get duped by something that feels nice in the shop, until you get home and realise it's made of nasty sweaty acrylic. The stitching and construction can also be shoddier, so you'll end up with garments that look warped and awkward after one wash. (My husband is often shocked by the difference in quality when we shop together.) Maybe you've already noticed this, but I wish someone had told me these things when I started shopping for myself :)  Another thing to know is a lot of women's clothes are labeled "dry clean only" or "hand wash only." You'll want to carefully read the labels so you don't ruin anything! The tumble dryer is not your friend, except for socks/undies/workout clothes. That said, most "dry clean only" items that aren't heavily embellished can be gently hand washed and air dried, but if you don't want the hassle, check the label before you buy.	episode_done:True
text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Don’t jump on trends...everything falls in and out of fashion if you wait long enough. Find a store/brand that you like the fit and cut of clothes on you and try to build a capsule wardrobe. Once you see what you like, you achieve a timeless look that doesn’t look trendy or dated. From there, feel free to incorporate fun pieces that can be easily added to other outfits like accessories or shoes.	episode_done:True
text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Honestly, accept that you’re gonna walk out the door and realize that your outfit looks ridiculous sometimes.  And that’s ok, especially when youre experimenting with new looks. As long as you liked the look before you stepped out the door and you figure out what you dont like about, it’s good!	episode_done:True
text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:As other users mentioned, (in my friend group at least) women tend to focus on emphasizing and downplaying certain features to achieve a desired silhouette more than the men do.  \[\[I could go on a 2 bazillion word rant about societal pressures for beauty standards but nobody wants to read that. \]\]   Point being, my advice would be to really look at the way clothes fit your body in almost an abstract way and see if you're achieving the shape you're trying to create.   This is 2021 you can be anything you want! a series of cascading triangles?  asymmetrical amoeba?  soft flappy machine at the car wash? sharp and pointy with a squishy interior? go for it!  If you're already into alternative / goth you probably have a good idea of your style already! :) Now it's just time to decide how "girly" you want to be with it. My goth "uniform" consists mostly of a mini skirt, crop top or top tied into a knot, black tights and boots. When it gets too hot for boots switch to studded sandals or converse and take off the tights.  If it's too cold put thigh high socks over the tights. Can't go wrong with a leather moto jacket or black faux fur on top.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:I generally find its easier to base your outfits around one piece, often an accent piece or statement piece. I got the idea from storytelling/art composition seminars, its infinitely more easy to come up with a composition once you know what your main character is interacting with scene/item wise. The same applies to outfits, once you have your main piece for that outfit you can decide how casual/dressed up you want to be, whether you need to add more textures, and what colors will match with said pieces color.  Generally I stick to the rules of trying to match the metals/detailing of outfits, trying to either go with neutrals for primary pieces with skintone matches to accents, or going with monochrome outfits(which generally look very stylish automatically). Fit wise, I generally make sure that I alternate between loose up top/form fitting below the waist, or vice versa. Silhouette is the most important thing, I try to go for clean lines.  Pattern wise I limit them to one pattern max, the same goes for textured pieces.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:I don't have a system per se. Rather, I have a kind of "capsule" mindset for my wardrobe: not too many statement pieces, and everything in my color palette (black, grey, Ivory, Navy, taupe, blush). I honestly haven't had to think about an outfit in years (outside of accounting for the weather). I can pick up practically any blouse, trousers, jacket, and accessory and they are almost guaranteed to match. I do find myself gravitating to layers (sweater over a blouse, cardigan over a top, etc) but I'm not too specific about it and I usually just choose whatever sounds most comfortable.  It works so well that I started doing this with lingerie too -only buying my lingerie in black, blush, or nude. Now my underwear always matches and it gives me the strength of ten men.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:My aunt has a "1 of 3" rule that I like: only one of the following areas should be shown/highlighted, cleavage, legs or back. For example, if the top is revealing cleavage, no short skirt or backless top. If the skirt is short, no cleavage or back, and so on. She says "one is attractive, two becomes trashy".	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:i kinda just got with what i know works for me. prioritize colors that make me happy, cuts that make me happy, things that fit right no matter what size it says it is, and comfortable fabrics so i don’t have a sensory issue with irritation.   so i guess my formula is more does this feel right to my needs and less “does this feel like a conventionally good looking outfit”	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:I'm a Sagittarius with a Taurus moon, so my formula is just abject chaos but make it luxe (ie. I wear a flat gold herringbone chain, gold or tortoiseshell earrings, a little gold watch, and a gold signet ring + my engagement ring at all times, even if I'm wearing leggings and a sweatshirt to play Stardew Valley all day).   More seriously, my jewellery basically never changes (see above), so I guess that's my formula? I wear that combo whether I'm wearing a dress and heels to go out (in theory, who even remembers going out?) or jeans and a sweatshirt to go to the grocery store (in theory, we just do pick up orders now). I did just get a new big-girl job, so maybe this will change as I'm able to better afford the wild 1940s wardrobe of my dreams?	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:When I was younger and experimenting with fashion and style, anything goes. Some days I hit bingo and come out looking fab, and other days I walk around knowing that I was a fashion disaster (incomplete outfits, too much going on,  non-cohesive outfits).  You know what? Everything is fine and the world keeps spinning.  I’ve since accumulated enough experience styling myself that those fashion disaster days are less and less. I just learned how to dress myself to my own satisfaction, efficiently. And this requires experience, experimentation, and learning.. from my good outfit days and my bad outfit days.  There really aren’t rules to fashion; what is a faux pas on someone, might be something you can pull off. It all depends on your style, personality, context.. so many factors.  I think this is how I would like to answer your question: what is the goal of a formula even? Where is this fear of failing an outfit coming from? Nobody really cares if your outfit is one necklace and a watch away from complete, or if you’re wearing one too many colors.  There are good and bad outfits, (or should I say outfits you like and outfits you don’t like), but it doesn’t mean the latter has no or negative value in your fashion journey. Don’t be afraid of making fashion mistakes! Cos unlike most mistakes in life, there aren’t really big consequences to it, and frankly nobody cares.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:As a maximalist, I just mix whatever colours, textures and patterns resonate with me. I don't love super strict rules about how many colours we should wear or whatever. More is more and fashion should be fun and have a sense of humour. I especially like making references to particular vibes (e.g. Latin American drug lords with colourful print shirts and gold chains, but really exaggerate it and make it more fashion-y).  Obviously, not everyone feels the same way. You do you.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:Some of mine in no particular order; I don't think about it all the time but my dressing habits are based around this:   * No more than 3 colours (I don't wear much black and have a lot of different neutrals, so I have to be aware of this). * Try to have something more interesting than just a crew neck sweater + pants. I am so guilty of falling into this when I get lazy.  * Don't wear the same colour pants and coat. People can probably pull this off no problem but it is something I avoid for some reason.  * Like someone else said, for tops and bottoms no tight/tight or loose/loose. I just don't feel comfortable that way. I feel better when I emphasize either my waist or my hips.  * Only wear 1 uncomfortable item at a time. Ideally you would have no uncomfortable items but unfortunately I have a few pieces that I am not willing to get rid of. If I wear them all at once it's like I am crawling in my own skin, so I try to be aware of this when I dress to leave the house.	episode_done:True

text:My 10x10 Capsule wardrobe challenge results	labels:I’ve never tried the challenge myself so it’s cool when others do and share their results.  I think outfit #9 works best because of the colours (green and white are dispersed well visually on top and bottom), the fabric weight matches for the top and bottom, and the contrast in size/busy-ness of the patterns.  I think #2 is my least favourite because it looks like you’re kinda divided into 3 harsh segments (black / blue / black). Maybe if you had something blue on top it could help integrate the outfit better? Like maybe a blue necklace or scarf or some other accessory with some blue.	episode_done:True

text:Alexander Wang accused of a history of sexual harassment - fashion in a year of reckoning?	labels:I thought this was old news but it seems to have been buried enough that it's just getting widespread attention now. I learned about it when the video of him dancing to WAP came out. I used to think that certain industries were rife for this sort of thing, but after a career change from arts to STEM I've realized they're all as bad as each other, albeit each with their own twist.   That said - I think fashion and other arts industries (looking at you, publishing) suffer from the issue of having just enough white women and white gay male representation to pat themselves on the back with the energy of a perpetual motion machine and drown out any and all criticism about diversity and representation, regardless of how genuine it may be. And when white people are concentrated at the top of the power hierarchy, it makes intersectional issues that much harder to surface with clarity.   For every person who has been harassed by AW, how many powerful white industry gatekeepers have brushed it off because they think only straight white men can be harassers? (And, of course, when a straight white man turns out to be an abuser they still can't accept it because "he's one of the good ones" or "he just made a mistake one time, it's not fair to ruin his life").  This only starts to get fixed when the industry gives equal respect and attention to the voices of everyone who helps to create it - whether they are a celebrated designer, fashion editor, personal assistant, early career model - anyone. I have plenty of reservations about social media, but the democratizing effect of reaching a huge audience without being beholden to the industry gatekeepers has been a very good thing for issues like these.	episode_done:True

A lot of people working in fashion are on a gig-by-gig basis so it’s Everyman for himself as far as success goes. People will turn a blind eye to the wrong doings of companies if it means that they themselves can get another paycheck or take a step up the ladder. It’s not that they themselves are immoral but it’s a hard industry to make it in and you can feel powerless when you’re not at the top. When you are on your own, which is most days, you will lose sight of the bigger picture of an ideal future.  For example this summer I read that FreePeople implemented racist practices within their stores. I added them to a list of companies that I didn’t want to work for (I’m freelance.) A month ago I was offered an opportunity to work with them and even though on principal I didn’t want to, I still considered it because I need a paycheck and the name would be good for me to have on my resume and would lead to more work.

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Disclaimer-- I know myself well enough to know that a capsule wardrobe is not for me.  When I get back from traveling, I cannot wait to wear different clothes.  Consider your laundry situation.  Having a smaller wardrobe means that you will be doing laundry more often.  If you're one in a family of 6, it may not be a big deal.  But for a single apartment dweller (pay per load), the additional costs can add up quickly.   Because I pay per load, I make sure that I maximize the capacity and only wash full loads (I'm paying the same no matter the capacity).  I am not one to hand-wash clothes in a bathroom sink.  Not now, not ever!   I do laundry roughly every other week alternating lights and darks.

text:Would you mind expanding a bit on the wardrobe tracking idea?

Logging every item was weirdly fun, and really made me asses why I kept what I kept. But the app was a bit clumsy, so I made a secret instagram account to just take an Ootd (outfit of the day) picture as I headed out the door (or when covid hit, on my way to the couch, ha ha)   If you have apple I have heard great things about their apps, some people on here use airtable (if you search the group there are loads of better informed wardrobe tracking, and mgetsdressed blog has many many posts about it)   I personally found looking at what I'm ACTUALLY wearing, not what I aspire to wear, helps me be realistic about what to add to my wardrobe, and being more aware of everything I own now I've done several purges makes me pull out lesser worn items to I have an excuse to keep them	episode_done:True

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:i don’t have a strictly capsule wardrobe, but the colors i feel best in are pretty neutral, so i stick to those. black, white, grey, shades of green, navy, some tan/brown. most of these colors go with each other.   in high school and my early college years, i was much more experimental with my style. now i know what i feel good in, and i know i don’t have an unlimited budget, so i try to buy pieces that will go with most of my other clothes. i think there’s a financial benefit to this (getting lots of ‘wears’ per purchase). it also makes putting outfits together faster and easier.   i still buy “fun” pieces and mix them in, but my higher priced items need to be able to go with most of my other clothes.	episode_done:True
text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I wouldn’t call what I have a capsule wardrobe but I have a wardrobe of about 50-70 pieces including all my winter and summer wear. Everything I own are neutrals and warm toned. I have a warm complexion and cool tones just don’t look the best on me. I like to get things in various cuts and styles so that I can play with shapes and proportions in my outfits.   For example I have 7 pairs of pants which includes 4 pairs of jeans. 1 light wash in a straight leg, one medium wash in a wide leg, one black straight leg and one black slim cut. I also have a pair of wide leg black trousers, a pair of wide leg beige trousers and a pair of cream cargos. I don’t double up on cuts and styles so that I still have lots of options and not a wardrobe full of the same things.   My tops are mainly tanks and t shirts in black and white, a few button ups, and turtle necks and sweaters for the fall and winter.   I do have quite a few jackets, about 10-15 so that i still feel like I have options and not get bored. Coats and jackets are my favourite layering piece and really helps to make each outfit look different. I have a white cropped jacket, a black cropped jacket, a white flowy shirt jacket, a forest green shirt jacket, a tan blazer, black blazer, plaid cropped blazer, black wool shirt jacket, black leather blazer, beige trench coat, camel wool coat and a black puffer.   I make sure that everything goes together in terms of colours and undertones so that I can pull anything out in my wardrobe and know that it matches. I also don’t get bored because I put thought into making each piece different enough to still have plenty of looks/options while not having a massive wardrobe. I don’t have the most minimal wardrobe like those 30 item capsules but it works for me :)	episode_done:False

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Capsule wardrobe is not for me. But you need to ask yourself what you want to get out of a capsule and what wardrobe issue you are trying to solve.   Do you want to have less stuff? Make it easier to get dressed? Get more higher quality stuff?  Eliminate decision fatigue? Etc.   If you are moving into to this path you want to figure out two things. Your color palette and what shapes you like. These should help you figure out the base of the wardrobe. And you do not want to trash everything and get it all at once. You’ll make mistakes and learn what you like by experimenting.    Maybe try a 10x10 challenge to get a taste of a more limited wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I have what would pretty loosely be defined as a capsule wardrobe -- everything is in a limited palate, and goes together. I love it, and don't plan on switching any time soon -- but I don't super-strictly limit the number of pieces I have either, which gets me out of the "Ugh, I hate all of this and I'm sick of it!" rut. While I've got a lot of strong investment-piece basics, there's a generous sprinkling of new (well, new-used) stuff coming in and out often enough that I don't get bored. Also, I don't stick just to neutrals; two of my four colors are green and purple.   I love that setting limits on myself has curbed my shopping addiction. I love that I'm pushed to be creative with what I have and think more carefully about how what I buy goes with what I have. I feel like I'm being true-er to my aesthetic because I'm not letting my head get turned by clothing that is objectively completely gorgeous but isn't for me for style/color/age reasons. And I love feeling put-together more often than I did when I didn't have limits.	episode_done:True
text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I've been using a capsule wardrobe of about 30 ish pieces since March so I have some pros and cons to contribute!   Pro: I wear more "out there" outfits. I know its counterintuitive to most people's neutrals capsule, but I put away every piece of black clothing I own and chose lots of color for my capsule and I've been having so much fun with it! Since I took the time to pick colors intentionally, I know when I'm picking outfits that my yellow plaid pants actually do go with almost all my shirts, and therefore I wear the fun pieces I love more often!  Con: I can't go out and buy new clothes when I come across an inspiration photo on Pinterest or instagram or whatever that I want to recreate. There's some clothes that I know won't look good with the majority of my closet, whether because of silhouette or color, so I can't justify buying them (I'm looking at you, wide leg flair pants).  Overall I've loved my capsule and I'm keeping it up for now!	episode_done:True

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:I always keep dates 1-2 fairly casual and do drinks or drinks and dinner since I wouldn't want to be trapped on an elaborate date if we're not vibing.   Summer: Sundress, denim jacket, white canvas sneakers if very casual place, sandals if slightly nicer.  Winter: Dark or black skinny jeans, cute top/sweater OR satin cami if I am feeling good about the date, booties. Coat depends on the weather. I try to keep it cute but sometimes giant puffy coat is the only reasonable option.	episode_done:False

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:It depends on where you’re going, but I’ve never gone anywhere fancy for a first date. It’s either a walk in the park and ice cream, or maybe a movie. I like to wear an outfit that I feels represents me, which is often nice jeans, boots or heels if we’re not walking around, and either a flannel or a similar nice blouse and minimalist jewellery and makeup.	episode_done:True
text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:Pre-COVID, my first dates were all super casual get a drink at the bar deals. I also work in theater so generally I was coming from work on a Friday or Saturday night so I really did need to do the “day to night” transformation you always used to see in magazines. So my usual outfit was a variant on black skinny jeans, low-cut tank top/slim fit band shirt (I date a lot of punk guys, go figure), with maybe a thin drapey waterfall sweater and/or leather moto jacket, and black combat boots. I’d add some more dramatic lipstick (bright red was a go-to but also brown, orange, purple) + big earrings at work and be good to go.	episode_done:True
text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:I dress on a date how I dress day-to-day, which is pretty casual, lots of natural fabrics, usually wearing running shoes or some other form of sneaker (Blundstone boot in winter).  So for a first date I might wear a pullover sweater or silk blouse, blue jeans, and my least grungy sneakers. I probably wouldn't wear makeup besides clear brow gel and a tinted lip balm (I like the Burt's Bees ones), but I would take the time to make sure my hair looks on point.  I guess if it's warm (like above 25C/75F) I'd wear jacquard shorts and a linen or silk t-shirt. Or a dress, but I don't usually wear dresses so I might feel awkward in one.  Comfort above all because I find that translates to feeling good about myself (no matter how the date goes).	episode_done:True
text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:Back when I did online dating and went on lots of first dates, I tended to keep it super casual and then just have one really flashy thing. Like jeans, sneakers, solid T-shirt, and flashy chandelier earrings. Or skip earrings and wear sequin shorts instead of jeans. If they wanted to go somewhere fancy, I just always talked them down into my comfort zone (i.e. a bar where all the staff know me, at least by sight) and will try to keep me safe if I need it.	episode_done:False

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:Man, I had this short, lacy white dress I wore for YEARS. It was just a babydoll dress from UO or something, pretty casual, but it looked killer on me. In the winter, I’d wear tights and boots (and a coat, of course); in the summer nice sandals or sneakers depending on my mood. Sometimes I’d add a long necklace, sometimes just super simple earrings. It worked every time, my magic dress. It got lost in a move, but the move was cross-country with my bf with whom I have a dog, so I think the dress did its job.	episode_done:True
text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:I prefer getting drinks for a first date. I think having a dinner date is too formal/too much of a (time) commitment when I’m just trying to get to know a person and feel each other out. It’s easier to dip out after a drink and there is less financial involvement.   Usually I wear a pair of statement earrings and one other statement piece (can be anything: jacket, top, etc). The rest I keep pretty basic (aka the rest of my outfit is black).   I wear a lot of black generally, so on a first date, I want to wear something that is representative of what I wear on day-to-day.	episode_done:True

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:On my first date with my now-husband, I wore a polka-dot shirtdress with simple flats. I wanted to look nice, without being overdressed. He still talks about that dress and can describe it in detail.  It’s not about what you wear. Men don’t care about that. But DO always wear something you feel great about yourself in! I’d say business casual is a good baseline for a first date.	episode_done:True
text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:I have completely given up on dating after my divorce, but when I did try, I kept things pretty casual.  I don’t want to portray myself as someone I’m not, so I would keep things pretty casual with jeans, a nice top or tee, whatever jacket went with my weather/my outfit and, depending on my mood, either Birkenstocks, converse or a pair of fun printed flats. I tend to take my more casual style and dress it up with fun and unique jewelry.	episode_done:True

Get a large salad spinner and some gentle lingerie soap, put your really delicate stuff in with some warm water and detergent, spin a hand-full of times and let it soak for 5 mins, drain the water out and fill it with cold water, let it soak for 5, then spin, drain, refill, spin drain repeat till it comes out clear.

text:I handwash all the time--the salad spinner is a great idea!  Most of the clothes that I handwash call for cold water only though, so I never use any warm water.  As for detergent, I use Woolite.  Threads are more delicate when wet, so I avoid any rough wringing--I roll them up in towels to get most of the water out.  With knit sweaters etc, I let them dry laying down, put back in their shape, as they get very heavy with water and hanging could cause them to lose their shape.  Since I already have many pieces that I handwash, I just end up doing that with all of the pieces I care about/really want to last and it works great albeit a bit time consuming!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:Depends on the fabric. Wool and silk? You bet that, given their price, I am not putting them into a machine, as I want to have the full control that handwashing provides. Same for my all-time favourite clothes that I couldn't bear to lose. Anything else that says handwashing? Put that in a delicates bag and pop it into the machine and done :)	episode_done:True
text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:I think that this really depends on what type of washing machine you have access to. If you have a modern, front loading machine, with multiple wash settings, you can relatively easily machine wash many “hand wash only” items. I’ve had varying results with top loaders or old front loading washers-I find them more rough on clothes. Most items do ok on a delicates cycle with cold water for both stages. I often wash sweaters on the wool setting (cold water, low spin) or soak my sweaters with euclean and spin dry-er in the machine before laying flat to dry. Most of the damage to clothes happens in the dryer IMO. Also, brands often put dry clean only or hand wash only because they haven’t tested the fabric for machine wash and want plausible deniability-thus many things can survive with machine wash cold and air dry. But your results may naturally vary based on the piece of clothing. I personally only buy stuff that I feel is very special that is not machine wash air dry safe. Otherwise I feel like laundry ends up taking too much of my life, and it isn’t worth it to me.	episode_done:False
text:This. Every front loader I've ever used has had a hand wash cycle which just gently rocks the clothes in water and doesn't spin them.  I don't hand wash anything other than my face cloths and masks (simply because it's quicker).	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:I buy a lot of clothes with special washing instructions.  To me, "hand wash only" usually means "put in in the washer on cold and gentle cycle and hang to dry."   Exceptions: anything made of wool or silk must be washed in the bathtub by hand with The Laundress Wool and Cashmere Shampoo instead of detergent. This is what I do for anything labelled "dry clean only" as well.  Leather is the only thing I do not wash either in the gentle cycle or the bathtub.	episode_done:False

text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:So far I've done pretty well just putting my things in mesh laundry bags and washing them on the delicate cycle in the machine, then air drying them.  That being said, we have a machine that was chosen specifically because it had a very good delicate cycle, and most of my pieces weren't terribly expensive to begin with. The tag may say hand wash only, but I'm not too worried about polyester.  For things I really really love and for my bras, I do actually hand wash them, and I'd probably do the same if I were to make a really expensive purchase or if I were handling an extra delicate fabric.	episode_done:True

text:Your 2021 trend predictions?	labels:The style of 2020 was so much more feminine and romantic than the trends of the previous couple decades, so it'll be interesting to see how this rediscovery of feminine softness will influence things going forwards. As others have said I think there will be more focus on beautiful and dainty ornamentation paired with simpler slightly more fitted garments of natural fibre. Pants and skirts sitting on the hips bones rather than being high waisted. Floral and nature inspired patterns and jewellery, I'm thinking the painting of Ophelia by Millais. But maybe at the same time there will be a swing away from this sweet, innocent look with more psychedelic, rave culture, lsd and 1960s art nouveau appropriation poster aesthetics emerging. I think this kind of psychedelic combination of delicate "nature goddess" looks with more vivid colours, trippy prints and interesting details will start to emerge.  Honestly I'm hoping some of the slow fashion, "timeless", ethical (and expensive) clothing that has been cool for the last 5 years will finally start to mean that people actually do buy less stuff and the fast fashion cycle will slow down with changes being more in the realm of accessories and hair than in buying tonnes of clothing itself.... But probably not right...   On another note: nike AF1s (and vejas) are surely done by now, and maybe this is wishful thinking but I feel the cool sneaker trend cycle might fizzle out a bit, with more trad leather and cute heels and basic canvas shoes coming in...

text:Shitpost Saturday: Grandma's Gift	labels:So it was actually my mom this time around. I'm old enough to be a g'ma myself so I figure Mom gets a pass.  I was chatting with some friends a few days ago about that stupid "We try to explain the 1979 Sears Wish Book to a millenial" article and for some reason I uttered (well, typed) the words "I miss velour". Well, I opened the Big Box O Stuff From Mom, and what should be in there but.... a velour zip-up cardigan. In a hideous print. With a zipper pull that's meant to look like metal but is obviously plastic (wouldn't have been surprised if it had come off in my hand). Did I mention the hideous print is BLUE? I don't even like blue.  But on the other hand.... it's SO WARM. And unlike most of the gifts of my childhood, it FITS PERFECTLY. It's not too big, not too tight, and somehow not a million miles too long.  Velour, though. I don't even know where the hell she finds these things.  I'll wear it over the festive Minnie and Mickey sweatshirt she got me last year. God knows what I'll wear under that as the sweatshirt is basically transparent. Hopefully I won't have to get up during the call because all that fits my lower half right now is sweatpants.	episode_done:True

text:What are your tips for dressing a big chest!	labels:My chest isn’t massive, but I have had some fit issues with clothes before, where the shirt is really tight around the chest but way too loose at the waist. Never a good look. My best tip for that is to buy shirts in a larger size that fits your chest, then tailor in at the waist. It’s relatively simple so you can learn to do it yourself and save lots of tailoring costs!	episode_done:True

text:What are your tips for dressing a big chest!	labels:As someone in a similar position, I avoid collars that are super high necked or super low. When I worked as a host and had to wear a lot of blouses I wore ones that were a size or two up (mostly to avoid button holes popping open) that could be styled in a French tuck with a tighter jean or pant. Similarly I’ll pair a tighter legging with a loose sweater or sweatshirt, so it’s not entirely frumpy but I’m not wearing something super tight across my chest. Lately I’ve been enjoying layering a nicer fitting cardigan or flannel over a half turtleneck, which doesn’t feel as oversized but the layering also takes some of the focus away from my breasts. When I don’t want to wear a tight pant I’ll wear high waisted sweats or joggers with a looser crop top, so even though it’s all loose comfy clothing it doesn’t feel as frumpy. For dresses I favor ones that are just a little loose but also come in around my waist, so there’s a bit of an hourglass shape to help seem proportional, but again it isn’t super tight.	episode_done:True

text:What are your tips for dressing a big chest!	labels:This may not be quite the type of answer you’re looking for, but have you considered trying out a minimizer bra? I just bought one a couple weeks ago because, like you, I’m a fan of clean lines and I want to wear certain things that tend to be most flattering on people with smaller chests. Shift dresses always make me look super overweight/shapeless because they don’t fall right on me, but a minimizer bra can help the dress lay a little flatter. They also reduce/eliminate that dreaded gap when wearing a button-up shirt, and I find that they help me to look less....Pamela Anderson-y when wearing tight fitting tops.	episode_done:True
text:What are your tips for dressing a big chest!	labels:I have big boobs and I love turtlenecks bc they show off my chest and waist but don't show any skin. I especially right now love a tight black turtleneck, loose vintage jeans and black combat boots.  In the summer I really like off-shoulder tops bc it shows skin without it being cleavage.    I only show cleavage in a loose top. I have a chiffon skinny strap flowy top that I love wearing all seasons with or without a cardigan or denim jacket. I also have linen long sleeve top with bell sleeves that is very cleavagey in a flattering way.    Hope this gives you some inspo! I don't have pics but if you put some of the descriptors I used +outfits on Pinterest, that could help!	episode_done:True

text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Hi! Former stylist.  1) Pay attention to the fit of things and figure out what cuts and shapes look good on you. Paper bag pants and some joggers have similar fits. Some mini skirts and shorts hit the same place on your legs and can have the same waist height. Find your sweet spot and don’t be afraid to buy multiple things in silhouettes that work for you.   2) Get some statement pieces that you would die for. If you are wearing a pair of jeans that fit well and a t-shit purchased within the past 3 years with some awesome earrings you going to look and feel great. If you are wearing an amazing dress and simple white sneakers you are going to look and feel great. Don’t overthink things but try and wear at LEAST one piece you are excited about at a time.   3) Don’t buy things just cause they are on sale, you saw your friend wearing it, or you feel like you “need” something in your wardrobe. You should love everything in your closet in its own special way unless it’s workwear and you hate your dress code for work. Something as simple as a T-shirt has so many different factors like cut, material, neckline, sleeve length. Purchase what feels good and don’t bother with the rest.	episode_done:False
text:This is a perfect list, I would also add that you should not be afraid to break out of any style rules that you have. One thing I do when making myself break a random “rule” I made up for myself is to buy a realistic version (a color/fabric/style I already like/own) and wear the new/weird thing somewhere easy. I just forced myself to buy and wear a kimono top/jacket this way. It was a matching set and I had already bought the pants and had worn them, but didn’t buy the top because I just don’t wear kimonos.   So I bought the kimono top and wore the outfit to my sister’s house first for just a regular hang out, and then I wore it “publicly.” (It’s not really public rn but I wore it to see someone in my non-fam bubble LOL.) After wearing it around at my sister’s house I felt comfortable in it and it no longer felt like a weird thing to wear.   This doesn’t always work, sometimes I just won’t like something, but if I’m drawn to it and the only reason I’m not getting it is because of some internal rule I made up, it usually works.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:I don't know about the other ladies out there, but for me there's no magic formula. In my humble opinion, I look good because I take the time to really plan out my outfit, hair, shoes, etc. It really is just practice, repetition, and routine. If it seems daunting to you, here are some smaller steps you can take:  1. Use a website to organize your thoughts - like Pinterest.  2. A lot of department stores have looks and outfit ideas when you are looking for products! It's a great way to go from - 'oh that dress is cute' in a vacuum to figuring out an outfit around it.  3. Practice makes perfect.  4. Practice makes perfect.  5. Try to make one part of your outfit really satisfying to yourself if it seems to much to do the whole thing. For example pick a bag that goes well with your dress. That way, even if your makeup/shoes don't work as well with the outfit you don't get worried about not having the perfect look. You'll still be happy with part of it and you can build from there for next time!  Sometimes, I try to do the 'just woke up but looking fresh effortlessly' look but I don't know if it's actually successful, lol.	episode_done:False
text:Yes to the "practice makes perfect". Try things on. Play dress up and experiment with silhouettes. Document what works and what doesn't. I've been documenting my outfits for nearly 10 years now and although I still have some questionable outfits, it's helped me develop an eye for proportions and colors. So there is no "effortless" look, not really. It takes work, and after a while it becomes instinctive.	labels:	episode_done:True

I’m myself trying to follow it but it takes a lot of effort and time and I give up. Any advise on how to actually make it work	labels:Once you hit a certain point in your wardrobe you just need to keep reminding yourself you don’t necessarily “need” anything. I’m also not saying don’t shop and buy stuff! Just don’t buy stuff that after a couple wears have you reaching for your old favorites because you feel the best wearing them. I used to have 5 different tshirts but I would go digging through my hamper for one specific one even if it was dirty because it looked best. That’s what you want to avoid. Similarly, if a brown shoe is on sale but you never wear brown don’t buy it. It will sit in your closet and aggravate you unless you go and buy some stuff to wear it with. Pay the extra for the black and rock them right away. Use per cost is a real thing.	episode_done:True

text:For 1. What pants do you recommend for people who are thin but carry a bit more weight in the core (stomach and butt) instead of their legs and thighs.	labels:It’s hard to say. Even for people who put on weight in the core does it go “out” or “sideways”? Everybody’s body is so different. It’s hard to tell what looks good without trying on different things but usually people are a pretty good judge of what “works” once they find it! Just keep an open mind and be willing to take stuff into a dressing room. A big butt or rounded stomach/hips can be sexy! If you are looking to “hide” something however a good trick is to split it up -ie. layering or accessorizing with a belt, jacket, longer necklace etc.	episode_done:True

I buy everything second hand, so my wardrobe is a collection of every style and era. I love wearing things that have had a past life before me, and I'm supporting the second hand industry by doing so too.  In less abstract terms, my wardrobe tends to be quite eclectic. Most of my clothes are from the 80s/90s, but I do like to switch it up. Because it's all second hand, my trendy pieces will usually be the older version of a trend! Eg. having mom jeans and floral midi skirts from the 80s, or bootcut jeans from the 00s.  I find it important that my fashion choices reflect my personality, or current mood. For inspiration, I often spend hours looking at old photographs/movies/etc and imagining what these characters would have worn from my wardrobe. Sometimes I'm feeling Britney Spears circa 1999, but other times I want to be a slightly-bohemian period drama character, so I can dress accordingly. I like to have a wardrobe where items can do double duty.  I often feel like I don't know how to express myself, so I love how clothes are a way of easily doing it!

I like florals, colourful stripes and polka dots. I also wear other patterns if they are in a smaller scale. I prefer fitted/ cropped tops, with looser bottoms. So a typical outfit would be a cute top, mom jeans/ paperbag shorts and sneakers. In winter I'd also wear a cropped sweater/ wrap sweater (it's not cold where I live). Sometimes I wear dresses/ skirts, but it needs to be both comfortable and flattering. I only wear sneakers in every day situations, and when dressing up it's wedge sandals/ thick heeled booties. I walk uncomfortably in other types of shoes so I avoid them. Overall I might align with it? I wear cute things but nothing too crazy	episode_done:True
text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:I think you can still look fashionable while ignoring heels etc.   I agree with you on heels, and my foot shape finds them quite uncomfortable, so unless they’re a platform or quite chunky (like with most booties), I just don’t do them.   Now, I personally love high waist (the higher the better, gimme that steve urkle shit 😂) but lower waist, softer fabrics, or even high quality leggings (like faux leather styles) will look much nicer than sweats.   Well-fitting basic t’s look great. They just need to fit properly across your shoulders and chest. Plenty of flat shoes exist that look nice. Vans, leather or leather-ish ballet flats, nice sneakers (e.g. New Balance or similar) with a well-tailored outfit.  Honestly a lot of it comes down to the fit of clothing, the FABRICS (I mean, put on anything pilled and it looks 🥴 immediately), and other styling elements like hair. Hair thrown into a ratty bun with sweats and uggs? Yeah I look sloppy. Straightened hair with joggers and vans? Now I look stylish! Ha.  ETA: that unfortunately body type also comes into play here. There have been quite a few posts detailing how basics look “timeless” and “stylish” on thin frames, and sloppy or unstylish on larger bodies. I thought I would throw this in there just in case, although I think most of my comments still apply regardless of body size!	episode_done:False

Any item of clothing can be comfortable if it fits your body properly.  This is why rich people get things tailored.  I'm a grad student so I can't afford that, but I just make an effort not to buy things that don't fit, and occasionally I get things tailored.  It's hard though, most cheap brands that I can afford don't sell clothes that fit well so it's an effort.	episode_done:True

Maybe it's because I was a teen in the 90s. I'm glad I'm not the only one!  And amen to the bra situation!

My style is generally long and flowing Korean-style fashion paired with open-toed sandals or other flat shoes and not only do I feel and look good in it, I also feel breezy! I think the tip here is to choose clothes that are not only cute but should go well with your body and ones you feel you can be active and move around with without any fuss! :D Also look for clothes made in natural breathable fabrics like cotton, linen or silk are always great because they breathe well and allow sweat to evaporate more easily unlike synthetic fabrics like nylon and polyester.	episode_done:True
text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:This is why streetwear has been my favorite trend. Now I, a 29 year old woman, can dress like I’ve given up and still be fashionable.  Sweat pants? Yes please! Tall socks folded over soft leggings? Of course! Sweaters all year round? Don’t mind if I do! Comfy shoes on all but the most special occasions? Yay!	episode_done:True
text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:When I started shopping for function, I started to enjoy fashion a lot more. Uniqlo was a big part of the beginning for me, I really like their airsim and heattech lines. How can my clothes work for me? I really took on a evolutionarily perspective lmao, like I need Shelter from Rain, Insulation in Cold, Sweat Wicking in Sun. It got me to pay attention to fabric choices more, which meant I was pickier, which meant I was buying more expensive items... so then I started to care about the quality of stitching and longevity of the piece.  I had IBS for a year and there were some clothes I could really NOT wear with that, so I had to learn to make adjustments too. I like high-rise bottoms, but I can't have an elastic cutting off my intestines all day, so I get something with a zipper instead.	episode_done:True

text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:I think that’s one of the reasons why I gravitate towards more grunge/street wear style. Comfort is a big deal to me and I can’t stand high heels, they make me feel unsafe like I’m on stilts. A nice pair of work boots or sneakers just feels right. I got married in a pair of shiny Dr Martens with a tea length dress to show them off because I love the look so much!	episode_done:True
text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:I think you can still look fashionable while ignoring heels etc.   I agree with you on heels, and my foot shape finds them quite uncomfortable, so unless they’re a platform or quite chunky (like with most booties), I just don’t do them.   Now, I personally love high waist (the higher the better, gimme that steve urkle shit 😂) but lower waist, softer fabrics, or even high quality leggings (like faux leather styles) will look much nicer than sweats.   Well-fitting basic t’s look great. They just need to fit properly across your shoulders and chest. Plenty of flat shoes exist that look nice. Vans, leather or leather-ish ballet flats, nice sneakers (e.g. New Balance or similar) with a well-tailored outfit.  Honestly a lot of it comes down to the fit of clothing, the FABRICS (I mean, put on anything pilled and it looks 🥴 immediately), and other styling elements like hair. Hair thrown into a ratty bun with sweats and uggs? Yeah I look sloppy. Straightened hair with joggers and vans? Now I look stylish! Ha.  ETA: that unfortunately body type also comes into play here. There have been quite a few posts detailing how basics look “timeless” and “stylish” on thin frames, and sloppy or unstylish on larger bodies. I thought I would throw this in there just in case, although I think most of my comments still apply regardless of body size!	episode_done:False

text:The Venn diagram of things I would actually buy has the following circles: fits my aesthetic, fits my budget, makes me excited at the outfit possibilities, will make me happy to put on in the morning, will fill in an empty space in my wardrobe, is eco-friendly. Last 2 somewhat optional, but I’m trying to make them as essential as the first 4.  My aesthetic is pretty broad (across several categories of garments and “styles” of dress), but having a more cohesive wardrobe means I have more opportunity to mix and match items and get more wear out of each, so there’s that as an advantage.  I don’t think anyone should force the aesthetic thing until and only if they feel naturally pulled towards that aesthetic specifically, and they know that the things that fall out of that aesthetic won’t bring them as much joy to put on as the things that fit in it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:You don't have to make your own clothes, but learning to do some basic repairs (reattaching buttons, patching a small hole or fixing a split seam with needle and thread, maybe using a sweater shaver/depiller or waterproofing your leather shoes) can be really helpful in making things last and look nice longer - so maybe your 2 pound shirt lasts 3 years instead of 2, which means you don't need to buy as many in the long run.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:IMO if you're wearing clothes until they get holes in them, it doesn't matter if you bought them from ASOS or Eileen Fisher -- you're doing better than the majority of people out there who wear something 3-10 times and then donate it.  Yes, buying clothes secondhand is best, but buying something new and wearing it out is pretty damn close.  If you can recycle the fabric again (e.g. rags for the kitchen), even better!	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:I second what everyone said about buying stuff secondhand, but just want to add, if you’re going to buy something from a fast fashion store, only buy it with as high a percent of natural fibers as possible. 100% cotton/silk/linen/wool/leather etc. The items will last longer and will look/feel better. Otherwise, you’re buying plastic clothing.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:Personally, I really like thrift shopping. I can't afford high quality brands, and hate fast fashion. By thrifting, I am often able to find old, quality clothing. I got a pair of 90's calvin klein jeans, and some old levi's, and I've even gotten some very quality pants from the 60's-70's that still have tags.   I got a pair of Docs back when they were still made in England, very sturdy and will last me a good while.   A recent find was a very nice custom made elk hide jacket, and it was only $6.   It can definitely take a little bit of time, but it's very worth it. All of the things I have mentioned seem, from text, like they would be worn, ugly, old. But they're very fashionable, almost completely new, and of very high quality. It's a lot of fun, very rewarding, and kind to your budget!	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:Just buy things carefully. Really think about what goes with the rest of your wardrobe, and buy things that you would want to wear again and again.  I buy fast fashion, but I have a very small closet. I don't consider my fast fashion items disposable. They are treated with similar care as I would treat the more expensive pieces in my wardrobe, like Max Mara, etc.  I also purchases second hand a lot of the time, and often consider trend cycles when I buy items. I avoid the really trendy stuff - unless it's something I really want to try out, and buy things that wouldn't feel that outdated in 3 years time.  In the case of buying 2 dollar tees and really cheap shoes - it might not be sustainable in the long run, because based on my experience, bad quality tees don't last very long.	episode_done:False

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:second hand shops, indie stores, stores owned by indigenous/native peoples, or just sew up the holes and buy some nice pieces that could be worn everyday with anything. classic looks never go out of style, and if you get a good coat that goes with everything, you can wear the same outfits all year and just change up the outerwear and layer	episode_done:True

text:I was going to say this - I “challenged” myself to buy only secondhand for a year but it’s been so easy it hasn’t even been a challenge and I’ve carried on with it! The downfall is the occasional thing doesn’t fit or look right, but I either re-sell it or practice my (rudimentary) sewing on it. If I buy something off eBay that’s high end and good quality fabric - and would be way out of my budget new - I take to get tailored, because I’m scared I’ll botch it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:I think it’s unavoidable, so yep like another commenter said, just choose wisely, and I would also add don’t ‘give in’ to any whims and infatuations. I put something in my online shopping cart (or even hold it and walk around the actual shop), and a few moments later I realise I don’t need it and close the tab/put it back.  For me the biggest thing is knowing my style. I know what things I look best (yes ‘best’, not just ‘good’) in, so I have these items in my closet and I am not likely to randomly get more clothes whenever I feel like it. And knowing your style, you’ll also know you’ll wear the items you buy a lot, so you’ll not feel bad about spending more money and ‘investing’ in pieces. :)	episode_done:True

text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:My 2021 resolution is to wear the clothes I bought in 2020 and not buy more, lol. Honestly I'm in the UK and it looks like we won't be coming out of frequent lockdowns until maybe June/July at earliest so that leaves less opportunities for going to places and serving snazzy outfits which is sad but hey, it is what it is.  I've been trying to wean myself off buying clothes, not because I hate fashion or something but to combat a shopping addiction I developed in 2017 (basically dealing with any negative emotion by buying clothes) and I've gradually gone down from 80 items a year to 40 and now 25. I've got a baller wardrobe with clothes I love so if I can manage to get my clothes shopping habit to what it used to be - a rare treat instead of a regular thing then I'll consider it a win for myself.	episode_done:True

I did way too much "fill the hole in your soul with stuff" this year, for obvious reasons, but I feel overburdened with the amount of clothing in my life now and I need to make a conscious effort to pare things down. If I run into a genuine need, I'll continue checking secondhand options first before buying new. I'll also continue logging outfits daily with Stylebook, because it helps me be honest with myself about what is and isn't getting worn in my closet (both for getting-rid-of purposes AND for informing-future-purchases purposes), *and* it'll help me focus in on what I gravitate toward in my day-to-day life rather than continually shopping for some nebulously just-out-of-reach fantasy self.   Summed up:  * Buy less, buy secondhand, buy practical, buy for TODAY (not a dream and a half from now), and buy only what is genuinely needed (very likely *nothing* for quite a while).  * Continue evaluating what I really need in my life, and how much, and adjust accordingly as time goes on with the goal of seriously paring down my closet to a manageable size.	episode_done:False

text:Also, be conscious about the "need" aspect. People tend to say that they need a new sweater, when they really mean they want a new sweater in a different color to match better with some stuff in their wardrobe.  I stopped years ago with those kinds of purchases, because I realized the "shop sustainable" is just talk from people that want to keep buying while not feeling as wasteful.  I haven't bought any clothes for years. No shoes. I have huge style holes in my "fashion matching wardrobe", but I solve that by just not wearing certain items together.  The truth is, it's a bit boring, from a fashion standpoint. I sit there show creaming my old boots and fixing a hole in my bag. But then again, if you already have a sweater, you don't need another one. If you already have a pair of summer shoes, you don't need another pair, no matter how bad they match with some things in your wardrobe.  If one always keeps this in mind, it will feel stupid to replace a super basic pair of pants that are beyond repair with a pair of pants that don't fill the most functions possible. Aka, no sequin pants that can only be worn with heels and a tube top.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:Last year, I went on a no-buy last year for 11 months to assess what clothing items I really wanted and finally picked out a few pieces (a cashmere sweater, a pair of loafers, new boots) during Black Friday. I also learned how to mend simple holes in clothing and embroidered some boring shirts to make them feel "new". Tbh, It wasn't really difficult, because during quarantine/online classes, I wore the same few pieces of clothing every day.   This year, I want to clear out clothing that don't fit me anymore or are poor quality/uncomfortable/unfashionable. I recently moved apartments and it was ridiculous how much clothes I had that I never wore. My family used to be a lot more frugal, so all my clothes were from the clearance section (under $5 usually) of fast fashion stores and I picked them without regard to style/quality/fit. I never threw away clothing if it wasn't significantly ripped, so I even have clothing from when I was in middle school.	episode_done:True

text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I'm autistic and I have a lot of sensory issues so I can relate. I've found that wearing a layer underneath other things helps. For example, I have uniqlo leggings and a long-sleeve undershirt that I know I like the feeling of against my skin, so if I want to wear a sweater that's kind of scratchy or something else similar I'll just wear an undershirt that protects me. Another thing that helps me is tight sleeveless undershirts tucked into my jeans/skirt/bottom half whatever so that my shirt and waistband don't rub against my skin. (edit: I don't know if this will work in warmer climates, it works where I'm from because it's cold pretty much all year)  I also have a strict policy of not buying things that I know I'll find uncomfortable (and that I don't have a workaround for), wishing that maybe this time it will work. Because it won't, I'll just wear the thing out once and feel bad the entire time and then feel guilty for never wearing it again. If I find something that I really love, I cling to that and try to find similar things in the future and things that will complement those items.	episode_done:True
text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I can't for the life of me handle tight clothing. I'm not diagnosed with adhd but two gps have independently brought up the possibility and I'll look into it with a specialist soon.  I can't handle tights, tight long sleeves, pantyhose, or (and they're the worst ever) skinny trousers, especially jeans. Luckily, with my awkward proportions, almost all clothes that fit me are either too wide, too short (I just don't go for those), or made for boys. So I just go with slightly oversized most of the time. I vary between androgynous styles with inspiration from malefashionadvice or old fashioned looking, almost frumpy dresses, or a combination of a wide, drapy blouse and a flowing wide skirt. The drawback is that I can't really be feminine in winter because tights and leggings are off the table for me and I'd be too cold with bare shins.   That gives me a decent amount of variation! So it might be worth checking men's fashion if you're similar to me, or going for retro/vintage style blouses, skirts, and dresses.	episode_done:True

text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:Yes!!! I am a highly sensitive person and I will not wear clothing that is “scratchy.” If it rubs me I am cranky pissy and have to change.   I need to be comfortable. Not tight, soft and smooth cotton or polyester. I do not like silk or anything like silk, I do not like lace especially if it’s under my armpits. It rubs.   I’m just thrift and feel the fabric before buying. I always reach for leggings and T-shirts because I am a houseplant now.   So I don’t like things with tight arms because I have fat flabby arms. So tshirts and tank tops for me. I do not like long sleeves.   Also I am always hot! So long sleeves are almost always a no.   And shoes. Omg shoes! I have have have to wear comfortable shoes or I actually cannot function.	episode_done:True
text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I'm autistic, and yes, it sounds very familiar. I second the sleeveless undershirts or camis to put into the waistband of my pants or skirt. I also buy some extra if after a couple of times wearing something turns out to have a great fit. I have some pants in different colours, but with the same fit, and that helps with not always wearing the same but still knowing they will fit just right. I also have some basic, tagless black shirts and longsleeves, so that I can put a cardigan or blazer over while the shirt kind of blocks the tags or fabric of what I wear over it - that only works when it's not superhot, but that doesn't happen often here anyway.  The main thing is, have some basic skin-layers that feel just right, and put something over to give your outfit that bit of extra without it touching your skin (much).	episode_done:True
text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I find skirts work well for me in that there is no tightness around my legs. If it is really cold I will wear tights too, but they have to fit well and not constrict anywhere. No pressure on my knees, no seams or fabric bunches pressing into my nethers like I might have with trousers or jeans.  I like to feel the swish of a skirt, but from the sounds of it, your trousers wrapping around your legs don't make you feel happy so that may not be something that works for you.  I just find I feel less constricted in a skirt.  I tend to go for circle skirts of knee length or longer.  I'm fussy about fabric too, I don't have any patience for polyester or acrylic or anything that might make me feel sweaty or overheated.   With a skirt I just have the one measurement to be worried about, the waist measurement. As long as that fits well and is natural fibre, I'm golden.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:Black jeans make stuff more dressy. Grey jeans match well with pastel colours or with black tops. I would start with those since you are a jeans lover!  Real pants can be more difficult to find a nice cut and length, but if you find a check or pattern you like then those are always the pants I reach for first- it is nice if you have a check with a tiny bit of colour in it cause then it pairs well with plain tops in that colour.	episode_done:False

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:Straight or bootcut jeans are a more current look than skinny jeans.

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:I was like this too and just had skinny jeans in different washes for a long time. In the past year or so I’ve collected some more interesting jeans that I love to wear even more and change up every outfit but are still jeans. For example, I have looser fit jeans that have a paper bag waist, looser jeans that have a pinstripe wash pattern, jeans with a plaid wash pattern, wide leg jeans with buttons instead of a fly. I think this, along with the different colored jeans others have mentioned, is a good way to change up your look while still keeping the comfort of jeans.  I’ve found these jeans from Hollister, Levi’s, Gap.  I myself have been looking to upgrade my wardrobe a little bit by looking for some dress pants that I could use to dress up otherwise casual outfits. For inspiration I would look to pinterest or stylist tiktoks. @morgankvogel is a toktoker I just came across that had some aesthetic inspiration tiktoks I liked and she included some stores to get started.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:Ease the transition with chinos, which still have the same sort of feel as jeans but are a step in the direction of "dressier" (please take that with the biggest grain of skepticism, it doesn't even feel right to type).  And then from there, straight-legged or skinny dress pants are just one more step.  I only tend to own my dress pants in black or navy blue, I think I have one single pair of a light grey checkered pattern but I have to be in some kind of mood to wear those.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:I would find a shape you think works for you and try different textures! A black jean is really different from black leather, which is really different from black velvet. I tend to have basically the same pant (black+fitted) in different textures which I love, no harm in it. I would also look at whether any printed pants would suit your needs - if you have a lot of solid tops this could be a fun change.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:Go find yourself a pair of really exciting pants. High waist/wide leg is in right now, so maybe try that silhouette but in a bright color or print. When you get dressed in the morning, sometimes start with your bottoms. Grab your fun pants or a skirt, and build an outfit from there. Honestly the best thing to do is to just make yourself do it.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:I’ve seen a few other comments to this effect... but really a good place to start can just be branching out in denim itself. There are so many different cuts and washes out there now that the particular jeans you’re wearing can have a big impact on the outfit.  I’m a big fan of denim, while I have a few pairs of jeans that “go with anything” I try not to think of them as a default item and pair them with things that make sense for a specific outfit. I have more jeans than most, but that’s because I’ve decide it’s what I love and enjoy having a big variety.   Beyond that, I would really think about what other kind of pants fit your style based off of what you lean towards on the top. Something that others see a lot of use out of may have no place in your wardrobe (ex I keep trying to get beige pants, but I can’t make a single outfit I like with them in my closet - however, I could make several I was happy in with a pair of pink herringbone trousers).	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:Fellow ex—worshipper at the altar of jeans here! I have absolutely fallen in love with a pair of black flowy wide leg crop pants I bought a few years ago and they really helped me get out of the jeans rut. I can pair them with a tshirt for a very casual chill vibe, or something more fitted for instantly work appropriate. They were very much my “gateway pant” into the world of bottom-halves, and mixing up styles that have a more flowy or dressy feel to them - particularly as I’m not big on skirts and prefer to have that “always ready for action” feel about my outfits that pants seem to give	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:YES. I've never paid enough attention to pants in my wardrobe until about two years ago. I mean, years ago when the mom jean/boyfriend jean became I thing, I did hop on the train; but mom jeans and skinny jeans were really the only thing I had, never really paid attention to pants that much. UNTIL TWO YEARS AGO. PANTS CAN SAVE YOU FROM YOUR BORING PANT-LESS LIFESTYLE AND ELEVATE YOUR SOCIAL STATUS.  Well, this was the case for me, at least.  I started with ambitious rips. Then I got more into the loose/baggy jean look. Then I got into joggers, straight-leg, wide-leg, balloon pants, cargo, sweats, patterned pants etc. Now I have a wide assortment of pants that fit every vibe, every minuscule emotion, every single hormone that possesses me that day. Now I'm just a huge pants fan. People are always complimenting me on my pants. Everyone by default pays more attention to what is worn on top when planning an outfit, but when the BOTTOM is factored in -- WOW you really know what you're doing.  There is nothing wrong with skinny jeans -- they're versatile in nature and really can go with everything. But it can get boring quickly. A strong, multi-dimensional pants game can elevate your look and wardrobe. I really do recommend looking at the pants on Aritzia, for example, Or Hailey Bieber's/Kendall Jenner's outfits. I tend to rely on Pinterest a lot for ideas and inspo.  PS. Many times have I failed in my pants journey (bought pieces that were actually quite ugly/didn't work/unflattering/one-time wear kind of thing). BUT BEAUTIFUL PANTS IS A JOURNEY AND A PROCESS. I'd start simple (like a wide-leg or mom jean or patterned loose pant) to ease yourself into a different pant-style. And once you feel more wild and comfortable, explore more.	episode_done:True

text:Has anyone lost their wardrobe creativity as they’ve gotten older? How do you get it back?	labels:I felt this exact same way a couple years ago.

Then I just started searching for fashion influencers on Instagram and YouTube. Check out Lindsey Albanese, she is so chic and gives lots of practical tips on how to tap into trends but also finding staple pieces as well. (I would recommend her YouTube channel.)

text:Has anyone lost their wardrobe creativity as they’ve gotten older? How do you get it back?	labels:I lost my fashion mojo for a few years after I had kids. I'm 34 now and I've realized that fast fashion doesn't work for me AT ALL, partly because stuff doesn't fit well anymore and also I don't have the time to browse and try on things in stores (even pre-pandemic I couldn't dedicate time for this). I've started buying less frequently but what I buy, I make sure it's good quality stuff that fits well and is decent quality. Not sure if it's age related but cheap items just don't look good on me anymore!  Same with skincare. I've started investing in quality skincare and it makes a difference.	episode_done:True

text:What are your favorite bags at the moment?	labels:I wear a backpack for work (teacher) but I have a thing for designer purses.  During the pandemic I‘ve mostly been carrying my Louis Vuitton Neverfull GM and my Chanel WoC and if I had to restart my collection again, those two would be on top of the list for me. A WoC (any brand) worn underneath a coat is just so cool to me and I love how carefree it is.  I also have a few Mulberry bags and two Chloes and while I love them, I wouldn’t pay full price for them. Chloe especially I find to be great value for money if you can find sth you like on sale. I got both of my bags 50% off.   I  like Polène which is a lesser known brand. If you are looking to spend up to €500 for a bag, consider Polène, Leo et Violette or Strathberry. I love my Numero Deux but unfortunately the model got discontinued :(.	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite bags at the moment?	labels:I like small, fairly structured bags for everyday wear. Lately I've been into short shoulder bags (so they hang above the elbow) and top handle bags that sit in the crook of the arm, but crossbody bags are classic and very practical. I recently scored a secondhand Little Liffner bag in sky-blue embossed leather; I'm excited to wear it in the spring with tonal browns and creams or with clashing shades of bright blue and purple. I also have a few fun vintage handbags, and I've always coveted smaller bags by Wandler, By Far and Mansur Gavriel—$$$ though!  If there's a lot of stuff to carry (like a big notebook and a change of shoes or something), I'll carry a separate bigger bag, like a canvas tote or an attache case. It's convenient to carry two bags in these situations; this way essentials like keys or a wallet don't get lost at the bottom of a giant tote.	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite bags at the moment?	labels:I am a teen, so my bag choices are more influenced based on aesthetic, rather than practicality. Also, I love designer bags.  1. Givenchy Mini Antigona in smooth leather (looks so edgy and bought this for the practicality aspect, as it can hold more items) 2. Gucci Dionysus Super Mini in black leather (can barely fit my phone in there, really is just for the aesthetic lol) 3. Prada Brushed Leather Shoulder Bag with Flap in white (my more casual everyday bag) 4. Dior Medium Lady D-Lite in Blue Cannage Embroidered Velvet (probably the sexiest bag I’ve ever seen) 5. Small Lady Dior (when I’m feeling a bit fancier)  I’m thinking of adding a Louis Vuitton backpack to my collection for days when I want everything out the way on my front and just need my hands free and also a Dior Saddle Bag. All of these bags just bring me a sense of pride ever since I started gaining interest in high fashion items. Even though I could easily buy it with my parents’ money, I busted my butt working as a barista to pay for these items, and I cherish each and every one of them. It’s even more special that I worked so hard and put in so many hours to be able to purchase them, which means so much more to me than having every luxury bag on the market. If that were the case, they wouldn’t be special anymore and wouldn’t hold the same value to me.  I also really wanted the Louis Vuitton Pochette Accessoires, for when I need to get out for a quick errand, but they’re sold out on the website :(	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite bags at the moment?	labels:Currently I have a small, black, crossbody purse that I thrifted years ago.

I live in a rainy area and I walk almost everywhere so it has been perfect for my lifestyle.	episode_done:True

text:I'm having the exact same reaction. And I wasn't a huge fan of this style the first time around. But OP I do like several of the work outfits and I think you did a good job at incorporating the Y2K aesthetic into work appropriate pieces.  This style of fashion was a serious reaction to grunge and reflected the more optimistic and hopeful feeling around the early 2000s. I was in high school for grunge and in grad school and working in the 2000s and the kids 5-10 years younger than me absolutely loved this style but I 100% hated it, and I was definitely not optimistic (and unfortunately was correct about a lot of my guesses about the future). It's a look that reflects a very specific moment in time.	labels:	episode_done:True

The icy blue and lime green tones really pop against my skin too, and its just such a vivid contrast to the more adult, classic style I've been trying to force myself into in the last few years. ~~Plus low-rise jeans make my butt look amazing~~  Essentially, it's all of the clothes I remember loving as a child, as well as what I wanted to emulate from my cool older cousins!	episode_done:True

I REALLY do so hope.* I tried ***so*** hard this year. I realized that *layers* are a thing! God, so many *layers*. New colour combinations, mixings textures, jackets! SO MANY OPTIONS. This is my problem, though.. I think I've been going too far with my newly found appreciation for *layers.* I've been **hot**. The sweaty kind. Beads of sweat dripping down my forehead at all times. I've been having to drink twice as much water, as advised by my doctor. My doctor doesn't know why I've been so dehydrated, and honestly, I didn't know why either. Until a few weeks later, I was weak and tired, eye's sunken in with dark purple circles sitting beneath them, bad hand shakes. That bad physical health night, I began to remove my clothing to get ready for bed. I began by peeling off each of my four pairs of socks, (the first layer was a simple ankle sock for padding, the second layer was a sock longer with large frills all around ,the third sock was a sock that went to my upper ankle, shorter than the frilly one and the fourth pair with were giant fluffy socks), it was that moment, when my hand slid against my sweat-dampened foot, why I might be so sick. I looked over to my bed, where my pajama assemble lay. I glanced over at each piece of clothing, a sports bra, an undershirt, a tight long-sleeved, a loose fitting shirt, a big knitted sweater, a shawl, warm leggings, long socks, boxers and pajama pants. **The** ***layers***. That must be it!  I feel better now, I stopped wearing so many layers, but now I have *no idea* what to do with layers! I have no self control. I can't bring myself to just wear **some** layers, once I match an undershirt with a tee-shirt, it's game over.  Santa will be leaving me a book on how to manage my Obsessive Compulsive Disorders.

Sometimes I wear a Fancy Hoody.  I haven't out on more than tinted chapstick and a quick swipe of mascara in months.  I did get myself a cute new pair of duck boots from Costco. On some girls they look cute and stylish.  On me, it looks like im a middle age mom of 3, who has just tromped around the muddy dog park. Because I am and I have.  Santa.

Someone mentioned Justine Leconte in the comments and for ex, after her videos, i just feel so much more knowledgeable, like i actually got something out of it. I like watching bestdressed because her personality is relatable and she knows she has imperfections but still posts anyway. Jessica Neistadt is one that hasn't been mentioned yet, but i watch her cause she has a good energy. Most of her hauls are thrifts so they're affordable, with a few expensive pieces here and there. Also, she has a quote of the day at the end of her videos. Obviously, what makes me happy isn't an answer for everyone.

text:Everyone’s opinions on Youtube fashion channels?	labels:I used to spend all of my free time watching beauty guru videos. I learned pretty quickly how badly that impacted me! Watching beauty content on a much more controlled scale, avoiding hauls, etc helped a lot so once I started getting into fashion I applied the same logic.  Pixielocks is my favorite fashion influencer. Her video about Lirika Matoshi's Strawberry Dress really transformed the way I think about clothing, got me to quit fast fashion, led me to my favorite brands (Big Bud Press & Mokuyobi), and gave me the inspiration I needed to finally start building a real wardrobe for myself instead of just living in "good enough" clearance rack finds. Her entire house and wardrobe is almost 100% my aesthetic so following her on Youtube and Instagram makes me happy.  I also really like these channels, although I watch them less.  - The Stitchess. Her style isn't as close to mine but her videos are very informative and interesting to me. - Karolina Żebrowska. Her fashion history videos are so cool! - Rachel Maksy.

I don’t particularly mind this because it feels like a signature look to me, and I think I look good in my outfits. To me, it just signifies that I know what I like and wear it on repeat! If you are happy with what you are wearing, I wouldn’t worry about trying to mix it up for the sake of mixing it up. I always think: do I, someone who likes clothing, remember what my officemate was wearing when I saw her two days ago? Nope! It’s probably safe to assume she doesn’t remember what I wore either. Heck, I don’t even remember what I was wearing myself.	episode_done:True
text:How many distinctly different outfits do you have?	labels:So, I have a lot of different silhouettes and nice outfits that are distinct, carefully coordinated and look great; However, in practice I wear a comfortable simple uniform (jeans and sweaters) that is not any of these ‘extra’ outfits 80% of the time because I can’t be bothered with the extra fuss. It’s a little sad that the nicer outfits only get 20% of the action, but oh well, I’ve come to terms with my reality.  Overall I’m happy that I have the option to enjoy fashion and feeling put together when I’m in the mood for it. All the other times, it’s just normie boring stuff that looks vaguely similar every day. I don’t worry too much about others’ option on my boring clothes since I work in tech and most people don’t care about fashion. I get a lot more scrutiny (I’ve been asked if it’s my birthday, if I was interviewing etc.) when I wore my nicer district clothes.	episode_done:True
text:How many distinctly different outfits do you have?	labels:I don’t think you should have to change unless you wanted to:) You sound like you have a fantastic wardrobe that works for you and brings you joy. I also love neutrals, wines, and forest greens and I don’t think there is anything wrong with it!   Perhaps some people might not notice, but the same people may not notice even if you had a diverse wardrobe because they may not be too interested in clothing in general. So please don’t let that discourage you.  I think it’s lovely how you pick clothes that have details that set them apart from others, and I think the people you meet often or people who enjoy style and clothing may notice and appreciate the differences.   There is also quite a large capsule wardrobe community these days so you might find that interesting. Everyone does it a little differently so you might want to browse around a bit to find someone who does something similar (some are more rigid than others), but capsule wardrobes tend to have focus on quality over quantity, and appreciating the smaller details. Maybe you’ll find some inspiration without any pressure of having to drastically change your wardrobe;)	episode_done:True

text:How many distinctly different outfits do you have?	labels:I have a lot of clothes, but only a handful of silhouettes. Right now, I'm wearing a lot of open cardigans/sweaters in solid color with an interesting shirt under, jeans, and ballet flats or oversized sweaters, leggings, and ankle boots. I'm not repeating items very often (well, jeans and leggings get repeated...) but I'm not really mixing up the shape either. I like it because I *think* I've found shapes that work for me and then within that, I can experiment and have fun. When I mess around with the overall shape, I often feel out of place or frumpy or something...but within the basic element, there is tons of ways to mix it up (color, texture, material, accessories, etc)	episode_done:True

text:How many distinctly different outfits do you have?	labels:I've wondered about the same thing a lot before. I spent some time working in Japan, and I had a fairly limited professional wardrobe there. I had a handful of skirts, with only two silhouettes really - a long maxi and a full a-line knee-length. To add to that, two pairs were literally the same skirt, just in two different colors. So I had to plan how I wore them pretty carefully to try not to repeat them more than once a week, and to try to avoid a weekly schedule of skirt wearing. What I really relied on was my blouses and sweaters, because although their silhouette and fit was also very similar to one another, they tended to have patterns and be more distinguishable that way.  To be honest though, I think I spent a lot of time worrying over something that few people really paid much attention to. There were a few times I forgot to do laundry and ran out of clothes, so I had to repeat an outfit before I wanted, and no one ever commented or gave me weird looks. And I definitely knew people who just repeated things all the time and didn't care. I think if anything, if many of your clothes are very similar, it makes it easier to dress and just becomes a distinctive style trait.	episode_done:True

I also bought a few clothing items that is taking forever to ship though. I might cancel some of them and wait out the rest. I mean, 30ish bucks for dresses/jumpsuits and 40s for cashmere is a pretty good deal, and it's not like Everlane's style is gonna change much. They sell the same shit year in and year out.	episode_done:False

text:I like aerie for the most part. Bras and bralettes are super cute and comfy. Usually the underwear is great but I was super disappointed by the no show cheeky underwear.

text:Online Styling Services?	labels:In addition to all the wonderful advice above, some stylists on Instagram regularly have weekly blog posts or stories posts where they ask their followers to send in any styling questions and they give their advice for free!   Personally I recommend waiting if you decide to try any paid styling services until after the pandemic because it opens up the option for meeting with a stylist in person, and also it makes it easier to try on the various things they recommend in a shop/mall as opposed to getting a couple things in a few sizes shipped to you and dealing with returns. Plus, sometimes colors differ from screen to screen so if they are trying to give advice about colors that suit you, the monitor differences could potentially cause problems.	episode_done:True

text:How do men's outerwear differ from women's? I found a really good deal on a 100% wool coat, but in men's...	labels:I would check out Aritzia for wool coats. I think right now they're on sale for more or less 200 dollars and they're made from Italian wool.   Otherwise, I would highly suggest getting the size as close to you as possible and consider getting it tailored--especially if you intend to get a nice coat that lasts a long time. I think it's definitely worth the money tailoring nice clothes to your body!	episode_done:False
text:A word of caution about tailoring - it’s the shoulders that will most likely need tailoring, but it is very difficult and very expensive to alter shoulders on a coat, and may not be physically possible depending on how much you need them taken in.   I tried it once with a men’s peacoat and brought it to the best, most experienced tailor in town, and even he really struggled with it. In the end, he could not take the shoulders in far enough without ruining the structure of the coat. He did the best possible job he could, it was not at all his fault, but it cost a lot and I didn’t really like the result.	labels:This is very true, And another problem is the size of the armhole. The armholes tend to be very big on men's coats, and no tailoring can actually add in fabric to make the size more reasonable. A man's coat would have armholes halfway to the waist on me, which greatly reduces the arm range of motion.	episode_done:False

text:How do men's outerwear differ from women's? I found a really good deal on a 100% wool coat, but in men's...	labels:Unfortunately men's styles aren't an easy fit on curvy women. You'd have to size up a couple of times to make room for boobs and hips and at that point, the shoulders would be disproportionately large and the fit would be very boxy. That's not something easy to tailor or worth tailoring.  H&M currently has women's coats in 100% wool, around $150, if they're not sold out yet. They had several styles a couple of weeks ago. There are options for women high in wool content, no need to venture into the men's section if it's not a sure fit. Off the top of my head, Artizia, Zara, and Massimo Dutti all also carry wool coats in the $100-$300 price range.	episode_done:False
text:Do you know if quality of the wool coats at H&M will be lower quality? Say getting a 100% wool coat from H&M/F21 versus jCrew? I mean, I've even seen people write in this sub that their Aritizia wool clothes didn't hold up for more than 1-2 seasons	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I’ve gone to online shopping only post Covid. It was definitively challenging at first to guess my size and learn to interpret my measurements (def measure yourself, there’s guides online) and the stores’, but it gets better with time!   It is easiest to stick to brands you already have clothes from, or alternatively use online stores that calculate your size for you based on other clothes you have (Saks, Bloomingdales and other large department stores offer this feature). The next part is to shop only on sites that allow returns (original payment, not store credit), preferably for free. Many big retailers do this already - with the final sale caveat. My favorites that I shop at most are Shopbop.com, Reformation, Saks, Aritzia (careful, they only refund to original payment non sale items), Bloomingdales, Lululemon, Farfetch, Banana Republic, J Crew, Abercrombie and Fitch. In general though, I won’t buy anything without checking out the site’s return policy first, and I usually don’t shop at places that don’t accept returns.  I acknowledge that some of these may have allegedly unethical practices, but I can’t afford (time, effort, health, money, etc.) finding alternatives at this time. I kindly ask that we don’t focus on that aspect sub the op didn’t specify they wanted ethic retailers only.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I have had the opposite experience because I'm gaining weight! I work from home in my one-story home now so it's easy to go a whole day without getting even 25% of the steps I normally would take, pre-pandemic. That plus stress-eating equals weight gain, but I'm trying to be kind to myself.   This does mean, however, that I don't fit in 75% of my clothes. I still have stretchy size 8 jeans in my closet I need to part with, which is absolutely crazy considering size 14 is what fits me most comfortably now.  I love to dress up and was often the overdressed person at pre-pandemic gatherings, so I get what you're saying about wanting nice things to wear on the rare occasion that you're seen. It feels nice to change it up from my favorite cozy/comfy sweatpants outfit I wear most days.   That said, I haven't been shopping as much as I normally would, but when I do, it's usually in-person from retail nearby so I can see items in person. I size up from what I think would fit (trying to be honest with myself) and usually it works out fine. I sometimes will over-buy, take things home to try on, then return what doesn't work. It's not perfect but that's what I've been doing, occasionally.  If I shop online, I shop from my trusted brands only, or again I follow my size-up rule.  Mostly though, I've found that the few cuter things I buy (like a Vera Wang blouse or a sweater dress from the Target down the street) hang in my closet for months before I realize I was fooling myself to think I'd rather wear this to sit at my desk than pajamas.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I worked at Kohl's in college and spent my fair share of time cleaning out fitting rooms.  In normal times, those are the grossest places ever (you don't even want to know what kind of shit I found in there-- including literal shit).    TBH the only clothes I've purchased since Covid were PJ pants (because my old ones split in the ass).  They were from Walmart (so I could go even during a lockdown).   Oh and I bought a sweater dress at Primark.  Now, most of the clothes I buy run SML as opposed to numbered sizes.  Even dresses.  I generally just hold them up to my body and pray that they work (and return if they do not).    I tend not to buy clothes online because the quality is so inconsistent from store to store (and even within a store).  I need to actually feel the quality.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I actually did a bit of a wardrobe overhaul right before COVID started (just happened to be around my birthday which is the only time I really do much clothing/jewelry shopping), and then promptly didn't get a chance to wear any of it, so I haven't purchased much outside of basics during the pandemic. I bought a few pieces I had been hunting down (a pair of Jeffrey Campbell booties, an embroidered "kimono") and filled some holes (fashion-over-function sandals, an easy summer dress) but other than that, I've taken the pandemic as an opportunity to focus on bulking out my basics. Finding the "perfect" undies, socks, etc and then stocking up. So nothing where I really needed to try anything on first or do returns, for the most part. All online, which isn't too much different than pre-pandemic minus the odd thrifting excursion. It's actually been nice, being on a limited income I tend to feel pressured to prioritize the clothing people can actually see. But since my "regular" wardrobe isn't getting worn practically at all, I finally have some flexibility to splurge on a nice pair of joggers or buy a couple camis specifically for lounging in (instead of having to "save" them for wearing with outfits). I'm definitely a maximalist and still get dressed up for certain meetings, but I haven't been getting dressed up "just because" mostly to avoid wear and tear on clothes that I haven't had a chance to wear anywhere yet.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I did a complete wardrobe overhaul and at first was going to buy my items from regular online shopping like at J Crew and Banana Republic, but then I realized I could find those same items secondhand through Depop. I usually find online shopping to be a pain, but being able to search for specific essentials I need for my wardrobe and also scroll through and find unique vintage pieces made the process really entertaining. It turned out that I enjoyed this way more than regular shopping in stores!   The way I tackled it was I searched for specific items I needed that were essential to me (e.g. black velvet square neck top) and did my best to avoid fast fashion items that I knew weren't built to last. If I needed help visualizing a piece, I asked for a try-on pic, measurements of the bust/waist/hip/length to make sure it fit my body the way I wanted it to, and material content. It's nice too that I'm supporting a small business and oftentimes messaged with whoever I was buying for a bit to ask questions about the item and maybe haggle a bit, that social aspect was nice. Essentially 90% of my closet is secondhand from depop now after shopping over the course of a couple months and I love that I'm in love with every piece that I have and was able to curate each one to suit my needs.  It definitely takes some patience and a good eye for pieces/what materials are best, but I think that's far better than how I originally used to shop and has taught me a lot about how I'm allowed to be picky and absolutely love and enjoy my items, instead of buying things just because it's on sale even though I'm only lukewarm about it. You can find some really good deals and unique vintage pieces while saving money and saving clothing from landfills!	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:Get measuring tape and read reviews when ordering online. Pay attention to size charts and stretchy/non stretchy fabrics. Shop from places with free returns. ASOS has always been my go to for a wide variety of brands, premier free 2 day shipping for a year ($19) and free returns. Ive always preferred shopping online because I hate waiting in line and get overwhelmed by stores, and I haven’t had much of a problem with them over the last 5 years	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I find some websites also have good customer service centers where you can ask questions about sizing and get a better idea of fit. So I'd find those companies and just reach out.   That said, I certainly have just stuck with what I know - no new styles for me! I was eyeing up a very nice jacket and even put it in my cart only to panic and abandon the order, because I just wasn't sure the style would work on me.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I moved to a big city in 2012 and driving and parking is miserable, so I have been online shopping for years now.  I use Zappos and Amazon a lot. For Zappos returns, you print a label, tape it up and take to any UPS place. I have a very difficult time buying shoes, so I might order a dozen pair and sometimes return them all. If the business wants to do this, I am cooperative.  You have to check on Amazon before you purchase and make certain it's returnable. UPS will box it up for you, it's amazing.  I hear Kohl's does also, but I never go there. You can print your own label and return it to an Amazon locker, that's even easier than a UPS store.  I check my measurements carefully and read a lot of reviews. I don't actually return much that I buy except for shoes.  I buy everything online, but bras? I don't know, that might be difficult.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I mainly thrift, but I'm a stickler for trying things on in store and since I don't feel comfortable shopping in person anyways, I've finally sucked it up and tried out Depop.  It's been about 5 years since I last did any online clothing shopping, but I've had pretty good luck with it so far, but I've got a good eye for what shapes are gonna work for me, and I always message the seller about something before I buy.  I probably would have picked up a couple of things for Asos, but they don't do video anymore, so I'll probably try and tackle Poshmark next for some of the more fun pieces on my list.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:This pandemic is forcing me to learn how to return and drop off packages, and overcome all of my anxiety doing it. I basically only shop thrift in person now, to support local stores, and I do online for everything else. Some of my online has been surprising (like ordering two sandals 9.5 and finding them to be too big) and others were amazing (a Banana Republic Factory fit and flare dress fitting me perfectly?? How) But I basically decided that I think I need to spend more time studying and gathering wardrobe inspiration, and taking care of basics. I also went to my local Fleet Feet and got fitted for proper walking shoes and a sports bra, so I can start exercising for my health. All in all, it's been a mix.	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I lost a lot of weight recently (AUS size 18/16 to 8), so this is probably the third time I have rebuilt a wardrobe. I am also a teacher and approaching my 30s so I wanted to appear more put together than what I did in my 20s.  It was difficult as I was anxious when clothes shopping because I had no idea what size I was at the time. My first step was to at least buy some basic but nice quality pants, I started with two pairs of jeans that I could wear to work or casually to figure out my size. She also showed me some blouses they had on sale at the time. I left with two tops and two pairs of jeans.      After knowing my size I went to a store like H&M and purchased a few more basic pieces such as blouses and pants that were suitable for work when I needed to be more professional and opposed to casual. During winter I purchased a couple of pieces that were on sale at MYER that were suitable for our weather, I also got two pencil skirts for variety.  I also took time to walk around my local shopping centre to see what was available close by to my home so I could identify what stores I should keep an eye on or watch for sales. When some of the stores I like are having a sale I will pop in and purchase a couple of things.  I also had to purchase new shoes as I lost half a shoe size (AUS 8 - 7.5)  Overall, start with some basics and keep an eye on the stores you like for sales. Every now and then if you really like something buy it. Even though I purchased all these nice clothes if I were a sim my default outfit would be tights and a denim shirt at the moment.	episode_done:True

text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I have been rebuilding my wardrobe for the last couple of years because I have the financial means to do so at this point in my life, and I feel like I finally have a good sense of what works/what I like.  This is what I kept in mind when making my purchases:  - What type of fabrics/colors/fit do I find myself reaching for the most often? - What outfits were my favorites in the past? What qualities about them made me feel confident/comfortable/good? Were my favorite outfits also my most worn? Why yes or no? - What occasions/situations do I need the most clothes for?  For me, I realized that I heavily favored natural fabrics that drape while still having some hints of structure. Fabrics like linen, cotton, and wool. I like black, cream, camel, burnt orange, and earthy reds.   When I had a good sense of what I needed and wanted, I did the following:  - Bought basics first. Well-fitting pants, solid tops, good undergarments like slips/bras/underwear. These basics followed my general rules for fit/cut/quality/fabric/color story.  - Only purchase items that fit perfectly. I realized that if something was even slightly too long, too tight, too whatever, I wouldn't end up wearing it.  - After I had the basics, I started purchasing items that I could build on the basics to create awesome outfits. I would only purchase something if I could think of ways to incorporate it into multiple outfits.	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I lost a whole load of weight and got bed bugs, which lead to me throwing out or not being able to wear a good portion of my wardrobe. Tbh it really sucked to no longer fit into all this beautiful clothing I had tailored to fit me perfectly, but that’s life I guess  What I actually did was basically buy a capsule wardrobe - I really like neutrals, so I bought only neutrals, and made sure everything worked with everything else. I’m pretty good at knowing what my style is, and all the pieces I got were pretty straight forward, but they all matched. What was good too, is I was able to buy a couple base pieces, and then after that I would buy stuff as I came across it. That way I wasn’t buying everything in one go, and was able to think about what I bought and if it would work for me. I did watch some capsule wardrobe videos on YouTube which helped.	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:This might not be helpful at all, but here’s how it worked out for me:  My first realization was that (for me) basics are overrated. I only like certain types of pants and never wear basic, plain tees. So I got enough skinnie jeans to last me throughout the week (which is 3 in my case) - two in black, one in a timeless jeans shade. Then I got just enough lounge/sleepwear to last me between washes. I had a small handful of old sweaters and tees that I didn’t love and phased out (still keeping them around for yard work) when I got items I loved.  From here on I decied to take it slow and *only* get pieces that   a) worke with what I have, and b) genuinely excite me.  In my case that meant (second hand) designer pieces that I meticulously picked out.  They needed to be timeless, of high enough quality to last years, fit me and suit me, and reasonable to care for. (Learning how to properly care for your clothes goes hand in hand with that)  If I saw something I loved (for example an 80s Fendi monogram jeans skirt, a lovely navy blue N. Pearl men’s turtleneck that looks just the right kind of oversized on me) I’d jump at it, otherwise I made due with what I had.  I slowly built my wardrobe like that. I only purchased 2-3 pieces a month and was really really picky. I either bought outstanding “wow”-pieces, or items I *really* needed at the time (a winter coat for example).   While I don’t have a large variety of clothes to pick from, I’m genuinely excited to get dressed every day.	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:Okay, I would start with two pairs of nice jeans, two pairs of leggings, one set of pajamas. 5 undergarments and 5 socks. 2 good bras. Three casual tops and one going out top. One warm jacket and one fashion jacket. One sweater. One nice dress and one nice pair of heels. A pair of sneakers, boots, and flats or sandals. To start! You can always add in a cardigan that matches to other things. I hope this helps?	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I'm a fashion graduate and have worked in fashion in some way since college, I found while I tended to make my own clothing or shop in thrift stores I was still hoarding clothing constantly (mainly with a "oh that fabric might come in handy even if I don't wear that!").   I moved to the UK from the States and realised my South Coast wardrobe wouldn't really work in London. I brought a few staples such as dungarees and jeans that fit like a glove with me and then just rebuilt when I moved.   I tend to ask myself   * Will I wear this in five years time?  * Is this well made? * Does it match at least three other things I own? * Does it make me feel good?   I found that I stayed away from things that were just a 'good deal' and fads. I don't have a Pinterest but I definitely know that I prefer earth tones and tend to stick to those :)	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I had to start over once. Basically, I graduated college in 2008, during the recession. I was poor, and being paid for shit. As I found better pay, I also immediately had 2 kids, so I was a million different sizes, with lots of bills. As a result, my wardrobe was ill-fitting cheap stuff. It was a mish-mash of styles and sizes. Most was from Goodwill and other thrifts/garage sales, Old Navy, Forever 21, etc. My casual wardrobe was basically stained sweatpants that I never left the house in. Everything was purchased solely on it's cheapness, and my work clothes didn't have to "fit", they just had to pass as office attire. It sucked, and I didn't feel great about myself.  Once my husband and I finally changed jobs enough to get to a good place financially, and my kids got old enough that a lot of the baby bills subsided, I finally had the money to fix my clothes. Before I started, I lost about 40 pounds to be back where I wanted to be. I then went to the stores and tried on A TON of stuff to find out what looked good on me and what I liked. I only bought things that served a purpose for me, and I ruthlessly purged things that didn't. I also stopped buying from "fast fashion" places, and I mindfully thrifted/bought only quality pieces from quality brands.   It honestly took a couple of years, but I think I'm finally done. I actually don't own that many clothes, because I get rid of anything that isn't being used often enough. I find that having one good, black dress that fits me serves me far better than having 10 ill-fitting, cheaper dresses. It's my only formal dress, and I have used it for pretty much all weddings and funerals. It's comfortable, it looks great on me, and I change the look with my shoes, bag, and jewelry. My wardrobe is built around workhorses like that that cover many occasions and that I want to reach for because of how good they make me feel.	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I started in 2017 and just finished this year and I am very happy with how my closet looks now!  First, I got rid of everything. I was transitioning from a cheap college wardrobe to a semi-professional one (I teach kids). I wanted to strip my closet down to the bare bones, keeping only what I truly wanted, and then building on top of what I had. I did a Marie Kondo type thing, almost. I kept a few things that were of higher quality or that I really liked, and donated the rest.  Then I got the absolute basics: a few neutral blouses, jeans and black pants, replaced some of my most worn out shoes that "went with everything." Then I built from there.  After that, then came the dirty work. Hours upon hours of Pinterest-ing, reading style books, saving money every month and then teaching myself to be ok with spending that money, successful and unsuccessful shopping trips, plenty of thrifting, scouring online sales, swapping with friends, cataloging everything and building outfits via the app StyleBook. I did a lot of online shopping this year and there were some truly awesome sales so I was able to truly round out my closet for much of this year. I finally have it in a good spot.  My style skews very classic and preppy and timeless, so a lot of what I have in my closet will be in style for years. I couldn't be more happy with how it looks; it's easily mixed and matched and because I spent over three years building it slowly, much of it is also tailored and bought thoughtfully. I will add little things here and there, but for now, and for the first time ever, I am content with it!	episode_done:True

I have cocktail dresses in dark gray, navy, wine and gold and just layer in accessories, shoes and bags to change the look. And if I REALLY want something new, I buy some inexpensive accessory instead of an entire new outfit.  My exceptions are my birthday and our annual family Christmas party. Those are the two times I treat myself. But for all those other weddings, cocktail parties and work events, I stick to my tried and true.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone here has the habit of needing to buy a new clothing/set of clothings when attending an occasion/going somewhere?	labels:Yeah its especially an issue with weddings because I don't want to be wearing the same dress in pictures from each. In the future I might look into renting dresses for that reason.	episode_done:True

text:Anyone here has the habit of needing to buy a new clothing/set of clothings when attending an occasion/going somewhere?	labels:This happens when I don’t prepare and don’t take the time to slowly buy things for certain occasions over time. I almost always hate what I bought when this happens and I end up donating it or reselling it on poshmark/eBay at the end of the season.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone here has the habit of needing to buy a new clothing/set of clothings when attending an occasion/going somewhere?	labels:I do sometimes, but I’ve been buying primarily secondhand (Poshmark, Depop, thrift stores, friends, Instagram, etc) for going on three years now.   I like trading out items with other people too, that way I’m not contributing to consumerism, but also getting that variety I crave!	episode_done:True
text:Anyone here has the habit of needing to buy a new clothing/set of clothings when attending an occasion/going somewhere?	labels:I was in the habit of thinking I need something new when attending a fancy event like a wedding. I would then donate the items. Nowadays, even before COVID, I wasn't getting invited to much so I don't have this problem anymore. In the future, I plan on wearing the same things again. If I thought I could get things that fit well in my size and don't need tailoring, I would rent instead.	episode_done:True

text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I work in a food safety lab, so we have to wear lab coats, uniforms, and even specific shoes. My off-duty wardrobe is, like everyone else's in our position, larger than it needs to be.  But since I live in a colder climate, I've gotten really into outerwear like coats & scarfs since that's the one thing I can control every single day on my way to and from work!  When I first started in my lab, I didnt want to put on a whole new outfit when I got home because I'm lazy and hate doing laundry.  But after a while, I got to the point where I just wanted to feel cute and like myself! These days I basically change outfits entirely in the evening when I get home just to have a little style in my day.  I also started wearing my "special occasion" clothes more regularly too since when else are we gonna wear them?!  Last night I wanted to look cute but didnt want to put any effort into it, so I put on a chiffon tank top and cozy sweater with nice leggings.  And you know what - I felt fancy as fuck sitting on my couch eating burritos with my husband.  I've decided that it's just about finding that balance between needing to feel put together at some point during your day/life, and how much effort you want to put in.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:About a year ago I moved from a front office position wearing business casual to a medical billing position where I am required to wear scrubs. I can’t stand it. My entire business wardrobe is packed away but my personal wardrobe only gets worn on the weekends. It’s very opposite of scrubs. I like tighter denim and leggings, lots of structured tops and leather jackets. Every time I go shopping I have this voice in the back of my mind reminding me that I am hardly ever going to wear that so there’s no point but I refuse to listen to that guilt. I love clothes and I get excited for the changing seasons.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I work in a medical lab, so it’s scrubs and a lab coat all day. On my days off I dress nice and do my makeup even if I don’t leave the house. I play dress up with my daughter with my nicer clothing so it doesn’t just sit in the closet until it’s safe to go out again. It feels good to be put together and not just wear sweatpants all day, even if we’re stuck home.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I am a vet tech so scrubs with pet fur and pet bodily functions on myself all day. When I get home, usually it’s a lot of sweat pants and comfy T-shirts that feel clean until pajama time. But I definitely love to have those days were I dress up and look presentable, but that’s mostly just jeans and a nice top/sweater in winter or a sundress in summer. I have an addiction to formal dresses so although I won’t have a use for one for a while in COVID, having those gorgeous dresses in my closet makes my heart full. I say get what makes you feel confident and happy, whether or not you’ll wear it every day or once a month.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:Mechanic here (yeah, a dude in female fashion advise, I know). Get greasy and filthy daily but have always had a more business casual/preppy style out of work. I'll wear polo shirts on the weekend even when I'm puttering around the house and nice sweaters in the evening. As others have said, lots of out of date clothes in my closet but as a guy that matters a lot less. I like to look good and always dress for or above the occasion. Bright side is: I spend VERY little money on clothes because they last so long. Jeans? 10 years easily. Graphic T's? 5+ years, no problem. Buy the things you love and don't worry about the money because the clothes will outlive your memory of the cost.  Added bonus, my wife and I go places together and look like we own the place. Every night is a date night!	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:Security here.   My non-work wardrobe is extensive and colourful and very 1950s.  I don't like wearing my security uniform into work unless it's freezing cold and I can hide it under a winter coat, because it's made by the same uniform supplier as our local PD.   So I end up wearing most of my clothes anyways, because I don't want to be mistaken for something I'm not.      Plus i've had incidents where people threaten to wait outside for me after I get off work (because I've kicked them out, or caught them stealing) and I've walked right by them and they have NO IDEA because I look so different in my regular clothes.   So it's a safety thing too.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I work in healthcare as well and wear scrubs to work.  I find that since I dress down on a daily basis, I tend to want to dress up a bit more when I’m not at work - heels, dresses, etc.  That being said, my wardrobe in general is fairly casual since I really have no need to business clothing.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I work for the local parks department in the summer and as a baker in the winter. So my summer job has a uniform and my winter job I have to wear more grungy clothes that can be in a kitchen. This winter I decided fuck it, I wanna look a little nicer at work so I have been wearing clothes that are a bit nicer for me and making sure I always have an apron over them. Otherwise I just have a lot of stuff that will rarely get used. Before covid I loved dressing nicer to go out to dinner or a brewery or even to a friends, but now when I’m not at work I mostly wear sweats and leggings. Just waiting for covid to end so I can at least look nice out and about again because I never will at my jobs haha	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I ride horses professionally and manage a boarding facility, so my daily wear has to be appropriate for riding 8 horses a day (so breeches, knee high socks, athletic shirts), getting dirty (mud boots, overclothes I don't much care about), and staying warm/dry (seven billion layers of hobo coats). Unfortunately, my personal style is more of a mix of cottagecore/Edwardian/grungy Audrey Hepburn, which as you can imagine has absolutely no place whatsoever in my day to day life. I am also a compulsive clothes hoarder (screw you, Goodwill and thrift shopping!)  &#x200B;  I got sick and tired of seeing all these beautiful clothes in my closets that I *never* wore, so I purged it completely. I have two to three outfits for every occasion, two pairs of going - out jeans, and one pair of black heels now, with the ability to mix and match in between. Since I never really go anywhere, I always feel like I'm wearing something new when I do! Most of my pieces are more or less "timeless styles," and then I try and get one new thing every season to keep my wardrobe up with the times. But I have a rule that every time I buy a new thing, I have to throw one item out, which helps with the clothes hoarding!   &#x200B;  Luckily, I have some room for fashion in my work wear. I try and get trendy colored breeches in earth tones, find complementary shirts and jackets, cool socks, etc. I also have the awesome opportunity to color coordinate with my horse *and* his tack, which most people can't say, so I'll take that over being truly fashionable any day! (Did you guys know it's actually pretty difficult to pick a color scheme that also complements the exact shade of your horses coat properly? It's hard enough to determine whether humans are cool or warm or whatever....)	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I work in an investment firm - no sandals, shorts or anything that remotely looks like a pajama.   I wear a nice tanktop at home with my nice pair of VS panty. I love feeling sexy at home. Sometimes bra or not. My BF loves to see me in nice panties. At other times when I am going out to see friends - I wear what I wear at work. I have no other varieties.	episode_done:True
text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I am a teacher that went back to working in the building at the beginning of September, so to be fair I was only wfh for several months in the spring, but it still drastically changed my style, or my perspective on my style.   Pre-Covid my work style (and general style) had morphed over the years to become very, very minimal and neutral. Lots of Everlane and Eileen Fisher. This was both because I wanted to be taken seriously at my job (I read very young) and because it also seemed like what was in style to me.   Returning to work in the fall, I realized I really f*cking hated all of my sensible, plain, go with everything black and grey clothes.   I still really prefer earth tones and blacks and greys, and I still wear some pretty simple outfits somedays, but I went on a small spree on The RealReal after I had my realization. I bought myself some louder statement pieces that feel more me, including an embroidered Happy Sheep sweater, a knit Missoni sheath dress, a multi-colored leather and fur purse, platform oxfords, and a couple of geometric patterned silk shirts and dresses.   For me life is too short to try so hard to be timeless and professional. I’m not knocking the look, it just isn’t ~me~ I want to love the clothes I wear and the clothes I love are fun knits and patterns.	episode_done:False
text:I also have added a lot more prints/textures/silhouettes/colors to my wardrobe since COVID. I am wondering if this is because I've had more time to take a deep dive into what my style actually is or if it's because trends are moving away from the all neutral "timeless" look.	labels:	episode_done:True

I miss going to the office and feeling cute, and being seen by others. A woman I work with told me ‘you always have the cutest dresses’ about a year ago and I absolutely loved hearing that.

A much more stylish blouse and pants with killer heels? It will look great, but no one compliment the perfect black pants.  At home with a dark office and shitty camera, I wear knitted joggers and cardigans with tight tops, like heattech. I'm really happy about trading most sweatpants for knitted versions, even though it's mostly synthetics. I find my legs are sensitive to wool.	labels:	episode_done:True

I have been going to my workout class and it feels silly to change clothes midday to get ready for an afternoon class. I would bring a change of clothes before of course.   One of my fashion goals for this year was getting better at separates. I am practicing this! In the before times I wore more dresses. I haven’t been doing it as much because my desk area is a little chilly. I have a few looks I am happy with and should translate nicely.   I did wear some of my dresses during the summer. But more solid ones vs patterned ones. I have been also experimenting with solids this year.   I have been wearing way more pants so that will likely translate in the future. Surprisingly. I have avoided pants a lot in the past.   I can’t wait to get back to my fave shoes and the dresses I have missed - that feel a little wrong for sitting at home. My wardrobe has gone through a massive shift over the past 5 years when I started biking for errands.  This means I mostly buy items that are bike friendly. And that works well for sitting at home as well. I have snuck in a skirt or two that may not work on my bike - and jeans which I hate biking in - but one the whole that rule serves me well.	episode_done:True

text:Contour is just the name of the bodysuit line from the brand! It’s more of just an actual garment instead of shape wear since the material is not as super stretch but it is definitely very slimming and hugging. I typically wear it as an easy basic top, it can be dressed up with a nice pair of high waist pants, heels, and mid length coat. I’ll dress is down with slim sweats and a long sleeve crew bodysuit and white sneakers just to look cozy comfy but still decently put together	labels:Aaah I get you!

text:definitely worth the cost. I found out about contour bodysuits maybe a month ago and I already own 5. I would say it’s pretty true to size but I would size up for the crewneck styles only because the armpit isn’t stretchy which makes it harder to get out of. If you want a skin tight fit, I would go with regular size and just take into account you’ll have to be patient at the end of the day getting it off or have someone help you.   The scoop, strapless and any that have a bigger neck is tts and stretches and you can slip in and out easily through the neck.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:I think you have to have one element that “fits.”  Like of you have the oversized thing, pick one thing that fits a little slimmer (e.g a straight pant over a wide pant).   Or make sure the shoulder fits for that oversized top - vs a drop shoulder - if the whole outfit is looser.   I also think you can be intentional about revealing a little bit of well chosen skin. Wrists, ankles, calves, collarbone. So you are not just overwhelmed by fabric.   And of course you can always just wear what you want and not worry about it.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:This style isn’t really my style, but one thing I notice in these looks is that they look really well tailored despite being loose and drapey. In particular, the cuff of the sleeves in the first pic and the hem of the pants in the second hit in exactly the right places rather than bunching up. This makes the outfits look really intentional IMO.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:I think what's consistent in the examples that you've shown is that she has a very minimalist style in darker colors. The quality of the fabric appears to be high. When you use natural fibers like cotton and wool and silk they will naturally drape better on any body type. Look for pieces like cocoon jackets, cropped wide leg trousers, and tunics for example. I hope this helps, I love the images you've selected. last thought is that if you are going to accessorize keep it somewhat simple and also high quality.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:I work retail and I see a lot of customers who are plus-size/large wearing oversize pieces and they make it work. It really is about attitude and also as a user below said, having your hair, makeup and nails done is really helpful too.  *I don't dress to disguise my body shape, I'm OK with looking fat.*  Also wanted to add that I relate to that sentiment. Having this attitude has helped me so much in not agonizing over what to wear to work every day. I know I'm not proportionate and I'm not going to try and disguise it with shapewear. It is what it is.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:I’d add that the most *important* fit for these clothes are the shoulders. Whatever top you choose, the drape will be affected by what is primarily holding the weight of the fabric.

text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:This goes for any size, but I think the oversized/shapeless trend is done well with styling.  Perfectly tailored items, luxe fabrics, and generally styling yourself to look polished (hair, makeup, jewelry, whatever your thing is) really helps avoid looking or feeling sloppy.  I really enjoy loose tops, and find if they have a nice drape it helps. I'm short, so I try to offset the volume up top by wearing something slim on the bottom.	episode_done:True

It is obviously prescriptive and repressive to say fat people need to hide fat "or wearing "flattering clothes", but if they are wearing some loose maybe they just like it? We do not have to wear body fitting clothing to be OK, or proud with our bodies, sometimes you know you just like the silhouette, the cut, the comfort.  Grandma can wear whatever she wants and she is not necessarily ashamed.	episode_done:True

I went through all the accessories obsessions, it started with earnings, I would change them daily (I need to wear always earrings), then it went to rings and I felt like a influencer. I do not know why wearing rings made me feel like such a badass it would give me like I do not why as if I had my life together and with a cute manicure wow.... but I am not that constant so I started forgetting changing earrings and putting rings. Then I started with multiple small necklaces and as with earrings and rings, oh and purses, I stopped doing it and nowI just wear the same three necklace always... so... now I am obsessed with belts, I promise I have tried with all my strength to go out of my house without a belt, but I really can't I would say that it is as if I was going without a bad but I do that a lot ....but without a belt puff I can't.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else always hesitate to buy what they truly love because they don't have a social life?	labels:I try to reach a compromise: one of the questions I ask myself before buying something is “will I wear it?” I’ve learnt that I don’t really need more dresses, but what does make me feel good is really good quality staples that make day to day clothes stand out more, like a special coat, shoes or earrings. For you, you might want to explore making your jeans, tees and athleisure really good quality so they make you feel good about them when you put them on.  Another way of looking at it is you probably save more money than the average person on going out. You could set aside some money every month for special items of clothing, then try buying and wearing that fancy dress or expensive jeans you mentioned - it’s much easier to treat yourself on clothes when it’s designated in your budget. The more you wear them, the more you’ll probably see there are opportunities in your life to show them off.	episode_done:True

text:You make a great point about quality variances across all fibers. Even though I prefer natural fibers I have definitely eschewed linen pants from target because it's low quality, see through, and scratchy. I also hate how sometimes a cotton tee warps after washing because it wasn't prewashed prior to being cut and seen but that has more to do with the production of the garment rather than the fiber content, but it's still an example that not all natural fiber items are great (if not made well).	labels:	episode_done:True

It is proven, that synthetics will grow a bacterium, that cottons, linen, wools, canvas etc will not. So you need to wash synthetics more. As everyone knows from gym clothes and swimwear.

Also synthetics textiles used for so many textile things around us daily life, that aren’t clothing, but were we are adding them in rubbish all the time and they pollution, and materials that won’t breakdown.

text:Yup I love Rayon and it does not have the shedding microplastics issue since it's made from plant material	labels:Each material has their own downside. Rayon uses a lot of trees (deforestation) and the chemical process to manufacture Rayon is pretty toxic for the environment.  Meanwhile cotton is a water hungry plant that kills the dirt's health. Plastic creates micropalstics like you said. It's almost like you can't win. But if you buy secondhand or deadstock new, it slightly better cause you're not putting new money into deforesting, pesticides, toxic chemical processes and such.  Linen / flax / hemp is technically the better choice to buy new. The plants require less water than cotton and doesn't have the plastic problem. Although any farming industry that gets big enough will eventually harm the environment one way or another.  It's really the insane commercialization of any manufacturing process that's bad for the environment. There isn't really any one magic material that's not going to harm the environment when it's mass produced for millions of people to consume.	episode_done:True

text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:I'm trying to decrease my consumption of plastic so yes, if I'm buying clothing nowadays I tend to look for natural fibers.

If I'm buying new synthetics it tends to be activewear.	episode_done:True
text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:I don't like wearing synthetic fabrics for the most part and try to avoid them, but I am vegan and that leaves out wool and silk, so almost everything I own is cotton or linen. I find I sweat too much in most synthetic fabrics or they just cause weird sensory issues for me, but not all synthetic and blends are bad or cause me issues. It's hard because I generally need to feel the fabric to see if it'll cause me a problem and when ordering online, it's not possible.   I do think fleece is particularly problematic because of the plastic fibers that get into the water when washed, but there are bags to wash them in to trap it. I don't think all synthetics shed plastic like that but I'm not sure.	episode_done:True
text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:I think its important to take into consideration that sure synthetic fibres are easier to acquire nowadays and its the ‘new’ thing to turnover plastic into these fabrics however, we need to think of biodegradability. Although these synthetic fibres are accessible they are not as easy to degrade into the earth as natural fibres. Look into this and think about it when shopping. I personally own items that are made of synthetic fabrics but have purchased them second hand so they are already pre-existing.  I feel grateful to have so many options accessible to me here in the GTA, so I now purchase about 90% of my clothing second hand.	episode_done:True
text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:Depends on the synthetic for me - like OP said if it serves a purpose, I love them. I think there's also a huge spectrum of quality with synthetics that can either make it unbelievably comfy or a scratchy heat trap from hell (although tbf you run into the same thing with wool).  What does creep me out is you would not want to be caught in any type of fire related emergency while wearing the majority of fast fashion synthetics because they will melt into your skin and make burns worse.

text:100% on privilege. Over the past few years, I’ve slowly transitioned much of my wardrobe to natural fiber clothing (with the exception of athletic wear - but now there’s recycled options at least!). And I know it’s a privilege to do so, now that I’m further in my career. A $300 slow fashion, locally produced w/ fair wage, pasture raised wool sweater simply isn’t accessible for most. And even secondhand, it’s not cheap by any means. This is why as problematic as Everlane is as a brand, I won’t judge someone for buying a much more affordable wool cardigan there instead of from babaa, if it better fits their financial needs.  However, trends are for sure more physically accessible now than before with e-commerce and social media, for better or for worse. It’s interesting - I’m in my early 30s, so our generation was in jr high / high school just as e-commerce was starting. We were one of the first Facebook user cohorts. I grew up in a sleepy suburb that was ~2 hours from a large city. We had an OK mall, Macy’s was our fanciest department store. Whenever a girl wore something from Nordstrom’s, everyone oohed and ahhed because not only was it more expensive, but you had to be fairly privileged to travel to the city to go shopping.   I still remember our family visiting my older brother in another major city, and he took me to an Urban Outfitters store for the first time. I thought all the clothes were _so cool_ and how awesome that the people had local access to that store?? And now it’s both visually and ‘physically’ accessible through the internets (with their problems as well). In that sense, I do think it’s great - but the trade-off is the exacerbation of fast fashion with trends cycling through and consumed at lightning speed.	labels:Wow this takes me back to the first time I went to an Urban Outfitters! Still have the graphic shirt I bought from there, now with holes and no print left on the front. Hell, even Forever21 was a brand that was intriguing to the girls in my hometown because you had to have the money and time to be able to drive two hours to the mall!	episode_done:True
text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:Was just pondering this the other day, I have always had hand me downs and thrift store finds and other bonus items as my wardrobe. I still have people comment on my style and saying I'm stylish, but fashion and brand choices aren't an option. I make what I can get my hands on work. I hardly ever get rid of anything just in case it will work well with something I get in the future. I wear a lot of more outlandish stuff simply because people would notice how shitty my clothes are if I was trying to dress like everyone else. I'll often get an item of clothing or a pair of shoes as a big birthday present, but anything over £100 is out of my league. Even if I could save it up, there's no way I can justify spending that much of my budget on shiny clothes, especially since there's hardly ever anywhere to wear them!	episode_done:True
text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:It's interesting for me to read other people's dislike of thrift clothes, and based on their stories I can see why. For me, thrift has been a different experience. When I was in middle school I hated it and unless it was Gap or something like that and you could not tell it was thrift AT ALL I'd refuse to wear what my mom got from a thrift store. I didn't really fit in with most of my peers. Not necessarily because of money, but mostly because I grew up kind of sheltered and then we moved to the DC area. I was suddenly teased because I liked to read and didn't wear Adidas or whatever. So for a long time I tried to fit in through clothes but it still never worked. I still didn't fit in. And I could never quite get the clothes right.  But as I got older I started wanting to differentiate myself from the other upper middle class kids I lived with (we weren't rich by any means but the DC area is an expensive place to live so I was privileged, even if it didn't feel like we had a lot). Thrift clothes were a way to do that that I could afford. Instead of wearing Abercrombie like all the other kids, which we couldn't really afford anyway, I chose to wear old men trousers and sweaters and weird T shirts from thrift shops. So thrift shopping became part of the control I had over my clothes in ways I didn't otherwise have. My "weird" choices were now *my* choice, rather than something I did because I couldn't afford anything else. And even if people thought it was weird that I wore ballet slippers and long wool skirts, it was a style I chose and honestly, I still am impressed by my teen style... sometimes. I like that I went for it and didn't care about how others perceived it.  I still think of thrift that way. And I've found stuff there that is unique and higher quality than I'd feel comfortable spending otherwise. I can experiment without feeling anxiety about how much I spend. And I really can't stand fast fashion, so there's that too.	episode_done:True
text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:To put it bluntly, 100% privilege plays a role in the way people dress because there is increased access to options (including natural fibres, so called “sustainable” clothing, tailoring, etc) that are completely inaccessible for the majority of others.	episode_done:False
text:100% on privilege. Over the past few years, I’ve slowly transitioned much of my wardrobe to natural fiber clothing (with the exception of athletic wear - but now there’s recycled options at least!). And I know it’s a privilege to do so, now that I’m further in my career. A $300 slow fashion, locally produced w/ fair wage, pasture raised wool sweater simply isn’t accessible for most.

This is why as problematic as Everlane is as a brand, I won’t judge someone for buying a much more affordable wool cardigan there instead of from babaa, if it better fits their financial needs.  However, trends are for sure more physically accessible now than before with e-commerce and social media, for better or for worse. It’s interesting - I’m in my early 30s, so our generation was in jr high / high school just as e-commerce was starting. We were one of the first Facebook user cohorts. I grew up in a sleepy suburb that was ~2 hours from a large city. We had an OK mall, Macy’s was our fanciest department store. Whenever a girl wore something from Nordstrom’s, everyone oohed and ahhed because not only was it more expensive, but you had to be fairly privileged to travel to the city to go shopping.   I still remember our family visiting my older brother in another major city, and he took me to an Urban Outfitters store for the first time. I thought all the clothes were _so cool_ and how awesome that the people had local access to that store??

In that sense, I do think it’s great - but the trade-off is the exacerbation of fast fashion with trends cycling through and consumed at lightning speed.	labels:I lived in South Carolina in high school.

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:I have always been pretty comfortably middle class, but yes lack of physical access has changed my attitudes to shopping at least.   I grew up on a super remote island, and literally the only place to buy "new" clothes was the thrift store, so everyone was walking around in each other's clothes. I never associated second hand clothing with poverty until I moved to the city, so I still have an attitude of "I don't want this dress anymore, but it would look great on my friend so I'll offer it to her" which some people find very weird.   The lack of access to shops has also affected my attitude to shopping. I can't fathom shopping as a past time or getting much enjoyment out of the act of shopping. Clothes shopping (besides the thrift shop) was something we did on one day a year as part of our annual holiday off the island. Mum would drag us around hundreds of shops, trying on clothes and shoes and it was exhausting and high stress and built so many terrible memories that I now hate clothes shopping with a passion.	episode_done:True

text:Yes I agree with that - workplaces are getting more casual but any midriff skin is really a big no-no still. You really can’t have ANY midriff skin showing. If you love the overall shape you could wear a cami underneath so instead of a strip of skin you have a strip of cami.  I agree with the general advice to just wear boring things for a few weeks/months while you’re new and getting a feel for the overall vibe. There will almost certainly be a way to dress more interestingly and have fun with it, but there will be “ok” and “not ok” ways of doing that and you’ll need a bit of time to figure out what they are. A few months of dressing boringly isn’t a big deal in the scheme of things.	labels:Agree with this. I wear a lot of cropped shirts and cardigans, but it’s usually with a tank top or wife beater tucked into high waist slacks.	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:start off your job dressing in line with the majority of the company, especially when you go back in person. during that time, strengthen your in-person connections with your coworkers and make yourself as indispensable at your job as you can. you'll also get to observe how people *actually* dress in the office as opposed to having mostly people's zoom outfits and the HR dress code to go off of.   once you have that strong foundation from both a performance standpoint and a team dynamics standpoint, then over time start integrating your typical style into your work style. pay attention to people's reactions to it, both direct and indirect, and scale back or plunge ahead accordingly.   this worked well for me and my style is pretty off the wall. it took about a year for me to feel secure enough in my role and on my team to wear renditions of "my style" to work all the time, and then an additional year to make the more 'permanent' choice to color my hair (i chose to also check with HR before i did this!). i also personally find that the overall aesthetic is what's most important to me, so the "just wear bizcaz but with fun earrings and socks" sort of advice that many people exchange on ffa is not relevant	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels: I don’t know that I have a unique style, but I remember my first office job where I could wear something more than the company assigned uniform. I was super excited too!    I would hold off on your shopping spree until you work in office for a bit. That way you can make sure what you buy not only incorporates your style, but is also something you feel comfortable wearing in an office setting.   I tend to work with an older, more conservative crowd but I am having a hard time picturing wearing crop tops in an office setting, maybe I am completely wrong, but I think you want to get the feel for working there (and how much effort you are realistically going to put into dressing up each day!) before you spend a lot of $$!	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:When I’ve worked in places without much of a defined dress code, I’ve used two criteria to choose my clothes: 1) what clothing will allow me to do my work comfortably and 2) how do I want my supervisor/coworkers to think about me. When I worked in dead-end jobs in industries that I eventually planned to leave, I definitely leaned hard into dressing in a way that made me feel sexy because I wasn’t worried about my coworkers’ perception of me affecting my career advancement. Now that I’m in a job I care about and in which my career advancement depends on my supervisors’ and clients’ perception of me as competent, intelligent, and professional, I hew much more professional in my dress. Nonetheless, I express myself/my style by wearing a lot of skirts and dresses(usually knee-length) because I feel sexier in skirts and dresses than trousers. I wear stilettos most days and I try to choose blouses with a v-neck or a bateau neckline. I would characterize the gestalt as professional but youthful.   Since you are going to be one of the younger employees at your new job, I would recommend leaning more professional in your dress, especially during the first few months when people are getting to know you. Once people are confident in your abilities and your capacity to be a team player, then you can relax a little and incorporate more fun pieces into your work dress	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:I have worked in casual places for the last few jobs now, and my motto is dress up but add one casual thing to dress it down or only have one dressy element per outfit.  That might mean wearing some sneakers with your fave dress. Wear your fancy skirt with a t-shirt or sweatshirt instead of a blouse. If you want to wear a blazer - make it a fun color, fun pattern, or softer less structured fabric. You wear your fancy trousers with a graphic tee and a jean jacket/leather jacket/chore jacket. You wear some vintage wash mom jeans with a t-shirt/boxy sweater and heels (or fancy boots).  This gives you one foot in casual, but gives you space to wear your favorites. And you do not feel ridiculously overdresses when your peers are wearing leggings and flannel shirts.  You also learn to go with it, and everyone thinks you are a dress up person.  These are my tips as a dressy person who works in casual Bay Area tech land.  And I'll chime in on the no crop tops if skin is visible! Not appropriate (although I know dress codes are loosening and people are doing it.... but it is a bad idea!).	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:I used to work in an environment that was super casual. Because we had no dealings with the public, we could wear hoodies and sweatpants to work if we wanted to. I just wore whatever I wanted to. Some days that was jeans and a comfy shirt, other days it was heeled booties with a dressy blouse and vest. The only thing I kept in mind was what job I'd be doing that day. I floated around different departments, so I'd dress nicer on days I'd be mostly sitting, and I dressed more casual on days I'd be doing hard work in the shipping area. Other than that, I dressed however I wanted. I didn't mind standing out because I was dressed better than everyone else. I was also the youngest person there (I was 19, looking more like 14) so I figured people were already judging me for that, so might as well add judging me for dressing way better than they did in there. I did a good job and my work spoke for itself, so I didn't notice any real negative effects from my fashion choices. A few grumpy people probably thought I was some bougie millennial, but they were so miserable I'm sure they hate everything anyway.  &#x200B;  Edit: I also want to add that I agree with everyone else that crop tops are never appropriate for the office, no matter how casual the environment is.	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:I would suggesting even wearing a more business causal version of your current style and then fine tuning it from there. You always want to look nice on your first day/week and rather be over dress than underdress.   I also feel like if you set the bar too low, when you do start dressing up it becomes more noticeable than when you start dressing down. In experience people are less likely to point out how causal you look but the will point out when you dress up. It's not usually ill-will, more like oh do you have a special event or whatever later?   We have a pretty casual office and we have a lot of people in varying function and formality. We have a lot of jeans and tees, but we also have people in button downs&slacks, dresses and heels, etc. Also literally, we had a guy on campus that wore a wizard hat all the time. At the end of the day, no one really cares.	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:You’re clothes don’t sound less business like than anyone else’s just more dressed up and like you’re more interested in fashion. To me that’s the only thing that may make them take you less seriously, they may think that because you put effort into your outfits you’re shallow or superficial etc. So otherwise as long as you don’t mind standing out I’d wear what you want to wear. (Minus the crop tops like people have mentioned). I’m always overdressed and I don’t think it’s negatively affected me at work.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:First, I do have some questions for you:    Which kind of items would you like to wear?   What style would you like to go towards? (I can't get much information from jeans and basic t-shirt)   Do you have a small waist? (this question goes towards if pants/jeans that fit you in the butt and thighs have a wide gap at the waist)   Are your legs "too long" for normal-sized bottoms? (regarding if you need tall sizes for jeans)   With your chest and shoulders, do you often have the issue that you need to size up to have correct shoulder hems but then the clothing item will be too wide in the chest/belly area?  Once you answer, I can give you some suggestions.	episode_done:False
text:Oh, and the country you're in would be helpful too, to suggest some stores.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:Clothing doesn’t fit most people off the rack.  Each brand has a fit model and proportions in mind that likely do not match you.  Clothes should fit you. You shouldn’t need to mold yourself to fit them. So with that in mind - find ways and places to get the fit adjusted to suit you.   1. The way if fits off the rack isn’t the end all of the fit journey - tailoring is your friend. Many things can be adjusted to fit you and your proportions  2. Figure out what you want to accentuate and deaccentuate.  This will guide you on to shapes to start with as a base.  3. Some brands will be a lot closer to fitting you than others.  And one brand that works for pants might be terrible for shirts and vice versa. Trial and error is important.  4. Find a body twin to get inspiration from.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:I sometimes YouTube people with my similar size and watch reviews on certain clothing/items before I purchase them. I think it would help to find fashionistas with your similar body/taste to start.  Taking measurements is also really helpful!!! I bought a dress online for the first time using measurements and I was very happy with how well the dress fit. It's soooo much more accurate than just going off small/medium/large sizes.  I also want to add that, at least for me, my clothing and fashion sense was *extremely* awkward (and at times unflattering) at 21. It's a bit of a strange age because you're transitioning from being a teenager to being a "young adult". The way you express your identity can change radically from teenage to young adulthood to adulthood. So I guess I bring this up to say that it is totally normal to be frustrated with your clothing at this age. People on social media will typically post themselves looking their best; please know that they too have days where their outfit doesn't look right, where they feel insecure. Fashion is ultimately a never ending process of learning and expressing one's identity as we age and grow.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:I’m also 5’8” and pear shaped! Old navy tall sizes are cheap and decent for the price. I’m the same height so it’s that awkward “not quite tall enough to justify going to specialty online only sizes” but it really helps with finding shirts that cover your torso easily or jeans that fit better. You need more material to cover longer limbs. And don’t be afraid to get a tape measure and figure out inches to buy the right size in a particular brand. A bruised ego is better than a lifetime of ill fitting clothes.  Also learn to accept wide shoulders and other large frame bone structure things. I lost a lot of weight recently and just for fun tried to fit into a size six blazer. Nope felt like Chris Farley “fat man in a little coat.” Even at a thinner weight, gotta wear a size ten blazer at least to cover my shoulders. My feet are size ten at my thinnest. Accepting that has made life easier  and honestly height has a lot of advantages like being able to gain ten pounds without a big difference in appearance  or eat more calories from day to day.  Try to dress around the parts you like the most, show some skin or neckline a bit (even a v neck is more flattering), show arms, dress in dark colors on the bottom. Dresses look good on most body types even if it’s out of your comfort zone, I actually recommend Jersey or sweater dresses or something that stretches. Might be the easiest way to get a good fit without shelling out money on a tailor.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:I’m an inch shorter than you and weight the exact same and I’d also describe myself as pear shaped so I’m guessing we look similar. My main problems have always been pants due to my height and shape: they’re too tight in the thigh, too short, or if they are a good length and fit my thighs, the waist is baggy. A few tips I’ve picked up at 24: You are now an adult, with an adults body so clothes from shops geared towards teens are going to fit weird. This is because they weren’t designed for your body not because your body is weird. (Young teens who shop there are often still in children’s sizes or are just barely out of them so the sizing is going to skew really small), if you are shopping there, don’t panic if you can’t fit into the size you think you are. The clothes are essentially made for kids.  At stores geared towards young adult women its easier to find pants that are labeled “curvy” which are not the same as “plus-sized.” it usually means the waist is cut smaller proportionally to the hip/thigh area, which is what you’re going to want to look for.  Look for pants that have longer inseams. Sometimes this will be labeled as “tall” I did not think i was tall enough to buy “tall” pants but pants that are meant to hit at the ankle always hit at my mid calf. Sometimes they are a little long but i think cuffed pants are cute so idc.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:Other people have covered the main points- find fashion bloggers or icons that look like you; buy from companies where people post reviews with pictures, so you can see how it looks on someone with a similar body type; don't be intimidated to go to a tailor, or tailor your own clothes (youtube has plenty of tutorials on how to do basic alterations!).  Please don't take this as intending to trivialize your struggles, but rather an effort to offer some validation: off the rack clothes don't really fit *most* people well. I have friends of all different body types and sizes, and we *all* struggle to find clothes that work for us off the rack. So please know that you're not having trouble because your body is somehow uniquely unsuitable for clothes. It's because, quite frankly, *most* clothing is badly cut and designed. Most clothing sucks. Clothing manufacturers, especially since the 2008 recessions (i.e. most of your life), have been making clothing that just gets weirder and boxier and less flattering with every passing year. It's almost impossible to find things that fit anyone (in the sense of being flattering), because they are made to fit everyone (in the sense of doing the bare minimum of technically covering the body). Instead of manufacturing clothes to fit a human body, with all its curves and variations, it's *way* cheaper and easier to sew a couple rectangles together and call it a shirt. And we don't really have better options, so we buy it, so they keep making it. And it may feel like other people don't struggle with this, but you're not seeing them in the dressing rooms or looking through their closets in the morning. You're seeing them out and about, or on social media, where everything is carefully clipped and styled, staged to look perfect and effortless.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:The question I will pose is: Are you dressing with your shape or are you dressing against it?  The reason I ask is because when I was younger, I soooo badly wanted to dress in a style that was more suited to completely different body shape. I bought clothes that didn’t fit right trying to make myself look like a different shape and obviously it didn’t work. It also made me feel like a failure and that my features were undesirable. When I stopped fighting my shape, I found more clothes that fit better and made me feel more confident.     But they only fit better, so I have my clothes altered to fit correctly or alter them myself. I mostly buy secondhand and go for things that are high quality, so that alterations are a possibility and worthwhile. It’s much easier to make something smaller than to let it out.	episode_done:True

But have an expert listen to you and find things that are flattering for your body type. In fact, I’d suggest trying this with two stylists so you get different perspectives. If you still find fault with how you look in those clothes, perhaps you’re being too hard on yourself and your appearance. Good luck.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:The clothing examples will be dated because the book was published in the early 2000s, but Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine’s “What Not To Wear” talks about similar body types—minus broad shoulders and long legs. I’m short and have a different body type, so I won’t be much help here, but checking out Trinny and Susannah’s book might be helpful to get ideas of general clothing cuts that might work for you.

I do this in the summer too (on summer bra days, which with boob sweat there are not many). when I buy a new bra, I typically get 2-3 coordinating panties in different styles so I have some options, and then put them together under all my clothes. I swear there's a posture change when I'm wearing ratty underclothes vs nice ones. even if no one sees it, I know it's there.	episode_done:False
text:Second this. Pretty sleep clothes also. I've been wearing ripped leggings, non matching underwear, an old shirt, and not shaving for months now and I feel terrible lol. I got a silky cami set earlier in the year and a chiffon one with long pants and felt so nice. Could get a little chilly, but a nice blanket helped. Even just taking care of yourself(hygiene,skin,keeping up old routines, exercise, etc) helps me during winter. Treat yourself like you're sexy and you'll feel it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do I feel sexy at home in winter?	labels:Find a matching set of lounge clothes of good quality, perhaps sweater material as opposed to sweatshirt/sweatpants. I just got one from UpWest, but you can google matching lounge sets and you’ll find a bunch. You can also get a cute long cardigan to throw over the matching set, and wear a nice pair of fluffy slippers (I like mini uggs or LLbean moccasins.   Do your hair and makeup, and wear perfume that reminds you of winter. You can also get a cute beanie that matches your set, Uniqlo has cashmere ones for $30.   Hope this helps!	episode_done:False

text:What’s the comfiest material you can put in a washing machine without fuss?	labels:Cotton would probably be the least fussy sweater material that still feels nice. Any wool/cashmere you would have to at least wash it on gentle and air dry. Acrylic and polyester is uncomfortable	episode_done:True
text:What’s the comfiest material you can put in a washing machine without fuss?	labels:I just got some insanely soft velvet leggings from Old Navy and they're machine washable.  &#x200B;  I machine wash a lot of things that say to hand wash only, but I make sure they're inside out and I only use cold water on all of my clothes.	episode_done:True
text:What’s the comfiest material you can put in a washing machine without fuss?	labels:Rayons. You can absolutely put them in the dryer, they're less prone to pilling than cotton and definitely much softer. If you do put them in the dryer, just use the lowest setting (which you should already be doing for all your clothing - high heat settings on washers and dryers should only be used for things like towels and sheets). Air drying is, obviously, less hard on *all* clothing and so you should opt for it whenever possible to extend the life of your clothing, but I wouldn't say it's *necessary* for rayons. They don't need to be dried flat, so a laundry rack or hanging them to dry in some other way is totally fine. I don't hand wash anything, either, tbh. I put delicates in a wash bag and wash all clothing in cold water on the delicate cycle, but that's about as far as I'm willing to go. I pretty much exclusively wear soft/smooth fabrics due to sensory issues, and that works well enough for me.	episode_done:True
text:What’s the comfiest material you can put in a washing machine without fuss?	labels:For an actual sweater, cotton but I don’t find cotton all that comfortable (the soft ones are thin and don’t keep me warm, and the warm ones are really heavy and knobbly (they leave indents in my elbows when I’m sitting at a desk because of the texture idk this is just my experience tho)  There are washable wools now so you could look into those too.	episode_done:True
text:What’s the comfiest material you can put in a washing machine without fuss?	labels:I love Supima or Pima cotton and modal. Preferably a blend of both! It's the smoothest soft knit blend. You can get tees made out of this fabric at L.l. Bean, Lands' End, etc.	episode_done:True
text:What’s the comfiest material you can put in a washing machine without fuss?	labels:Responding so I can follow this.

My mom dries her cashmere sweaters on medium heat and has never had any issues either	episode_done:True
text:What’s the comfiest material you can put in a washing machine without fuss?	labels:Columbia makes super soft and cozy 100% cotton knit sweaters that are machine-washable.   I actually find my merino sweaters faster to hand wash. I use Eucalan, which doesn’t require rinsing. Soak them in the sink with Eucalan for a half hour, wring out, roll in a towel to take downstairs to the drying rack, dry flat. It takes the same amount of time as finding the mesh delicates bags, washing on delicate, being nervous that I’ve ruined them, and drying flat.	episode_done:True

text:What are novelty leather keyrings/keychains for? How do you use them?	labels:I have just three keys but a huge everyday bag, so I bought a big keychain just so that I can find my keys easier. I know some friends of mine use those keychains to match their keys to their bag/outfit, or to create a difference between different sets of keys. Other than those three reasons, I wouldn’t know why people need key chains.	episode_done:True
text:What are novelty leather keyrings/keychains for? How do you use them?	labels:I’m gonna be frank: they are unnecessary junk that companies manufacture to get the consumer to spend money.   But beauty and decor has its value in this world and people buy it for decorating their bags and to show a bit of personality. Maybe some people use it. To each their own!	episode_done:False

No. Does it make me happy? Yes. I have 2 keys on it. My first keychain was one shaped like an ear. I unleashed a beast after that.   I have some that I attach to my bags every so often and I like switching them out! Or add one or two to my lanyard. I say If you find one that’s a reasonable price that brings you joy, use it wherever you want. Even clip it to your wallet zipper. I use them more as charms than as keychains at this point basically.	episode_done:True
text:What are novelty leather keyrings/keychains for? How do you use them?	labels:When I was younger I used to put multiple decorative key rings with my keys.

text:What are novelty leather keyrings/keychains for? How do you use them?	labels:Just a PSA for anyone who keeps them on the same key ring as your car key.   My locksmith gather told me that heavy key rings or chains or lots and lots of keys attached to a key you put in your car ignition causes the ignition to wear out quicker and require replacement.  Not a problem in the push button cars these days but something to think about if you regularly drive a car that isn't.	episode_done:True

text:What are novelty leather keyrings/keychains for? How do you use them?	labels:Mostly, they're a money grab - cheap enough that people will buy them for their cute or aesthetic factors without the qualms that might go into dropping money on a purse or coat.    That being said, I have a pretty hefty key chain, so I keep quite a few keychains on it (all of them are sentimental or associate with specific friends/family)  and I like using sturdier ones for distinguishing my luggage.	episode_done:True
text:What are novelty leather keyrings/keychains for? How do you use them?	labels:I believe that they are used so you can have an easier time finding your keys as well as just a decoration.   I don't personally use them because I like to minimize the amount of space my items take up, but I can imagine it being relatively hard to find keys in a large tote unless you have a lot of little thingos hanging off of them, or you attach them to some kind of long string, hook, etc or keep them on a lanyard like you said.	episode_done:True
text:What are novelty leather keyrings/keychains for? How do you use them?	labels:I use them because I lose my keys in my bag. Or we have spare keys that get tossed in a drawer and it’s easier to find them with a big key chain. Also, I have cute charms on my backpack zippers because I have trouble keeping straight which zippers go to which pocket. Charms help.	episode_done:True

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.	episode_done:False

My hair was down to my bra line and all the ladies stopped hitting on me.   I kept telling myself after every date with a guy that my next relationship was finally going to be a woman, but only guys ever seemed to hit on me :(   I’m still not sure how I should have dressed in 2005 to attract the ladies but it definitely wasn’t what I was doing.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight.

I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.	episode_done:False

text:Evidently, I present as “an upper middle class lesbian” (quote stolen from a FFAer). I’m not but whatever. Assume away. Clothing style is a combo of conservative/traditional New England/androgynous except for shoes ;-)  Pros: Was never sexually harassed at work. Also, lesbians were treated very well *in my division* of the aerospace corporation I worked at (more than a few in mgmt). Suspect there was some “honorary man” caca going on but it certainly benefited other women that did not behave/present traditionally.   Cons: None that I noticed but I’m pretty clueless.

text:What’s something you wish you could tell clothing manufacturers to do differently?	labels:More jackets with inside pockets.  More raglan sleeves and fewer drop-shoulder sleeves. I prefer a regular shoulder seam, but I think a raglan sleeve looks better than drop sleeves while also making for a more forgiving fit than a regular seam.  This isn't really a manufacturing issue but I wish they'd just size men's and women's shoes the same in the US--an 8 should be a certain number of in/cm rather than changing with the shoe's "gender."  I saw a couple comments about more elastic in clothing and I think this is actually way more common than it was 10-15 years ago because of the effect of the athleisure trend (and it's probably cheaper). It used to be that elastic waists were common in clothing marketed toward older women, plus size women, and young children, but they weren't standard and it was supposed to be embarrassing if you wore elastic-waist pants.	episode_done:False
text:I agree with you about everything except the sleeves, I personally would like to throw all raglan sleeves into a fire, and love a dropped sleeve. It’s all preference of course, I swam and rowed for years and have massive shoulders and am very self conscious about how raglans emphasize my shoulders.   Ditto on the elastic! I bought some fancy selvage (ie no stretch whatsoever) jeans and I a) can barely sit in them and b) cannot for the life of me fathom how I wore jeans prior to them containing spandex/elastin or some variety of stretch- I did, but I don’t know how.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your coziest winter finds/essentials?	labels:This year I've finally come to the realization that I can layer all the sweaters I want, I'm still going to feel cold if my legs are cold. So I got merino wool tights from Icebreaker (the 260 weight) to layer when I'm outdoors, as well as a couple of pairs of cheap "fur-lined" leggings for lounging at home (purchased from whatever Instagram brand advertised them to me first, I'm ashamed to admit). The wool tights are great of course, as expected, but the cheap leggings are a pleasant surprise!

text:What are your coziest winter finds/essentials?	labels:Definitely fleece-lined leggings/tights. I have a few in fun colours but also nude ones to wear under sheer tights to get that look but stay warm.  Waterproof lined, heeled boots (Ecco is great) are also a staple for me. If you can't tell, I like my skirts/dresses year-round so these two things keep me warm.	episode_done:True
text:What are your coziest winter finds/essentials?	labels:Carhartt overalls. I thought I might need snow pants for extra dog walks this year since I'm still working from home.

So far, I'm pretty dang cozy on daily walks and it can double mucking around clothes.	episode_done:True

text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:Planed obsolescence comes in to play. If the trend is over for the next season why make it last a year?  and adding to that is the cost of investment to change trends is higher for women with more possibilities with sizes and lot's of  inventory for each size. So the "Value"is in the changing for companys because it increases consumption but men don't have that.  For them if it falls apart or feels cheap they don't buy it and a shirt can last every season XD. So if it falls apart after a couple of months they are more likely to change brand for something of higher quality.  >>  >The lack of consumption and brand loyalty can lead to increase in quality with lack of differences and change cutting cost.	episode_done:True
text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:This makes me think of a conversation I had with my husband yesterday - he asked me (on my next run to the thrift store) to pick him up some track pants as his main pair have gotten a hole and it's too cold to run in shorts.  I told him he didn't want to wear thrift store track pants (I have spent many hours digging through the men's and women's sections in our local thrift stores for both of us).    Husband: why not?  Me: Let me put it this way.  Women tend to donate their clothes when they don't *want* them anymore. Men tend donate when they *can't* use them anymore.     Men's clothes don't change as much, and men tend to either wear them until they're ruined or they cannot use them (aka, they gain/lose weight, change jobs, have a spouse donate them, they move and can't store it etc).  So while you can still find good stuff if you really dig, there's way more staining, missing buttons, fading and wear on men's thrift clothes.      My usual score for husband at thrift stores is  (formerly) expensive cashmere and wool sweaters, and occasionally, high quality dress pants and shorts.  Nice jeans and regular shirts are hard to find, and this is probably related to the fact that others have pointed out - men can wear their clothes for 10+ years and still be moderately in style.    As for men's clothes that I wear - I never buy women's socks for work.  Always men's wool and cushioned socks.  Same with any kind of technical under layers for martial arts.  I like the women's designs better, but for some reason they assume the women have no boobs and I'll have 2-3 inches of stomach showing under a rash guard.  So I buy men's.	episode_done:True

text:Supply and demand is a lie, it's like saying evolution has a plan. Sometimes things just turn to shit. If there is no one competing with great quality for fair prices, mediocre shit will rise to the top.  Companies might be 60% right on what the customer want. But they jack prices to compensate so they are still doing well. Like H&M burn a ton of clothes, but are still doing well, because they will profit if they sell 1 item for every 2 they burn.  Companies know the customer wants a dress with pockets in high quality, and it would sell well. BUT the profit margin would be much better on a shitty item with money spent on marketing rather then quality.  Small companies might make the perfect item, but they will be more expensive because of the small volumes, and more sensitive to a bad year. And can't afford marketing.  Women will buy shit if shit's the only thing offered. Men will wear their old stuff rather then buy shit.  Uniqlo is murdering the Nordic market because they came in and offered the product "women didn't want" to a wider base then 16-30. And now both men and women of all ages are crowding the store will the ones that "know what the modern woman want" are having sale after sale. They really didn't think women wanted a cheap blue wool sweater rather then a flimsy transparent blouse.	labels:It’s still supply and demand, they’re just creating artificial demand for their product.

text:I also wonder if men tend to buy clothing staples, and clothes for women tend to be on trend. So, we get cheaply made fast fashion that has extra development costs.	labels:100% because it's pretty easy to sell women stuff if you make them feel bad about themselves. I've recently been actively avoiding fast-fashion and buying more high-quality stapes, I end up buying a lot of "unisex" clothes.	episode_done:True
text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:The fabric content and construction methods  selected for menswear tend to be more durable (wool, Tweed, twill, cotton/cotton blend, denim, tencil, natural and synthetic suiting). It is also considered feminine to buy a broader range of colors and lighter weight fabrics so most retailers don't get trendier colors and fabric weights when stocking menswear because they don't think it will sell. It's more to do with risk aversion and gender assumptions than planned obsolescence.   I did menswear design in school and now that I'm learning to sew for myself, it's very challenging. Women's garments have more variety, but the weight of many of the fabrics with better drape are pretty flimsy.	episode_done:True
text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:A lot of my basic items are mens ones, plain tshirts and polo shirts, pyjamas, I tend to buy mens hoodies (or even kids ones because I'm short) and mens sweatshirts too, if I can find them small enough.  I find the primark slim fit muscle tee's for men to be actually pretty good, as in not noticeably masculine when I wear them, but then again I'm not the girliest of girls either so I don't mind wearing mens clothes, or mens watches for that matter	episode_done:True
text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:men’s fashion is like a glacier- moving in one direction, not fluid, extremely slow moving- and women’s like an ocean, fast moving fads, extremely fluid, moving in all directions. Also men don’t go shopping as often, so if their clothes give out before they are due for another shopping trip, men will perceive the product’s quality to be bad. I feel like brands know these things and so they make what appeals to their consumers. They don’t need to sell women quality because most of their customers want to buy something new before the old wears out. Men don’t buy that way, I would imagine.	episode_done:True

Color scheme. What else feeds temptations? Trends and scared of not seeing it again. I would say if you love a piece immediately then buy it but don't take tag off. Try it out in real life first.  Also tastes change. Like I went from utility pants to wearing and liking tight jeans then back to wanting more room except I don't have any. So having an open minded/ wardrobe with pieces to take you out of comfort zone, not too far, wouldn't hurt.	episode_done:True
text:My incomplete guide for buying less in 2021	labels:I wanted to completely upgrade my wardrobe and I spend a lot of money on clothes this month. Even though there are still a few things left I want to buy, I want to spend less money and be more mindfully since I came to the realisation that there are always new clothes, styles and trends and you can't have them all. I am selling my old stuff I don't wear anymore to start fresh. I will also delete most of my shopping Apps and unsubsribe to newsletters because it is too tempting and make a list of things I **actually** want and need.	episode_done:True
text:My incomplete guide for buying less in 2021	labels:I cleaned out and organized my entire closet earlier this year. I sold what no longer fit and things I haven't worn in a while. I use the money I make from selling my old clothes to purchase new items. I put my entire capsule wardrobe onto a Powerpoint, so I can see what items I need or would like to add. Then, I shop around for the pieces I want and save them to my Shoptagr extension in Chrome. The extension keeps all my wishlist items in one place, and alerts me then they are discounted. This keeps me from impulse-buying just because something is on sale, since I know these are things I have been wanting for a while.  I also unsubscribed from all newsletters, but I follow the brands I like on a website called Milled, which is a search engine for email newsletters. It lets me follow all the brands I typically shop at, but because the newsletters don't go directly to my inbox, I'm not as tempted to purchase. It's also helpful to look back through the brand's emails, just to get a sense of their sale patterns.	episode_done:True

I save all the ones I really like, and if I’m instagram I will follow someone if their overall style is to my liking. Then I’ll go back through the ones I had liked and assess which outfits I can make immediately, and which ones require any extras that may or may not be added to my wish list.

You'd probably have to call periodically to check.  If it's something super hype, like the latest Supreme shirt, you're SOL and would have better luck buying it after-market at a higher price than retail.  Calling and having someone ship something to you from a store doesn't work for every company - Sephora won't do it and I don't think most fast fashion places will either. Your chances of getting a sold out item go up if you have an established relationship with a sales associate.	episode_done:False
text:I have some experience with this. when I worked at Macy's, our stock search was more accurate than the website. if you don't have a relationship with a specific associate, calling at an off-time (meaning not Friday night or Saturday, weekdays are a safe bet) is the way to go.   Banana Republic's website was more accurate than the stock search ~4 years ago, don't know if that's changed. they're willing to ship from a store, their infrastructure just isn't as good as a department store's. don't bother with Forever 21-type stores, but mall stores are worth a shot. I remember J. Crew being ok about this.  smaller stores/sites are generally good about this.

If it's something super hype, like the latest Supreme shirt, you're SOL and would have better luck buying it after-market at a higher price than retail.  Calling and having someone ship something to you from a store doesn't work for every company - Sephora won't do it and I don't think most fast fashion places will either. Your chances of getting a sold out item go up if you have an established relationship with a sales associate.	episode_done:False
text:I used to agree with this but Nordstrom has changed their algorithms and their site/app has much higher stock accuracy than it used to. And I can promise if it’s a final item in the company, the stock team is 99x more likely to locate it than a sales associate. The stock team needs to find a manager to sign off on a rejected order while a sales person answering the phone just needs to act like they checked (spoiler: they usually don’t).   Just check the app often, maybe multiple times a day, and place the order the second you see it.   Edit for clarity	labels:Used to work there and this isn’t true. Employees in store can check where items are and request other stores to ship it. They’ll typically try hard to do this too because they get commission off of it. There is the chance that the item can be denied if it’s only 1 in stock at another store, but they have a quota on denying items too, so they don’t want to do that often.   Try going into a store to see if they can find another store to ship it directly to you.	episode_done:False
text:Me too. I worked for Nordstrom for almost ten years, mostly as a DM but also in HR, and quit last winter when my role moved into more of a fulfillment focus. Managers have to do “blitzes” to clear DTC screens and if web-team cannot find an item, they will come find a DM or ADM to do a last check and sign off on the reject.   Therefor, when you have a web order for a last in company, a manager will have a hand in trying to find the item where as a salesperson calling another store is likely to reach another salesperson, who may or may not have any interest in searching for the item. As you know, only the salesperson placing the order gets commission — not the salesperson on the other end looking for the item. Plus, if it’s a recent return, it might be in inventory but not back to its home department; in that case web will have much better chances of finding it.  Now that last in company items will show up on the app/website (they used to only show up in store on merch search) I see no reason to call the store to bother people with locating your items. The salespeople honestly hate finding DTCs, and they’ve started to restrict the sort of credit information salespeople can take over the phone. In Los Angeles, you can’t pay over the phone for designer items any more unless your card is already on file with a store associate.  This is all new as of about 2 years ago, and piloted in the Los Angeles stores so depending on where you worked and how long ago, this may sound new, but I can promise you this is how it’s being done currently.  Edit: also going to clarify the “quota” on denying items. The store’s fulfillment rate (which they usually refer to in terms of inventory accuracy) has to be above something like 88% to allow in-store pickup and same day services; but when you are calling a salesperson for a Manual DTC before placing, the order is not yet on their screen and doesn’t count for or against their inventory accuracy.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:A few years ago, I had recently gotten a promotion and wanted to dress a bit fancier. I went a bit ham on Old Navy's pixie pants. I bought some really fun colours, mustard yellow, light pink, floral patterns, pastel blue, etc.   I used to style them primarily with black, dark, grey, white, chambray tops/blouses.  I grew bored of this phase and went back to blue jeans, but it was a fun experiment for the summer time! Especially when I didn't want to wear a dress, but still wanted to look fun but work appropriate.	episode_done:True
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:I used to have teal pants I wore all the time. I have been looking for pink, berry, or mustard yellow pants all year and I haven't found a pair yet. The only colored pant I have now, is a hot pink satin jogger. But haven't had a lot of chances to wear them as special occasion pants , I got them end of last year and wore them twice out and once at home.   In the teal pant era (this was a long time ago) I wore them with my myriad of black and white tops - this is one of my faves. And also color blocking! If I can recall, I wore them with chartreuse, yellow, and pastel blues and greens. And light grey.   I love color blocking and often have had colorful bottoms, I just mixed them with whatever colors I felt were complementary. I had a couple of cobalt blue skirts, and I think some pants as well. This color goes well with just about any bright. I wore these with pinks, greens, and yellows.   In my brain, mustard yellow is a neutral, so it goes with basically everything. Hot pink pants - this for me, in my wardrobe, works with other shades of pink, maybe burgundy, grey, and yellow. I do to have many other colors outside of these, so that is what I wear. I also like pink with greens.   I say pull out your color wheel and see which pairing you like. You do not need to be limited to neutrals.	episode_done:True
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:I’m the first to admit I have a pretty boring colour palette in my closet (I love it!) But I did try for a while as an exercise to make colourful capsule wardrobes where I could assemble 20 (digital) items and make 20 outfits. I had a lot of fun and really tried to go for colour. One thing I found was that you could have the wildest colours you want, so long as everything went together as a whole.   My suggestion for eg. Red pants would be the items in following categories: 1. Coordinating neutrals (like your white top) 2. Coordinating solids (eg a blush pink top, or a  mustardy colour if it’s more burgundy) 3. Coordinating prints (eg anything that has a bit of red in it to tie it all together) 4. Monochrome! Red on red!   Which category you choose in what quantity will depend on how bold your style is, but I think that with a little planning you could incorporate a colourful pant happily into your wardrobe!   Oh, edit to say: I have a teal pant that I really love. I wear it the following ways: 1. Coordinating neutrals: my wardrobe is black/white/silver so basically any black or white tops 2. Coordinating colours: again, don’t really have any but I do find it goes well with my silver camisole and shoes! 3. Coordinating prints: I used to have a white shirt with teal leaves all over it, match made in heaven! 4. Monochrome: with the matching teal blazer, or with a coordinating teal turtleneck under a different jacket!	episode_done:False
text:Definitely on board with prints - I have printed pants and lots of printed tops. I usually match a print of one with a plain color of another that pulls from one of the print colors. Of course, I have way too many shoes (boots, really) to match... getting dressed this way is really fun but takes a long time since I tend to have too many options compared to too few, lol	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:I have a pair of olive green pants and I used to have a pair of maroon ones that I loved and wore out. I also love plaid pants but only have one pair right now - white and black with a pale pink stripe.  Neutrals are always good with crazy color pants, but so are complimentary colors. Some combos I think would work:  Pink/Teal  Orange/Royal Blue  Purple/Mustard  &#x200B;  I wear my green pants with rose/blush a lot, and I also really like black and white pants that have a pattern on them. It's like the fun of wild colored pants without the commitment to a color.	episode_done:True
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ?

Just love them. Wear with any of the print colors or white	episode_done:True
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:While my wardrobe is fast turning as black as my soul, I’ve enjoyed two pairs of colorful pants: a pair of mustard cords, and a pair of salmon boyfriend chinos, both from Gap. I’m glad colorful pants exist! I’m heartbroken the mustard cords didn’t hold their color for more than a few years—now they’re just an odd yellow shade, like Charlotte Perkins Gilman picked out the shade—but in their prime I loved wearing them with Weejuns or midcalf boots, a chambray or blue plaid shirt or a lace cap-sleeve and denim jacket, a chunky necklace. Granted, this was the early/mid 2010s. I styled the salmon chinos about the same. Now, if I were to choose a pair, I’d go for a jewel-toned pair, perhaps Eileen Fisher lantern pants in that gorgeous red color, and pair with black. I’d pair a high-contrast pant with a high-contrast/clear top, and muted pants with a muted top.	episode_done:True
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:Earth tones are a BIG winner if you're trying to reach outside of the standard dark tones like Black/Blues. The next ring up from White is most definitely a CREAM/OFF-WHITE shade. Grab an assortment of camel/chestnut browns too. & then find some mute shades of Green (not emerald or teal), but more like green shade that are within range of a Matcha green color....and voila! The start of an awesome color range.	episode_done:True
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:I have beige/tan trousers. I style them with brown, or white, or black and white print, or grey. They can go with many neutrals.   I also have rust/brick color trousers that I normally style with other earth tones or white. I style them for both casual and business casual outfits.   Then I have two joggers from GAP that are yellow and also pink (as in Barbie pink)  and those go well with white or black and white stripe. These two colors are for casual outfits only.	episode_done:True

Sadly the Magenta ones don’t fit anymore. Also sad they are polyester because... they’re not warm for our winters but too hot for our summers so I rarely wore them.   I found even though the pants are bright I end up styling very neutral colours with the magenta pair - white, cream, camel so it balances out	episode_done:True

Even though the skirt is the statement and the colour should be overwhelming, it all comes together beautifully.  Also coloured tights :-)  Then the red skirt is similar - a stand out colour that is offset by the browns (love the boots - that's what drew my eye initially - I obviously have a boot problem :)  ) - and then you accent it with that goreous, contrasting green scarf.  I love Nicole Kidman's red/burgundy leather skirt and in the next picture in the series I find myself wanting the luxe skirt.	episode_done:False

And with the exception of walking a red carpet or a black tie (or higher) level of formality, I have something in my closet that could work for the occasion (wedding, political fundraiser, etc).

text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:Make it the new normal. Dress up all the time and then you will set a new normal of always looking fabulous. Of course then you might have the opposite problem of “are you ok?” when you’re not dressed up lol	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:The best advice I've ever heard about fashion was that (and I'm badly paraphrasing here) if you wear something more than once, it just becomes something you wear. If you wear a hat a couple times, you can be a "hat person". If you dress up often, you're a just person who dresses up.   It's cliché, but I feel like all about confidence. I have friends who like to dress up for all occasions, but nobody ever bats an eye because they just act as if their fully choreographed fit is a tshirt and jeans. People are almost never thinking about you as much as you think they are (you can google the "spotlight effect"). Also, I feel like wearing fun outfits around the house can help you get used to feeling "dressed up" in a casual environment, and is a good place to safely test-drive fun outfits.   I think there's a weird societal stigma against trying hard, which I think is so lame. It's cool to try hard if you want to try hard! I don't get why people feel the need to comment on how you're dressed. Honestly, I think that saying that it makes you happy is enough of a justification for being """"overdressed"""" (by their standards).   The last thing is think about all of those people you see dressed up on the street, where you think they look great, but you're too shy to say anything. When you're dressed up in a way that makes you feel good, the right people will notice, even if they don't say anything. The world is full of silent admirers!!	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:1) Be early when you're dressed up. People will assume you're late because you were getting dressed even if that's not true.  2) It might actually help to wear the clothes around the house. Even just for an hour or two on your day off then hang them up again in the closet 3) Do you love to look at dresses or wear them? I really like to look at high heels, but I just don't buy them because they make me uncomfortable. If the dresses are making you uncomfortable, then maybe they're not really "you." Maybe you just enjoy collecting them?	episode_done:False
text:This right here. Wearing it around the house until you forget you have it on is how I got over the fear of wearing dark lipsticks. Besides you get the feel of if you're actually comfortable or not.  Most importantly you understand if you're wearing it for yourself or others.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:I get it, I'm a nurse who is also an introvert who loves fashion/style. Its tough because we can't express ourselves at work, and I've also felt insecure about wearing my best clothes on the rare occasion I would go out (especially nowadays), and feeling like no occasion is good enough to wear my nicer or different clothes.   I still struggle with it, but my advice is to incorporate items slowly and consider how things can be dressed up or down. For example, I have some shorter skirts that might be a bit of a statement on their own, but I'll bust them out in winter with a sweater, scarf, and leggings and go grocery shopping. Simple and still casual. I do the same with shorter dresses. A nicer top and jeans is not over the top by any means. Try pairing a nicer pair of shoes with your jeans to dress down the shoes (and dress up the jeans i guess!)  As for asking why you're so dressed up, I don't see why people have to comment in that way, but I'm guessing they mean no harm. I typically get compliments from friends on my stuff but they also enjoy style, so if you hang out with people who aren't into it at all then they probably won't get it, or maybe they are interested and are in the same dilemma as you. Either way, the appropriate thing to do would be to compliment your skirt or top or whatever, not make you feel weird about it. I think "because I like it" is actually the best response. How can anyone argue with that? If you want to be petty you might say "oh, don't you like it?" and see how they respond, I'd actually be curious. The more you wear your nicer things the less you will be asked. Fake it till you make it! I've worn things out that I thought maybe was "too much", and people might stare but for all you know they are admiring your look, and occasionally I will get a compliment from strangers which is a great confidence boost.	episode_done:False
text:This is such great advice. Not only does it help one get more comfortable with dressing up, it's just good fashion sense.  The 'why are you dressed up comments' I think are a function of location. Where I am and the places I go I get way more compliments on my outfit than questions why I'm dressed up. I think it would be a bit more difficult if you live in an area where everyone is super casual. But hey, maybe you'll inspire others!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:> should I try to incorporate things one at a time or just muddle though the vaguely uncomfortable period of time until I feel comfortable?  Yes. Fake it till you make it. Wear one nice, "dressy" thing at a time until you feel comfortable enough to dress up in an entire outfit. Wear it around the house until you feel comfortable enough to wear it outside. I used to be a tomboy who lived in baggy t-shirts and jeans, and I remembered being so self-conscious the first time I wore a skirt and flats, but I just kept wearing them, and soon the feeling wore off - I got used to being dressed up, and people got used to seeing me dressed up, so nobody commented on it anymore.  &#x200B;  > what to say when people make the, "why are you all dressed up" comment  because, "I just felt like it" never seems to be good enough.   Why? That's a perfectly legit reason to me. You deserve to feel good about yourself.	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:Actually, this is a great time to address this. Once you come out of the pandemic, people will have somewhat forgotten what your normal is so you can set a new tone. Dress it up the first few times you see people and it will set the tone for a new normal. No one will even think it's weird because I bet everyone is sitting at home just wishing they would wear anything other than sweats. So, for the first couple of times at least, make sure you dress up. After that it'll be your normal. I kinda dealt with this too. I live in the bay area, the most people wear here are jeans and a tee. I hate it so will go with dresses and other things often and feel really overdressed. I realized that for me the best way to not feel weird about that was to dress down my shoes. So wearing ankle boots was the fanciest I would go with shoes and that was only on rare occasions. Most of the time I would pair sandals or sneakers with my outfits and look like I fit in again.	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:Try to see things from their perspective. *You* know that this is your real sense of style, and you have liked these clothes for a long time, but to your friends and family, you are a person that wears a t-shirt and jeans. So when you wear a skirt, that's very different and out of character for you. You just need to grind through the first few times, and then they will expect you to dress like that and they won't say anything.  And yes, "because I felt like it" is a good enough answer. Did someone tell you it wasn't? They're wrong.	episode_done:False

text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:I realised that I do this all the time.

text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:Own it! We have so few occasions these days to wear something nice, I’ve been overdressing to go to the post office! If someone asks, just tell them you’re wearing it because it’s what you wanted to wear! Or bc YOU like it? If someone says you’re overdressed maybe be like “no, you’re UNDERdressed, not you must be embarrassed.” Personal style is yours, for you! If you like it, own it, I’m sure you look great!	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:If you feel uncomfortable wearing a fancy blouse and skirt, try wearing a skirt with a sweater! I absolutely love that look. And to address the people asking "why are you dressing up?" Don't worry about it! Just answer honestly: "I really like this blouse! Or: "I love to look nice!" Many people really appreciate nice dressing. I'm still in school, and though I can appreciate a cute sweatpants fit I'd be ecstatic to see a nice skirt and cardi combo. Make it normal, and people will appreciate it!	episode_done:True
text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:I find that washing and drying my clothes gets them back in shape. Like if my jeans are feeling less snug because I've worn them 3 or 4 times, I wash them to get them back to the right fit that feels comfortable for me. It's the same with jumpers and tops. They get baggier with each wear and start to look sloppy on me.	episode_done:False

text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:I conceptually understand that I probably don't need to wash my clothes as often as I do as someone who lives in a temperate-cold climate, and studies from home, but I can't get over my childhood conditioning to wash clothes after almost every wear. My parents grew up in South East Asia, where you practically have to shower and change clothes twice a day, and that training runs deep. I probably wash T-shirts after 1 wear, gym clothes after 1 wear, bras every 1-2 wears, jeans/pants every 2-4 wears, and outerwear/sweaters less frequently (when I spill something, or every 3-4 weeks for my indoor home sweaters that get frequent wear). I am however very careful with how I wash clothes- always on cold, use appropriate detergents (euclean for wool/cashmere, soak for silk/other delicates, and unscented tide for everything else), and I try to air dry everything that I can. Clothing care is a big part of how I approach sustainability; my purchasing habits might not always be the most sustainable, but I try to take care of the items that I own well so that they last for me (and maybe even for a second owner). I also would prefer to wash clothes a touch too often than not often enough and end up smelling; I spent a year studying in Germany, and my host family was great, but I kind of felt like they didn't wash clothes as often as I would to prevent smells; natural fibers are not = deodorant, they still need to be washed. Now if I could only kick my dry shampoo habit....washing my hair is so much more work than laundry.	episode_done:True

text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:You all do a lot of laundry!  I only wash base layers (panties, socks, camis, undershirts, leggings, hosiery) regularly. Everything else I hang up on a garment rack to air out. I hit it with cheap vodka in a spray bottle to deodorize/sanitize. I learned that trick in costume class in college, much more skin safe than febreze. I use a steamer to get out the wrinkles and reshape. I recycle my old toothbrush brushes/cut up tshirt rags to spot clean with felsnaptha or oxi clean.  If you have good hygiene and aren’t sweating, there’s really no need to wash most things, especially with a washing machine. Clothing experiences a lot of friction while being agitated in the machine and that will wear your fibers out. I have shirts I bought at 16 that still look brand new and spot care preserves all my vintage/handmade pieces. The hang/vodka/steam combo is great for bras too, which should only be hand washed if they need to be thoroughly cleaned.	episode_done:True
text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:Same, I only spot wash when something has stains and machine wash if something smells, otherwise I'll keep wearing it even if it's been a long time since the last wash. One thing I do often though, is air clothes out, even if they don't smell, specially if it's clothes that touch my skin directly, like tshirts and tight fitting knits etc, these items might seem clean and free of smells but if left in the wardrobe for a long time, will start to smell, airing them extends the freshness.  The only exception is pants and socks, they are washed after every use.	episode_done:True
text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:Pretty much the same - I’ll wash t-shirts after every wear, for blouses if I’m only wearing them for a couple hours I’ll just hang them up again, if it’s all day I’ll wash after a wear. I wash my jeans every 5-8 wears same as other pants because all of mine bag out regardless. Sweaters I usually handwash every 1-2 years lol. Leather stuff I try to condition at least once a year (my favourite shoes get more love).   It helps a lot that I’m not very sweaty or smelly (confirmed by outside sources).	episode_done:True
text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:I sniff test everything (except underwear, which is one wear/wash) and I just purchased a wool sweater for the first time and I was *so suspicious* of the care instructions telling me not to wash it lol. I scoured the whole internet looking for something to tell me that this information was fake and that my suspicions were correct. After an overwhelming amount of evidence telling me I would have wasted $100 if I don't listen to people smarter than me, I begrudgingly made a deal with myself to give airing out only a try and I would wash it if it so much as had a hint of a stink.  Four months later and the sweater is going strong! That'll show me. In hindsight it makes sense that wool is water and scent wicking, because sheep have it "on" all the time, it was just a big adjustment for me since I had never really had natural fiber clothes before.	episode_done:True
text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:Underwear/socks/masks: 1 wear  Tee shirts/tanks/cotton tops/flannels: 1-3 wears, depending on sweat level  Blouses (silks, fragile rayons, etc): As infrequently as possible--basically if I spill or they smell  Sweaters: Similar to blouses, but I tend to do all of these in one big go (delicate cycle in garment bags with a gentle wool/cashmere detergent then lay flat to dry), so some get tossed in earlier   Dresses: pretty much never unless I spill   Jeans: once a month ish, or when I spill on them. Washing helps get them back to shape if they start to bag out too much, and eventually they will start to smell  Workout clothes: 1 wear  PJs: 3 ish wears   Jackets: rarely--fleeces, sweatshirts, really anything soft will be more often, but if it's anything heavier than that I just spot treat stains	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:I have an extensive jewelry wardrobe, I love it. It’s all fine - real gold, real diamonds, real gems, platinum, silver etc. I switch up jewelry daily (pre-covid when I actually went to the office and out of the house) including my wedding jewerly. I have my original diamond & platinum set, plus an eternity band in yellow gold that I wear when I’m wearing yellow gold jewelry and an emerald cut eternity band that I wear when I wear my emerald cut three stone right hand ring.   My birthstone is emerald so I have several pieces with this stone. My son’s birthstone is sapphire so I have both a blue sapphire ring and a yellow sapphire ring.   Casual jewelry is yellow gold usually - hoops in various sizes, bangles, gold chains & pendants, my Tiffany bold T ring in 18k is one of my fave pieces to wear for a minimalist look. I also like the Mejuri slim dome ring for this as well.  I do have pearls - a vintage strand that was my grandmother’s and I have matching pearl studs plus black pearl studs.   For earrings I mostly always wear hoops. I have yellow and white gold hoops in all sizes small to large and diamond hoops in mid size and large. I have one pair of 1.25 carat total studs that I never ever wear.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:My jewelry style is very simple so I tend to wear the same thing daily. I invested in solid gold necklaces and studs for this purpose. If I want to mix things up a bit with my earrings, I have purchased filled gold or at least gold plated. My plan is to see if I like the style and if I wear them enough before I invest in the solid gold versions of them. These days it seems like I purchase jewelry exclusively from Etsy!	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:Im 24 now, my entire life my grandmother has gifted me high quality pieces for important occasions in my life. A small silver, engraved, velvet lined jewelry holder when i was born, small 14kt studs when i got my ears pierced, small diamond earring for my 13th birthday, etc  As I got older and had my own money I decided to do it too. I hate fast fashion jewelry because it ruins so quickly and dont buy it, so i enjoy hunting for the perfect piece for each special occasion. Over time other family members have also gifted me nice pieces (new and heirloom) because my family knows how much I enjoy them.  Some of my own favorite pieces are vintage that i've bought at antique stores. I also buy gold filled or gold vermeil on etsy.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:Yes. After paying for cheaper jewelry most of my life and seeing it get ruined easily, I spurgled for my first Catbird piece. Now I have 3 necklaces, 2 pairs of earrings and 2 bracelets from them (and one from an artist they stock) that are so good. I can wear them all day and night, shower in them and still they look great. I only buy the gold pieces but it's been well worth the splurge and I intend on keeping them forever.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:I’m basically mostly interested in paying enough that a piece of jewelry I love doesn’t have the metallic coating peel off after a year. I’ve had so many pieces I loved the design of get ruined because they were cheap. So I look for sterling silver, solid gold or at least gold-filled but also stuff like brass that’s cheaper, and looks it, but at least doesn’t peel. I don’t like gold-plated or vermeil because it has a much thinner layer than gold fill.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:The only “fine” jewelry I own are my engagement and wedding rings. Everything else I own is basically costume jewelry-I’m a sucker for fun resin earrings. Part of it is my personal taste, the other is definitely affordability.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:I didn’t really start buying fine jewelry until my mid thirties and even then I don’t buy too much of it because it can get pretty expensive and while I love jewelry, I don’t have justification for buying it most of the time. 😬😅 I think the only real fine jewelry I bought for myself was some diamond stud earrings and engraved gold rings. Most of the fine jewelry I own is actually passed down or gifted to me. All my eclectic pieces I own are more along the lines of fashion/costume jewelry and purchases by myself for casual wear.  As for vendors I like, here are a few names I follow: Ochre Objects, Vrai, Caysie van Bebber (really expensive and I don’t own anything from her; I just like looking at her work, haha), Liesel Love, Aurora Designs, and Social Value (this one is great for affordable diamond jewelry).  For nice, eclectic pieces, I like Local Eclectic.  For old estate pieces, I follow ChelseagirlNYC, Zacharysjewelry, and Ivy & Rose.  Lastly I do like to look at Blue Nile. Sometimes they have good deals!	episode_done:False
text:Seconding Vrai and Oro. I got two gold necklaces from them a few years ago and am very happy with the quality and design. They do high quality dainty jewelry perfectly.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:Going for good materials is definitely the way forward if it's something I'd want to wear for years to come. I prefer solid gold or silver to plated pieces which will barely last a few months before coming off. However, if it's a fun fashion style I'm not adverse to cheaper options like gold filled or vermeil.  Same goes for stones - e.g. diamonds or pearls over CZ or plastic pearls.  There is a wide spectrum of 'real stuff' depending on your budget and brand preference. E.g. a Tiffany diamond is more expensive than a non branded one from Costco. A lesser quality diamond (based on the 4 C's) or lab diamond is cheaper. 14k gold is cheaper than 18k gold and sterling silver is cheaper than 14k gold...  Not sure if I'm still considered young anymore but I've certainly always enjoyed jewelry! Sterling silver is cheap to buy typically if you don't go for branded (Tiffany, David Yurman) - Etsy is a favourite. Plus second hand saves a lot. Gold is a lot cheaper in Asia if you buy non branded as the labour markup is a lot lower. Given the weight method of sales, solid gold earrings and rings are quite affordable as a result.   And cultured freshwater pearls are a lot cheaper than say Akoya pearls of AAA quality. When I was on holiday in Asia, it'd be common to pay £5 or something and pick some oysters that they'd open up and you get to keep all the little seed pearls they had inside  Typically there were quite a few! Goes to show how easy it is to farm them.  Overall, I think if you're savvy about how to shop and willing to compromise on quality, these items are all affordable.  I'd say have a browse for what you enjoy wearing and like the look of and go from there. Some people might enjoy a single classic item and save up and others have a wide range. I'd say pawnbrokers, eBay and Etsy are some of my favourite go-to places depending on what I'm looking for.	episode_done:False
text:This is the highest comment right now, so I just want to point out to other casual jewelry owners that fine jewelry holds value. It's highly unlikely that freshwater pearls you buy at retail are going to resell at a similar price, vs AAA Akoya pearls.  >Goes to show how easy it is to farm them  Farmed pearls aren't as valuable as natural pearls - similar to natural vs synthetic (aka lab) diamonds. The rarity of a natural pearl drives/retains its value.  >if you're savvy about how to shop and willing to compromise on quality, these items are all affordable.  This... really confuses me in a thread about investment grade jewelry. Store of value investments typically don't suddenly become more affordable; they aren't considered sound investments if this is the case. (There are exceptions, like copper, whose value is tied to demand for construction, but that's different than gems.) This statement is like trying to claim you can buy a blue chip stock on sale. Happens with recessions or a major event, but the majority of the time it can be counted on as a stable store of value.	labels:Fine jewelry really does not hold its value, I certainly wouldn't say (as a jeweler) that "the majority of the time it can be counted on as a stable store of value". Buying jewelry as an investment is like buying a car as an investment. You aren't going to get anywhere close to a full return on it unless it's a particularly rare or sought-after piece, which is the vast majority of cases. You might get what the materials are worth but that's going to be notably less than the retail value you paid. This is especially true for diamonds, which are relatively abundant and artificially marked up. Other gemstones like emerald, ruby, and sapphire hold their value better but even then, unless you have a truly remarkable one I wouldn't hold your breath about seeing a return on it.	episode_done:True

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I’m queer and get read as straight a lot, so clothing is a tool, albeit one I don’t always feel comfortable using.  The other thing for me is that I sometimes feel like my body is incompatible with queer fashion? I’m pretty fortunate to have a relatively “desirable” body, but I’m short and top-heavy, so I feel like the androgynous queer outfits I like are meant for people much more willowy than I am, the femme-er stuff is more feminine than I feel comfortable with, and the more masc stuff is too masc for me. So I default to just whatever I have that I like, which tends to read as straight, if not quite conventionally feminine and sort of sweater-heavy. And when I’ve leaned into what feels like queer fashion to me, other people tend not to read it that way.  Anyways this was kind of long but to actually answer your questions:  1) Yes I do, though at this point mostly in the form of jewelry and more recently hair 2) Sometimes it means signaling and sometimes it means wearing clothes that (joyously?)  reflect your authentic self even in defiance of cultural norms. I would probably be better off if I figured out which definition I want to define myself with  3) IMO sometimes the stereotypes are a way to signal because the media denies us representation and sometimes they exist because of the representation the media gives us. For people my age (20s) I think it’s more the latter  4) I always feel pressure to present gayer. I think impostor syndrome is common in minority groups and when the thing that makes you different isn’t immediately visible, it’s natural to want to either bury it or lean in and use it as a shield or a signal. I haven’t figured out what that means for me in practice, but the urge is there.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I just wear what I want and what I like the look of. I do admire queer fashion but it’s hard to tell what is queer or what is genz fashion. To me anything slightly alternative is queer or butch/shirts. The media has a lot of influence over all stereotypes but I think they are trying to move away from them. I’m not sure of my sexuality but if I do find I am queer I don’t think I would present in a way just to look queer.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:At some point I wanted others to know I'm gay from meeting me, so I got a pixie cut and called it good. It was a bad haircut, it didn't feel like "me", and guys still hit on me. I've gone through other time periods where others couldn't tell my sexuality from my appearance. This was something I was proud of, due to internalized homophobia. (But other queer women always knew. It's the vibe.)  Now, I'm more comfortable with myself and comfortable playing around with masc/femme in how I dress and present. I've made a few subtle changes with my clothes. But what has really made a difference is allowing myself to use more masculine mannerisms - the way I stand, the way I talk, the way I carry myself. In the past I've felt awkward in social settings despite being an extrovert, and I've recently realized this is mainly due to the dissonance between the gender role I'm expected to perform, and what's going on internally. By accepting my androgynous/masculine side, I've started to feel free of awkwardness.  To me, queer fashion is not one thing. There are many different queer and lesbian fashion styles. Just like straight people, we have different subcultures and styles within queerness. You got your art queers, your sporty queers, your co-op queers, your preppy queers. But there's often an element of playing with and mixing masculine and feminine and androgynous, both in the clothes and the way you wear them and the way you act.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:These are the two questions that interest me most, so:   *What does queer fashion mean to you?*    Queer fashion is whatever a person who identifies as Queer identifies as their way of approaching clothes/self expression.  I'm reminded of a Hannah Gadsby quote, where she talks about someone complaining there wasn't enough "lesbian content" in her comedy, to which her reply was "I was on the stage the whole time."  I feel like defining something as "Queer" can be a little...exclusionary, especially when it's used to exclude others. "Oh, you don't dress "gay". Well, ok.  *Bonus question for LGBTQIA+ folks - do you feel pressure to present a certain way based on wanting to signal to others or what the media has stereotyped a certain group to present like?*    Yes, but usually by other LGBTQIA+ folks. The rise of social media has been great because a lot of people feel more comfortable expressing their identities...but it seems like there's this assumed homogenity which has got even stronger (I'm not even that old, but predate social media by a good few years).  I am all for expressing identity! I love that LGBTQIA+ people feel they can do that!    But " are you ever gay if..." shit makes me tired.  Media has stereotyped us enough. Let's not do it to myself. Caveat: I could just be salty that I look bad in cuffed jeans :P	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:This is actually such an interesting topic. As a bisexual teenager i often fit the “fashion stereotypes” of a bisexual because I look extremely different everyday. I dress in a number of styles, some being more masculine and some more feminine. I use pinterest for all my outfit inspiration, i never really think about whether or not it’s “queer fashion”, I just kind of like what i like.  I will say i consistently feel pressured to dress a certain way. Because I dress in a number of styles I’ve realized the way you dress will tend to attract different kinds of people. For feminine women who like girls it’s hard to get attention from other women because most are going to assume that you’re straight.  Edit: Just letting everyone know because I think it’s funny. Ive recently noticed that i also walk differently depending on the way I dress. When i dress more masculine my walk is more relaxed, i have my hands in my pockets, and i slouch v.s. when i dress feminine i sway a bit when i walk and have good posture.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I’m queer and i have definitely felt like i had to dress more “queer”, even though i am still closeted. No one was pressuring me, but it was more like me just wanting to fit into that archetype, of the cool queer who dresses vaguely androgynously with the beanies, baseball caps and dad shirts (but i really do love a good buttonup). But ultimately, that isn’t me. I prefer more feminine (typically feminine, if you will) outfits. But I do aspire to own a pair of docs, wear rainbow clothes etc. I want to give off a “queer vibe” if anyone gets what i’m saying. If you know you know.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I'm a too femme to function lesbian and stereotypical queer fashion always leaves me feeling left out in the cold. I don't like how I look in flannel and doc martens. I really do like how I look in an embroidered satin maxi skirt.  Going back in time, I used to feel like I had only two options : butch or look straight. It was not a fun choice. Neither was right for me. I spent a lot of high school looking way more masculine than I really felt comfortable with. It was partway through college that I realized that I had a third choice. Perform the hell out of stereotypical feminity. Embrace the chiffon and satin but do it on my own terms.  I don't look exactly like your average straight woman these day. It's subtle but there's a difference. Well there's also the fact that I dress like I'm an escapee from a Victorian brothel. I play with feminity. I wear petticoats beneath skirts and dye my hair blue. It's not the same kind of feminitity as a the average straight lady. It's a conscious performance of femme and not an uncritical acceptance of gender norms. It works for me.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:Idk I believe clothes have no gender.

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I am a bi woman. And while I know it doesn’t hold true for most wlw, I am definitely the ‘femme’ one in the relationship. (Or I would be, if I wasn’t single.) So for me, I would feel the need to dress in a more feminine way. Not saying I would go all 50’s housewives in heels, but even if I wear jeans or dark colours, I would incorporate things like hair ribbons, makeup or even mannerisms to look more ‘feminine’ I guess.   I am aware that I am contributing to the idea that ‘someone in a wlw relationship must wear the pants and the other the skirt’, and I do feel a bit bad for that sometimes. But where I live, the most common wlw relationships (not that you see much of them because Asia), consist of a butch and a femme. I suppose this plays a hand in it.	episode_done:True

I also doubt that he knows his sports gear feature “chartreuse” and “teal.” His clothing color limitations are more gender-limited than word-limited.	episode_done:True

I think more so than language, culture and location would have a huge impact on the colours you wear. I grew up in a hugely colourful country and all levels of formality allow colourful clothes, but now I live in Canada and everyone wears black and blue and grey year-round, especially in winter, even casually.

text:Does your language affect how you wear colors?	labels:I read an article in scientific American forever ago that discussed the way some languages are structured to center the group or the space rather than the individual speaker the way English does, which can contribute massively to how a culture's values are learned (individual gratification vs acting on behalf of the group, consuming/hoarding natural resources vs conserving/cultivating them). In my amateur  assessment, I'd say language effects our fashion choices more in the realm of what we're dressing to communicate (personal wealth, individual perspective and creativity, respect for the natural environment, etc), and in the realm of how we consume fashion (desiring to have more or better than others in our community, desiring newness, desiring to leave a smaller environmental footprint, etc).	episode_done:True

He was telling me all about how in the 90s lithuania had an olympic team but they had no uniforms so the guy who makes the Grateful Dead tie dyed made the team their shirts, so I decided to look them up. Turns out they STILL make the shirts so I got him one. It's super very specific guy who likes 90s world sports.   Usually I make brownies and peanut butter cookies, and make all the guys their very own cookie plate. Goes over quite nice.	labels:I had a Liquid Blue shirt in the 90s with a sun on the front and a moon on the back that I wore CONSTANTLY!

text:Naked and Famous Raw Denim Review/Fit/Experience	labels:It's a bit pricey but one option is having jeans altered to fit. Either by a competent tailor who is willing to **alter from the inseam** (and preserve the selvedge outseam) or a speciality shop like Railcar Fine Goods that you can mail your jeans to. RFG lets you take in the waist by up to 2" and you can specify your preferred thigh, knee, opening, length down to the quarter inch. I'm a guy with meaningful waist and hip/seat divergence, though not nearly a 10" difference like many women, and have relied on RFG to fix some issues. There are other shops in the U.S./Canada that do similar and similarly good work. RFG also carries women's cuts.  Just want to note that with 100& cotton / non-stretch fabric, you won't be able to have a super narrow leg opening since it'll be impossible to put your legs through. Relatedly, it's not the same, but maybe you can get your raw denim fix in the form of a jacket?

text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:Hot take: nothing is really original anymore, and most everything has been done before or inspired by someone or something else. For the luxury brand to automatically claim ownership simply because it's *designer* is bullshit imo.  We all know that quality differences will be present. A $3k coat isn't going to be on the same level as a $100 one. If someone wants to spend the extra money, cool. If someone likes the look but wants polyester instead and can only spend a lot less, cool. If the designer coat is really that great, there will be a market for it. If tons of people are buying the knockoff and no one is springing for the expensive version... Well, maybe you misjudged your market or overpriced your item.  I don't have a problem with knockoffs because they appeal to different crowds. Not everyone can afford a multi-thousand dollar handbag. Why should a struggling single mom who likes the design of something be relegated to a plain black bag? If she finds a similar style at Kohl's, she should be allowed to buy and enjoy it. I feel holding designer items as being superior, and then looking down on knockoffs, is classist. End of.	episode_done:False
text:Agree 100%	labels:	episode_done:True
text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:Logos are *trademarked. Clothing designs are... a more grey area. Like, a v neck knit sweater can only be designed so many ways, you know? However there are some instances where parts of a design are copyrighted, like i think the red soles on Loubitons, which i cannot spell, are copyrighted/trademark. Prints and artwork are a whole other story.  There are a lot of factors and copyright and intellectual property law also differs from country to country - there is no international copyright law, just general agreements between specific countries.  I personally feel that knockoffs and replicas are different. Replicas are illegal as they are faking an item AND copying the logo. Knockoffs that just copy the design... not illegal, generally speaking. Ethical? Truly depends on the situation.  In your specific examples, yeah theyre probably inspired by Sezane but tbh theyre not really dupes, there are clear design differences in each example.	episode_done:False
text:I've watched a video on this and I think you're right.  Also, I think the argument is that a knock-off is not going to steal market share from the original. Those who want to and can afford a high end designer brand aren't going to buy a knock-off and those who do probably can't afford the original.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:I would't consider Sezane a paragon of originality at all. They are also copying someone.  Every season there is a grab bag of trends for people to interpret. This year we have big sleeves, chunky knits, and 70s office wear as the inspirations.   And each brand takes their spin, and washes it with their point of view. Sezane does its rendtiion in the classic, same for brands like J.Crew and Banana Republic. Madewell's version is a little hipster and boho takes on the same classics. Anthropogie is quirky femme takes on the trends. Gap would do the plainest version - yes to chunky knits but not super statement sleeves.  It is hard to deem a solid knit sweater as a knockoff, there are only so many versions you can make.	episode_done:False
text:Yeah Sezane didn't invent bodysuits and pom sweaters, they're all copying from somewhere else and EVERYONE is making these. I think it's bullshit that it's only ever cheap brands that get called out.  When Sezane sells rip-offs, it's "inspired" or "trendy" (but in a ~timeless~ rich person way ofc), when a cheaper store does it, it's a "blatant rip-off" and "stolen intellectual property"? Girl, please.	labels:Exactly.  I’ve seen both things a million times before.  But it’s overpriced so I guess it’s theirs?	episode_done:True
text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:You see this a ton in the world of lingerie, maybe even more so than clothing.  I think it’s impossible for a designer to truly say they own a design element, so dupes and items that have been inspired by other designs are fine by me. If design houses are often ‘inspired’ by smaller indie labels anyway. They bring to trend to mainstream, and it filters down.   I don’t think the example you mentioned would hurt Sezane. The knockoffs allow more people to wear the trend who couldn’t afford ‘the original’ and seeing the design become really popular and trendy would probably make more people want to purchase it. The people who tend to shop from sezane or other higher priced retailers aren’t likely to buy knockoffs because they want higher quality.   The one thing I think is wrong is people selling fakes, trying to pass it off as a genuine designer item. This could either be a high quality dupe of a high end designer, or cheap amazon listings using a photo of the garment they’re copying, when the reality is they’re selling you something much worse. Unfortunately this kind of thing is becoming rampant as if you can shut down one retailer, they just make a new amazon/Ali express store and start again.	episode_done:True
text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:>there is no world in which I will ever buy a 10k coat, so buying a cheaper dupe isn’t taking business away from anyone.   Yup. How it all plays out legally, of course, is its own issue. But luxury brands are not depending on my business and I never feel bad buying copycats (of the same style, that is. I wouldn’t purchase an article of clothing with a fake logo, for instance, but that’s me personally.)   I also find that fiercely anti-knockoff attitudes can become classist very easily. And the topic of ethics in this regard really gets to me, too. I don’t think it’s fair to criticize the ethics of consumers in a rigged economy.   (Not saying that OP suggested any of this, it just came to mind.)  EDIT: this was meant to be a reply to someone in the thread, but it’ll work	episode_done:True
text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:I think it has to do with how immediately recognizable something is as being a particular brand’s, like the ever famous red sole shoes. Most companies don’t really have these kinds of easily recognized traits (outside of trade marked logos), because putting an identifying feature on everything you make severely limits what you can produce.   Most clothes look like clothes, and could easily come from any brand, and those I don’t find a moral issue with. Especially since many designs we look at and associate with a certain brand are only because we saw it for them first/associate that brand with prestige and assume they must have come up with it first. In reality, most of them are using designs that have been around and circulating amongst all of fashion, and no one can really pin point where they came from first.   Like with your example, those are two incredibly basic designs I’ve seen around for years from many different brands. I wouldn’t even be comfortable saying the cheaper brand is copying the French brand for sure and not any number of other companies. Sure, it’s sometimes very obvious when someone is getting copied, like when a Kardashian wears anything and Fashion Nova is selling it’s version the next day. But most of the time designs are kind of free flowing.	episode_done:True
text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:I can say something about this from a EU design law (very very basic) point: In the EU, if you make your design public in any way, you have 3 years automatic protection. However, to prove that the other party is infringing, your design still has to meet the minimum requirements of design law, which means that it needs to be distinctive enough. To do this, you need to consider what else was around at the time the design came out.   For the low back body suit, I imagine theres plenty of low back body suits around, and it would be really difficult to prove that Sezane had something distinctive here.   With respect to the jumper, I think that the jumper itself is distinctive, but that VICI’s jumper is different enough (only single balls, balloon sleeves) that it would not infringe either.	episode_done:True
text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:I’m clueless as to what luxury brands even exist nowadays but when I was in high school my mom and I scored a bunch of fake Louis Vuitton bags at a tourist trap shopping center and I carried the shit out of them for four years of high school and got tons of compliments. Fond memories.	episode_done:True
text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:Most designs are not unique imo.  Designs and inspiration is a grey area.  There are some situations where I can see blatant copying but they’re pretty rare.  Like if a unique pattern on the fabric is copied or something.  I’m all for affordable options when it’s not plagiarism, I love fashion but it can be overpriced and elitist.  And accessibility for people who don’t want to spend ridiculous amounts on designer clothes is a plus to me, I know that’s controversial.  Honestly some of the most heinous and shameless theft of ideas often comes from big designers.  I don’t think that first top is even something original enough to be stolen.  It’s a v backless ribbed bodysuit, right?  Common, simple fabric/pattern.  The sweater is *slightly* more unique but imo just a few common trends put together.  And the other sweater doesn’t really look much like it imo.	episode_done:True

text:Winter staples?	labels:Depends how cold it gets, and how much time you plan to spend outside! I'm a city girl and a bit of an "indoor cat," so my main winter activities involve navigating public transit, dealing with puddles of slush, and an occasional walk on icy sidewalks. We don't plan to drive or live in a detached house any time soon, which cuts out a whole category of winter chores.  So for me, staples are long wool coats, wool turtlenecks, wool socks and shiny black rain boots or sturdy shearling lined Timberland boots. For extra warmth, I wrap a wool pashmina around my head and layer silk thermals under my clothes. Mittens annoy me so I usually just wear leather gloves or keep my hands in my pockets. I find this is the best compromise to stay warm without too much bulk or any technical garments. If the pavements are dry, I'll even switch to heeled leather boots.  I've walked up to 30 minutes at a time in weather around 10° Fahrenheit in an outfit like this, with the scarf pulled up over my nose and mouth. (The normalisation of face masks will make this even easier now.) But it would *absolutely not* be sufficient for extended time in temperatures below 0° Fahrenheit, winter sports, or even for things like shoveling snow or scraping a windshield. For that you'd want taller insulated boots and a proper down jacket.	episode_done:True
text:Winter staples?	labels:How cold of a winter are you expecting?   As another poster said, fleece-lined tights and leggings are great for layering. I love them under jeans or wool skirts.   Make sure you get more than one pair of boots, especially if it snows a lot. Nothing worse than putting damp boots back on because the snow was taller than the tops!   Get warm socks! Wool is great. Darn Tough is a good brand for keeping your feet warm. They also have a good guarantee so if they get damaged, send them back for a replacement. I love knee high socks because you can layer them under jeans or work pants and stay a little extra toasty.   My staples tend to be pullovers and sweaters (Patagonia, H&M, anything wool, fleece, or cashmere that I can get at the thrift shop), jeans, full-length wool skirts, scarves, beanies that go over my ears, joggers, and boots.   Also, get a variety of winter coats if you can afford it. Peacoat for the kind of cold and blustery days. Down jackets rated to negative temperatures for when the frigid ice and snow storms hit. A canvas lined jacket for shoveling and other dirty outdoor jobs that is easy to show in the wash. A nice full-length dress coat for work or nights out on the town.	episode_done:True

I'm not nearly as adventurous as I used to be, but I still try new things/pairings/outfits all the time.	episode_done:True
text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:1) The most foolproof way is to try on every combination of clothing possible. Especially the things that you’re like - there’s no way that will work. Because that’s how you discover new combinations. Or you’re like... well, that didn’t work but if the top were like slightly longer, it’d actually be amazing - and that’s a great way to build a shopping list of stuff that would work with what you already have.   2) Trying on clothes is actually a lot of work. If you’re lazy and would rather lie around instead (cough what do you mean, I’m not talking about myself at all), if you put all your clothes in a closet app (I use Stylebook) you can look at what’s in your closet on your phone and make up different combinations to try out later. This isn’t foolproof, you will need to still try them on irl to see if they actually work (although the more practice you get the better you’ll get at creating successful outfits). Actually getting all your clothes in a closet app is a whole lot of work to start tbh, but if you want to go that route I find it’s best to use as many stock photos as possible and don’t bother with background removal.   3) If you really want to be a geek and see everything in your closet laid out, do a visual wardrobe. People posted them occasionally a couple years ago so search the sub if you want to see examples - but you basically take a picture of yourself wearing every piece of clothing you own. This takes a long time but you have the advantage of being able to see what your clothes look like on you and I feel like that makes it easier to pick out good outfit combos, because at least to me, silhouette is so important. Also it’s kind of fun to see what types of clothes you gravitate towards and you can sometimes discover things like “I really need a bright yellow jacket, that would tie together so many of these outfits” or “I actually hate green so why do I own 24 green t-shirts???” that’s kind of hard to parse when all your clothes are tucked away in drawers and stuff.	episode_done:False

For that you can also "randomize" your outfits! Count how many tops and how many bottoms you have, then let something choose 2 numbers for you (Google has a random number generator when you search for "random number"). If you get, let's say, 8 and 3, take the 8th top and the 3rd bottom in you wardrobe, then try to make an outfit out of them by choosing a jacket, accessories, etc.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:The first step is knowing what you have - colors, shapes/silhouettes, patterns, etc. and what makes you feel comfortable. The best outfit means nothing if you're uncomfortable/self conscious in it.  A few tricks that have worked for me until I got more comfortable with my closet and could slowly evolve it and venture out:  \- Black or other neutrals are your friend. Pair with a pop of color or a fun pattern. This made breaking things down for me much easier.  \- Find complementary accessories. Statement bracelet, necklace, earrings, scarf, blazer. Whatever you like. Even adding this one element can tie things together.  \- Try different combos of what you have together. Figure out what you feel comfortable in and what shapes work together and what colors you actually like together. One concept that works for me is if I wear more fitted on the bottom, I put something a little looser on top or vice versa.  One thing that really helped me when I had to elevate my wardrobe game for work stuff was a trick I heard they teach associates at a fancy pants store. I don't know if this is actually true but I still found the concept helpful: every outfit should have 3-4 pieces. Skinny Jeans/camisole/cardigan/statement earrings- wham! Leggings/sweater/scarf. This has helped me when I'm staring at my closet with a sweater and jeans wondering if I can do something else to snazz it up.  If you're interested in working with color, I would suggest just browsing about color theory to see if there are some ideas there that may inspire you on things that may work together. Also figuring out what colors work with *your* skintone/hair/eyes is very helpful in narrowing things down.  **That was a long way of saying, try things out and observe the types of styles/outfits you like, what works for your own lifestyle/needs, and just have fun with it!**	episode_done:True
text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:I'd suggest rotating your wardrobe. Every day, pick a different item that you haven't worn before and try to style it. This helps me to see the holes in my wardrobe and I get more practice matching things together too. I try not to wear the same things too often- after all I paid for those things sitting in the back of my wardrobe so I want to wear them lol	episode_done:True
text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:Instagram!  Seriously, it's the best place to go to for style challenges, and even if you don't want to participate publicly, you can do it just for yourself, and also great for getting a ton of styling ideas and figuring out what you like in general.  As for developing an eye... exposure to a ton of different styles is pretty helpful; it helps you develop your preferences.	episode_done:True
text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:1. Start slow! Save images that inspire you- whether it be print/ social media or random photos on the internet.  2. Take these images and see if there are any elements of your wardrobe that work. Eg the image shows a woman in a black turtleneck and a plaid skirt. You have a cream turtleneck But don’t have a plaid skirt. You do however a a similar style skirt in navy.  3. If I pick what to wear every morning I would always gravitate to the same items. I spend at least half an hour every Sunday figuring out my Monday- Friday outfits. This gives me time to experiment and try on new combinations. Sometimes things will work in my head don’t work in person and that’s okay! It also means that I can make sure I have the right underwear/ tights etc so I don’t panic in the morning.	episode_done:True
text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:Play dress up and have fun! Honestly it may seem simple, but just trying it on, and especially taking pictures of outfits and saving them for later. I’ve got a whole album of outfit photos (thanks biweekly outfit threads lol) and it helped me narrow down things I liked and didn’t like, and where I wanted to go with my style.  Also, lots of looking at outfits in Pinterest and Instagram.   Another thing you could try are 30x30 or 10x10 challenges, and find new ways to wear the clothes that you have.	episode_done:True
text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:Like many others have said, just try stuff on!  It can be a bit exhausting but you can pick one one item that you would like to focus on (a top that you recent bought or pants that you never got the chance to wear) and start trying on different pieces until you get an outfit that you like with that piece!  I find that this way makes the process less overwhelming and is an easy way to incorporate new pieces into your cycle.   You can also try and replicate an outfit that you see on Instagram or even google an “aesthetic” that you’re interested in with what you have in your closet!	episode_done:True
text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:I definitely second everyone saying to try things on and see what you like. I do that myself all the time. Even if I think something might go together, it's helpful to try things on because it's not uncommon that it worked a bit better in my head than it does in real life, and it can just enough that I don't actually really love it in person. And even with an eye for fashion (or at least an eye for what I like and want personally), I still discover pairings that I didn't think of when I go through and try on a new piece with e v e r y t h i n g I own.  I'll totally admit it's a lot of work though, and if you're doing your whole wardrobe it can easily take a full day, which is a *lot*. So one thing I like to do that makes it a lot more fun, is I'll go through and try everything one with another person, and kind of turn it into a fashion show. It can be with friends and we'll both go through our stuff and take turns posing and having fun with particularly great matches, or it can just be with my mom and super casual, but it turns it from work to get through to an activity to enjoy with someone. Sometimes that's enough to let me power through a lot (I've done a few wardrobe purges as I matured out of different stages and needed to reevaluate what I wanted), and sometimes I still want or need to break it up into multiple sessions over a few days, but it makes it a lot more pleasant overall.	episode_done:True
text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:I went through this too, and while going through it, did an entire wardrobe overhaul. Instead of lamenting the weight gain, I chose to have a ton of fun buying new clothes for my bigger pandemic size. I’ve had a great time eating really enjoyable food during quarantine, I don’t care that I’m fat now. Also, I had been ready to re-do my style for a while, and this seemed like the perfect time.   However, now knowing how easy it is to fluctuate in size, I used weight fluctuation as a deciding factor in what I chose to buy: I only purchased items that will fit with a fluctuation anywhere from 5-15lbs (I’m 5’2). Seems crazy, but it actually is possible. I stuck to either loose silhouettes, or tight yet forgiving stretchy styles.   What worked for me in choosing what I invested in was just ensuring I put enough time and effort into the process. I downloaded Pinterest and spent an inordinate amount of time looking at street clothes, I set a budget, thought about what items I needed, and did a ton of online window shopping. Once I had a better idea of what I wanted my new style to be, I did a lot of online shopping. I did return a lot of things, but also kept a lot, too.   Think about items of clothing that you gravitate towards, that make you feel really good. Use that to form the basis of your wardrobe. The process does take time and effort, but doing enough prep before buying will really make the process way easier.	episode_done:False

text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:I'll add my 2 cents as someone that went through a big weight change about 4 years ago and how I've accepted/adjusted to it.  Until about 35, I weighed 110 and my concerns were always about trying to add curves with clothes since I had no butt and a flat chest.    A few lifestyle changes...I quit smoking!  I started working from home (so similar to what people are experiencing now) and I went on birth control.  All those factors together lead to a 50lb weight gain in about 6-8 months.    At first I didn't believe what my clothes were telling me.  I thought oh these jeans must have shrunk or those always ran small.  I was still cramming myself into size small or extra small tops because it was all I had ever worn.  Then one day I saw my own reflection in a window and thought "that poor girl needs to just go up a size or two" and then I realized it was me.  I used to love body hugging clothes like close fitting turtlenecks but now they just accentuate the parts of me I don't like.  I've switched to flowy tops and sweaters.  I used to avoid maxi dresses if I couldn't wear a push up bra because they made me look sooo flat chested.  Now I love them and its so nice not worrying about bra straps or a strapless constantly sliding down.    The biggest obstacle for me has been to stop fixating on the size on the label and just get the size that looks and fits the best.  I also was really motivated to lose weight for a little while and still bought the smaller sizes even if I could barely get in to them.  I lost a little of what I gained but I think my body is just happier at the heavier weight.  I think I look better too but it was hard giving up the "I'm the skinny girl" identity I had for so long.	episode_done:True
text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:Hmm, not sure I have a lot to contribute but I have had to change my style quite a bit on a few occasions in my life in the last 5ish years, and it's left my closet in shambles. First was when I moved from a trendy college town to a trailer on a ranch (lol, I f***ing hated it). So all my cute shit went bye bye and I basically only had clothes I could feed pigs and cows in. Then I moved to kind of a trendier metropolitan suburb and got to wear nice things again, then moved to a very casual city and had a baby, so all my cute stuff became ugly casual stuff again. Still trying to sort things out so I can look good and feel good while balancing my new lifestyle, new body, and the local culture.	episode_done:True
text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:Looser fits, and more stretch in fabrics, I like dense fabrics but it needs to have some stretch (I can't do 100% cotton denim). This way my clothing works for a few sizes, though they do have an ideal fit. I'm 5'0, hippy, and have some bad stomach issues that result in extreem discomfort and bloating, and just a strong desire to live in sweatpants sometimes. My diet has been pretty good over the pandemic because I have been trying to identify what foods don't make me feel like shit and 4 sizes bigger, but in the before times when corporate lifestyle ment lots of dinners and drinking, looser silhouettes saved me.	episode_done:True

text:I love the eye for clothing that will fit with a weight fluctuation -- especially since I am now trying to be a bit more conscious of that! Do you have any particular examples of items that have worked well for you?  I think part of my problem is that the silhouettes that used to work for my pear/hourglass body now do not at all with a bigger stomach, and it's slow to figure out what will. The other part of the issue I'm finding is that clothes quality and silhouette fit is a challenge in plus sizes for me, even with brands I trusted before. I'm having issues with things riding up or sliding down over time even when they seemed my proper size.	labels:I’m also an hourglass/pear! In terms of oversized fits, I made sure everything I bought hit me at my smallest spot so that it looked correct for my shape. For example, I bought an oversized cashmere sweater, and it ends mid thigh. I wear it with tight pants (I often follow the baggy top/loose bottom vice versa) and a shoe with a heel to balance it out. The sweater is big enough to fit a huge weight range and still look good. Oversized is in, and I think it looks trendy.   In terms of plus size clothing, I haven’t yet ventured into that because I stuck to brands that offered already oversized clothing. The sweater I mentioned is Ben Taverniti (bought on deep discount) and was already marketed as oversized, so I bought the biggest size and it fits great. It’s an easy way to not have to find new brands or learn how to style yourself with plus sized clothing.	episode_done:True
text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:As I gotten older, my weight has mostly gone to my thighs. So my emo/scene skinny neon jeans didn't really fit. I've also kinda changed how I view myself in general. So I've kept the music but changed the pants. I wear a lot of high waist loose/straight leg pants now. Most of my pants aren't jeans either. I've really gotten into other fabrics.	episode_done:True
text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:So my weight fluctuates quite a bit- I've gained and lost the same 20 pounds since high school. I'm not very tall so it means about a size or two difference in clothing. I basically just keep all my old clothes since I'll probably eventually fit in them down the line.. whether they're too big or too small. This is not an issue with looser clothes, but can be annoying with bottoms. My jeans collection is massive.	episode_done:True
text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:i actually finally got a breast reduction surgery this summer which definitely let me change my style so much i’ve defitnely felt very inspired by recent trends and felt more connected to them than i have in the past but whether that’s cause of my surgery finally let me feel connected or them just being my taste i don’t know  i’ve felt drawn to things that are both comfy and fun patterns or fabrics (stuff like corduroy and satin) things that are both cute and comfortable at the same time as well  i also have developed an insanely large tank top collection but i think that’s just me feeling comfortable in a tank top for the first time in years  i’ve found myself researching things more as well  like i see a piece i really want but i spend time thinking about it how much i would wear it etc and then rather than take the first cheapest option i’ve been trying to invest in quality pieces that i can keep for longer i’m trying to get more comfortable with form fitting stuff that’s still comfy like turtlenecks! before it was uncomfortable as hell because form fitting just made my chest stick out more which was the opposite of what i wanted now i’m kind of scared that since my chest won’t be taking immediate attention the rest of my body will be the focus and i’ve definitely gained my own share of quarantine weight	episode_done:True
text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:I’m in your boat and have been for several years now. I was usually between 140-160lbs and a solid hourglass until I was around 23-24 thanks to a combo of PCOS, hormonal birth control, and wedding planning-induced stress eating. These days I float between 220-230lbs and most of my weight hangs out in my belly so I look pregnant lol. In my thinner days I liked form-fitting pin-up style clothing. These days I tend to go for loose, flowy blouses,flannels, and sweaters.   For pants I discovered the joy of stretchy paper bag style pants over the summer and in the fall/winter I do anything black and high-waisted. I still refuse to give up skinny jeans though as I detest anything flared. I swapped H&M out for Torrid and I still get most of my clothes at Target as they usually have decent options for work clothes. I’ve recently discovered that Old Navy makes the best fitting, AFFORDABLE jeans for me.	episode_done:True
text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:Mainstream fashion is so much more inclusive these days when it comes to plus and mid size women I don't think gaining weight really makes a difference in the majority of cases.  Women who carry some extra weight are no longer designated to day floral vomit and glo tunics, empire waists, shark hems, polyester and doleman sleeves.  They can wear crop tops, high waisted pants, athleisure, alternative fashion ect.  Even high fashion is coming around somewhat.   This is especially true in the USA where 70% of people carry extra weight.    I think the way you feel about your body is important when choosing clothes.  Many women think they look worse in fashionable and attractive clothes than they actually do.  When women feel insecure they often hide behind their clothes instead of using their clothes to express themselves.	episode_done:True

In middle school, the nike AF1s high tops were really popular and also the K Swiss sneakers and the Phat farm ones (throwback). But they resembled the classic adidas stan smith/superstars. In high school, I remember wearing really chunky "skater" sneakers and slip-ons. I remember wearing DCs. In college it was the chucks. Then after I graduated it was those suede vans, and the slip on vans as well as the keds. Now I see a lot of stan smiths, superstars, AF1s, chucks, common projects and those adidas NMD / yeezy. I have yet to encounter more than a hand full of people wearing those big chunky sneakers at all. Only a few who were tourists.  TBH it just feels like everyone just wears whatever the popular sneaker of X company is, and since all of the above are still around, and because social media bubble aesthetics influence groups of people to choose whatever shoe suits them from whatever popular company, the outcome is that all of those sneakers are still very much alive and kicking....	episode_done:True

text:Thank you! Textures is one of the things I struggled with for the longest time, I think the thing that helped me the most was jut going for the dumb statement pieces (velvet blazer, the skirt that has a ton of different textures in itself, lace) rather than buying the same mostly cotton/jersey basics.  Cozy fits are my favourites :)  I have a bunch of cool rings, so when I’m in the mood I’ll just put all of them on. But I don’t really see them as part of the outfit since I’m not picking them specifically based on what I’m wearing, if that makes sense? I wish I was more of a jewellery person, but the stuff I like is a bit expensive and I’d rather spend that money on clothes, and I’m also so lazy in putting it on.

text:Covid Dilemna - Finding my style	labels:I have been using Le Tote for three years now as a way to try out new styles. It’s a rental box service, but it has “normal” clothes - things I would wear to the office or to dinner with the hubs. Even during quarantine I’ve continued because it gives me new things to look forward to wearing without the need to shop outside my home. And I’ve found brands I really like that I wouldn’t have discovered in my normal routine of Target and JCPenney runs.   I discovered I actually can wear column dresses with my super curvy silhouette as a result. And I’ve tried cropped pants, cold shoulder tops, paper bag waists (they are awful on me), and all sorts of trends I would never have purchased without wearing for a day to make sure it worked for me.  I average 2-3 boxes a month with 5 clothing items, so that would be a slower but safe way to try lots of things.

text:Covid Dilemna - Finding my style	labels:I got to do some of this in store, and honestly that was a lot easier. But when the stores closed, I ordered stuff online and tried it on at home. I ordered from Zalando, which has a ton of different brands and free returns. Trying clothes at home was pretty nice, because I could take it in for as long as I wanted, get back to some stuff on a different day and pair the new clothes with my own to see if it made a good outfit.   When you're just starting out though, it's important to actually try out a lot of different things. Don't focus on clothes you might want to buy, just get some plain things with different necklines, fits and materials to see what looks good and what doesn't.  Once you have narrowed that down, you can look for more interesting stuff that actually fits your style. So if you do this by ordering online, make sure returns are easy.   If ordering online is not an option, maybe you can borrow some clothes somewhere? Shirts, dresses and skirts also can be pinned to change their shape. And if you have old clothes you don't wear anymore you could cut them into a different fit. Things like cutting a crew neck shirt into a V-neck or a maxi dress into a midi or mini, or shortening sleeves. If you're handy with photoshop or something, you could even try that.	episode_done:False

text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:Honestly, I think if an item brings you joy, fits your budget, and you’re sure you’ve got things to wear it with then it’s ‘worth’ whatever the price is.   I try to spend more on things I’m sure I’ll wear over and over. Like my fake leather jacket I’ve worn every cool day for eight years finally started cracking on me so I decided to throw down the money on a good real leather replacement that will last me a long time. Same thing if I wear through a favorite pair of jeans or have a specific style of top I know I love wearing. Those things are worth the extra cash.   But for a trendy thing I just want to experiment with? I see no harm in tossing out $20 on it, seeing just how often I wear it and then buying a higher quality version later if it starts to wear out. I try to limit these purchases so I’m not wasting money on a closet full of trendy stuff I never end up wearing but I still spend $20-$30 on a new “it” item to feel like my wardrobe is getting refreshed each season.   Tl;dr life is short, value is subjective. If that cheap forever 21 cardigan is calling your name then get it even if you know it’s not gonna last forever. So long as you actually wear it and enjoy it then it’s not money wasted.	episode_done:False

text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:I agree with the comments that suggested thinking about how often you’ll wear it, more so than the price. I used to prioritize price, but ended up with low quality clothes that just didn’t last. Now i find myself passing on some items even if they’re really cheap, just because it seems like it won’t last. I try to pick clothes by their fabric composition and pay attention to the details (stitching, closures, etc). For jeans I look for as high % cotton as possible. I like linen, rayon, modal and cotton for other pieces. I usually avoid nylon-y and thin, fast-fashion pieces. Then I think about whether that store usually has sales, if so, I wait. I very rarely get anything full price because there’s always some sale!   I’m usually willing to spend more on “core” pieces that I’ll wear all the time, like a coat, jeans, or work pants/shoes. For statement pieces or trendy shirts I usually wouldn’t spend that much. I think it just depends on how many ways you can style that item.  As for a&f and hollister - I have personally found really great quality clothes there. For a&f i love their linen pieces, jeans, pants and sweaters. They also have awesome sales. As an example, in september i got 2 sweaters for like 15 each, jeans for 40, and pants for 20ish from there, all really good quality, and I wear them often. For hollister, it can be hit or miss since it’s more casual, but I have blouses and jackets from there from several years ago still look new, but they weren’t expensive. Sorry for ranting lol!	episode_done:True
text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:I work in fashion and you’re spot on about the acrylic. Very uncomfortable fiber to have as a primary content on a smooth fabric. Fine if it’s in a yarn...I would say knowledge about fiber content is key, which you seem to be aware of.   There are no hard and fast retails as markers for quality in fashion. I have Uniqlo jeans for $20 that have held up pretty well. I’d say you’re spot on again when you ask about brands in this respect. Some brands offer customers a great value AND value their customers.   I agree with the comments here that say if it sparks joy and you wear it, then it’s worth the money, on both the low end and the high end.   However, shopping online can be extremely deceptive sometimes. In my experience Free People is one is the biggest offenders in this. Their stuff just looks horribly cheap once it’s in your hand.   So something that sparks joy in on a model in a photo might not once you get it home. I’d just say shop with your heart and be prepared to make returns.   Personally, I shop vintage a lot and I am pretty selective about the brands I buy new from.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:My policy is that I refuse to buy anything that I’m not absolutely sure that I’ll love. I see a lot of people fast fashion shame by saying that “people never wear those things more than once or twice” but while I try to avoid fast fashion now for ethical reasons, there are definitely things I’ve purchased from shein, H&M, etc. that I wear all the time.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:Cost per wear!!   T = How many times a year will I wear this item S= How much? W = worth  S/T=W  EX. Leather boots are $120 (S) Will probably wear them 3x a week for 6 months so that’s 78 round up to 80 times. (T)  120/80= $1.50 per wear  EX.2 Cute summer dress: $200 Will wear once a week for 6 weeks it’s warm where I am. If I find that many excuses to wear it. So about 6 times this year.   200/6= $33 per wear  After a while, you’ll start seeing prices based on cost per wear. It’s helpful to start yearly, but after a while you’ll be able to gage how long the item will last, then you can really do cost per wear.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:A fair amount of what makes a garment last/wear well is how you take care of it.   Extremely cheap fast fashion like YesStyle is going to wash/wear poorly, so you need to be very gentle with washing those kinds of garments. Hand washing, coldwater washing on low speeds, and air-drying will make those kinds of garments last longer. I have 10-year-old Forever 21 dresses because of how I wash them.  For American-made brands, I like LA Apparel and Bug Bud Press. However, keep in mind that these brands are expensive for a reason, and they have fewer styles and sizes for a reason. To try and understand clothing price and quality, try and think about how can this YesStyle dress possibly cost $11? How long does it take to make a dress, what would I like to be paid for making a dress, how much does fabric cost per yard, how can this brand afford to make this many styles, colors, and sizes? You'll realize that the only way for a garment to cost that little is because corners are being cut SOMEWHERE.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:I used to work for a wholesale company and know how much some items are marked up buy our clients and that has ruined shopping for me.

text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:Other than figuring out the cost per use I tend to make a list of items I actually need/want and then try to only buy things from that list regardless of the sale.

text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:A little different but I own several saris and a couple of lehengas, some of which were my mum's and some from my grandma on my dad's side.  With my mum's, I like to style them as she wore them which is pretty traditional and really lean into the 80s style with fluffy hair and major winged eyeliner but I normally add a statement piece of jewellery to make it mine.  My grandma's I tend to mix up with different styles of blouses, different scarves and wear as more of a mishmash to fit in with the trends at the moment. One of the saris she gave, I've had made into a lehenga with two different blouses and the skirt into a ruffled, almost flamenco kind of skirt because the material really suits that kind of thing.	episode_done:False

text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:My grandmother was incredibly stylish and had amazing taste in clothing. When she passed I was able to go into her closet and take what I wanted before her kids donated everything to Goodwill, so I have all these gorgeous coats and blouses of hers...that I have no idea what to do with. I need to alter pretty much everything if I’m going to wear it but I am terrified of ruining anything of hers...so currently it’s all just hanging in my closet making me miss her whenever I see it, which is probably the worst of both worlds. If anyone else has been in a similar situation I would love advice on how to seek out vintage alterations or how to find a really good alterations place.	episode_done:True
text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:My heirlooms came from my grandmother, who was 5'2" in heels. I am built the same way, but have more inches than she did... so alas, that gorgeous Burberry trench coat simply cannot be made to fit.   However, Gram was a collector of cashmere and one of those people who believed that if you like a thing, you should have one in every color, and two in the colors you like best, against it wearing out. I have a handful of her sweaters, some of which are from the early 70's. These sweaters were everyday wear for her, and it does show, but they are SO soft and SO luscious that I wear them around the house on a regular basis. My cats don't care that they're two inches too short and have holes at the hem.   I did inherit some of her jewelry, including her engagement ring, which was put in a setting that my grandfather designed. Sadly, resizing the setting to fit me would have destroyed it, so I have that put away until I find a jeweler I trust to make it into a necklace with a new stone. I have an AMAZING opal bracelet of hers, also my grandfather's design, a silver wire cuff with the opals set in as the body of a spider. Gram never told my grandfather that the thought of a spider on her wrist freaked her out- she rarely wore it. I never met my grandfather to tell him how cool I think that piece is. Looks amazing peeking out from under the lace sleeves of my favorite LBD.	episode_done:False
text:Same on the cashmere in multiple colors! My great aunt didn’t have kids, so I got some of her clothes, including 3 cashmere sweaters from Jacobson’s (probably late 60s) in red, black, and grey. They’re a cropped boxy shape with a mock neck, and I love them.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I’ve also inherited cashmere sweaters in all different colours. My grandma loved turtlenecks though so that’s the only format. On the plus side they don’t have any holes and they fit me just fine.  When I was younger and she gave them to me she would go on about how great the quality was in those sweaters. I, knowing nothing about quality clothing being a teenager, just nodded along and shrugged. Now when I’m older and seen the prizes for new quality cashmere, I feel a lot more appreciative. I’ve made it a point to thrift non-turtleneck cashmere sweaters though.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:many moons ago my mother took a trip to the British Isles and came back with two of the densest wool sweaters you'll ever see in your life. i'm talking chunky, itchy, but so incredibly cozy. i have one and she has one, and she doesn't even really wear hers, but i loooove mine on a cold day. makes me eager to go traveling (lol thx covid) whenever i wear it!	episode_done:True
text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:I have a pair of beautiful caramel taper-toe Dex riding boots that my mom bought in 1970 with her first paycheck. She gave them to me when I was in high school in 2007 and I wore the soles out from wearing them so much. I paid $30 to have them re-soled with leather in 2012 and my mom was so shocked because that's how much she paid for them in the first place.  But these boots are so special to me and not a single thing could ever persuade me to get rid of them.	episode_done:True
text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:I have a few of my moms high school sweaters/cardigans from the 70s (including the one that was part of her cheerleading uniform)!

text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:One of my great aunts gave me a great silver and turquoise matching ring and bracelet set she got out West probably in the 50’s and likely as a souvenir even though it’s nice quality silver and real turquoise. I also have a small beaded purse from her, it looks quite older, maybe 1930’s. I only use it for special occasions and otherwise it just sits on my dresser looking pretty. The same great aunt was the oldest of my grandmothers siblings and gave them fancy dresses from a lady she worked for to play dress up in. Later my mom played dress up in them and so did I. I wish we had realized how nice they were because they’re in rough shape now even though I’ve saved them. They’re probably 1920’s, one is silk and could possibly be repaired enough to look nice displayed.   My mom did her own sewing and saved a lot of her favorite clothes. I still wear some of her 70’s maxi dresses but she wore her dresses too short in the late 60’s for me to wear most of them as an adult. There’s one wool jumper dress I wear over leggings.   When I was in high school I wore her 1980’s Calvin Klein jeans, the ones with the white labels instead of the modern leather patch.   My aunt gave me some of my grandmothers costume jewelry and it started my love affair with tacky mid century jewelry.	episode_done:True
text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:I wear and use my heirloom pieces inherited from my grandmother very often .  Have not altered any of them , since some of them are quite old and it would ruin the historical value .  My most interesting pieces are : A solid gold cameo set with of earrings, necklace , brooch and a ring that originaly was my great-great grandmothers , and a ruby pendant in silver from the same era (1880s 1910s) And a brooch from the napoleonic era wich is quite interresting.   My style of dress is a mix of bohemian with a good deal of influence of Edwardian (1910-17ish) sensibilites, so the jewlery work really well with that. Also have a gorgoues 50’s swing dresse that was my grandmothers, wich i have worn on ocassion. Edit to say that my grandmother was my same exact size when she was younger , so thats really fun, the clothes i have after her fits me PERFECTLY wich is great luck!  A bit controversial but i also inherited my grandmothers furs, they are still in excellent condition and i wear them almost daily in the winter months. But despite the ethical ramifications i am a firm beliver in sustainability , its better to wear and repair existing clothes then buying new .   I love the feeling of continunity i feel from wearing these treasures, that am a part of a long line of women who have worn these pieces, loved and cared for them.	episode_done:True
text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:Personally I try to avoid faux if possible. Real leather lasts longer, faux leather is just plastic and I find it cracks and/or scuffs usually within a couple years.

They simply do not hold up like leather.  I have vintage Dooney&Bourke leather bags that are 25+ years old. I keep them polished, clean and in dust bags when not in use and they look new.

They usually last about 6 years or more of daily wear before they are worn enough to replace, or another workhorse bag catches my eye.

One way to pay less for good quality are thrift stores un upscale areas.  My last bag cost $30 and was retail $600 Italian leather.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:If not going to use real leather, then great quality fabric is a better, more stylish option, than pleather/ fake /faux leather in my view. Oiled canvas, linens, weaves, neoprene, canvas, polyesters etc, look great, and are often combined with leather or other kind of handle or strap details. Longchamp set the standard for these kind of bags.	episode_done:False

text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:I find real leather looks much better in person compared to faux leather and will age much better year over year. A faux leather purse can look nice when you first get it but it will quickly be obvious it's of cheap quality and that can make an outfit look blah whereas a good quality leather bag can elevate an outfit and make you feel chic and hold up year after year with proper care! I find a real leather bag is more sustainable as well since you wouldn't need to repurchase it again soon compared to the faux leather which would not hold up as well over time and thus you would need to repurchase over and over.	episode_done:True

No matter where you get faux leather from, it’s just plastic at the end of the day. Luxury faux leather is just plastic with a designer label on it.	episode_done:False

text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:For me, (retired, age 75) real leather bags are not an investment I would make now. In the past I was able to find excellent vintage Coach bags at consignment shops at a great price. One of these is still in rotation. My current favorite bag is “pleather” cost $15.00 new, and has good zippered pockets. It actually looks decent and definitely classier than the price would suggest. The chief advantage of this bag is that it’s durable and waterproof when set down in rain or snow. One drawback of both real leather and faux leather bags is they’re heavy.  A wonderful alternative to both real and vegan leather is nylon, such as Baggalini or Haiku brands.  Light weight, practical sizing, fun colors and quality construction. Just not waterproof enough for winter wear where I live! Fun question 👍🏽	episode_done:True

Mostly I live in shorts and skirts, but there is also something comfy to me about wearing something longer and which kinda hugs your body. But when you're celebrating a holiday that revolves around eating a huge meal, it's pretty much the worst thing. Everyone in pants just sitting around being uncomfortable after the meal until they leave Grandpa's house and finally get to undo their fly. Lol. A loose dress does sound a lot more pleasant.  While I transitioned years ago, I usually see conservative family on the holidays, so I still try to dress up en masc, and it's a little ridiculous. Will be nice to have a smaller gathering with just close fam this year (siblings and my mom only, all of whom live together).	episode_done:True

The Luxe Strategist: Very thoughtful posts on finances, shopping and general lie stuff.  I’ll also add ExtraPetite / Jean Wang, though ever since she started blogging full time, her outfits aren’t nearly as consistently relevant for workplaces.  Also, pantsfessional is great - her posts got me interested in learning sewing, which has been a saving grace these past 8 months.  I’ve noticed with some of these, it’s less so ‘daily OOTD’ content and more often than not, a weekly/monthly cadence of varied content. Which might not fit the ‘influencer’ definition, but I still enjoy reading / consuming it!	episode_done:False

This can make the same item of clothing look so different on two people.	episode_done:True

Their goal is simply to project an image, not to express themselves.

So many blogs are exactly the same, it's like they're all just copying each other. So many posts are just ads. I don't mean they *have* ads, I mean the entire post is just an ad for something.  I can only assume they've witnessed other influencers' success and are trying to replicate that for themselves. They don't understand most OG influencers worked for years to add value and build a following before they ever saw a cent. They're trying to skip to the end by following proven formulas and packing their content with as many ads as possible. That's my theory, anyways.	episode_done:True

text:Check out french fashion instagrammers, if you are looking for chic classy fashion and more mature style. My own style is very verstile, from grunge to street to preppy to vintage to classy chic. I am 30. Everything works for me, and I get insparation everywhere, though I do control the amount of skin being shown in my own style, comparing to these younger "influencers". Also I eliminate fast fashion from my menu. And most of inspo these days come from japanese magazines like Fudge or from Pinterest, not instagram. French chic fashion is the only type which worth checking out on insta. Oh also some girls with very cool 70s like inspo style are pretty cool, but it's not something I d wear. The only minus is that they are all way too skinny, as someone in a normal body weight, I find these influencers , not depending on their style, almost unrelatable.	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True
text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I too am bored to death of the French classic look, the Tik Tok youth trends, the Everlane normcore.   Someone recently recommended Amy Smilovic of TIbi here and I’ve gone in deep, haven’t felt this inspired in a long time.   On her + Tibi’s Instagram she espouses what she calls the “Creative pragmatic” look and articulates nicely many things, like what makes clothing “stuff or style”, does a lot of bolder silhouettes that somehow still work for everyday and uses styling to bring out personality.   Frankly, I haven’t seen anyone be so clear on why sometimes you buy an item you love that feels stylish but as soon as you use it in your daily life it just feels off or not as impactful.   It’s also been helpful for me to see for once how pieces are worn on actual people and not just models. For the first time it’s like I can see where these higher end looks could translate into real life.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I think it depends on who you follow on social media and where you go for inspiration. There are so many communities and designers that are doing crazy cool stuff that's very indie and original. Check out vfiles, designers like Didu and Area.  If you feel disconnected, try reframing your perspective and look for people, communities, and designers that draw you in and connect you.  I feel that with the barriers to entering the fashion world being lower than ever before, I continue to be inspired and amused :)  For example, I came across a designer who constructed fashionable corsets from Nike shoes. How innovative and sustainable!	episode_done:True
text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I've never been interested in anything home related (to the point where I will likely never own a home, by choice) as I spent every weekend of my childhood on some home project.  Enough is enough!  While I'm now WFH (so what I wear does not matter) I've noticed that fashion as of late is simply butt ugly.  The oversized boxy neutral aesthetic is just blah to me.  THe last time I really liked some of the trends was around 2014-16 when things like skater dresses/skirts (you know things that actually had a shape to them that was not a paper bag).    Now the trends remind me of that scene in The Little Mermaid when Ariel first becomes a human and they dress her up in an old beige sail and make it fashion.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I live in France and there is definitely a big push on instagram via influencers for 'nouvelle vague' 60s-70 styles to be promoted as 'french/parisienne girl style' even though that is not actually what most French women wear,  but it is a style category that exists here. I like certain elements of this style but there are intellectual experts in recent years that have shown that the marketing push of this image nationally and internationally had lead to a lot of erasure of the diversity of French population. Luckily more and more media outlets are trying to show the diversity of French style. I love 'Dress Like A Parisian' blog that really instills how stylish french women create their style no matter what kind style 'identity' they gravitate to.  As for sources on instagram/pinterest etc. I have several: In terms of RTW,  I'm not the biggest fan of Hedi Slimane but his Celine collections since 2019 are very wearable and what I could see certain French demographics wearing. And I mine older Isabel Marant (pre 2015-2016) for inspiration to satisfy my bohemian itch. Other RTW I like is Dries Van Noten, Chloé, Old Céline, Virginie Viard's Chanel. On instagram, I follow certain hashtags of certain brands (typically high mid-end/independent designers many of them French)  to see how smaller influencers style certain brands.  Concept stores/Large mulit-brand boutiques also do a great job on insta with styling which helps me hone in my style. I still use Pinterest but it's easy to keep seeing the same pins to repin and it ruins the search for inspiration so I like mine instagram more and more often.	episode_done:True

I wanted to see which are not really used,  which I must change a bit (maybe dye it a different colour, maybe get it resewn) and what small purchases would really make a huge difference in my wardrobe (a belt, a skin coloures tshirt, a scarf in a certain colour etc) It made me realize I have more than enought cool outfits to last me a whole season, eventhough my wardrobe is not big at all.	episode_done:True

text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:Figure out what style the clothes you don't wear are, separate them into season based styles then figure out what the opposite would be.

text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:I feel this! I’ve been frustrated with browsing slow fashion/ethical niche brands lately, because while not fast fashion, they seem incredibly expensive and visually underwhelming for the most part. Shapeless and baggy just doesn’t look effortless on my body, and I’m far too grown to be going about half naked.   My solution has been looking to eras before fast fashion for inspiration, and learning about historical/couture techniques to sew myself the pieces I’m envisioning if I can’t thrift them (you could always get a tailor to make you something to fit too). Sketching has helped me a lot to think through shapes, colors, and how they look on my frame. It could change your perspective, instead of seeing clothes on other people and imagining yourself in them, start with a picture of yourself and imagine clothes that would make you comfortable and confident.	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:In my experience, style is more about HOW you wear your clothes than it is about the clothes themselves. My advice is to start with items you can wear every day like accessories, footwear, outerwear, hair/cosmetics that fit your style so you can mix those with your current wardrobe instead of having to buy a ton of new stuff all at once again.	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:I suggest you to watch movies or tv shows. If you find a style you like, no matter the time period, you can get your own style from that.  Two of my favourite style icons are Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, the classic style is just perfect. Find inspiration in movies, it's way better than social media.	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:I think it can be useful for someone like you to look back at your favorite trends you've jumped on the bandwagon for. If you were really into cutouts and cold shoulders, maybe your style will end up playing with silhouette and shape a lot. If you loved mom jeans, think something vintage-inspired. Look at your closet and mark out everything from the past year. What do you still like?	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:There's a lot of good advice about finding inspiration here but what really helped me is in some ways the opposite: allowing myself to be really picky.

text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:For me it came with age. In my teens and early 20s I wore the same sorts of things my friends did. By my mid 20s, a lot of my style was influenced by bloggers (just before the social media influencer era, when fashion blogs were at their peak).   But I eventually got used to spotting what looked good on me, what didn’t, what I actually liked the most and what suited my lifestyle.   I’m 30 in a few weeks and I don’t follow current trends. I wear the things that work for me.	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:I came to that realization a few years ago too, I used to be really into Zara and H&M and all that bs. Basically I've found a few specific brands and stores I really like, (Reformation, Realisation Par, Anthro, and Rokit Vintage to name a few) that I follow, focusing on sustainable/vintage/consignment shops. I get a lot of ideas from social media, my friends (I'm lucky cause they're mostly art students so they're always looking cool), movies (old and new),  and also just people watching. Like if I'm on the subway and I see someone wearing a great coat, I think about what I like about the coat (fit, color, silhouette, etc.) then I might go thrifting and try to find a similar piece, or a piece that has an element of whatever I liked about the inspiration piece. I did a wardrobe overhaul recently and I started with basics I loved and just built my way from there. It's hard to avoid trends entirely, but if you focus on what you really are attracted to you're bound to find your style. There's a lot out there, just keep looking for it!	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:i found my style basically by getting pinterest.  when you get pinterest, there are either two ways you can find outfit inspiration that you like. the first way (which someone already mentioned) is looking up movies, tv shows, singers etc. that have a style that you genuinely like and then create a board for fashion. the other way is to just search for different styles (i can give you a whole list of styles to search up if you want). after that, your pinterest will start recommending you more things to you.  some examples of things i would personally look up are "beabadoobee outfits", "euphoria outfits", "the craft style"  finding brands is probably the hardest part for me be size the style that i like isn't as common, but if your style is a bit more out there, you should find small businessesm i especially like instagram for that. i actually found some that i like from some photographers that i follow. as well as that, i also knew some from influencers, including heaven by marc jacobs and unif.  edit: also second hand apps are very good for clothes. depop is where i get most of my second hand stuff but ebay can occasionally have very good things for pretty cheap!! once i found authentic prada jeans on there for $45, gucci pants for $15 and more.	episode_done:True
text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:When I watched The Devil Wears Prada, I thought Miranda Priestly explained it pretty well for a plebeian like me:  "'This... stuff'? Oh. Okay. I see. You think this has nothing to do with you. You go to your closet and you select... I don't know... that lumpy blue sweater, for instance because you're trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back. But what you don't know is that that sweater is not just blue, it's not turquoise. It's not lapis. It's actually cerulean. And you're also blithely unaware of the fact that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns. And then I think it was Yves Saint Laurent... wasn't it who showed cerulean military jackets? I think we need a jacket here. And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers. And then it, uh, filtered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin. However, that blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs and it's sort of comical how you think that you've made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you're wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room from a pile of stuff."	episode_done:False

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:Fashion is to style as reading is to wisdom.  If you only read the rainbow press you're not gaining wisdom.  Likewise if all your contact with fashion is the fast fashion catalogs you're not gaining style.  Still reading comes at different levels if you give a book by let's say Boudrillard to somebody who never read you're not doing them a favor.  Same with haute coture.  People need to already have a fashion framework to understand it.  Also if you read something and just vomit it out again verbatim at the next opportunity you definitely don't demonstrate any wisdom.  Same way if you copy a model's clothes you're not getting her style.  The way reading furthers wisdom is because you would try to integrate ideas of what you have read into your existing cognitive framework, and the effort you spend on your framework improves it.  Same with fashion, you integrate inspirations from what you see on the runway into your existing stylistish framework and the effort you spend on it improves it.	episode_done:True

Theatre that makes you think about the world differently might not be the ocr you put on for a roadtrip.

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:I always think this question is framed oddly (and I know you’re not the one framing it), because I have never seen a runway show that didn’t have at least one piece I would wear in my everyday life, just not with all the other pieces and the makeup and the hairstyle and the jewelry and the shoes. (With the exception of bridal and evening wear collections, of course.)	episode_done:False
text:I totally agree, even if it’s a gown that I would have to save for a formal wedding or something. But that’s bare minimum, there are usually plenty of things that I could wear in my every day life.

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:I think you're thinking either avant garde or couture runways? These are different from regular season fashion shows. Mainstream labels like Gucci, Versace, Tom Ford, etc show very wearable pieces in their regular fashion shows IMO.  Now designers like Iris Van Herpen and Guo Pei do very couture almost avant garde fashion that is not meant for daily wear. These fashions are more for their high end clients who want to be inspired and who may place orders for their pieces as a COLLECTORS piece.	episode_done:False

It's annoying, because splashing a big number like that ("30-50% off the whole site! \*exclusions apply") draws me to their site, but the items I actually want aren't a part of the sale.  The only exception being Levi's because I've been waiting for this 40% off sale to get a pair of Wedgie jeans.   Not going to lie, I did buy quite a few bits from the sales this year but with the intention of returning 90% of it because I don't feel comfortable going into stores to try stuff on. Best to buy everything I want to try on at sale prices then return what I don't want to keep!	episode_done:False
text:This has always been something I hated! I also think that Black Friday sales are overblown and actually not that good (for clothes).

I can reliably count on shops like Madewell, Levi's, Abercrombie & Fitch, etc. to have sales at the end of the season. The only problem is whether or not they'll have my size when the sale happens or if they're sold out of everything except XS and XL...	episode_done:True

Dresses skirts, shirts, sweaters everything... And I almost cried. They were all so beautiful and colorful. Everything fucking fit. I was just blown away. The construction was perfect, the silk was the softest ever... And I nicely put it all back on the hangers and hung everything back up where I found it... It was like my own personal runway in the dressing room. When I left however.. I was definitely upset.

text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:I don't even have stores like that anywhere close to where I live - but I DO try on stuff from thrift stores that would be out of my price range new, and that's how I learned about higher quality garments.  For me it's more about the materials and construction than brand.  For instance, I learned the value of real wool, silk, etc. from gaining experience with them through thrifting.  Same thing with really good structure, weight, stitching.  Sometimes it's a brand I would never be able to afford new, like JCrew or Loft, and sometimes it's just a vintage piece from the 1960s when clothes were more likely to be made of natural fibers and be really solidly constructed.  My favorite thing I learned about was what cashmere feels like to wear!  I can now just go into a thrift store and run my hands down the rack until I my hand feels merino wool, cashmere, real silk.  I've also gotten better at identifying them by sight.  I'm also more likely to shell out for one nice new item in a natural fiber from a brand with a reputation for durable, long-lasting clothes than to buy a whole wardrobe of "fast fashion" stuff.  I'd rather wear the same two merino sweaters in just two colors I love all winter (in a classic cut I can wear for years) than 20 "fashionable" cheapy synthetic sweaters that are "in style" for this year.  I still stay away from purely luxury-type brands, though, as they are both out of my price range, and because I think I can find stuff that's functionally almost as good without the markup for being brand name.  I've also finally recognized that it is worth it to take care of natural fibers properly and doesn't even take much time (especially considering I need less clothes overall because these wear more often better).  Thrifting is my friend!	episode_done:True

text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:I've always had a penchant for oversized, long coats-- even before they were a trendier piece. Several years ago, I was walking down Michigan Ave in Chicago with a decent amount of money burning a hole in my pocket. Naturally, I tried on a $5,000 Bottega Venetta coat that SCREAMED my name from the rack.   The fabric, weight, feel, and look were so so so much nicer than any other coat I had ever warn. Before I even saw the price tag ( I thought it must cost no more than $1k bc I'm an inexperienced dummy), I felt so luxurious and confident in it.   I'm still trying to capture how good I felt in the jacket in my day to day life. Truly life changing.	episode_done:True

Your face gives it away. :)  Now is a good time to experiment with fashion and figure out what you want. It is ok to make mistakes, and change your mind. Your style and body could change as you get older so no need to focus on “timeless classics.” You have plenty of time for that.   The current trends for people your age feel so much like what it was when I was your age. There are always people who skip the street wear part! You don’t have to do if you don’t like it. Keep playing with the things you are drawn to.	episode_done:True
text:How to build an age-suitable varied chic wardrobe?	labels:Dress how you want and disregard other people's opinions. If you're uncomfortable sticking out from the crowd then I would recommend shopping at popular stores within your age group and age market, and buy pieces that suit you but are also in line with the general style. You can also dress basic/minimalist and stand out with your accessories.	episode_done:True
text:How to build an age-suitable varied chic wardrobe?	labels:I am a lot older (in my 30s) but in grad school and a lot of grad students also dress in athleisure. I also want to not draw too much attention so here are some of the things I do to dress down: 1. White trainers (Veja) with an otherwise dressy outfit, instead of black leather shoes 2. Pairing formal button-down with ripped or faded denim (more casual) 3. Wear loose outerwear (flowy) rather than a tailored coat or jacket 4. Add some pattern even if it’s basic like stripes, dots, plaid  5. Wear slightly cropped length pants, slightly cropped tops and sweaters with high waisted pants  6. Drop sleeves make everything look casual  7. French tuck / half tuck is more casual than a fully tucked in top  8. I’ve been wearing a lot less makeup since I’ve gone back to school - concealer, blush and mascara is a more youthful combo than eyeshadow, eyeliner, lipstick	episode_done:True
text:How to build an age-suitable varied chic wardrobe?	labels:>French chic and preppy school girl  Have you ever heard of the brand Claudie Pierot? It's suitable for your age, but it's really perfect for this. It's probably too pricey, but maybe you can copy that style elsewere. Also, I am East Asian - women tend to look very young and our fashion is geared a lot towards looking youthful as well. Maybe you can get some inspiration with how we style stuff too.  Anyways, I remember how hard it was as a teen to hear "dress however you want and don't worry about it" from people and have it mean anything (hell, that's the case for me even now in my mid-thirties). So I'll just say this - people will definitely notice if you dress differently than them, but they are less likely to think you're trying "too hard" if you don't act differently (better or different than them, seeking validation, etc. etc.) because of how you dress or if you avoid drawing attention to your clothes specifically (like name dropping brands or styles or being not willing to go certain places or do certain things because you're not dressed appropriately).	episode_done:True
text:What age do you think you're too old to follow teenage-type style trends (ie e-girl style etc)? Or are you ever, why/why not?	labels:23 is definitely not too old!   The age at which you age out of a trend is only when you stop feeling confident wearing it.	episode_done:True
text:What age do you think you're too old to follow teenage-type style trends (ie e-girl style etc)? Or are you ever, why/why not?	labels:I can't speak for everyone, but I knew my time had passed when I popped into a "teen style" store and went "EW YUCK They brought THAT back? Why would they bring that back? It was terrible the first time around!" and *realized I sounded like my mother*.	episode_done:False
text:this is sort of like what happened to me too! i turn 30 in a couple weeks (help) and have never identified with the idea of feeling "too old for" any fashion trend until the latest series of 90s trends started hitting stores/social media. some of it it does look cute on today's teenagers but it reminds me too much of my mom's style in the mid-90s for me to feel motivated to wear it myself. had my fill of it the first time!!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:HAHAHA when I first saw belt bags back again, it sent me back immediately to my dad in family vacations in the 90s and it gave me a visceral like "WTF YUCK" reaction. And then I realized I was old and there are many beautiful and vibrant young women out there who have never had the misfortune of seeing the utter-suburban-dad-core-fanny-pack look in its full glory	labels:	episode_done:True

text:haha weirdly i thought that about high-waisted pants when they first came back when i was a teenager. It took me a while get rid of the association with my mom who was a bit older than most and unironically wore mom jeans.   I love Y2K style though, even though i remember wearing bootcut jeans dragging around in the mud when i was a kid. luckily the trend is also towards short pants lol	labels:Yes!! as a petite I can not begin to count the number of times I walked home from school or a friends out with soaking wet pants halfway to the knee. The flared/wide leg look actually really flatters my frame so I love it but glad we have more versatility in styling it in our modern era (and also the wits about me to go to a tailor lol)	episode_done:True
text:What age do you think you're too old to follow teenage-type style trends (ie e-girl style etc)? Or are you ever, why/why not?	labels:23 is so young! I work with several people in their early 20s and they follow all the trends of the moment. If you’re not comfortable with going all out with a trend, perhaps adding pieces into your existing wardrobe/style?	episode_done:True
text:What age do you think you're too old to follow teenage-type style trends (ie e-girl style etc)? Or are you ever, why/why not?	labels:23 is young  And despite being archaic per Reddit's standards, I don't feel like i'm too old to wear any particular style. If I did feel old I would probably tap into my creative side and find a way to incorporate the style to my comfort level.	episode_done:False
text:Agreed. I’m 31 and I LOVE some of the current trends out there. I just style it a bit differently to fit the needs of my job/life and comfort level. I might focus on colour and material over cut, or get the cut in a less overt colour.   There’s only so much longer I can maintain abs. People can pull the crop tops out of my cold, dead, hands.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What age do you think you're too old to follow teenage-type style trends (ie e-girl style etc)? Or are you ever, why/why not?	labels:I'm in my mid-30s and have been seeing instagrammers wear outfits I would have worn or envied in 2004. I am definitely not planning to wear low rise anything again, but I would wear boleros, the mod influenced stuff, shiny and space print fabric, and bootcut jeans with tunics again. I don't want to dress like or be 2004 ModestMalka again, but I feel that I can dress like a woman my age would have dressed at that time instead.  You're 23 though, that's the perfect age for this stuff. I deeply regret trying to grow up too fast in my early 20s, selling or donating my fun clothes and then going out in polo shirts and cardigans for 6 months.	episode_done:True
text:What age do you think you're too old to follow teenage-type style trends (ie e-girl style etc)? Or are you ever, why/why not?	labels:Wear whatever you want at whatever age. It's about what makes you happy not other people.	episode_done:False

text:What age do you think you're too old to follow teenage-type style trends (ie e-girl style etc)? Or are you ever, why/why not?	labels:My rule is I can wear any trend that I did not wear in its previous appearance.   At 23, you’re not old enough to rule out any trends yet.	episode_done:True
text:What age do you think you're too old to follow teenage-type style trends (ie e-girl style etc)? Or are you ever, why/why not?	labels:I’ve been through these looks a couple of times already in their earlier incarnations as punk and scene, so I’m likely to pass on a full-on e-girl array.  But maybe will dig out some schoolgirl skirts and oversized graphic tees and leg warmers  from the basement and see if I can integrate them into my 56-year-old casual tomboy look. 🤔	episode_done:True
